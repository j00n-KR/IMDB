0,TheLittleSongbird,"Mayn't quite be a Christmas classic, but visually stunning, beautifully scored and worthy adaptation-wise",7,12 June 2011,"I love animation and I love Christmas films. Not to mention that I adore Dickens' story. 2009's A Christmas Carol mayn't quite be a classic for the Yuletide season, but it is a worthy film and one of the more loyal adaptations of the story, maintaining not just the details but the spirit as well.CONS: There are few cons actually here. I did feel the film was too long, I personally think 80 minutes is a perfect length for telling the story, this was nearly 100 minutes. In order to do this, while they were musically and visually stunning, there were two scenes that didn't quite work for me and could have been omitted, one being the extinguishing of Ghost of Christmas Past, the other being the carriage chase. As impressive as they are, they don't enhance the storytelling much and feel odd in their placement too. The film does occasionally drag as well, particularly towards the end.PROS: However, there is much to enjoy here. The story has a classic feel in how it is told, and it has the heart and sentiment of the original story. The dialogue is delightful and almost word-from-word from the original story as well. There are three outstanding things though. One is the vocal cast, Gary Oldman is excellent as is Colin Firth, but it is Jim Carrey's show all the way, while his distinctive acting style is here it is also naturally understated. Two is the score, I like Alan Silvestri a lot, and his score here is beautiful and compliments the spirit and meaning of Christmas wonderfully. Most impressive are the visuals, which in the colours, backgrounds, 3D effects and character designs are outstanding.So all in all, while not a movie to treasure perhaps, it is definitely worth watching. 7/10 Bethany Cox",A Christmas Carol
1,SnoopyStyle,"CG getting much better, but familiar story holds no surprises",6,22 December 2013,"Robert Zemeckis retells the familiar Christmas story using the latest CG motion capture technology. It's the path he started with 'Polar Express'. Only this one is lightyears ahead. The faces have more details and more humanity. The dead eyes are gone. It makes it a more pleasurable viewing experience.The story is so well known that there are no surprises in this. The joy comes from the visual inventions, but it doesn't warrant any special recommendations. It has enough beauty to watch once, but I can't see this taking a large place in the holiday TV watching season. This is more like another step in technological advancement.",A Christmas Carol
2,Hitchcoc,On The Low End of the Spectrum!,5,24 May 2012,"It took me a long time to finally see this film. Visually it is quite impressive, but as is often the case, the movie falls far short of the better presentations of this story. Scrooge is portrayed in the usual way, but the treatment of his character is almost sadistic. So much license is taken with his plight that it falls into the realm of every juvenile movie made today. I'm really surprised that Ebenezer didn't have a skateboard. The way he is tossed and attacked in this film, totally distracts us from the central issue. That is a redemption of the soul. Scrooge's character is never one we care about. He is tortured and prodded. The spirits are dull and contrived. There is hardly a former love and a true sense of avarice. Bob Cratchitt and Tiny Tim are incredibly boring. The kid isn't of much interest. Finally, there is no emotion in Scrooge. This is animation which should allow incredible creativity. But the film sells its soul and dwindles away to nothing.",A Christmas Carol
3,claudio_carvalho,God Bless Us Everyone,7,30 March 2010,"In the Victorian era of the United Kingdom, the stingy and cranky Ebenezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) that hates Christmas and people loses his partner Jacob Marley in a Christmas Eve. For seven years, he runs his business exploiting his employee Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldman) and spends a bitter treatment to his nephew and acquaintances. However, in the Christmas Eve, he is visited by the doomed ghost of the chained Marley that tells him that three spirits would visit him that night. The first one, the spirit of past Christmas, recalls his miserable youth; the spirit of the present Christmas shows him the poor situation of Bob's family; and the spirit of future Christmas shows his fate. Scrooge finds that life is good and God bless us everyone, changing his behavior toward Christmas, Bob, his nephew and people in general. This dark adaptation of ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens to the screen is one of those optimistic films that follows the style of Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and it is impossible not loving it. The redemption of the mean Ebenezer Scrooge in a Christmas Eve is one of the most known worldwide novels and this animation produced by Disney Company follows the style of Tim Burton and may not be the best adaptation to the cinema, but it is indeed effective and a good family entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Os Fantasmas de Scrooge"" (""The Ghosts of Scrooge"")",A Christmas Carol
4,jboothmillard,A Christmas Carol,4,24 November 2009,"From director Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump), yet another version of the classic Charles Dickens story, this time using motion capture animation, and available in 3D. Basically, in Victorian London on Christmas Eve, miserly Ebenezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) says ""Humbug"" to dinner with his nephew Fred (Colin Firth), to some charity collectors, and to Christmas itself. That night, Scrooge is visited by the ghost of his dead business partner Jacob Marley (Gary Oldman), who warns him of three spirits that will come and try to help mend his ways. The first, the Ghost of Christmas Past (also Carrey), shows him his childhood, his young working life with Fezziwig (Bob Hoskins), and his love with Belle (Robin Wright Penn), before Scrooge extinguishes him. The second, the Ghost of Christmas Present (Carrey again), shows Scrooge the current world he knows, where everyone despises him, apart from maybe his employee Bob Cratchit (also Oldman), with his sick child Tiny Tim (Ryan Ochoa, and Oldman). The last, the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come, shows what could happen to the world Scrooge knows if he does not change, including some people who hated a man and not attending his funeral, the death of Tiny Tim, and of course his own death. The nightmare ends the next morning, Christmas Day, and Scrooge knows he must change and enjoy Christmas, so he buys Bob a turkey, gives a large sum to charity, attends his nephew's dinner, and raises Bob's salary. Also starring Cary Elwes as various supporting characters, including Dick Wilkins and a Mad Fiddler. Carrey is vocally talented, but isn't as funny as he could have been, and the animation is improved compared to The Polar Express, particularly facial expressions. But even in relatively impressive 3D, with so many loud noises and attempts to create excitement in the story, e.g. unnecessary and confusing chase sequences, it was a disappointing overall film. Okay!",A Christmas Carol
5,ma-cortes,Charming and worthwhile adaptation about timeless and quintessential Christmas story,7,5 November 2011,"A Christmas CAROL is an enjoyable Hollywood production, a wonderful and straight forward approach to the Dickens's source material being splendidly adopted . It is given the full ¨Motion Capture¨ deluxe treatment in this superior Holiday film. The production values & acting are both excellent, with just enough attractive to appeal to the tenderhearted, and with touching doses of horror , case of the potentially frightening elements the Ghosts of Past, Present and Future , adding sentiment ; all of them are blended into the mix, until, like a nice Christmas punch, the result appeals to all. Scrooge (Jim Carrey) is a miserly old businessman in 1840's London. He displays no charity to mankind generally, and in particular, to his employee Bob Cratchett (Gary Oldman) and his unfortunate son, Tiny Tim . One Christmas Eve he is visited by the ghost of Marley, his dead business partner. He is warned that he must change his miserly ways or face damnation. Marley foretells that Scrooge will be visited by three spirits, each of whom will attempt to show Scrooge the error of his ways.In Just One Night, He Has Seen His Past, His Present, And His Future. And They've All Come Back To Haunt Him Will Scrooge reform his ways in time to celebrate Christmas? . To his delight, the spirits complete their visits in one night giving him the opportunity to mend his ways. The first spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Past, shows Scrooge visions of his own past in which had spent much of his childhood neglected by his father over the holidays at boarding school until he was finally brought home by his loving sister Fan (Robin Wright), who died prematurely after giving birth to his nephew Fred (Colin Firth).A marvelous recounting of a Christmas vintage classic and Jim Carrey demonstrates once again his versatility on screen in this retelling of Charles Dickens' immortal story . Atmospherically, the movie is as comfortable and heartwarming as an old Christmas card .The whole concept of looking at your life in the past, present and future is creative in and of itself. After watching the movie, you may look at your life from the same perspectives. Special effects add a nice little touch,but it is Carrey's interaction with the 'ghosts' and various characters that really steal the show . Though most of us,if not all of us, have seen other adaptations in the past or read the story,and know already what to expect, Jim Carrey manages to capture pure magic with his stunningly awesome portrayal of main character Ebenezer Scrooge,and it is definitely worth a look. It's fun and different approach to the Christmas classic with top notch effects by means of ¨Motion Capture¨ a technique developed by Robert Zemeckis in previous films as Beowulf and Polar Express . A highly recommended film that nobody should miss it especially during Christmas time.¨Robert Zemeckis's Christmas Carol¨ still ranks as one of the best adaptations of the Dickens classic ever. This animated retelling of Charles Dickens' classic novel about a Victorian-era miser taken on a journey of self-redemption will appeal to Jim Carrey fans .Other versions about this stunning story courtesy of several mysterious Christmas apparitions are the following : The rather obscure 1935 version, with Sir Seymour Hicks, the 1951 British production, with Alastair Sim, adaptation released by MGM in 1938 with Reginald Owen , and the 1970 musical, with Albert Finney. Under the title of 'A Christmas Carol' a cartoon rendition (1997) by Stan Phillips and voiced by Tim Curry and another (1991) by Jimmy T Murakami with Simon Callow ,the made-for-TV productions: 1984 – With George C. Scott, 1999 – With Patrick Stewart, and the 2004 musical, with Kelsey Grammar .",A Christmas Carol
6,paul_haakonsen,Excellent!,6,18 May 2010,"Well, being the timeless classic that it is, everyone should already be familiar with the story of this particular movie.Now what makes this version stand out, besides the fact that it is a CGI animated, is the impressive cast they put together. But back to the animation first. This movie is simply fantastic. Lots of good graphics and effects, and enough weirdness to make even Tim Burton clap his hands.As for the cast, there are lots of a really good people here, people that work well with their voices alone, voices to supplement the animators creations.I liked this version of the classic story, as it was so beautifully made.This movie should not be missed by anyone who likes the Charles Dicken's classic.",A Christmas Carol
7,Quinoa1984,"a high-point for director Zemeckis, and a good step forward in motion-capture",7,9 November 2009,"I wonder if Robert Zemeckis weren't a filmmaker if he would have become a pilot. Look at his films and you may find a recurring shot in them, if not all then at least a good lot of them: a shot up in the sky, flying around and bringing the audience along (i.e. the feather in Forrest Gump, the pull-back through the valley and mountains in Beowulf, Back to the Future with the flying Dolorean), and here too are shots like that, more than one in fact. It's exhilarating to see Zemeckis at a mastery of this particular shot, and in the full scope and awe in 3D it's even stronger to watch and wonder 'how did they do it(?)' With motion-capture, anything is possible... except, sadly, making one feel a true emotional connection to the material.Oh, don't get me wrong. It's an improvement over The Polar Express, whose creepiness was more unto itself and jarring as opposed to serving the story, and one can already see advancements in the technology from Beowulf, which was also lots of fun and had an edge to it allowed only with the digital animation. But for some reason- maybe my heart is a lump of coal or I wasn't in the right Christmas spirit or something- the material in the film didn't connect with me, except those moments that were funny (intentionally or not, sometimes due to Jim Carrey's performance), and it became something peculiar. It's a story that is practically timeless, and the director is at the top of his game, almost at the same control of the medium for a particular story like Forrest Gump or Back to the Future - maybe more-so.It's also still a WOOSH experience, not carrying the same time and effort for characters to really feel fully human before our eyes like, for example, Up did back in the summer. I mention all of this first since the story we all know pretty much (as an aside, I kept thinking back to the first incarnation of the story I saw as a child, the Muppet Christmas Carol, and marveled at how both that and this film kept much of the book's dialog and storytelling devices exactly), and it's almost pointless to recant it here. What is paramount to mention though is that Zemeckis, in keeping with the tone of the original Dickens text (and having the clout that he has), makes it a true Victorian horror movie.It should be said also that children will be hit or miss with this version; while they'll delight and be awed by the animation and moments of craziness (my favorite being the scene with the ghost Marley and his entire presentation before Scrooge, unhooked jaw uneasily included), they may be put off by the ""old"" language, some of it in that olde 19th century English Dickens wrote in. Perhaps this is why, against his own better judgment, Zemeckis decided to add in a few scenes to change the very faithful adaptation, the key one being the chase through the streets of London in the Christmas-Future sequence. This is smack dab in the middle of what is the best segment of the film - seeing death as a silhouette with a bony finger and Scrooge's stark pleas is truly chilling - and it suddenly makes it also the worst. It kills the tension and makes a strange sensation: does one laugh at a tiny-voiced Scrooge running around like a mini Daffy Duck cartoon while he's supposed to be facing down his own demise? It's entertaining to watch, but awkward to behold at this point of the story.That the motion-capture, for all of its beauty and detail in the faces and people and locations and dazzling set-pieces, doesn't engage on a purely spiritual level (not even to the extent that 'Muppet Christmas' did, that at least had the ghost of Henson on the production to keep things truly haunting), is somewhat forgivable for what Zemeckis does accomplish here. He puts a modern spin on a classic tale, makes it approximately dark and mostly uncompromising for all ages- adults will jump possibly more than the kids at the WHOA effects- and Jim Carrey is nothing short of astonishing.Carrey plays Scrooge in such a bravura way that only calls attention to itself as a dramatic part (only toward the end, when he becomes ""happy"" Scrooge are there a few unintentional laughs), and it may even be the best Scrooge seen in many years in any medium. Added to this are his *other* parts in the film, as the ghosts of Christmas past and present, the former creepy just on the pronunciation of 's'. Others like Gary Oldman and Colin Firth come off more or less fine if not remarkable (Oldman as Marley is fantastic - as Cratchit, a Oldman-faced Hobbit, is another thing).",A Christmas Carol
8,tavm,This current version of A Christmas Carol comes highly recommended from me,9,9 December 2009,"After about a month of this latest version of the famous Charles Dickens Christmas tale coming out in theatres, I finally decided to watch Robert Zemeckis' and Jim Carrey's version of A Christmas Carol. With my 3-D glasses on, I watched in marvel at the whole Motion Capture version of the long-beloved story with my movie theatre working friend who was seeing this for the fourth time. The images of the ghosts and various scenes of the past, present, and possible futures brought a very intense mixture of joy, sadness, and especially terror to the fore. Carrey impresses in the leading role of Scrooge so much that I was truly spellbound by how compelling he was in a dramatic role for such a crazy comic. Perhaps because of the 3-D effect, there were probably too many scenes of point-of-view shots of flying through the scenery making it very much a possibly too-intense roller coaster ride for anyone under 12. (It certainly reminded me of how thrilling, yet dizzying, the dog fight scenes of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope was when I first watched that on the big screen at 9 years old.) Still, with all that, I very much enjoyed this version of this best known of Charles Dickens' classic stories and so I highly recommend this.",A Christmas Carol
9,studioAT,Carrey as Scrooge,5,20 December 2011,"A Christmas Carol is one of the most filmed novels ever and so it was only a matter of time before Disney had a go at trying to bring it to the big screen.The film visually is stunning with the time travelling aspects of the book really coming across as Dickens would have wanted them to.It is also loyal to the original text and there are very few lines that seem to not ring true. Whether little children would understand it or not remains to be seen.Jim Carrey does a good job in all his multiple roles. He won't go down as the best Scrooge ever but he certainly gives it all.As other reviewers have said, this film is quite dark in places and I would advise parents to sit and watch it with their children the first time round. I know that the book is essentially a ghost story but there are moments that Disney over-step the mark on the darkness.",A Christmas Carol
10,Hey_Sweden,"A good, not great adaptation of the enduring Dickens novel.",7,25 December 2016,"The now quite familiar Charles Dickens novel tells of Ebenezer Scrooge (performed by Jim Carrey), a cold hearted, greedy miser who spreads around the darkness in his soul every chance he gets. One fateful Christmas Eve, he's visited by a succession of ghosts, including that of his former business partner Jacob Marley, who review for him the course of his life, and attempt to show him the error of his ways.Obviously, the main reason that this version exists is to exploit motion capture technology for everything that it's worth; time and time again we're taken on dizzying trips through and above the streets of London. It also enables its talented cast to play more than one role: Carrey plays Scrooge at various ages, and also all three of the spirits, Gary Oldman plays Bob Cratchit and Jacob Marley (and Tiny Tim!), Bob Hoskins plays Fezziwig and Old Joe, etc. As a vehicle for the abilities of some top animators, the movie does do its job.However, people should be aware that despite the presence of Walt Disney Studios as the producer & distributor, that this is actually somewhat faithful to the source material and gets pretty dark at times. It's NOT the typical Disney feature. The youngest of your kids could easily get scared by Marley's ghost and the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come.Screenwriter / director Robert Zemeckis does show some respect for the source material, but goes seriously astray at times. His version gets rather over the top; those people who appreciate the subtlety of the 1951 film adaptation will be sorely disappointed. We really didn't need a sequence of a tiny Scrooge pursued by demonic horses through London. Zemeckis' film also shortchanges some characters (like Alice, and Mrs. Dilbur) and spends not enough time in ""Christmas past"".Fortunately, the material still resonates. It's still got power and substance and the ability to move ones' heart; not all the extravagance in the world can really take that away.""A Christmas Carol"" '09 is not likely to be remembered decades from now, like ""Scrooge"" or even the 1984 TV version. Carrey does a likable, respectable job, but he won't make ANYBODY forget Alastair Sim.Still worth a look for lovers of this story.Seven out of 10.",A Christmas Carol
11,Doylenf,"A new twist on ""A Christmas Carol"" with Jim Carrey in several roles...",6,19 November 2009,"From an artistic viewpoint, the new Robert Zemeckis film from the man who gave us THE POLAR EXPRESS, is another of his animated features using the motion picture capture technique that allows the actors to play several roles. The cinematography is exceptionally well done.JIM CARREY, as miserly Ebenizer Scrooge, looks nothing like his real self. He's a perfect Scrooge, using his voice and mannerisms to great effect, never overplaying the role as you might expect he would.The visit from three spirits is more frightening than usual, since Zemeckis decided to throw everything he could into startling special effects--sometimes with very gruesome results. The sight of Marley's Ghost with a flapping jaw that has to be realigned by Marley is just one of the ""extra"" touches. Some of the ""spirit"" scenes are too intense for small children, more likely to frighten them than anything else.There are times when the story remains very faithful to the Dickens book, sometimes even word for word. But when Zemeckis decides to show off that the camera can do with flying aerial scenes zooming over Victorian London, it begins to stray a bit. Biggest stray is a chase scene that has a miniature Scrooge going through drain pipes to escape an oncoming coach and horses trying to run him down.The lovely score by Alan Silvestri blends perfectly with the on screen action and includes a number of traditional Christmas favorites. GARY OLDMAN and COLIN FIRTH do well in key supporting roles but it's really Carrey's show all the way. He plays several main characters with great skill.Not quite as festive as you might expect, it's a darker version of Scrooge, handsomely executed so that many of the scenes look like Victorian illustrations from the novel. Warning: This is not a child's version of the tale. Parents should be advised that some of the content is too gruesome for young kids.",A Christmas Carol
12,dbborroughs,"Better than I thought it would be, had the character design been better and they not gone for thrill ride ""wows"" this might have been the best modern adaption of the story",7,10 November 2009,"I went to see Disney's Christmas Carol in 3D.My initial reaction to the film is I'm really angry with Robert Zemeckis. Why did he do this as motion capture? Okay yes I understand the effects and the sets are easier to do in the computer, but the human figures look wrong. Bob Cratchit looks like Alfred E Newman. I'm not going to rant about the way the characters look wrong. Its pointless. Lets just say that the non spirit characters are at best adequate and move on.(I'll come back to the faces in a minute) Okay away from the characters? how was it? Well had Jim Carrey not been animated he might have gotten an Oscar Nomination. Carrey is one of the best Scrooges there is. Perhaps the fact that his is the only face that looks real, mostly I think its a fine performance that allows you to really feel for Scrooge and his plight (No, I who as a rule dislikes Jim Carrey have not lost my mind, he does give a good performance). Gary Oldman is his equal playing a great Bob Cratchit and the terrifying Jacob Marley. Actually all of the performances are so good that they rank as the best in any Christmas Carol. I just wish the faces were better. And whats worse the weird facial appearance is intentional. How do I know? watch the end of the film when Bob Cratchit's face changes from Alfred E Newman to Gary Oldman and you see the lousy way its done is Zemeckis' choice. (I think he's been living too long in Hollywood and around people with botox injections).Truth be told I think on many levels this could have been the best modern adaption of the story. The script is, for the most part sterling. Its beautiful heartfelt and moving adaption of the story. Zemekis for all my belly aching has created a great version of the story. When was the last time that a version of the story scared you? Or even made you cry? I think the problem, outside of the faces, is that the film is designed to be a thrill ride. There is too much flying and the chase by the funeral carriage is much too long (with the drain pipe piece at the end being totally unnecessary). The real question is why? The film doesn't need it and doesn't take advantage of the 3D other than to show depth to the world. I think Zemeckis has forgotten what a movie really is.Sue me I really liked the film. I would dare say when it works I loved the film.(I expected to bail on the film) I think that Robert Zemeckis has cut his own throat with motion capture. I know several people who will not see the film because of how the film looks. Its a shame.As it is this is a really good film that is worth giving a go if you are so inclined. I would suggest trying it in 3D if you get the chance only because of the spacial relationships are pretty cool, but I think it works sans 3D (I had my glasses off for a part of it because the falling snow annoyed me)",A Christmas Carol
13,Bunuel1976,"A Christmas CAROL (Robert Zemeckis, 2009) **1/2",6,29 December 2011,"I came across this one by accident, since it was broadcast on local Cable TV instead of the scheduled 1984 TV version with George C. Scott! Not being a fan of Jim Carrey or the modern 'motion-capture' style of animation, I was not exactly enthused by the prospect of catching the nth rendition of the Dickens Yuletide classic featuring both these resistible commodities! The end result could hardly be expected to be anything less than the standard level already accomplished by the myriad previous adaptations of the tale for both the big and small screen. However, it is certainly not any better than most of these and a far lesser achievement than the definitive one i.e. 1951's SCROOGE. With this in mind, it is a pity that young moviegoers with little to no interest in so-called 'old' films will be deluded into believing this is the ""Christmas Carol"" to see! Anyway, I was surprised by Carrey's understated central 'performance' (which, rather lazily, resorts too readily to a mere mimicry of Alastair Sim's iconic interpretation in the afore-mentioned British version!): for the record, he takes on several roles here – as do Gary Oldman (most recognizable as Bob Cratchit) and, though hardly a thespian, Cary Elwes (as, among others, the Ghost Of Christmas Present). Colin Firth, then, is Scrooge's apparently clueless nephew (I was always bugged by the fact that this character seems surprised by his uncle's intense dislike of Christmas!), Robin Wright Penn Scrooge's old flame and Bob Hoskins 'appears' as Scrooge's ebullient and big-hearted first employer Mr. Fezziwig. Incidentally, director Zemeckis had been behind the first film to be made entirely via the 'motion-capture' technique, namely the similarly Christmas-related – but unwatched from my end – THE POLAR EXPRESS (2004). In this case, he chose to adapt the novella himself and, if anything, he started it off in a novel and interesting fashion, by showing Scrooge haggling with funeral directors over his partner Jacob Marley's burial preparations (even paying an attendant with the coins superstitiously covering the deceased's eyes!).At first, I have to admit to being impressed with the whole approach, especially the way the Steadicam is made to hover over the bustling street activity. However, once the plot gets going, the style becomes inconsistent and generally leans too much towards appeasing the kids in its prospective audience (this is actually ironic, since the inherent phantasmagorical elements are tackled with all the stops out!) – such as Bob Cratchit giddily sliding on the ice, Scrooge himself being made to hitch a ride at the back of a carriage (not to mention fly on a number of occasions), and even having the Ghost Of Christmas Past in the shape of an anthropomorphic flickering light. The latter, then, is the most obvious tell-tale sign of its being a Walt Disney production, and it is odd the studio turned to Scrooge for one of their animated features only now (though, in all fairness, they had already made the half-hour short MICKEY'S Christmas CAROL {1983}, which is actually one of the most enjoyable reworkings of the source material!).The protagonist's maudlin back-story (sacrificing love for the unmitigated pursuit of wealth) and the whole syrupy subplot revolving around the crippled but altruistic Tiny Tim (for those not in the know, the youngest son of the miserly Scrooge's meek clerk Bob Cratchit) is clearly in line with the essentially lowbrow sensibility that lied at the heart of Zemeckis' Oscar-winning FORREST GUMP (1994)! Thankfully, as I said, the supernaturally-infused moments deliver the goods and make the film worth watching at least once: the visitation by Marley's shackled contrite spirit, the two symbolic children (quite creepily rendered) concealed under the robe of the Ghost Of Christmas Present (who himself eventually turns skeletal), and the typically grim wraith-like depiction of the Ghost Of Christmas Yet-To-Come.",A Christmas Carol
14,writers_reign,What The Dickens,6,14 November 2009,"Whilst this is a fine adaptation and on the whole visually stunning it may not be the ideal Disney movie to place before young children which is ironic given the Disney brand image. I'm thinking of the scenes in which Scrooge is falling into his own coffin or indeed the opening scenes in which Scrooge removes the pennies from the dead Marley's eyes as he, in turn, lies in his coffin. Clearly adults and case-hardened children will have no problem with this but any real innocents may well have nightmares. Other than this the film works well and Jim Carre turns in a tour de force playing half the cast as well as the lead. The support is excellent as are the visuals so all in all it's one to see.",A Christmas Carol
15,zardoz-13,A Halloween Carol,5,18 November 2009,"Charles Dickens probably had no idea that his novella ""A Christmas Carol"" would be the overwhelming success that it has become since its initial publication in 1843. Essanay Studios in Chicago produced one of the earliest cinematic incarnations of this timeless tale in 1908 as a fifteen minute short film. Since then ""A Christmas Carol"" has been adapted to the big screen no less than 37 times. Basically, in the fantasy, four ghosts visit profit-minded curmudgeon Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas Eve, and Scrooge experiences what amounts to a secular conversion and wins redemption so that he turns into a completely changed man. Dickens wrote the story after witnessing the inhumane conditions that child laborers faced in Cornish tin mines. Not surprisingly, some critics have interpreted the novella as an indictment of industrial capitalism, but ""Polar Express"" director Robert Zemeckis and Walt Disney Studios depict it primarily as a thrill ride in 3-D with Scrooge going airborne on many occasions. Nevertheless, while the latest incarnation of Dickens' fable exhibits some fidelity to its source material, ""A Christmas Carol"" is more often than not a dark, sinister saga that should have been called ""A Halloween Carol"" for all its macabre machinations.After the first of several aerial flying sequences during the credits, this PG-rated Victorian morality play opens rather ominously with perennial curmudgeon Ebenezer Scrooge (voice of Jim Carrey) in a shadowy funeral parlor after his partner Jacob Marley has died. Skinflint Scrooge displays characteristic misanthropy when the undertaker extends his palm for payment of Marley's funeral expenses. Scrooge complies but emphasizes his austere miserliness by plucking the pennies off the eyes of Marley's corpse before he leaves. Zemeckis leaves no doubt in our minds about Scrooge's parsimony. A choir of street carolers clams up when Scrooge marches past them, and he scowls at urchins clinging to horse-drawn carriages so they can skate along the icy streets. The action leaps ahead seven years after Marley's death. Scrooge makes it painfully clear to Fred (voice of Colin Firth), his hopelessly cheerful nephew and only living relative, that he has no use for Christmas. When Fred invites his reclusive uncle to have Christmas dinner with his guests, Scrooge warns Fred he would see his nephew in Hades first rather than break bread with him. Before he locks up shop for the evening, Scrooge reminds Bob Cratchit (voice of Gary Oldman) not to be tardy for work the day after Christmas.Later that evening Scrooge's former business partner Marley materializes as a luminous evergreen ghost. Bedecked with chains anchored down by metal strong boxes at the ends of the chains, Marley bursts through the walls of Scrooge's house while our protagonist eats a meager supper. Marley's ghost informs Scrooge that Scrooge still has a chance to escape the purgatory that Marley has found himself condemned to for an eternity. After Marley departs, the disembodied Ghost of Christmas Past shows up. He resembles a child and a ball of flame hovers above his noggin. He takes Scrooge on a whirlwind flying tour of his past, and we are shown how Scrooge changed into a heartless person. Scrooge is shown where he attended school and relives important moments in his life, especially an ill-fated romance with Belle (voice of Robin Wright Penn). At one point, Scrooge tries to snuff out the flame by suffocating it under a metal cone. The Ghost of Christmas Present appears next, and he is a loud, happy, rambunctious fellow. Finally, the last ghost is a black clad Specter whose face we never see. Zemeckis preserves portions of Dickens story, particularly when Ignorance and Want cower beneath the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present, but he strays when he sends a miniature Scrooge scuttling through drainpipes as a demonic coach-and-six pursues him. All told, there are six flights across London and parts of rural England, including one where Scrooge tumbles across the face of the moon a la ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"" before he alters his spend-thrift ways.Not only does Jim Carrey play Scrooge, but he also plays all three ghosts. Nevertheless, if you didn't know it was Carry, you wouldn't know who it is. Indeed, Carrey looks nothing like his alter ego, and Scrooge—as he has been drawn—resembles comic actor Crispin Glover more than Carrey. The low-brow humor is limited to a sewage joke and a kick in the groin gag. Unfortunately, despite its state-of-the-art 3-D graphics, Zemeckis shoots most of the action in settings so shadowy that it detracts from rather than enhances the 3-D effects. Clearly, Zemeckis loves the motion capture process essentially because it enables him—to his way of thinking—to render the story's spectral appearance and its time-traveling nature. This represents Zemeckis' third use of motion capture technology that takes real-life people and converts them into lifeless as well as soulless caricatures of themselves. He made both ""The Polar Express"" and ""Beowulf"" with motion capture technology. The digital eyes lack warmth and the characters evoke little sympathy since they appear more like caricatures than characters. The Bob Cratchit character wears a blissful expression that makes him look like ""Mad Magazine"" icon Alfred E. Neumann on narcotics. Indeed, this ""Christmas Carol"" possesses about as much emotion as the lump of coal on Cratchit's desk in Scrooge's office that the poor fellow cannot burn for warmth against the winter chill. Zemeckis' ""Christmas Carol"" qualifies as an oddity and doesn't erase the memory of the 1951 British version with Alastair Sim as Scrooge.",A Christmas Carol
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,The essence is intact,7,20 November 2009,"Yet another adaptation of one of the most popular, beloved and shamelessly cheesy and positive(well, its message, anyway) Christmas classics. One thing that remained in my mind throughout watching this, and after it as well, was the first thing I thought upon seeing the trailer; the fact that there's barely any ""Carrey"" to it. Actually, my initial response at finding out that it would be him was probably ""why Jim?"". I have no problem with him. Before, I found him hysterical, and I continue to find his finest work hilarious. Thing is, Scrooge isn't someone we laugh at because he makes faces, has a goofy voice or moves in an odd way, and that is the gist of the guy's schtick, crassly put(and again, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with enjoying that). However, as I said, it makes little difference as he doesn't do much of it in this. One has to wonder why they'd get him for the role, other than star power. Every part is well-cast, they all sound exactly the way they ought to. Dialects and words are spot-on, as far as I, not having grown up in Britain, can tell. There's no doubt about it; they wanted this to pay respect to the novel. Most of the material is largely intact, and every scene, as I recall, is here. With that said, they have cut some, including golden stuff, and a lot of details that were important. Worse still, what they put instead are useless, ""exciting"" fly-passes and the like. I'd hope that the following goes without saying, but just in case: This story was never about spectacle! Ebenezer sees past, present and future, he doesn't go to another world. It is *reality* that changes him, the truth, that's the whole point. Imagination is not a bad thing, and it is certainly present in this and others of Dickens' books. Meanwhile, the social realism is vital, and there should have been more of such in this. They do get the core right. This is well-paced, you're not bored. The majority of the pretty-to-look-at camera-tricks and the like add nothing, and don't even relate to the plot. A couple of them do, and those are good. The design sticks to the appearance from the original. It is quite close to being natural, and the people looking like actual human beings(and, as anyone can tell, they tend to incorporate the real face of those who perform the character in their 3D counterpart, to varying degrees of extensiveness). There are people who will find that creepy, you may want to consider if you're one before buying a ticket. The animation is excellent. This is not that funny, and I'm honestly not sure I'd call it(or its source) a comedy. What jokes and gags there are mainly go for being silly. The drama is usually great. This is not one of the best versions of the tale. It doesn't dare go deep enough when dealing with those who suffer hardship, it breaks up one or two potentially somber and/or meaningful moments with attempts at humor, and for showing us an accurate depiction of Victorian London, this didn't make me ""feel"" it, although I do now realize that it would have been cool to soar through the air above it. It didn't need to be JC, and it could have been live-action. There is potentially scary and disturbing images in this, as you should expect if you've read it. I recommend this to fans. 7/10",A Christmas Carol
17,neil-476,Very good - caution for youngsters,8,11 November 2009,"I liked this quite a lot.It is a faithful adaptation of Dicken's novella which, in many ways, perhaps works better than a live action equivalent would. Most importantly, it remembers that the story is, above all, a ghost story rather than simply a morality tale - there are some definite horror/ghost story elements in it. Marley's ghost is straight out of the book, and truly horrifying.Most of the principals double up on voices, and do so very well. Carrey's Scrooge (at all ages) is very good, albeit one gets a distinct feeling he is channelling Alistair Sim's version to some extent.As was the case with Beowulf, it is disconcerting to see CGI variants on real people - the midgetised Gary Oldman as Bob Cratchit, and the Bob Hoskins-based Fezziwig were both somewhat distracting. I think it would have been better to create original faces.The opening sequences swooping over the London rooftops and down into the streets was spectacular, especially in 3D. Conversely, the coach chase during the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come sequence didn't really work for me - for one thing, it was far too dark.Alan Silvestri's music was excellent.",A Christmas Carol
18,ferguson-6,Lacking a bit of Spirit,7,9 November 2009,"Greetings again from the darkness. This is a stunningly visual film with animation that will take your breath away. My eyes could hardly keep up with the opening credits as we ""flew"" through the city. However, as amazing as the film looks and as wonderful as the Jim Carrey voices are, the film still lacks something.What may have happened is that some of the Dickens story was cut due to costs and the desire to concentrate on Scrooge. I am not saying it was a mistake, it just prevents us from ever connecting to the plight of Cratchet (Gary Oldman) or Scrooge's nephew (Colin Firth).One thing is for sure, the spirits are frightening. Marley's spirit will have kids running for the exits or hiding behind parents. That will probably hurt the film as it will need kids to build any type of box score.Definitely worth seeing for the visuals, but certainly not in the top versions if you really want to capture the spirit of Dickens' novel.",A Christmas Carol
19,anaconda-40658,Rates With the Best of Them.,10,30 December 2015,"A Christmas Carol (2009): Dir: Robert Zemeckis / Cast: Jim Carrey, Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Robin Wright, Cary Elwes: Classic Christmas tale that never seems to get old. Director Robert Zemeckis is perfect for the job since having made the Back to the Future films as well as Who Framed Roger Rabbit? He brings about the same adventurous feel of those previous films. Jim Carrey plays Ebenezer Scrooge whose reputation for being wealthy and selfish are well documented, however, he is visited by his late partner, Jacob Marley who informs him that he will be visited by three ghosts that represent his past, present and future. Jim Carrey plays off all three ghosts as well as Scrooge whose life is an open exam within one night, Christmas Eve. Gary Oldman appears as the tortured Marley whose mistakes are cemented in chains but he offers Scrooge an opportunity to avoid his fate. Colin Firth plays his nephew who expects Scrooge to visit for Christmas despite what others say. Firth remains one of encouragement and belief that Scrooge has good in him. Robin Wright appears as Scrooge's fiancé whom he once had passion for until he chose his career over her and has since regretted it. Cary Elwes also performs multiple roles, beginning with an old roommate of Scrooge. The message of giving and redemption is still as clear in this version as it was in the Alastair Sim version in years past. Score: 10 / 10",A Christmas Carol
20,FlashCallahan,Merry as a schoolboy.....,9,20 November 2011,"On Christmas Eve, crotchety miser Ebenezer Scrooge is visited by the ghost of his dead partner Jacob Marley.Scrooge is told that what they do in life will determine what happens to them in the afterlife.Marley tells Scrooge that he will be visited by three ghosts and to take heed of what happens. The first spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Past, shows Scrooge that he was once a happy young man, carefree and in love but money became his greatest desire.The Ghost of Christma Present shows him how others, including his nephew Fred and his clerk Bob Cratchit, The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, shows Scrooge the fate that awaits him......We all know the story of this film, and its been filmed numerous times since cinema began, but it's pleasing to say that Zemeckis has made a brilliant interpretation of the age old classic.But it's a dark movie, and sometimes very unnerving, so if you have younger children, i'd give it a miss.Carrey and the rest of the cast are on top form, and the Animation is fantastic in 3D. It's lighted in a very miserable way, mirroring the main character.But when he starts to learn the true meaning of Christmas, the film becomes brighter and more warmer, I think a lot of people who criticised the aesthetics and the lighting, didn't get what Zemeckis' intentions were.But watching it in 2D, my only gripe is that the characters have 'dead eye' which is not noticeable in 3D.It's a great film to watch on Christmas eve, and really does make you feel warm inside.But still not a patch on 'Scrooged'",A Christmas Carol
21,gradyharp,Fine Interpretation for Adults: Not for Children,10,25 December 2010,"What would Christmas be without a visit to Charles Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol', a story that dates back to 1843 and has been loved and read every year at this time? There have been other films, stage productions, musicals, and family readings galore and it still holds the magic of what the spirit of Christmas is all about. Doubtless there will be flocks of naysayers who don't buy into this adaptation by Robert Zemekis, but given the ghost story magic Dickens' created, this film takes it one step further and makes the ghostly three spirits very much alive and beautiful fanciful. Combining the actors with animation (animating the actors might be a better way of describing the magic) makes each of the many very well known actors who portray the characters that much more credible. Jim Carrey is at his peak as an actor in his ability to become the illusions his mind creates: he portrays all three ghosts as well a Scrooge at every level of his history. Other actors who are transformed by Zemekis and staff include Gary Oldman as the trio of Cratchit, Marley's Ghost, and Tiny Tim, Colin Firth as the jovial nephew, Cary Elwes, Robin Wright Penn, Bob Hoskins, Fionnula Flanagan and a host of others. The costumes and scenery are brilliantly executed. One problem with the film that may require parental judgment is the fact that the ghosts are truly scary and children might not be able to get past the fear they instill. But they will grow into the film as it is likely a work that will be resurrected every Christmas season as a tradition. It is 'excellent, my good fellows'. Grady Harp",A Christmas Carol
22,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: A Christmas Carol 3D,7,23 November 2009,"Robert Zemeckis seems to have been bitten by the motion-capture/3D/animation bug and it's definitely no stopping him from developing yet another flick that continues to evolve the multi-sensory technology to immerse the viewer into an experience. And you just cannot fault him with his latest, as you can see marked progression from what he first started out with The Polar Express, then Beowulf, and now, Charles Dickens' classic tale A Christmas Carol.I suppose nobody needs any introduction to the tale where three ghosts visit Scrooge, turning his life (or nightmares actually) upside down to evoke a change in behavioural pattern. Scrooge being the miser being led to see the folly of his ways and his attitude, and well, turns over a new leaf. The story has been done countless of times, either directly, or indirectly and usually through comedies, the most recent being The Ghosts of Girlfriends Past starring Matthew McConaughey.One of the chief differences for this Zemeckis picture, is that it stays faithful to the source. No tinkering of characters and plots, as it strives to probably be the definitive version in time to come. And the animation here is simply top notch, and you'd soon appreciate the half a decade of honing the technology and craft into what you'd see from the film - pristine, photo-realistic rendition of characters and sets, so much so that if someone was to boldly suggest the end of an era for real actors shooting against real locations, well, you won't just bat your eyelids and laugh that suggestion off.The level of detail for each character is astonishing, and one wonders at the amount of effort that went behind the scenes in the production process, which you can read about in countless of material available online. But I suppose having a strong, imaginative and innovative cast helps, as the voice talents here all prove to be a force to be reckoned with, in their portrayal of more than one character, and to infuse uniqueness into each so that they don't pass off as lazy copies of one another.Rubber-faced Jim Carrey doesn't get to exercise his facial expressions in person, but does so through the animation. And to voice no less than 8 characters is something, although one can argue that some of the characters are just different versions of the same. And he's supported by the likes of Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Cary Elwes, Robin Wright Penn and Bob Hoskins amongst others to bring to life their respective multi-characters through only the quality of their voices.Should Zemeckis continue this path of making animated films, I'd certainly like to see how he'll top this one. One caution though that some of the scenes here do contain some frightening moments that could make the young ones bawl, and I'm still lamenting that we don't have an IMAX 3D, or an IMAX theatre to take advantage of the many thrill-inducing scenes that were plentiful here. Hopefully that situation could change sometime soon.",A Christmas Carol
23,Smells_Like_Cheese,One of the best versions I've seen,9,20 May 2012,"Who doesn't like Christmas? Or at least parts of it? One of my favorite things about Christmas are the movies and stories that come with it. One of the most classic stories is Charles Dickens' classic A Christmas Carol, the ending always gets in me in tears and reminds me why Christmas can be so special. I love every rendition of the story: A Muppets Carol, Scrooged, the classic Christmas Carol from the 80's and so on, even the cheesy TV specials. Honestly, when I first heard about this movie, I had my doubts. The CGI fest really freaks me out, it's like we are being replaced with animation and like we won't need real actors in the future. But someone lent me the movie and I decided to give it a fair chance since I love this story and I'm glad I did because I was pleasantly surprised with A Christmas Carol.Ebenezer Scrooge, a bitter old moneylender at a counting house hates everything that embodies the joys and spirit of Christmas. He refuses to visit his cheerful nephew Fred at his Christmas dinner party with his family, and forcing his underpaid employee Bob Cratchit to beg to take the day off for his own family. That night, Scrooge is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley who had died seven years prior on Christmas Eve and is now forced to spend his afterlife carrying heavy chains that were forged from his own greedy ways. Marley warns Scrooge that he will suffer an even worse fate if he does not repent and foretells that he will be haunted by three spirits that will help guide him: The Ghost of Christmas Past, The Ghost of Christmas Present and The Ghost of Christmas Future. They take him on a journey in what was, is and can be if he doesn't change soon.Though the animation still bothers me as I don't think you can convey real human emotion through the CGI people, but I really did like this movie a lot. I thought the whole atmosphere was just gorgeous and really captured the colors of Christmas. All the voice actors did an incredible job, though one complaint is what the heck was with Jim Carrey's accent? He's trying to be British but sounds like Borat trying to do an English Accent. I loved the animation on the ghosts, they were just breath taking. I'm also relieved that they didn't water down the horror of the ghosts, they were genuinely frightening and a lot of the imagery was very haunting. A lot of people forget that the novel despite having a wonderful ending is very scary at the same time. It took being frightened out of his wits that Scrooge changes.I really did like this version of A Christmas Carol and I think some people are being a bit too harsh. I'm not saying that it's not without flaws, but it tells the story beautifully and doesn't insult the children's intelligence. It's beautifully set and wonderfully acted, I think Charles Dickens would be proud of this presentation. It's a timeless story that can be told in many different ways, but sometimes you can't go wrong with the simple classic style. A Christmas Carol is sure to become a classic in years to come, it deserves another chance.9/10",A Christmas Carol
24,blanbrn,A different style and take on a traditional holiday classic.,7,2 December 2009,"Growing up over the years as was so common with many of us, we either read or watched different forms of the Charles Dickens classic ""A Christmas Carol"". And it was always a heart warming tale for all of mankind proving that around Christmas it pays to be kind to those that are less well off than you. As if you don't change your end will be grave like Scrooge! With this modern and animated version that's brightened up with CGI and 3-D digital color it's certainly a different style for a viewer who was use to the old classic versions of the 1930's and 1950's it's even more toasty with magic than Disney's Mickey's Christmas Carol. Anyway writer director Robert Zemeckis as you know also sparkles and brightens his films up as it's proved here with his motion capture techniques as seeing Jim Carrey's rubber Scrooge face is neat and interesting. All thru the film the faces and buildings show so much expressive features. Still the story stays the same as Ebenezer as cold and fearful as ever who's played to fine form by Carrey follows the same path as the original tale as he's visited by three ghosts the past, present, and future. And with all of the visuals you feel the psychotherapy is more original as scenes show Carrey and Gary Oldman not showing any emotions in multiple roles.The Ghost of Christmas past is a cut off invisible flame that's neat and with Zemeckis sci-fi is present by showing Scrooge's home getting turned into a moving hovercraft. Overall this film is okay with some new style delight of brightness and high tech animation which might help someone in need of a holiday fix, still it doesn't rank with the old traditional ""Christmas Carols"" yet in today's age it's a watch.",A Christmas Carol
25,KineticSeoul,Worth checking out at IMAX,7,14 February 2010,"Well just about everyone has read or at least heard of Charles Dicken's ""A Christmas Carol"" and the director basically tries to go in a direction of how Dicken's would have imagined it using only CGI throughout the whole film. I must say Jim Carrey did a fabulous job of playing different characters even the 3 ghosts. Although after the film is finished, it felt a bit mediocre but some parts were actually pretty cool, like the flying sequences. And the serious parts didn't feel that serious cause they try a bit too hard to push and show what they can do with CGI. This was a good story written by Dicken's and with that being said, there wasn't any emotion in this movie and the most irritating part about it all is that the film gets a bit too dark sometimes(literally) to the point it's sort of difficult to see what is going on. This really isn't a film that I personally would watch again on DVD, but it's alright to check out in 3D in some theater or IMAX.7.2/10",A Christmas Carol
26,sddavis63,Decent Movie With Great Animation But Certainly Not The Best Adaptation Of Dickens' Story,7,25 November 2009,"There may not be a story that has been put on the big screen as many times and in as many different ways as Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol."" (The only possible one I can think of that might rival it is ""Dracula."") This has been done straight many times, it's been done as a cartoon, it's been done featuring dogs, it's been Americanized and updated and pretty much everything else you can think of. Now we have this animated 3-D Disney-version featuring Jim Carrey above anyone else, which I saw, appropriately enough, at a theatre in Orlando, Florida while on vacation. As always, Disney's animation is top-notch and the 3-D effects are very good, making it worth the money to spend to see it in a theatre. Carrey's voice work as Scrooge was excellent, and the rest of the voices were quite good as well. The animation allowed the spirits to be portrayed in a quite ghostly fashion, especially Marley's ghost and the Spirit of Christmas Past - in fact, those two might be too frightening for younger children, and some of the scenes involving the Spirit of Christmas Yet To Come were a bit too over the top even for an animated story. Some of the story seems abridged, but the basics are all there, and I guess that would count as the biggest weakness. This adds nothing to the story that hasn't already been done, making me wonder why Disney went to the trouble, frankly. It's technically a good piece of work, but Carrey's Scrooge seemed based largely on the work of Alastair Sim in the 1951 version. That version remains the absolute classic in my view. There's nothing wrong with this. It's enjoyable, and you certainly wouldn't be sorry to have seen it, but don't watch only this version - catch the '51 version as well. 7/10",A Christmas Carol
27,Buddy-51,Classy treatment of a classic,8,22 December 2011,"With income-disparity at a level not seen since the turn of the last century, Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" has never seemed more timely and relevant in its spirit and message. No longer just a quaint little tale from a distant past, the story, with its themes of unbridled greed and compassion for the poor, speaks with a renewed urgency to our current generation.So, polemics aside, how does the 2009 ""motion-capture"" animated version of this most famous of all stories stack up against the umpteen others we've seen over the course of a lifetime (including those featuring The Muppets and Mr Magoo)? Very well, actually. Robert Zemechis' movie remains generally faithful to the source material, and, while it provides us with a visually ravishing - almost snow globe-like - look at a wintry 19th Century London, it isn't afraid to confront the darker elements of the tale as well (as such, it might be a bit frightening for very young kids at times). And while one could accuse it of going a trifle overboard in its search for the requisite 3-D sensation (as most of these films by their very nature are wont to do), the movie remains forever focused on the human heart that beats at the core of the work.Even in semi-animated form, Jim Carrey is so remarkable as the miser Scrooge (and the three main ghosts who visit him) that, in the spirit of the holidays, we're even willing to forgive him for his desecration of the Grinch a decade or so back. And he's backed by a first-class cast that includes Robin Wright Penn, Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Bob Hoskins and Cary Elwes among others.All minor quibbles and qualms aside, you'd have to be a bah-humbugging Scrooge yourself to resist the charms of this movie.",A Christmas Carol
28,cherold,"Beautifully animated, mostly faithful adaptation",8,14 January 2021,"A Christmas Carol offers a generally traditional approach to this classic. It captures the spirit of the story, although, like most adaptations, prefers to portray Scrooge as an unpleasant man rather than go with Dickens more pointed look at the evils of Capitalism.The animation is often remarkable, particularly the third, extra shadowy ghost. The story is fast-moving, although I wish it had cut less of the story; it's short enough that it could have been comfortably extended.My one strong objection is to a misplaced chase scene near the end that is not organic to the story or true to Dickens and seems to be there just because they wanted some big flashy animated scene. It really bugged me.Outside of that, this is an excellent addition to the family of Scrooges.",A Christmas Carol
29,Robert_duder,A labor of love that honors the classic but doesn't add any flare,7,2 March 2010,"This will be the good bad and the ugly of the latest iteration of A Christmas Carol. Has any other story been brought to life as many times as this has? This has to be a driving factor in reviewing yet another version...not the first animated, but the first in 3D probably (I however only saw it in 2D) which I don't think played a huge part in this review. The brilliance of this version is how much writer, director Robert Zemeckis kept true to the original content. In some cases the script is word for word from the original Dicken's story and that is impressive. Also there are small things in the film that are very true to Dicken's vision of the story (you can read a few of them in the trivia section on IMDb.) A Christmas Carol is such a timeless classic that it would practically be impossible to dislike any version but at the same time anyone over the age of ten has seen at LEAST a half dozen different versions so it is really like watching a movie you've already seen...only animated in CGI. The animation is lovely, very impressive, the setting of London is beautiful and just brilliantly drawn which I'm sure helps in 3D.Jim Carrey undertakes several voice roles and is brilliant as he always is. His animated likeness as Scrooge is disturbingly amazing and you believe that Jim Carrey IS Scrooge. I don't think he could pull it off in live form but he is perfect in animation. The amazing Gary Oldman is surprisingly soft spoken as Bob Cratchit but gets to unleash a little as Marley. Colin Firth is excellent and perhaps the second best animated version of himself next to Carrey. Bob Hoskins also brings to life ol' Fezziwig in the past and you could look into the animated eyes and literally see Hoskins, same with Carrey and Firth and several other characters in the film. The animation on the characters and the voice over work is literally flawless.Robert Zemeckis is a brilliant film maker. I think he's brought some of the most brilliant films to the big screen including Back To The Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and Forrest Gump just to name a few of the truly astonishing animated and special effects ridden films. So the technology is easily brilliant. Now here comes the bad...this iteration of A Christmas Carol stays so true to its original concept that it doesn't bring anything whatsoever new to the table. As stated you will feel like you've seen this before and it never surprises you which is both bad and good when remaking a classic like this. The problem is when you've seen this movie in another version so many times you know exactly what is coming next and I found myself excited to see how Zemeckis imagined it but when it came...it was just the same. But if you consider other versions of this movie a classic than any movie that follows the formula to a T will mean that this should be a classic as well. It is well worth the Christmas Carol mantra and your kids will enjoy this likely more than other live versions thanks to brilliant animation and terrific voices. 7/10",A Christmas Carol
30,Lejink,Entertaining 3D experience,7,7 December 2009,"I really enjoyed this latest re-telling of Dickens' timeless morality tale on the true meaning of Christmas and whiled away a wet Sunday afternoon in Glasgow being warmed in more ways than one by this imaginative treat.To be fair, I'm more interested in hearing Dickens' text than being swept away by the up to date modern technology that director Zemekis brings to bear here, but even an old churl like me was excited by the animated effects on show, enhanced thrillingly by the 3D-Experience. These were most to the fore in the scenes of snow-falling, Scrooge's spirit-assisted flights from one scene to another and especially those eye-popping perspective shots looking down from high places. The rest of the animation was similarly admirable with the physiognomies of the star actors Carrey, Firth and Oldman easily recognisable mocked up from real life and also in the recreation of old Victorian London.Perhaps there was a little too much catering to today's youthful game-generation - there are only so many breathless chase sequences which screamed out product tie-in that you can take, but the essence of the story was otherwise well enough preserved to satisfy this old traditionalist.Carrey's comic excesses are well under control to the benefit of the film in general and he carries off Scrooge's aged, English accent with aplomb. Colin Firth gets to be bluff and hearty, while Gary Oldman dispenses humility and charity most satisfactorily so that by the time the happy ending is reached, that feel-good Christmas feeling has surely been well-imbued into the demeanour of even the most Ebenezer-like viewer.",A Christmas Carol
31,MLDinTN,uninspiring version of a classic,5,22 May 2011,"I didn't think there was anything special about this version of Dickens' classic. Some of the animation was good, but it wasn't spectacular. Plus Jim Carrey didn't really use an English accent for this role set in London. I think everyone knows the general plot of this story. Scrooge is visited by 3 ghosts that make him change his ways. It's a little dark for younger kids. And it has a very slow pace, this story has been told many times better than this.Plus, with animation you usually get really good background music, but nothing stood out to me.FINAL VERDICT: Not a great version of Dickens's classic.

36,johnnyboyz,"Humbug! Zemeckis continues to pour animation-driven nonsense on top of us in this, frankly, trudging adaptation.",5,24 April 2010,"An interesting, if rather amusing entry on this film's IMDb trivia page, reveals that the piece is pretty faithful to the Dickens book on which it's based but with one or two exceptions. Firstly, and I quote, that ""In the book, we spend a lot more time in the present, especially at the houses of his employee and nephew. The novel also shows us strife around the globe - in caves and on ships - that is relieved by Christmas joy. Also, the whole ""future"" scene with the horse chase and Scrooge becoming smaller is not in the novel."" Summed up perfectly, in an absolute nutshell, we get everything presented to us in terms of what's wrong with Bobby Zemeckis' 2009 incarnation of A Christmas Carol: less trouble and strife put aside capturing what it is Christmas does for people and more whooshing and waltzing about the world for sake of it. So spectacle before strife is the order of the day in this film; then we think back to its three-dimensional opening and we realise that up to that point (nor since, at time of writing): no film is yet come out in three dimensions that wasn't aimed at people under the age of seventeen anyway, thus, all the whooshing and flying and 'stuff' needed to be in there so as to pander to that particular crowd. This ideology of spectacle and 'the visual' over heart-felt substance and concentration renders the piece a rather horrid Americanisation of the classic text; a 21st Century non-event of something that has had its past adaptations and versions, with people at the core of it ranging from Mickey Mouse right the way up to Bill Murray, but here really at its most cynical. Jim Carrey is the man whom lends his voice to,amongst many others, the protagonist Ebenezer Scrooge; a bringing to life of the withered old codger as he progresses from harsh, senile elderly man to someone in possession of great fear at what befalls his large lonely house to retribution in realising what Christmas is all about.I'll give Carrey credit in that he voices Scrooge in a way that would see you need to second guess who's providing the necessary skills, but in throwing Gary Oldman; Bob Hoskins; Colin Firth and the-like into the mix, you have a nice list of names fit to sit nicely on a film poster so as to draw your audiences in - each actor voicing roles that may very well have been done by anybody, and each talent offering nothing in the way of anything else but going through the motions and sounding slightly alike and unlike their real-life voices at random times. Rather disgustingly, Zemeckis' film begins with a 'journeying' into Dickens' classic text itself; an animated book sitting on a desk and magically opening up as we slowly drift into it to easy-on-the-ear instrumental music, suggesting a moving into the actual novel. As discussed, it's anything like the novel and while I read it sticks to the source text structurally, it still wants the flight sequences to 'wow' (3-D or not) and the generic scares.So, Scrooge is this old hag; this miserable and downtrodden old man whom lives on his own and while is fulfilled in life in terms of riches, inhabits a hollow existence in terms of social status. His house is large and fit for many-a person to live, but he dwells alone; his long-time business partner has died prior to the opening scene, but he fails to show much in the way of remorse; his money would go rather a long way in aiding those less fortunate than he, but he keeps it too himself in a form of unadulterated physicality: so much so, that replacing a sign above his place of business thus renaming it after his partner's death as well as heating the damn place is out of the question. Share and share alike; enjoy what you have and try not to dismiss those linked to you through family and work. Fine, but Zemeckis again, as in Beowulf, lands the film half way between child and adult audiences. About an hour in, amidst all the spectacle, I found myself recounting my own previous encounters with the text that further still brought its own sense of nostalgia, distracting from the piece I was watching, but the sense of nostalgia was more interesting.The film is difficult to get too excited about. Its cut up narrative of handing us these five distinct segments, one of which is epilogue; three of which are spirit driven and the fifth of which is the new order, would plod and meander to the point of unearthly dullness had there not been some schlock scares in there to keep us all awake; while manipulative tones in colour and hue lead us into false senses of security on some occasions and set up drab, uncanny exchanges with ghosts on others. The film is overstuffed but underwhelming, and Zemeckis has had his fun now with this computer generated imagery filling in for flesh and blood actors; the run's over, I'm not interested anymore and getting back to what the man did best in the past is due. The film is mildly diverting, but rather irritating; a little effective in its creepiness, but annoying in its age-old technique of bringing everything down to zero before blasting us with scares; too scary for children of a younger age of whom ought to be able to get the most out of it, but both too infantile and repetitive for grown-ups to truly enjoy: A Christmas Carol is a misfire.",A Christmas Carol
37,filipemanuelneto,"Pleasingly faithful to the original tale, it can, however, scare off the most impressionable children.",8,16 August 2017,"""A Christmas Carol"", by Charles Dickens, has been regularly adapted to film or television, so even those who haven't read the book know the whole story, and its difficult to bring something substantially different from what already exists. This is bad? I don't think so. Literature classics have always been (and will continue to be) available to be adapted for the movies. We can change perspective, tell things differently or simply be faithful to the book. It's all a matter of taste. Personally, I really like a story that is faithful to the book that gives rise to it, I think its meritorious when adaptation manages to put on screen the magic of words. And, to my delight, I can say that this film has captured the magic of Dickens. So I will not waste time telling the script or commenting on it because its famous enough.Being a film with Disney seal, we're expecting some quality standard, especially concerning to the animations and the whole visual and sound part of the film. I think it's technically perfect or very close to it. My only negative criticism is the somewhat gloomy and Gothic atmosphere that I notice sometimes. Some scenes are, in fact, scary, and this will surely scare some children, to whom parents are going to show this movie for being a Disney movie. I believe, therefore, that some scenes may not be advisable to very young or impressionable children. A very nice point of the film is the cast of voice actors. The most noteworthy name is, of course, Jim Carrey, an actor who has always stood out for his extraordinary use of voice. Soundtrack is good and discreet but does not have the usual songs, which Disney movies have used us to.",A Christmas Carol
38,Rectangular_businessman,A dull and uninspired version of a classic,3,24 December 2012,"While this wasn't as bad as the awful ""The Polar Express"", this animated version of ""A Christmas Carol"" directed by Robert Zemeckis feels mostly dull and uninspired.The best thing that can be said about this movie, is that the plot remains mostly faithful to the one from the original book, but the animation style (Which actually isn't that good, looking most of the time as it were just a extremely long cut-scene from a video game) made this something very hard to enjoy, due the Uncanny Valley effect.On the other hand, in this movie there wasn't any kind of emotional involvement with the story and the characters, feeling most of the time as an empty spectacle that without being terrible is completely forgettable.For a much better animated version of ""A Christmas Carol"" see the short film from 1971 directed by Richard Williams, that was much better than this movie in every single aspect.",A Christmas Carol

This time, as it is a comeback to roots in the Victorian era, I was even more excited! But, when I bought my ticket, and got the 3D glasses, I have already lost and broken all my glasses except my sunglasses. So, with the 3D glasses, I got as much light as in a Rembrandt painting, that is to say, none! I could do nothing to change this because the tale happens during Christmas night, in a candlelight time, because it deals with poor families.In addition, along the movie, I became frozen and as soon as I was home, I was definitively ill with a high fever.The only good time I got with this movie was the opening credits with the aerial ballet in London sky.",A Christmas Carol
40,TheMovieDiorama,A Christmas Carol sings the haunted verses of Dickens through disjointed emotionless motion capture.,5,18 December 2019,"""Bah! Humbug!"" Zemeckis had always been fascinated with digital cinema. 'The Polar Express' was technological innovation at its more pure, yet 'Beowulf' stabbed itself through contrived art direction that failed to suit the dark environment it was showcasing. So when he heard the ""House of Mouse"" were adapting Dickens' universally known tale (again...), he clearly joyfully jumped at the chance of producing more digital art. The inevitable question though is: why? Does a Victorian-era Christmas story warrant the unrefined technological advancement of motion capture? Yes and no, is the answer.The tale itself remains intact, following closer to Dickens' words than any other adaptation that preceded this. On Christmas Eve, Scrooge encounters various spirits that show the repercussions of his selfish acts, in a bid to rid the evils of ignorance and want. I've seen it. You've seen it. Your nan has definitely seen it. And probably your pet dog too. Whether it be live-action, Mickey Mouse or The Muppets, you have almost indefinitely seen an adaptation of this famous novella. It's an important moral that warrants the several iterations over the course of cinema, teaching families the significance of generosity and Christmas spirit.Much like its source material however, it's a dark tale. Ghostly ghouls visiting an elderly lonely man, including his deceased business partner entrapped in shackles and the shadow of Sauron succumbing Scrooge to the depths of Mordor's burning fires. Zemeckis took the core tone of Dickens' novella and merged it with Disney's typical holiday whimsicality. The end result? Inconsistent. It's either too dark for children or too joyous for adults. The two jarring tones rarely worked, producing a conflicting adaptation. One moment Scrooge is dealing with a prostitute dragged away in a straining jacket. The next scene? Children having a snowball fight to the merry notes of Silvestri's score. Neither producing an entirely cheerful Christmas flick or faithful replication. I'd rather have a 15-rated horror adaptation of A Christmas Carol, as intended of course.Now for the motion capture. It is what it is I suppose. A technical achievement for its time, utterly outdated a decade later. Character models were stilted. Eyes lacked any expression whatsoever. When close to candle lighting, resembled waxworks. The Ghost of Christmas Past just looked terrible, with its face mismatching the rest of its anthropomorphic candle body. Environmentally speaking, the scenery and inanimate objects were stunningly designed. It really felt like Christmas in Victorian-era London. Just a shame that Zemeckis only tested the limitations of animation through scenes of padding. Scrooge chased by a grim reaper for five minutes. Scrooge flying around London for three minutes. Scrooge slowly becoming Jim Carrey for the film's entirety. Seemed like additional efforts for gimmicky 3D extravaganza than actual substance.Fortunately the voice acting was perfect. Carrey and his multitude of personas rarely matched Scrooge's mundane lifestyle. But that's why it worked so well! The various voices of the ghosts as well tested his voicing talent remarkably. Oldman as Cratchit added a touch of humility to the story, and again, suited the character perfectly.A Christmas Carol is a smorgasbord of tonal clashes and technical anomalies. For every fantastic aspect is a tiresome trope. The gorgeous scenery design is counteracted by horrific motion capture. The source material's darkness is restrained by forced whimsicality in an attempt to appeal to the masses. It's not the ideal Christmas present I asked for, but I can make do with its contents. Bah! Humbug!",A Christmas Carol
41,southdavid,Ebenezer Goode ?,5,26 October 2020,"Next, on my alphabetical run through Disney Plus, I arrived at Robert Zemeckis' adaptation of ""A Christmas Carol"" made using the same motion capture software but, thankfully, less horrific than his dead-behind-the-eyes version of ""The Polar Express"".Notorious miser, Ebenezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) is visited by the ghost of his dead partner, Jacob Marley (Gary Oldman) who warns him that three further spirits will visit him, to convince him to change his penny-pinching ways or he too will be cursed to hell, upon his death. Sceptical of the warning, on a cold Christmas eve night, Scrooge settles in but is soon aware that he is not alone.As I say, visually ""A Christmas Carol"" is a big improvement on the ""The Polar Express"". It was 5 years later, and Zemeckis had made ""Beowulf"" in between, to help improve his craft. The characters and their movements, whilst not necessarily lifelike, don't look like the reanimated corpses they did back then. From there, it's an odd adaptation, stringently adhering to the dialogue from the book, whilst introducing the odd flight of visual fancy, such as the chase by the ghost of Christmas future's carriage or the candle snuffer that acts like a rocket.Jim Carrey does OK playing Scrooge at several points in his life, as well as all three of the spirits. His accents are . . . questionable . . . but his enthusiasm comes through and I like the idea that all three of them resemble him, adding to the idea that he's essentially talking to himself. My most pressing problem is that I'm not really sure who the film is for. It's too scary for younger children but a little too silly for the adults and the older ones.There's nothing spectacularly wrong with this version of the story, but it's not particularly memorable or entertaining either.",A Christmas Carol
42,jzappa,An Awe-inspiring Experience That Makes Beneficial Use of Its Trendy Format,9,26 December 2010,"A Christmas Carol by Robert Zemeckis is a breathtaking cinematic experience and attests that he's one of the hardly any who knows how to be proactive with the stereoscopic illusion of depth perception, the growing popularity of which in mainstream cinema is yielding an unprecedented amount of 3-D releases. Not only is A Christmas Carol one of the biggest of those, it's also entirely comprised of recordings of the actions of human actors to animate digital character models so it can be a CGI film. This is extremely expensive technology that adds nothing of value to the movie-going experience when for 100 years we've been mesmerized and moved by two-dimensional movies that with organic talent have provided more than enough psychological illusion for three-dimensional reality. But Zemeckis is either uninterested in its use as a gimmick or he is but is equally or more interested in using it as a storytelling enhancement.Animation affords the liberty to show anything, and Zemeckis, who still knows the value of occasionally quieting things down for a bit of tension or a precisely timed joke, utilizes it. Intermittently, he even looks to be suggesting the spirit of iconic surrealists, as in a remarkable sequence where all the furniture vanishes and a soaring grandfather clock intimidates Scrooge and a floor inclines into an indistinct viewpoint. And it all brings Dickensian details to such sumptuous life. The heart of the story is there, and Zemeckis honors and respects it.Can you argue performances in characters so much compiled by council? Actually, yes. I see now that there does not have to be anything lost in an actor's inimitable gestures or reactions through this process. Especially in the expository scenes, which are as perfectly paced and delicately directed as any of the best of the 2009 movie year, performances are quite incredibly real and surprisingly natural. Also, needless to say, Carrey goes into overdrive as not just Scrooge but all three of the Christmas ghosts. Gary Oldman voices Bob Cratchett, Marley and Tiny Tim, and is less recognizable than he was in Hannibal, through no more or less fault than the elaborate make-up job of that film.The Dickens story stays ageless, and if it's electrified here with a milestone opening credits sequence comprised of a single swooping shot soaring through the bustling winter macro- and microcosmic goings-on of London, well, once you allow poltergeists into a movie, there's opportunity for everything, most importantly letting the story itself shine through where it naturally does.Said phantoms are not news. What makes this a masterpiece of film direction, pacing and spectacle is the fantastical visual expression of the film, the sobering and well-thought-out segue from Present to Future, the swooping flights through London and amplifying the utter ethereal strangeness of the ghosts, all of which feel faithful to the character of Dickens. Here his protagonist is a stunningly real exaggeration: Ebenezer Scrooge, never more skeletal, never more hunched, never more acidic.Zemeckis sets these characters in a London that coils and distends its setting to display the chilling atmosphere. Scrooge's living room is precisely as constricted, angular and vertical as he is. The home of his nephew Fred, on the contrary, is as broad and welcoming as Fred's character.I stay dubious that 3-D's gimmicky return characterizes the next generation of movies, though it says something that Zemeckis' 3-D features have grappled interest from me. Yes, Zemeckis does throw in a few gratuitous moments where things are flying at your face, but he ultimately uses enough self-discipline to guarantee the stereoscopy doesn't engulf your wits or detract from Dickens' reductive but rousing story about greed and redemption. It's too enriched by effective details from second to second to write off. But let me also note that my experience of this film was one of home entertainment. Yes, 2-D, and yet I was still thoroughly caught up in another world, as they say, sincerely and genuinely, without the troublesome dimness of the polarized-light technology using only half the light for each eye, closer people and things blocking further ones, the further ones color-depleted and obscure in relation to nearer ones anyway, and so on.But I stand by what I said. There are films of this format that are not simply exploiting the public's fleeting fascination with the product, but---not in a way necessary to achieve that intention, but a fun one to tackle every so often---keen to surround us with every fine distinction and trace of a story's world. Even the score by Alan Silvestri steals some traditional Christmas carols, but you have to listen in for them when their distinguishing tones become menacing throughout a death-defying journey through London, or sulking when Cratchett breaks the bad news about Tiny Tim, or elated when Christmas dinner is served. Ultimately, A Christmas Carol, despite being exquisitely crafted, has the one feature adults expect in a family movie: It's engaging for them, too.",A Christmas Carol

44,meeza,A Christmas Carrey!,8,11 November 2009,"Charles Dickens' originated the grumpy, money-hungry Ebenezer Scrooge many moons ago in his infamous ""A Christmas Carol"" book, and to this day Scrooge is still thought of as a Dickens' D_ _ k who is the anti-Christmas poster boy. Before you think I am pulling a Scroogie on Ebenezer, I must say it is still gratifying to observe the Christmas Spirit transformation that Scrooge goes through in this classic Dickens' tale. And it is retold once again with breathtaking 3-D imagery in Director Robert Zemeckis' movie ""A Christmas Carol"". The legendary Jim Carrey stars as Scrooge, and also co-stars and co-stars and co-stars as the Ghost of Christmas Past, Ghost of Christmas Present, and Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. Sorry I got Carryed away! Hope Jim got a nice Christmas bonus for playing so many parts. For those of you unfamiliar with this tale, it is based on Christmas Day. The meanie Scrooge is confronted by the aforementioned ghosts in guiding & reminding Scrooge on the man he sued to be, the reality of the world in present, and what his future will be like if he does not alter himself to be a better man. The scene-stealing ghost with the most comical spirit had to be the Ghost of Christmas Past. I must give props to Carrey for taking on this multi-character mission; he reminds us that Jim is still ""Smokin"" with talent. Zemeckis' vision of filming the actors and then superimposing them as graphic characters continues to be a groundbreaking directorial technique. However, Zemeckis' scrooge fumble was on his mundane and way too complex screenplay of the movie. I could just visualize many kids doing a ""Uhhh?"" in trying to understand the knotty dialogue. Nevertheless, Zemeckis ""A Christmas Carol"" does present itself with the best 3-D imagery I have seen in the latest 3-D movie craze; and for that and the grand Carrey is sufficient enough to unscrooge yourself and book a theatrical 3-D viewing of Robert Zemeckis' ""A Christmas Carol"". **** Good",A Christmas Carol
45,CubsandCulture,The director seemed to have lost a few battles,5,4 December 2020,"If you have never seen any adaptation of A Christmas Carol this is definitely not the one to check out first. Zemeckis either had the studio interfere with the film or the film got away from him. The major issue is the version of the story is among the darkest of the adaptations I have seen. Marley and the Spirits are all played for horror, dread and the the film includes some of the darkest beats from the novel that sometimes gets excluded from the family friendly versions, i.e. the couple who are happy Scrooge is dead, or the children of Ignorance and Want. The death of the Spirit of Christmas Present is especially intense. The Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come is among the most visceral versions I have seen. But at the same time the film includes a ton of added action, comedic (for lack of a better term) sequences that don't add anything to the story other pad out its run time. The final project-especially given the animation-is too goofy for adults and too disturbing for (young) kids.The animation-I never saw this in 2009 and I only saw it just now 2020-has dated pretty badly. The other Zemeckis digital backlot, animated films from around this time period are better realized technically. There is a lot of uncanny valley in this film. There's also a lot of stiffness in the animation. It is a drab looking film with only the The Spirit of Christmas Past standing out as a unique take on a sequence.It is really too bad. Jim Carrey turns in a really good set of performances and the idea of limiting the cast to only a few actors performing multiple parts stand apart from the other adaptations.",A Christmas Carol

Gary Oldman (Bob) and Colin Firth (Fred) are welcomed members of the voice cast, also.I quite like the tone of the film, as well as the design of the animation - which isn't amazing, some parts look like what you'd see in a video game, but it works well to set up the ambience of the London surroundings.There's good music from Alan Silvestri, too.

47,MissSimonetta,A decent adaptation marred by some of the ugliest visuals ever to grace the silver sheet,5,27 December 2020,"On one hand, this is one of the few versions of A CHRISTMAS CAROL that does not shy away from the darker elements of the story. This is, after all, a tale of ghosts, regret, poverty, and social injustices. While there is a place for lighter versions, those who complain about the movie being too dark for their kids are rather missing the point.However, I still have to write this one off as a disappointment. For one thing, it is one of the UGLIEST movies I have ever seen. I've never been fond of the Zemeckis mo-cap movies of the late 2000s: the exaggerated character designs and cartoonish physics look uncanny and gross when combined with photorealistic textures, and rarely moreso than here. I found every character horrible to look at-- which fits with the intentionally scary characters but not with the ones we're supposed to find cute or sympathetic. The film is also marred and dated by the show-offy CG effects obviously intended for the benefit of 3D screenings. I imagine the scenes of Scrooge flying like mad over Victorian London were breathtaking on an IMAX screen or when seen behind 3D glasses, but on a normal home television, they lack that wow factor and just come off as obnoxious padding.I came away from the film more annoyed than anything. It's a shame too, because Jim Carrey is a pretty good Scrooge.",A Christmas Carol
48,NateWatchesCoolMovies,My favourite Christmas movie of all time,10,25 December 2015,"My personal favourite Christmas movie of all time: Robert Zemeckis's triumphant telling of Charles Dicken's timeless 'A Christmas Carol'. I'm not sure if Disney quite knew what they were in for when the handed the reins to Zemeckis, but he's never been one for cutting corners or watering things down in his work (his Beowulf is an hard R rated marvel of filmmaking) and he pulls no punches here, presenting a version that's true to Dicken's book down to,every macabre detail and dense, period authentic line of dialogue. I say all the better, and the silly parents who complained this was too 'dark' for their kiddies: grow a spine, and some balls while you're at it. It's full Dicken's glory given the adrenaline shot of Zemeckis's trademark, visionary motion capture technique to provide visuals so dazzling your eyes will need spotters. The motion capture allows for all kinds of camera tricks not possible with live action, and it's used to full effect, as we swoop, swing and dance along with Scrooge all throughout London on his classic journey. The technique also allows each actor to play multiple roles, and half the fun of the film is spotting various thespians hiding in different roles, often very unlike their real life looks. Jim Carrey works overtime here, playing Scrooge at four different ages and all three of the Christmas ghosts in a tour de force effort. His old Scrooge is the star of the show, a cantankerous old buzzard who's surprisingly spry when it comes to racing around the city in his skivvies like the roadrunner. His Ghost Of Christmas Past is an eerie, flickering candle with Carrey's twinkling visage hidden within, and Ghost Of Christmas Present a booming, ginger tufted Father Christmas, sporting a northern English accent that Carrey is disarmingly deft with. Gary Oldman I known for disappearing into roles, but he's actually the most recognizable here, as a jolly little Bob Cratchit and a terrifying, croaking Jacob Marley. Colin Firth makes pleasantries as Scrooge's kindly nephew, Robin Wright Penn as Ebenezer's old flame, Bob Hoskins as a bouncing Fezziwig and always welcome Cary Elwes as the portly gent. Zemeckis, similarly to what he did with The Polar Express, takes the source and runs with it to places beyond imagining, while never losing the core of what makes the stories so special. At times his Christmas Carol feels like a careening carnival ride, with us thrown right smack in the middle of the action, right at Scrooge's side as he's put through a wringer on the holiest of nights, forced to confront his ways, and tossed along rooftops, soaring over snow dusted English landscapes and making his way through ye olde London at the most magical time of the year. This ones a treasure for me. I've already watched it two times this season and plan on a third. It's just the ultimate Christmas story, given that special dose of movie magic that only Zemeckis can deliver. 🎄🎄Merry Christmas to all my family and friends, may you all have a special time today and in the New Year, and thanks so much for all the support from you in my writing!!

50,aidanratesmovies,"I've always enjoyed Carrey's take on the Grinch, as for Scrooge...not so much",5,4 November 2021,"With outdated creepy animation and subpar voice performances Zemeckis's new take on A Christmas Carol hardly benefits from modern day technology- in fact- it only seems to make it worse. Let's get one thing straight, I don't hate this movie. It can be charming at times, and its ending is delightful- even if it does feel a bit too little in midst of its ghost scenes. The motion capture animation however takes more than a toll on this film as a whole, losing much of the desired heart and empathy a story like this requires- and instead turning it into a lifeless and creepy corpse of a Christmas film that simply does not age very well. The voice performances are also a very mixed bag, which is a shame as I am both a huge fan of Jim Carrey and Gary Oldman who provide a significant amount of the voices throughout the film. Carrey's take on Scrooge seems like a bad impression, and his other voices feel far too forced at times. Oldman's take is a lot more wooden, and very little sticks out about any of his performances throughout the film. I did like the new more authentic take to the horrors throughout the classic story- as it hasn't been expressed on screen like that quite before. The film was entertaining to watch, despite a tedious extra scene or two, and its forced 3D gimmick of course. In the end, it's far from a bad film, but is sadly best remembered for its outdated and incredibly distracting motion capture than the film and heart of it itself. Here's hoping they finally leave this classic story alone.My Rating: 5.2/10.",A Christmas Carol
51,davidmvining,Taking some visual ideas too far undermines a very good telling slightly,7,1 December 2020,"This could have the best of the three motion capture animated films Robert Zemeckis made in the 2000s. It embraces a slightly more cartoonish visual aesthetic that fits best with the animation style, using exaggerated character design really well, as well as a few very good performances, especially from Jim Carrey, but it also contains some of the worst impulses of these movies in that it falls down a rabbit hole of spectacle at the wrong moments. Overall, it's a good, heartfelt film, a very good adaptation of the Charles Dickens' novella, but with an extra dose of control it could have been something great.It's one of the best known stories in the English language, so there's no point in a plot synopsis, so I'll just talk about its strengths and weaknesses. First and foremost is that visual design. Zemeckis signals from the very beginning that he's adhering to the original publication as closely as he can (in certain ways) by showing an etching that greatly resembles an original etching that could have appearing in the 1840s (it's not, in actuality, but it does somewhat resemble the work of John Leech). That etching fades into the actual animation of the dead Marley's face with coins on his eyes, and we quickly see the exaggerated form of Ebenezer Scrooge. With long, protruding nose and chin, Scrooge looks wonderfully distinctive in a way that they could have never made Jim Carrey with makeup or prosthetics. That design extends to all of the characters from the round faced Bob Cratchit, the rotund Fezziwig, the decaying Jacob Marley, and the three Christmas spirits.Another great thing about the film is the performances. When this movie is quiet and focusing on the characters, it can be surprisingly affecting. The best section of the film is the journey with the Ghost of Christmas Past, and that's because it's a delicate and tender dramatization of the events that led to Scrooge becoming the miser that starts the story. The digital performances are subtle, and especially everything that happens in Scrooge's old schoolhouse is pitch perfect. The journey with the Ghost of Christmas Present is also very good, finding a wonderful visual way to get Scrooge around London by turning the room that the Ghost resides in into a transportation with a see-through bottom. I've always wondered at Scrooge's sudden transformation into caring about Bob's family, in particular Tiny Tim, considering the depth of Scrooge's misanthropy at the beginning, but it's still handled well based almost entirely on performance, which seems like a weird thing to assert in a visual effects movie like this, but I think Zemeckis understood this technology more than most people realize.He does descend into nonsensical spectacle at a handful of moments, but Zemeckis seems to understand that this type of animation's core really is performance. It was harder to capture in The Polar Express due to the relatively primitive nature of the technology, but the upgraded tech Zemeckis uses here is top notch. Despite his exaggerated characteristics, Scrooge feels extraordinarily real. As I said, if this movie were smaller and quieter, it could have been the best A Christmas Carol, but it doesn't stay quiet and small. It goes big in some ridiculous ways.So, the Ghost of Christmas Past is the best sequence, but it ends oddly. Angry with what he's seen, he grabs the spirit's extinguisher cap that it had been holding the entire time and douses the flame of the spirit, just as the original story describes and the original etching shows. Fine by this point, but then it goes further, turning the cap into a rocket and sending Scrooge over the rooftops of London and eventually over the clouds to silhouette the moon. It's just too far. And this keeps happening with a good visual idea getting taken too far, but it reaches its ridiculous climax with the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. The entire sequence is nonsense, a chase of the Ghost in a carriage going after Scrooge as he shrinks in size and ends up in pipes and bed curtain rings. Full of weird ideas and spectacle for the sake of spectacle, most likely to make the 3D of the film's original release have at least one extended sequence to pop, it does nothing to serve the story and just goes on and on. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is usually best when he's quiet and foreboding, turning it into a loud chase undermines the very point of his presence in the story.One other intelligent choice that Zemeckis made, though, is of Jim Carrey playing multiple parts, in particular which specific parts he plays. Much like Tom Hanks playing all of the adult male characters in The Polar Express, I think Zemeckis is trying to say something with this choice. There seems to be an underlying idea that the three ghosts are all borne from Scrooge himself by having Carrey play all three. He's most recognizable as the Ghost of Christmas Past (with a curious design choice that makes his face rather solid in a fluid space like a flame that makes the face stand out more), but he does do the motion capture for all three, providing an interesting psychological extension to the story that never really existed before. It's not harped on, but it's definitely an interesting addition.A Christmas Carol represents an intelligent use of a visual aesthetic that received a lot of pushback from audiences. Never realistic enough and always existing in a cartoonier reality than the visuals would seem to imply, this is where the material and the use of the visuals exist most comfortably together. However, this style also allows, and probably encourages, Zemeckis to indulge some of his worst instincts, sacrificing story for interesting visuals that don't add much. As he told the writer who revamped the script to Beowulf, a minute of screen time made this way was always going to cost about a million dollars no matter what they put up, so that mentality seems to have led to Zemeckis using the ability to do things cinematically as clearance to do them narratively. It's only a problem in fits and spurts until a large section at the end, but it's enough to drag the movie down. Considering its heartfelt ending and wonderful performances and overall visual aesthetic, A Christmas Carol is a quality film that is one firm rewrite from being great.",A Christmas Carol
52,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,The same take on Dickens' tale but somewhat darker,8,8 June 2012,"There have been many films based on Charles Dickens' Christmas carol and each one has their own way of telling it. This version is no different story wise (obviously). The only things changed were the visuals and tone. There was nothing I didn't like about this film but there were parts that make me question whether this movie was intended for children.The voice cast to this story is pretty remarkable. Just like how Tom Hanks was able to do multiple voices for The Polar Express (2004), Jim Carrey plays Scrooge and various other characters throughout. Along side Carrey is Carey Elwes, Robin Wright, Bob Hoskins and much more. Surprisingly, the audience will be able to identify which actor/actress is doing the voice for whomever the character they are portraying. I suppose the voice characterizations were not needed to be enhanced. But it's blatantly clear whose speaking for whom. Visually, the film's animation is nothing to scorn at either. Much of the characters, the backgrounds and lighting is accurately spaced, colored and shaded. Perhaps the most colorful spectacle is the transition between the spirits who visit Scrooge during his sleep. But what's extremely odd is how all the animated characters in this movie look like the actors who give them their voice; especially Scrooge! Look closely when he's on screen; Scrooge at the current time, looks like a weathered Jim Carrey and the younger version of Scrooge looks like Carrey as he is now. I'm curious if the animators knew this while making the film.Nevertheless, I am leery about the reactions small children will have if they are given the chance to view this film. Scenes where Marley, Scrooges' partner, pays him a visit from hell, or when the ghost of Christmas present dies, is on the edge of being dark. Marley having a lazy eye, or dislocating his jaw? Ehh...not quite sure what those parts were put in for. Comedy? Or the dying ghost of Christmas present having a maniacal laugh? That kind of stuff could freak out a child. The ghost of Christmas yet to come is always a spooker for kids. I'm surprised Disney went through with it. It's not bad though. I liked the change, but it's not suitable for a child maybe under twelve.Overall Zemeckis' take on Dickens' Christmas carol is visually intriguing and has a great voice cast. All the same, there are some elements in this film that are darker than usual and that's puzzling especially for Disney.",A Christmas Carol
53,Christmas-Reviewer,Nothing New Here Except the 3d,7,17 December 2016,"I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 400 Christmas MOVIES.BEWARE OF BOGUS REVIEWS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW. WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE PRODUCTION. I HAVE NO AGENDA! I AM HONEST!Disney's A Christmas Carol is a 2009 American 3D computer animated motion-capture fantasy film written and directed by Robert Zemeckis. It is an adaptation of the Charles Dickens story of the same name and stars Jim Carrey in a multitude of roles, including Ebenezer Scrooge as a young, middle-aged, and old man, and the three ghosts who haunt Scrooge. The film also features supporting roles done by Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Bob Hoskins, Robin Wright Penn, and Cary Elwes.The film & its visuals and the performances of Carrey and Oldman are great its dark tones will scare smal ones. The 3D film was produced through the process of motion capture, a technique Zemeckis previously used in his films The Polar Express.The film was released in Disney Digital 3-D and IMAX 3-D. The film however is one that has been made too many times. THE 3-D effects aside this version offers nothing new. Since most of us do not have 3-D at home then there is no need in purchasing this film. The Best thing about it was the 3-D and watching this in a theater. If you want a Great Version of the film then I recommend the 1938 MGM Version in which this version closely follows",A Christmas Carol
54,mike48128,Not a True Disney Film? Not for Children!,9,1 December 2010,"Not for any child under 12. I can't say which of the ghosts is scarier but it is a tie between the Grim Reaper Ghost of Christmas Future and Marley's ""Green Goblin"". Disney was only the distributor, and this sure isn't a ""Disney"" film for the whole family. I don't know if Disney had anything to do with the actual production at all? The animation and special effects are amazing, beautiful, and haunting. It looks far better after repeated viewings. A great cast of character actors and fantastic ""motion capture"". At times I forgot it was ""animated"". Mean-spirited, It lacks the humor of the many other, older, versions. Even the old 1951 Alistair Sim version isn't this scary, although certain scenes come close. So many small details of the story are missing. Including an explanation as to why Scrooge disowns his nephew Fred. When Scrooge travels through the sewers it plays like a theme park ride, not a movie. Yes, I realize that it might be, in some cases, closer to the original story, but I don't remember Scrooge shrinking to Lilliputian size or being chased by red-eyed black stallions and a black hearse. ""Ignorance and ""Want"" ""morph"" into a prostitute and a knife-welding ""thug"". That's sick and unnecessary. This should be rated PG-13. The George C. Scott version is far more literary and restrained. So is the excellent Patrick Stewart Version. The other ""non-authentic"" adaptations: Mickey's and The Muppet's Christmas Carol(s) and Albert Finney's Musical ""Scrooge"" are far better-suited for family viewing. I read that parents pulled their (little) kids out of the theater as certain parts of this version scarred them-to-death. Dickens had the uncanny ability to write scenarios very film-like a good hundred years before the medium existed. The Ghost of Christmas Past is very candle-like, just like in the book. Disney Channels run this film more often than anyone else. So, would it be such a crime to edit a few of the more disagreeable scenes out for a special ""children's edition"" making it a bit kinder and gentler? I would buy that on disc, as long as it had both versions!",A Christmas Carol
55,Troy_Campbell,Both children and adults will gain more from this experience than most family films.,8,6 November 2009,"After directing The Polar Express in 2004, Robert Zemeckis vowed to only make 3D movies using motion-capture technology from then on, never to return to traditional live action films again. What? How could he? Moviegoers everywhere were bemused at how the bloke who gave us Forrest Gump, the Back to the Future trilogy, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Contact and Cast Away could settle for some silly 3D business. Perhaps Zemeckis was smarter than us all though, his pledge to developing a decent 3D output coming half a decade earlier than most. It seems he was on to something.It is credit to Zemeckis though that his use of 3D isn't the drawcard for this wonderfully told fable, it purely enhances it. The opening title sequence is one of the most breathtaking of the year, as we soar over - and through - the old Victorian town in which Scrooge inhabits in only one shot. It doesn't end there however, with no less than two more flying scenes and a splendid chase sequence on foot, which capably show what mo-cap and 3D are capable of. One small gripe, as was present with Up, the glasses still make everything darker and subsequently duller; especially as this picture is intentionally not well-lit to begin with.We all know the famous Charles Dickens novel for which this is based on and Zemeckis stays faithfully close to it, unworried about making a family movie that has very few laughs. Let's face it, the story of Scrooge isn't meant to be a light-hearted laughfest. With demonic horses (complete with glaring red eyes), ghosts with broken jaws and men withering away to a skeleton, this is anything but a hoot. But is that a bad thing? Not at all. In fact it is a relief to see a movie for young (but not too young) and old that doesn't shy away from evoking feelings of fear and regret rather than always sugar-coating them with funny moments. If dealt with rightly, emotions like these can be healthy and will have a longer lasting effect on you and your kids than something that only makes you laugh.Providing the voice of Scrooge from childhood to old-age, along with the three Ghosts of Christmas, Carrey does a fine job, even with his normal over-the-top voicing toned down a few hundred decibels. He is barely recognisable in all his parts - a result that I'm sure Zemeckis would have been aiming for - which allows the characters to stand on their own two feet rather than be a typical Carrey product. The experienced supporting cast of Oldman, Hoskins, Firth, Elwes and Wright Penn add a nice level of class to the proceedings.The dark and morose atmosphere might at first shock, but ultimately both children and adults will gain more from this experience than most family films. See it on the big screen.4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",A Christmas Carol

57,Pumpkin_Man,An Awesome Adaptation of a Classic Story!!!,8,17 November 2009,"A Christmas Carol is 166 years old, and it's still going strong. I bet Charles Dickens would be proud. This movie is visually beautiful and has amazing scenery. Jim Carrey does a great job at playing Ebenezer Scrooge, who wants nothing to do with Christmas, forces Bob Cratchit to work on Christmas day, and refuses to go to his nephew's Christmas dinner party. On Christmas Eve, Scrooge is visited by his dead partner, Marley that tells him that he will be visited by 3 ghosts who try to change Scrooge's outlook on Christmas. Christmas Past shows him how Scrooge came to be who he was, Present shows him that his nephew feels sorry for him and that Cratchit's family don't have enough money to afford a meal, and the Future shows him what tragedies will happen unless Scrooge changes his ways. I highly recommend A Christmas CAROL!!!",A Christmas Carol

59,Sirus_the_Virus,"Beaufiful animation, great voice work, great stars, great cast, great story, great movie.",10,28 November 2009,"From what I have seen of Fall 2009, it hasn't been bad. It's actually been pretty damn good. I have seen 2012, a long but worth it film, and I have seen Disney's Christmas carol starring Jim Carrey and directed by Robert Zemeckis. This is Zemeckis' third time using this kind of animation. The third time sure is the charm. Because this is without a doubt, his best one yet. He did The Polar Express in 2004, which I didn't like all that much, he did Beowulf, which was thought was great but scared me, and now he's done Thee Christmas carol. You know, it's know as creepy as Beowulf, but it still freaks you out a bit. In this film, Zemeckis goes for chills. There is a scene when he is getting chased by the Ghost of Christmas future, and there are these horses that have red eyes. There is also a part in which these two children come from out of Christmas present's cloak, turn into an adult size, hover around him, and next thing you know, one of them is in a straight jacket. That creeped me out too.I never saw Polar express in 3-D or Beowulf. But I did see this in 3-D, and it is so good in 3-D. The animation in this film is beautiful, the acting, especially from Jim Carrey is great, and you know what. This film kept a huge smile on my face the entire time. I like Christmas films. This is the best one, I think, since Jim Carrey's Grinch. Man Carrey is the best. I am not going to go into the plot with you. But I might as well tell you who does the voice work. Carrey, my favorite actor, does the voice of Scrooge, and all of the Ghosts. I loved what he did with Scrooge and the ghosts. With each of the ghosts he added a language to them. I think one of them was Irish. I must move on. Gary Oldman does the voice of Bob Cratchit,Jacob Marley and maybe even Tiny Tim. Before I go on, I have to say something. For years, nobody has ever given Jim Carrey any credit. The man deserves it. Like I think this movie deserves a nomination for best animation(cause it is).Robin Wright Penn plays Scrooge's old love Belle. The film doesn't go too into detail with her. Colin Firth plays Scrooges nephew Fred. Bob Hoskins from Roger Rabbit, another film of Zemeckis', stars as Mr. Fezziwig. And that is it.This film has a 56 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. 56 percent of critics liked it? Why world? It's great. Hopefully it will make more bucks around Christmas time because this truly is a great film. I hope it is nominated for something. It's a visual masterpiece that you can't miss out on it. Otherwise, the bitches that don't see it will be real scrooges. This film put such a smile on my face throughout. Filled with laughs, fantastic visuals, laughs, creeps, and the damn holiday spirit, A Christmas carol is the best animated film of the year. It's the best PG rated film of the year. And it's one of my top three favorites of the year.A Christmas carol:****/****",A Christmas Carol

I love the vibrant, warm animation and design. The Polar Express was terrific but this is on another level.Jim Carrey does an unbelievable job voicing Scrooge (young and old), and all three ghosts. The story is left pretty much untouched and adopts a classic, stripped back approach, with emphasis on the story as told by Dickens. It does have a darker tone to it, and some of the ghost scenes may be too frightening for younger viewers, but overall this is a great Christmas family film.",A Christmas Carol

62,Danusha_Goska,Ugly; Squeezes the Magic Out of Dickens,1,7 November 2009,"Robert Zemeckis' ""Christmas Carol"" is a big, bloated, ugly, tone-deaf monster that stomps all the magic out of Dickens' classic. It is nowhere near as good as the two best versions: the black-and-white, 1951, Alistair Sim ""Scrooge,"" or the simple yet amazingly evocative animated, 1962 ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol."" If you've got young children, please don't take them to this movie. There are scenes of ghosts and demons that might frighten a youngster.This is more of a Zemeckis film than a Disney one, or an adaption of Dickens' classic. It's got the same odd cold heart as ""Polar Express"" and the same theme park ride feel of ""Back to the Future."" Bigger is definitely better to this guy, so he gives Scrooge a house with fifty-foot ceilings and a staircase that goes on forever, but never does anything interesting with that bloated staircase and never makes those fifty feet necessary.Dickens' ""Christmas Carol"" is chock full of poignant moments, but those moments never came to life for me in this movie till the final scene where Scrooge carries Tiny Tim on his shoulders. Had this been my only version of ""Christmas Carol,"" I never would have understood the heartbreaking nature of Scrooge's lonely childhood, his broken engagement, or his estrangement from his nephew.Finally, this version is very hard to look at. Scrooge is very, very ugly. You actually have close up views of the cavities in his obviously rotting teeth. His chin and nose are grotesque and his flesh is rendered as sagging, greasy, and full of pores. London is always dark; smoke pours from chimneys; streets are deserted. I didn't believe those lifeless streets. They didn't feel spooky; they just felt conspicuous for the absence of people and street lamps. If Zemeckis really wants to make a film that makes use of darkness, he needs to watch German expressionism and film noir.",A Christmas Carol
63,ajs-10,Disney's take on the classic Dickens Christmas tale I found it sadly disappointing,6,26 November 2011,"I remember this coming out in theatres and deciding I'd wait for it to come on TV. It didn't really appeal to me and anyway it was another vehicle for the 3D 'phenomenon' that I want no part of. So, time passed and it finally arrived on my TV screen and I must say I'm glad I waited. It's very well made and beautiful to look at, but for me, sadly, that's where it ends. A very well known story and so I'll make my summary very brief and to the point before I give you more of my thoughts.Ebenezer Scrooge is a miser, he keeps his money very close to his chest and really doesn't like spending any of it. He treats his only living relative, his nephew Fred, as badly as he treats his clerk, Bob Cratchit. His business partner, Marley, had been dead seven years when he is visited by Marley's ghost. The ghost warns him that if he does not change his ways he will be doomed, like him, to wander eternity in chains. Scrooge is to be visited by three ghosts who will each show him the error of his ways in an effort to make him mend them. Will the miserly Scrooge be swayed by what they show him? Well, the Spoiler Police (Classics Division) have deterred me from revealing the answer here, so I'll end my summary on that cliff-hanger.As I've already said, it's a beautiful film to look at, with some excellent animation, although I did find the picture a tad dark at times (& I wasn't even watching in 3D!). The music was every bit as expected the traditional Carols and classical tunes of the day, fitted the visuals perfectly. Many of the voices of the main characters, and the ghosts (except Marley) were performed by Jim Carrey, who I must say, did an excellent job. Other voices were supplied by; Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Cary Elwes, Robin Wright and Bob Hoskins, amongst others. All did an excellent job also.I guess the clue is in the title DISNEY'S A Christmas Carol and it is very much a Disney film, although I did find the story a lot darker than I expected. My favourite adaptations of this story have always been comedies; films like 'Scrooged' and 'A Muppet Christmas Carol', both of which I have reviewed previously, are far superior (IMO). I guess this adaptation didn't work so well for me because it did stick quite closely to the original novel (with a few twists), and as such it doesn't quite work for a modern audience. It plays very much on Scrooge being in fear of his mortal soul and, for many, I think that is of very little, or no, consequence in modern society. It's still very well made, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it for the very young some of the ghosts are pretty scary. Over all, sadly, not recommended.My score: 5.8/10.IMDb Score: 6.9/10 (based on 22,962 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 53/100 (based on 183 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",A Christmas Carol

Very well animated, dark but also joyful when it was required, this movie tells how not to be in life by flashing the life of an old man through his eyes, in an attempt to make him understand his mistakes and correct his inappropriate attitude. It uses Christmas as the perfect opportunity to tell its story and it does it flawlessly, according to the original story. It's emotional, full of Christmas spirit and has a lot to learn from its plot. A clear recommendation from me, especially during the winter holidays.",A Christmas Carol
65,DarthVoorhees,Dickens' intent is missed completely,5,22 November 2009,"Robert Zemeckis has offered us a visually spectacular film that has no emotion in it whatsoever. 'A Christmas Carol' will no doubt satisfy younger viewers but in the long run it is probably the least faithful adaptation to the story I have seen. It doesn't capture the magic or the moral fable of the Dickens classic.A Christmas Carol has been adapted to death. So much so that we almost loose sight of what the story is about. It is a morality tale about a lonely broken man who over the years isolates himself from all humanity. Christmas isn't merely Christmas, Dickens uses it as an allegory for the best in the human soul. It is a time of year where there is warmth, family, and love things Ebenzer Scoorge never had. The best adaptations of the story must make you pity Scoorge. In the telling and retelling of the story it has become a children's fairy tale. I'd like to see an adaptation not marketed or made based around the assumption that it has to be childish. I think the best adaptation of the story is the Musical which Kelsey Grammar starred in an adaptation of. It doesn't compromise the story and yet it is family oriented. I think when you try to dumb down the story it loses all meaning. Zemeckis has given us one of the silliest and childish Christmas Carols ever. The Muppets did it better.Part of why I think the film misses it's target is Jim Carrey. Even in the computer fashion he gives his most over the top performance. Scoorge is a cartoon Shrek like character here. He is silly even in the beginning of the film. Carrey plays Scoorge as a clown. You can't have a story about a man finding his soul, if the man is a clown.On the other hand technically the film is a wonder. Zemeckis has a brilliant imagination. The 3-D effects are brilliantly incorporated and they for the most part don't take away from the story. There are times though when the staging is off. Scoorge flying around like Superman is unnecessary. I think overall the film is much better at being a showcase for 3-D computer animation than it is at being a general film. Zemeckis ought to try making an original story in this format. Beowulf didn't translate well and neither does Christmas Carol. Scoorge isn't meant to shrink.",A Christmas Carol
66,Likes_Ninjas90,"A wonderful tribute to Dickens' story, visualising the classic tale with artistic flair and sustaining the narrative with smart writing too",8,17 November 2009,"A Christmas Carol is a retelling of the classic story by Charles Dickens, focussing on Ebenezer Scrooge, a grumpy old man who has stopped believing in Christmas because of his bitterness to the world. He is entirely unsympathetic to the poor and needy, especially his own workers, such as Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldmen) who is trying to feed his family, including his crippled son Tiny Tim. Scrooge is also neglectful to his own family, such as his nephew Fred (Colin Firth). Yet on Christmas Eve, Scrooge returns home and is met by the ghost of his former business partner Marley. He is warned that three spirits will soon come to him and that very evening they do. The first is the Ghost of Christmas Past, the second the Ghost of Christmas Present and the third the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. Each ghost serves to show Scrooge where his life went wrong and what will come if he does not change his ways.The screening I attended for A Christmas Carol in 3D was initially not a happy one. Despite being Hoyt's discount day, the price to see this film in 3D was twenty dollars. I was also told to keep my glasses because the cinema was going to also start charging for the glasses in the future. How often entire families are going to see films in 3D with these outrageous prices is highly doubtful. Furthermore, the screening, which did not include any previews, was late to start by twenty-five minutes. In spite of these misgivings, A Christmas Carol (3D) is a surprisingly uplifting and faithful adaptation, gloriously shot with motion capture technology. The 3D visuals in this film are just a delight to witness and become a part of. They are so rich and vividly immediate in bursting off the screening that you could almost reach out and touch the snowflakes as they fall towards you. Sweeping shots across snowbound London and close-ups of outstretched hands that come towards you have been deliberately placed to show off the sheer depth and range of the visual aesthetics. It is such a shame that these 3D films are so expensive because it is a delightful and beautiful experience to be immersed into.Yet this is not just a visual treat as director Robert Zemeckis and Disney have opted to remain true to the essence of the dark themes of Dickens' story. Questions of poverty and the working class of London have not been glossed over, as much of the dialogue of the original tale has been kept intact, allowing Scrooge to be characterised as a man who has lost faith in the world and sees no reason for celebration because of the poverty and the overcrowding in the city. When he is told that the poor cannot go to the prisons and union workhouses and would rather die, he responds by saying: ""they had better do it quickly and decrease the surplus population"". The maturity of dialogue such as this is surprising for a Disney Christmas film, but a welcome addition all the same. At times though, the film seems almost too dark, specifically with the design of some of the supernatural elements. The wait for Marley's ghost is a slow, intense one, but his appearance is even scarier, particularly when he has to realign his own jaw. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come – who looks exactly like the shadow of the Grim Reaper – and has control of a possessed horse and carriage, is also a very scary inclusion. This film might not be entirely suitable for very small children.In contrast with these supernatural elements though, there are a number of poignant scenes that are surprisingly touching. The most emotional of these being when Scrooge overlooks his younger self and sees the time he met his first love at a dance, and also the decline of the crippled boy, Tiny Tim. These somber scenes ensure that the final moments, when Scrooge attitude changes, are rewarding with their warmth and humour. It is up until these last scenes in the film that Jim Carrey, who plays eight characters in the film, including the three ghosts, could almost be called restrained as Scrooge. His trademark wacky mannerisms are kept to a minimum, with more attention applied to his harsh creaking voice and more subtle movements. The amount of time spent capturing the slight gestures of Scrooge would have been painstaking. After the disastrously predictable Yes Man, this is a performance that Carrey can be really proud of.To say that the last decent Christmas film was Bad Santa back in 2003 is an indication of the lack of quality in these pictures in recent year. Fortunately, A Christmas Carol (3D), though very dark at times, is a wonderful tribute to Dickens' story, visualising the classic tale with artistic flair and sustaining the narrative with smart writing too. Hopefully cinemas like Hoyts, who are the real Scrooges at the moment, will come to their senses though and realise that this breathtaking technology will never last with such absurd prices. It would a real shame if films, as visually magnificent as this, were never viewed in 3D because they were too expensive for families to afford.",A Christmas Carol

68,griffolyon12,"An Eerie Ghost Story, but far from a Sentimental Work",7,7 November 2009,"Disney's A Christmas Carol is a solid adaptation of the Charles Dickens' work, it just lacks the emotional connection inherent in some of the previous cinematic iterations of this timeless story.The story of the film is the traditional story of Ebenezer Scrooge, the grouchy old penny-pincher who is in turn visited by the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come in order to turn his life around in the right way.In this film, the legendary role of Scrooge is played by Jim Carrey (where as he also plays the Ghosts of Christmas Past and Present). I was a touch disappointed with Carrey's performance. With this being an animated film, I was expecting his portrayal to be a little more over-the-top, more scenery-chewing, but alas it was actually a very restrained performance from Carrey, and were this a live-action adaptation, he would have hit the nail right on the head.The film was directed by Robert Zemeckis, who here continues to try and refine his favored medium of production, animated motion capture. Disney's A Christmas Carol is a vast improvement over his previous mo-cap works, The Polar Express and Beowulf, but it still doesn't manage to look as good as live-action, nor as polished as other CG-animated product; though I will say that there were certain shots where the lighting was so well designed that I was fooled momentarily thinking that some of the characters on screen were real.I saw this film in 3-D, the first time I've ever seen a full feature length movie in 3-D, and I came away impressed with certain aspects, while a touch frustrated with others. A simple dolly shot in 3-D looked marvelous, it was beautiful and really engrossed me into this world, as well the depth of field in a simple shot where two characters are in frame is astounding, but then whenever they did a shot of someone's hand flying out toward the audience or something, that immersiveness disappeared.Zemeckis has definitely made a visually intriguing film, a highly original take on this classic story, while also being faithful to the source, and there are many good times to be had within. I think the best way to sum up Disney's A Christmas Carol is that it's more flash and not enough substance. The film seems to be more interested in being a whiz-bang extravaganza of impressive visuals than of creating emotional connection with the characters. It's just, whenever a sequence begins to get really intriguing emotionally, it pulls away into another crazy storm of visual pizazz.As a whole, Disney's A Christmas Carol is a good time at the movies, though it's less of a sentimental work and more of a high octane ghost story, more interested in entertainment than anything else, but there in again, isn't that why we go to the movies in the first place? I give Disney's A Christmas Carol a 7 out of 10!",A Christmas Carol
69,Imdbidia,Wasted attempt to revive the old story,6,6 May 2011,"A Christmas Carol is Robert Zemeckis' 3D adaptation of Dickens' eponymous classic novel.With stories as well known as this, which have been adapted so many times for the big and small screen, any director faces the challenge to offer something that is new and attractive, still capturing the message and spirit of the novel. Zemeckis really has made an effort trying to revive the book story, adding some elements that are in the novel and are not usually shown in other adaptations: the depiction of the spirit of the present Christmas, the persecution of the black carriage, and the ""trip"" on the bullet over the city among others. The eagle views of the city are extremely painterly, realistic and beautiful. The attention to the details of the daily life of the characters, especially of the street life and inner door of the working class are great, too, and they give an idea of what real life was in 19th-century England. The animation is very realistic, created by using ""mocap"" a 3D computerized filming technique in which the actors voice, movement and facial expression serve as a basis for those of the animated characters.Jim Carrey plays Ebenezer mean Scrooge and the three spirits of Christmas. Gary Oldman is the good-hearted but poor clerk Bob Cratchit and Scrooge's former business partner. Robin Wright Penn plays young Scrooge's fiancée, Colin Firth plays Scrooge's nephew, while Fred Cary Elwes, Bob Hoskins, Ron Bottitta and other supporting actors give their voices and physique to multiple secondary characters Despite the all-star cast, the movie does not work as an ensemble and there is something indescribable missing from it. The fact that we see the actors quite realistically reflected in the faces of the animated characters leaves little to the imagination of the animators and of the animation lovers, as it does not create enough detachment between the actors and the character they play. If that was the aim, filming a non-animation movie would have been more appropriate. On the other hand, Carrey is not especially inspired in this performance, and we see the more sardonic mime-ish Carrey instead of the good serious dramatic actor he can be; I did not see Scrooge anywhere in this movie, but Jim Carrey's caricature of the character. The rest of the cast is OK in their respective performances, and only Gary Oldman shines in his sweet portray of Scrooge's clerk.At another level, the tone of the movie is far from being Christmassy or dramatic as it is action packed, with the most important dramatic moments of the story just sketched and the action ones delightfully focused on. By doing so we lose the most important thing of Dickens' novel - its soul.The movie is likable, but never memorable, and will not move or touch anybody. To do so, the stunning visual animation should have been paired with a more dramatic touch, with a little bit of Christmas magic, which is not the case.A wasted attempt to revive the magic story of Dickens' novel, still enjoyable",A Christmas Carol

71,meydiana-65242,Fine Interpretation for Adults: Not for Children!,10,30 October 2020,"What would Christmas be without a visit to Charles Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol', a story that dates back to 1843 and has been loved and read every year at this time? There have been other films, stage productions, musicals, and family readings galore and it still holds the magic of what the spirit of Christmas is all about. Doubtless there will be flocks of naysayers who don't buy into this adaptation by Robert Zemekis, but given the ghost story magic Dickens' created, this film takes it one step further and makes the ghostly three spirits very much alive and beautiful fanciful.Combining the actors with animation (animating the actors might be a better way of describing the magic) makes each of the many very well known actors who portray the characters that much more credible. Jim Carrey is at his peak as an actor in his ability to become the illusions his mind creates: he portrays all three ghosts as well a Scrooge at every level of his history. Other actors who are transformed by Zemekis and staff include Gary Oldman as the trio of Cratchit, Marley's Ghost, and Tiny Tim, Colin Firth as the jovial nephew, Cary Elwes, Robin Wright Penn, Bob Hoskins, Fionnula Flanagan and a host of others. The costumes and scenery are brilliantly executed.One problem with the film that may require parental judgment is the fact that the ghosts are truly scary and children might not be able to get past the fear they instill. But they will grow into the film as it is likely a work that will be resurrected every Christmas season as a tradition. It is 'excellent, my good fellows'.",A Christmas Carol
72,Shattered_Wake,A creepy & visually stunning version of the Dickens classic,7,22 November 2010,"Robert Zemeckis, director of such classics as the 'Back to the Future' trilogy and 'Forrest Gump,' turns his talents once more towards animated Christmas magic after his success with the Tom Hanks-driven 'Polar Express.' This time, Zemeckis brings along a stellar cast for his motion-capture version of Charles Dickens's 'A Christmas Carol.' While there have been over a hundred adaptations of this ultimate Christmas tale, the story never gets old nor does its importance ever wear away.We all know the story like the back of our hand: Ebenezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) is a miserly old coot with a cold heart and a tight grasp on his money bag. Even with the warmth of those around him, including his worker Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldman) and cousin Fred (Colin Firth), Scrooge never allows his frozen soul to ever be thawed. Trying to heal Scrooge's wicked ways, Jacob Marley (Oldman again), his long-dead business partner, returns from the grave to warn Ebenezer of his certain other-worldly fate. To save himself from an eternity of torment, Scrooge must change his ways with the help of three other ghostly presences (all played by Carrey).Through dozens & dozens of adaptations with at least one new version each year, it seemed that 'A Christmas Carol' can't have much more life in it. However, there always seems to be something new to come along that calls for another. From the Muppets to Barbie to Bill Murray, it's almost as if everyone's had a go at the Dickens classic. This time, Disney expands the scope into a wide-ranging epic 3D adventure of sorts, something I would not have expected out of this story. Funnyman Jim Carrey was nabbed to play a dozen or so roles, and pulls of the majority of them fairly well (though, I wasn't a big fan of his rendition of the Ghost of Christmas Past). The story itself, as it is in most versions, is left essentially untouched. This is always for the best as an altered version of 'A Christmas Carol' rarely works well (other than 'Scrooged,' which is one of the best adaptations one will find). The big difference, clearly, from most versions comes from Zemeckis's direction. Adding his always-fun visual flair to the film, it is a joy to look at. The visual 3D effects are stunning, even though a bit too much time was spent showing off the special effects.One important aspect of the film that should be realized comes from the appearance, behaviour, and general terrifying style of the spirits. From Jacob Marley all the way through (and especially concerning) the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, the spirits are genuinely a scary bunch. Even as an adult with the deepest love for the horror genre, I was actually creeped out quite a few times throughout the film as Scrooge met his ghostly guides. Therefore, if children are present to watch what is supposed to be a family film, just be aware that there are several times where they most likely will be scared.Overall, Robert Zemeckis has created a visual stunning version of Charles Dickens's beloved tale. The special effects are a joy to watch, though they are treated as the centerpiece of the film instead of a companion to the story. However, due to the dark mood & scary spirits, do not think this as a family film in the style of 'The Muppets Christmas Carol.' Final Verdict: 7/10.-AP3-",A Christmas Carol
73,moviemanMA,Eye candy and not much more,6,13 December 2009,"Zemeckis has transformed Charles Dicken's classic tale A Christmas Carol into a 3D animated motion picture with eye popping animation and over the top 3D effects. It stars Jim Carrey as the old miser Ebenezer Scrooge. He also plays the three ghosts that haunt him (Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future). He is accompanied by Gary Oldman, doubling as Bob Cratchit and the ghost of Jacob Marley, and a few appearances by Colin Firth, Bob Hoskins (who starred in Roger Rabbit), Robin Wright Penn (who played Jenny in Zemeckis' Forrest Gump),and Cary Ewles.I won't go into the story very much as I am sure most people are familiar with this story, but here's a little refresher. We follow Scrooge on Christmas Eve, seven years after his counting house partner Jacob Marley has passed away. He is visited by his ghost who warns him of the awful afterlife that awaits him. He is visited by three spirits who show Scrooge the true meaning of Christmas and what he needs to do in order to turn his life around.Ever since I was a little kid I have always been a fan of this story and in particular the made for TV version starring George C. Scott, the version I recommend to all those in search of a good version of the story. Although Zemeckis' take on this story is visually impressive quite the spectacle, that is all it really is. Were it not for the 3D animation, which sometimes is laid on a bit too thick, this film would not be very impressive.I felt that there was too much emphasis placed on the ugliness of Scrooge. He doesn't have to be handsome, but I think Zemeckis went above and beyond to make him look as appalling as possible. It was distracting looking at the little hairs on his nose and other grotesque features, especially seeing it on a humongous IMAX screen.With so much emphasis placed on Scrooge, I thought details on other characters were not paid enough attention to like Scrooge's nephew Fred, who I thought went cross-eyed a few times, along with other characters (for a minute I thought Tiny Tim was blind). Still, with all of these issues that animation really isn't that bad and 3D does make for a fun viewing experience.Seeing as this is a Disney film, I feel like I should warn those taking small children to this movie. There are several instances that are too intense and downright scary for some young ones. There are moments with Marley that might be too intense as well as with the Ghost of Christmas Present and Future. I can see why some of these things were put in, but they don't contribute much if anything to to story.Story aside, the real spectacle here is the 3D animation. I was impressed with the way Zemeckis used it to create depth and the feeling like we are really on the streets of London, and in some cases flying through them, but sometimes I felt like I was on a ride. I wanted more focus on the story and the acting. I was let down by some of Carrey's work with the ghosts, especially Christmas Past. I know it shows the versatility of Carrey's ability to act, but I thought this character was too much and distracted from what was going on in the movie.Overall, I wasn't very impressed. I thought the cheap thrills of 3D were used to the max and taken advantage of. I still think that Disney and Pixar's Up has utilized the potential of 3D to the fullest and other directors should take note of it (Coraline comes in second place). There are some scenes that just don't fit with the rest of the story and I could never concentrate for too long without being distracted of bothered by the visuals. It's still a somewhat pleasurable experience and for those looking for an entertaining movie, this will probably do the trick.If you really want to get the most out of this movie, see it in IMAX. It's the best way.",A Christmas Carol

75,trimmerb1234,3D spectacular remaining fairly true to the book,7,23 December 2013,"I have a number of versions of A Christmas Carol starting with a British one from 1935 featuring the actor Seymour Hicks who had spent a lifetime portraying Scrooge on stage. Also the Alastair Sim 1951 and George C Scott versions. None are perfect although each contains at least one thing better than any of the others. All had rather variable casting. Seymour Hicks was certainly the frostiest Scrooge. The Alastair Sim version was let down by a plump Bob Cratchit - who (very suspiciously) looked far too well fed for his 15 shillings per week. The most affecting Tiny Tim by far was in the George C Scott version but Ma and Pa Crachit showed not the least sign of lifetimes worn down by druggery and minimal wages. Nobody since this 1935 version seems to have portrayed the Cratchits as quite poor, destroying a central part of the story that Tiny Tim becomes ill and dies because of his parents' poverty (the thing Scrooge later puts right).This version - following a Disney tradition at least 60 years old, is excessively scary for young children, quite unnecessarily terrifying at times. Its main distinguishing feature is that it was designed to be a 3D spectacular and I am sure it fully succeeds in this. The advanced graphics available in 2009 and imagination came up with some impressive spirits as well as Marley's ghost - the best I have seen. Acting is never good with animation. Given that the budget was $200,000,000 I wonder if they might have spent more of it on live actors rather than motion capture animation (Jim Carey looked, sounded and performed exactly as he had in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events).In watching all these screen version it is clear that there is only one perfect thing - the book itself. It continues to wait for a director with the brains to fully appreciate and respect the book. Oliver Twist got this with David Lean. As the temptation to modernise and soften the book grows, understanding of the Victorian period fades and technology takes over from talent, the best film versions of A Christmas Carol will most likely to be these in the past. For timeless perfection, the book fortunately remains",A Christmas Carol

Now, a month and a half before Christmas, the Robert Zemeckis directed version is out in theaters. The only thing I can say after seeing this is ""How?."" I suppose I should have been ready for this version to be jam packed with special effects since every movie is now, but the special effects seemed to have ruined the timelessness of the story. I will admit, although it is an animated performance, Carrey does do an excellent job, and the film does have its moments, but the film ruins what is on of the most classic tales of all time. Some of the characters look almost sickeningly creepy, and kids will be scared by it. The film does not show more than a couple of drops of Christmas spirit, and it wonders aimlessly from special effect to special effect, without any real plot or story or anything. Zemeckis and Carrey are both talented guys, and they both have made some very good films, but A Christmas Carol is not one of them for either.

Disney's Mickey's Christmas Carol with Scrooge McDuck, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck was a better joy than this. There were many times when it was so dark I couldn't see what was going on.

81,Ryan_MYeah,MYeah's review: Disney's A Christmas Carol,7,17 November 2010,"The film stars Jim Carrey as Ebenezer Scrooge, a ruthless, and cold hearted money grubbing businessman. He's unfairly cruel to his employee, Bob Cratchit (Played by Gary Oldman), and is neglectful, and hateful towards his only living relative, Fred (Played by Colin Firth). One Christmas Eve, he gets the shock of his life when he is encountered by the ghost of former business partner, Jacob Marley (Also played by Gary Oldman). He tells Scrooge that he will be visited by three spirits (Jim Carrey as the Klumps of Christmas spirits), who will use their power to show Scrooge all his wrongdoings, as well as possibly save him from a damning fate.The movie hardly gets any points for being anything we haven't already seen in hundreds of adaptations of the classic story by Charles Dickens, but it does get points for being one of the darkest in tone and presentation. Robert Zemeckis's style of motion control animation, previously used in The Polar Express and Beowulf, is put to good use here. The film is at times light hearted, but never compromises its abilities to hold a consistent tone, and bring out its full dark nature. I know *I* got chilled something awful from a particular scene involving the Ghost of Christmas Present.Jim Carrey does a fine job as Ebenezer Scrooge, balancing out the hatred, and eventual sympathy we feel for the character, although, his accents as the ghosts of Past and Present are somewhat inconsistent. Gary Oldman is put to good use as both Bob Cratchit, and Jacob Marley as well as Tiny Tim (Must I really explain?). This method of using one actor play multiple parts over time does feel a bit distracting, but for the most part, it's not so bad.The film at the very least is a pure visual spectacle, and the visual effects artists clearly put their hearts into creating the lovely environments. Robert Presley's cinematography is lovely as well, particularly in a technically impressive ten minute long take through Scrooge's past. Randy Thom, as always, provides proficient sound design, and a great mix, and Alan Silvestri delivers his most thoughtful score since Van Helsing and The Polar Express, occasionally paying delightful homage to classic Christmas tunes such as ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Hark! The Herald Angels Sing"".I don't quite think it's a good movie, but it's highly enjoyable, visually pleasing, and (for the most part) true to its source material, so in all honesty, it's ALMOST a good movie. And if you're in the right mood for Christmas (As I am right now), then I highly recommend it.I give A Christmas Carol a strong **1/2 out of ***",A Christmas Carol
82,D_Burke,"Great Movie! Ranks Among the Best ""Christmas Carol"" Movie Adaptations",9,4 December 2009,"Everyone has their favorite cinematic version of ""A Christmas Carol"". Many critics who reviewed this movie said that their favorite version still remains the 1951 version starring Alastair Sim. My personal favorite is ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" with Michael Caine as Scrooge, not only because of Caine's performance but also because the Muppet team stayed very true to the original story.The point is, if you've seen more than one ""Christmas Carol"" (and there are dozens) you probably have a favorite whose ranking can't be replaced by this most recent remake. That said, this adaptation is perhaps the most true to the book, details London more vividly than any previous retelling, and will eventually rank among the Top 5 versions in a few years.This is Robert Zemekis's third 100% CGI-animated film (after 2004's ""The Polar Express"" and 2007's ""Beowulf""), and the first where the animation feels necessary. Not only are the 3D effects from the snow that falls to the ghosts that float around amazing, but the scenery, perhaps for the first time, goes beyond Scrooge's front steps. As the opening credits roll, I was amazed how the animation remade 1842 London so vividly, stretching far from Buckingham Palace to local butcher shops before settling at the front door of ""Scrooge and Marley"".Some scenes are indeed scary. Showing the dead body of Jacob Marley in the beginning was unusual, but ultimately told a lot about Scrooge's character that reached beyond his being stingy. From the first scene, Jim Carrey disappears into the role of Ebenezer Scrooge and never pops back out again in surprise. I expected him to ham the role up a little, making winks and nods to the audience as he had done in previous comedies. However, to Carrey's credit, he takes this traditional role just as seriously as he did when he played Andy Kaufmann in ""Man on the Moon"". His role is convincing, but still fun in a strange way.The unusual aspect of this film is that many of the actors played multiple roles. Carrey, for one, played Scrooge in addition to The Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet To Come (despite the fact that the latter ghost has no lines, the role is still credited to Carrey anyway. Go figure). Carrey was unrecognizable as the GOC Present, and far more obvious as the GOC Past. I was a little let down by his GOC Past, as he whispered most of his lines, making them very hard to hear. The fact that the GOC Past was more obviously him also took me out of the movie for a bit. I liked the ghost's design, and the scene where Scrooge tries to extinguish him with his cap is a great touch. I sort of wish that particular ghost was played by someone else, though.Even stranger, though, was Gary Oldman playing Bob Crachit, the ghost of Jacob Marley, and Tiny Tim (!!!). I'm not sure what the casting director was intending with these same actors playing drastically different characters. I mean, Charlton Heston played Moses and the voice of God in ""The Ten Commandments"", but that made more sense because it combined God's word with Moses's inner voice letting him know what his calling was. The same thing can be said for all Scrooge's ghosts, but why was a grown man the voice of Tiny Tim? What was the point? Well, those are just minor grievances, and you'll see that I rated this movie with 9 out of 10 stars. If I let casting choices bring this film down for me, I would completely miss the point of this film. The truth is, I rarely see movies twice in theaters, but this movie I felt compelled to see again. I'm glad I did, too, because it's a very fun and enjoyable movie experience. It's worth seeing at least once with 3D glasses, too. Above all, Jim Carrey was fantastic in it all the way through, the special effects and animation added to the story rather than being a distraction, and it deserves extra props for staying mostly true to Charles Dickens' original story.And yes, there has been some controversy with the scary images in the film. The ghost of Jacob Marley (and his corpse for that matter) are by no means G-rated images, so yes, parents should be warned before taking their kids. By no means, however, should a few scary parts keep kids out of this movie. There were scary parts in ""The NeverEnding Story"", and that still remains a timeless classic. This one will too, and it may be one of the first films fit for BluRay that tells a great story. I highly recommend this version of ""A Christmas Carol"". ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" still tops my list, but this adaptation will prove a worthy adversary in the years to come.",A Christmas Carol
83,Stompgal_87,A morbid yet realistic animated adaptation of the Dickens classic,8,20 December 2013,"I saw this film in 3D at the cinema four years ago with yet another member of support staff from my former care home. While I especially liked the snowfall effect in 3D, Scrooge shouting, ""Good afternoon!"" made me jump right out of my seat because it was very loud and sudden, thus making it a major sensory issue for me as part of my Asperger syndrome. When I re-watched this today, I still jumped but it was less of a problem because the sound on my iPad wasn't as loud as that in the cinema. The support worker I was with during my first viewing jumped even more, especially when the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come was riding his cart pulled by evil-looking horses. Also when watching this for the second time, I spotted some similarities to 'The Muppet Christmas Carol' and an abridged version of the original novel. I enjoyed it for the most part but it does have some unnecessary filler (unless it was featured in the original story) such as the GoCYtC riding his horse-drawn cart. Besides the filler, there are some scenes that young children may find scary and others that looked too dark in terms of shading.Other than the negatives, this film has many positive aspects such as the characters, props and backgrounds being realistically designed in a similar manner to those in 'The Polar Express', the smooth and convincing character animation, the stunning special effects (in particular the 3D snowfall and the glowing effect on Jacob Marley's ghost), the instrumental arrangements of 'Deck the Halls' and 'Good King Wenceslas,' the script being close to the text of the abridged version of the story that is part of an anthology called 'Illustrated Stories for Christmas' published by Usborne and some fantastic flythroughs, particularly those including the Tower of London and St. Paul's Cathedral, the one where people on the street sell things such as wreaths and chestnuts and the Ghost of Christmas Past flying Scrooge through a series of wintry trees. Further to the character designs, Scrooge here had some Jim Carrey in him and the ghosts were intriguingly designed - I especially liked the Ghost of Christmas Past bearing resemblance to a candle and his many face changes prior to Scrooge putting him out and the snuffer launching him in the air like a rocket were funny. The Ghost of Christmas Present looked very much like the one in 'The Muppet Christmas Carol' (particularly when his beard turns grey) and the one in Alan Marks's illustrations in the Usborne book. The demise of the Ghost of Christmas Present was one of the film's creepiest parts when he is still laughing as a skeleton while the rest of his body turns to dust. The scene of the Cratchits learning of Tiny Tim's passing in the GoCYtC's (who looks true to the version in 'Mickey's Christmas Carol' and in Marks's illustration) vision is the most poignant depiction of the heartbreaking moment since the one shown in 'Mickey's Christmas Carol.' I must admit I did find the camera zoom from Fred's house during Christmas dinner confusing because I thought this was the end but it wasn't. The ending itself was a tad rushed and I would like to have seen more of the Cratchits during this part as per the Mickey Mouse version.Overall this is the most morbid version of all Christmas Carol-based films I have seen but it has the most impressive and realistic animation style of them all. 8/10.",A Christmas Carol
84,gregeichelberger,"Classic story, intense animation save film from 'Bah, humbug' list",5,15 February 2010,"There have been more film (and television) versions of Charles Dickens' immortal Holiday classic, ""A Christmas Carol,"" than almost any other book ever written (remember the ""Rosanne"" and ""Sanford & Son"" episodes?).But, then again, why not? It's a timeless story with ghosts, love interests, family, pathos, hate and joy, all wrapped around the yuletide spirit.Now Disney Studios has jumped into the fray with the newest release of a frenetic CGI version employing the vocal talents of Jim Carey (who last did this kind of work in the fun ""Horton Hears a Who"") and Gary ""JFK"" Oldman, among others.Carey voices several characters, including the evil Ebenezer Scrooge, the bane of all London in the 1840s. Scrooge is such a tightwad he'd steal flies from a blind spider.He also abuses everyone from his nephew, Fred, to his clerk, Bob Cratchett (Oldman, looking more like a cross between Clint Howard and Ralph Waldo Emerson), and even strangers on the street. Why anyone TAKES this kind of abuse I'll never know, but that's Dickens' business, I suppose.One day, however, he is visited by the ghost of his late partner, Jacob Marley, who informs him - just like the book - that he will be visited by three spirits over the next three nights. Most versions compact the visits into just one evening.The first apparition is a creepy candlestick-like thing that shows Scrooge his past association with the holiday - how much he enjoyed, appreciated it and celebrated it. The next ghost, the Spirit of Christmas Present (also voiced by Carey), takes him to see his nephew and the Cratchett family, complete with all the kids, including a crippled but happy Tiny Tim.Once sufficiently humbled - but not quite ready to convert just yet - Scrooge is visited by a third ghost, the Grim Reaper-like Spirit of Christmas Future. It's this last sequence that departs from the many other versions, as we see Ebenezer chased by evil spirits, zombies and demonic horses.He is also shrunk down to the size of a rat (for SOME unknown reason) and threatened with a premature burial and cremation, all before coming to his senses and embracing the season.Once he does, he runs around like a kid proclaiming his love for the holiday. He's a changed man and turns around his life and reputation. It's a wonderful story and one you can enjoy in many editions. For my money, though, I still prefer the 1951 Alister Sim version, as well the 1938 MGM film.This one is not bad, however, and I give Disney kudos for employing some decent CGI (especially the scenes showing the streets of Victorian London), seamless 3D technology and sticking to the book as closely as it does.Parents be warned, though, that some of the scenes are very intense and as such, caution should be used in bringing children under 10.",A Christmas Carol
85,robert-710-767167,What I go to see of it was great,7,24 December 2010,"This is a unique review, because unlike my other reviews, this one is based on a bad DVD. By that, I mean, the DVD would freeze every 2-7 minutes so I had to skit a good 5 minutes worth of the movie in total. Thus, I cannot properly rate the movie, but I will because I watched it.This movie is based on the classic book, and seems to do well. There is apparently 3d special effects in the 3D version but I ended up watching it on my computer, so the special effects were not there. So this is pretty much based on the story.I really liked the way they presented the movie, which of course was just like how the story goes. I suppose there were a few jumping moments, but overall I really liked it. I rate it 7 because of the bad DVD and the inability to see it in 3D.",A Christmas Carol
86,RichardSRussell-1,Skynet Wins! Technology Trumps Humanity,4,23 November 2009,"A Christmas Carol (Imax, 3-D, 1:36, PG) — Fantasy: Supernatural, biggie, remake, OSIT romanticsThere's a Hollywood story about how Dustin Hoffman, on the set of the movie Marathon Man, was suffering thru his method-acting efforts to get into the proper mindset for his tormented character when his co-star Sir Laurence Olivier — a guy who'd never lacked encomiums in the performance department — inquired ""My dear boy, why don't you just try acting?"".The same question springs to mind upon seeing Robert Zemeckis's Imax 3-D efforts: The Polar Express (2004, into which he lured Tom Hanks, the in persona propria star of his 2000 film Cast Away), Beowulf (2007), and now the umpteenth remake of Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol.Here it's Jim Carrey who gets the Tom Hanks / Peter Sellers treatment, playing multiple roles thru the dubious ""miracle"" of motion-capture CGI. But why?Surely we learned from the Oscar awarded to the make-up crew that worked its magic on Brad Pitt in Benjamin Button that all the electronic gimmickry isn't really necessary. Indeed, as Roger Ebert has described it, all these efforts to get close to looking like a real human but not quite making it lead the viewer into the ""uncanny valley"" where you're just creeped out by this obviously fake simulacrum of real life.The story is familiar to everyone over the age of 4: Skinflint Ebenezer Scrooge thinks of Xmas as ""humbug"" until he's visited on Xmas Eve by the ghost of his late business partner, Jacob Marley, and thereafter by the spirits of Xmas Past, Present, and Yet To Come, the combined impact of which produces a 180° attitude adjustment in the old miser.But the basic story, despite being a time-tested classic, obviously wasn't sufficient for Zemeckis, who has to take us swooping, barrelling, and skidding thru the streets and over the rooftops of 19th Century London (at one point arrowing thru a wreath), repeatedly tumbling Scrooge ass over teakettle during the course of the spirits' revelations. This has the unsettling effect of breeding sympathy for the old goat while not demonstrating in the slightest why the warm milk of human-kindness should have started flowing in his withered veins. He ends up seeming like a torture victim who'll say anything to get it to stop.Was it worth extra to see it in Imax 3-D? Nope. In fact, in my case it was worth less. That's because the theater decided to use every one of its available 12,000 watts of sound. Obviously, that's the fault of the venue, not the film itself, but this isn't the kind of problem you'll encounter in a regular theater.I know we're supposed to be charitable during the holiday season and overlook shortcomings like these, but I've been inoculated by Tom Flynn's book The Trouble with Christmas (Prometheus, 1993). In it, Flynn observes that all of the supposedly timeless Xmas traditions that ""everybody"" knows and lives by were either (a) stolen from earlier non-Xian traditions or (b) largely invented out of whole cloth relatively recently by what he calls the DWAMQs — dead white Anglophone males and a queen — those being Victoria, Washington Irving, Clement C. Moore, Francis Church, Thomas Nast, and of course Dickens. He notes that neither Scrooge, Dickens, nor anyone in his readership thot it unusual that Scrooge could find an idle boy to send to buy a turkey early Xmas morning, nor that the store would be open for business. All of the soft, warm, nostalgic glow that's supposed to surround the holiday was retrofitted later.Of course, if you buy into all the schmaltz, half of Zemeckis's work is already done before the 1st firework has gone off over the Magic Kingdom, and thus I list the movie as being of special interest to romantics. If, however, you're looking for a human-compatible retelling of a good story, you'll probably be disappointed.",A Christmas Carol
87,thekyles99,I'm almost positive that this is the version Dicken's himself would want you to see!!!,10,4 December 2010,"I finally sat down to view this latest adaptation of the Dicken's Christmas classic tale. I'll start by saying that, nothing against what i call the ultimate version and the version being the 1951 version starring Alastair Sim however they didn't have the technology that incorporates all the Cgi themed movies these days back then. And this tale requires it to plant the full impact of the punch! I was totally blown away by this version that has Jim Carrey providing the voice work this time 'round for cranky Ole Scrooge. Gary Oldman,Bob Hoskins,Colin firth and many more round out the rest of the talent that lent their voices for this extraordinary film. Watching the other versions we got the jist of how all these three ghosts played out but with the use of all the fx cgi in this film you for once actually feel that you have experienced the story the way Dickens would have wanted it told. Only problem with this version is it has unfortunately a lot of scary sequences that might frighten children and under as my kids were hiding under the pillows every now and then although threatening ,e with my life if i turned it off...awww kids whatta you gonna do? This version definitely deserves the classic title as it is an sight to be hold during the Christmas season.",A Christmas Carol
88,BabelAlexandria,The Scariest Christmas Carol,8,26 December 2020,"An interesting take on a frequently produced favorite! Although we didn't have the 3D blu ray, the stop action computer animation is stunning. The tone and visual effects of the movie are quite creepy (compare the Jacob Marley ghost with Goofy as Jacob Marley in the animated version), especially at the end of the Ghost of Christmas Present scene, with ""want"" and ""ignorance."" I had to explain later that they were ""symbols,"" which was a good conversation with the kiddos. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is not directly scary (one only sees his shadow and hood), but the scenes in which he appears are the creepiest. I felt bad watching it because Sebastian said it was more of a Halloween Movie and went to the stairs, peeping in every few seconds so he could still follow the plot!",A Christmas Carol
89,bob_bear,Throughly Enjoyable Christmas Classic,8,26 December 2013,"Visually stunning and utterly engaging this version of A Christmas Carol is second only to Alastair Sim's Scrooge IMHO. A complete treat to watch over the Christmas holidays.It's dark and scary in parts and not quite Disney - which is not a bad thing. Rated PG so at least parents get some warning of what their children can expect but we must remember that it was Dickens' intention that his readers feel afraid at certain points. It's part of the whole experience.My only minor quibbles would be the unnecessary ""action"" sequences. Scrooge shooting to the moon was a superfluous departure (no pun intended) from the book but it was the overly long chase sequence and miniaturization that most glaringly took liberties with the source material for the cinematic sake of it. The time would have been better spent on developing other scenes from the book. You can't improve on Dickens' original but for some reason Hollywood always seems to find it necessary to fix what isn't broken.Overall though, it is lovely to watch, heart-warming and life and love affirming.Highly recommended.",A Christmas Carol
90,RickHarvey,A Christmas Carol,6,28 December 2010,"I just don't know if Disney have hit the nail on the head with this film. Too scary for children but also to much of a fairy tale for adults. It's easy to appreciate the film. It looks stunning especially the opening sequence and when it comes to dialogue, it has stayed loyal to the book but overall, it just plain soulless.Also not being a fan of 3D doesn't help. When watching the DVD version, i couldn't help but tut at the constant falling and flying just to get some cheap thrills.Some scenes were unnecessary. The horse chase, going from big to small. Not needed. There not much to say. If you already know the story, then expect the similar tale being told but in the usual Disney fashion ( aimed for children, but ends up frightening the poor buggers is the case with this one) If your an adult who watches to revise the tale through the medium of film without any add on's or childish moments, then insert the 1951 version into your DVD player instead",A Christmas Carol
91,C22Man,Superb Adaptation,5,29 December 2013,"Charles Dickens' classic story is adapted for the big screen once more, this time by famed director Robert Zemeckis and with use of his Motion- Capture technique. The main scrutiny of most A Christmas Carol adaptations is whether or not they offer something new for the audience. I think it's easy to say that this version definitely offers a lot of new things and gives its own take. When you just consider that it is produced by Disney and has Jim Carrey in the lead you'd expect a jolly take on the story, but to the films credit it is a lot darker and closer to the story.Everyone should know the tale, but I'll remind you. Ebenezer Scrooge is a cold and heartless elderly man who only cares about his wealth. He despises the idea of Christmas and all who celebrate it. After a ghostly visit from his deceased work partner, Scrooge is visited on Christmas Eve by three ghosts who show Scrooge how his actions impacted his past, present and future in order to make him change his ways and seek redemption. The plot sticks very closely to the book, even down to lifting many sentences from it, which helps the film as it feels more faithful than most adaptations. All in all the story deserves credit for staying close to the book.I did have big doubts over Jim Carrey as Scrooge, but they were thankfully extinguished quickly as he puts in an understated and effectively emotive performance as the elderly crank. He does a spot on impression of Alastair Sim and though he has some over-the-top moments they are kept to a bare minimum. Carrey also managed to possess some wonderful facial expressions that perfectly showed the sadness, fear, contempt and later happiness that Scrooge goes through. Most of the actors play multiple roles and, though they do get lost in the shuffle at times, they all do solid jobs. Gary Oldman really stands out with a sincere turn as Bob Cratchit and so does Colin Firth as Scrooge's cheerful nephew Fred.The film also offers an interesting take on the three ghosts who are all played by Jim Carrey. Past is given a wonderful design of a floating flaming head and has a really dreamy Irish accent that makes it memorable. Past is more sombre than normal interpretations and it fits the film well. Present is not quite as good, I know he is meant to be very jolly but it's too much here. He laughs all the time, and its typical canned laughter too, and he seems to treat Scrooge's plight with only mild interest. Carrey does an excellent Northern English accent, but there is little else there. Yet to Come is just wonderful. The fact that he is simply a shadow is incredibly creepy design and offers plenty of tense moments. This is possible the spookiest version yet as he basically just terrifies Scrooge and is more demonic than any other version has ever been. The Ghost's may not have been perfect, but they were all nicely developed and, at the very least, memorable.I am a fan of the Motion-Capture technique and believe that I can add to certain films. Whilst it isn't as stunning as Beowulf was, it still looks fantastic. It once again gives the film more uniqueness and allows for many more visual effects which is another thing that sets it apart from other adaptations. The soaring shots of London look wonderful, especially in the opening credits. The visual ways the Ghosts transport Scrooge are also fantastic, Past's fast paced flying sequences and Present's shimmering room are both impressive. As stated the designs for the Ghosts are fantastic and the design on Scrooge is great mainly because he still resembles Jim Carrey.Another main talking point is just how scary the film is. I was pleasantly surprised by how dark the film was willing to go and though many may not like such a sombre take I really give the film credit for it. There were many moments that were much more frightening than most Horror films. The scene where Present fades away is usually a quiet thoughtful one but here he appears to suffer a heart attack and slowly decomposes into a skeleton all while eerily cackling, it's flat-out disturbing. The usually dark scenes are excellently done, the build up to the first Ghost has a heavy atmosphere to it and as said everything involving Yet to Come is extremely creepy. The sadder moments such as Scrooge's sad childhood and seeing how other regard him so badly are appropriately solemn. The scene showing the effects of Tiny Tim's death is genuinely tear-inducing.Regular Zemeckis collaborator Alan Silvestri puts in another great score. Although it doesn't stand out as much as some of his others it does a perfect job of creating the right moods. It has the right amounts of jolliness and gloom to make a solid balance.Was A Christmas Carol a good adaptation? A massive yes. I'm just going to say that I enjoyed the film immensely. I really loved how seriously it took the source material and just how dark it was willing to go. From a tone perspective, if you want a jollier take then this isn't for you but if you want a true tribute to the novel then it is perfect. Jim Carrey proved me wrong by putting in an excellent performance and all of the Ghosts were very impressively done. People will always have a love- hate relationship with Motion-Capture, but it is done very nicely here and if you do like it then you will really enjoy it again. On the whole it is certainly the version that I will watch the most and it is also the one that impressed me the most.",A Christmas Carol

It has a good moral, but this is full-on Nightmare Fuel. The animation quality was horrible. Younger audiences will be deeply disturbed by all the scary images in the movie. There were some parts that were too frightening to even watch. During these parts, I asked myself, 'Is this even supposed to be a Disney movie? Was this even meant to be a CHRISTMAS MOVIE?!?' Impossible. How could that be?The script was okay, and the movie had a good message. After all, Christmas is all about giving to others and spending time with your loved ones. But the scary imagery just ruined everything.",A Christmas Carol
93,jburtroald95,The best adaptation of the highly-renowned novel.,9,17 December 2009,"Christmas isn't quite yet a film genre, though it ought to be. The joyful holiday has over the years proved to be a very popular premise for a box office release, as it provides directors with a well-known – but very limited – set of characters and morals to work from.Though unfortunately each festive season the trend churns out an onslaught of cloying, hackneyed family rubbish. Many of the greats have sadly been corrupted by the overpowering obsession. Even the reliable Robert Zemeckis was led astray and the insufferable Polar Express was the consequence.But with A Christmas Carol he has found redemption, one that we can all take pleasure in witnessing.This is partly owing to the far superior choice of source material this time. Chris Van Allsburg is more of a drawing artist than an author. His picture book was very impressive, but had very little to offer in terms of story and left Zemeckis with little more to do than to replicate the illustrations. The famous Charles Dickens novel, on the other hand, had much more to offer, though it did also present the great challenge of giving something new to a story that has already been adapted several times. It is very satisfying to see such courage and daring and its results.Another notable delight is the performance capture animation technique; which was the only positive aspect of Zemeckis' aforementioned mistake, and its manipulation has even improved since then. It's part-realistic, part-cartoon look is very interesting, giving the film a pleasing Dickensian feel. The vast range of styles from familiar warm and cheerful Christmas tones to the eerie supernatural feel that is the most dominant in the picture is also highly impressive.Though of course it would not go to finish without mentioning the cast, who look slightly different in the dazzling animated world, but the superb motion-capture still allows their performances to show without a trace of distortion.Jim Carey leads the talented group as the multi-layered protagonist Ebenezer Scrooge, a role that he absolutely shines in. He makes the most of every scene, and plays every incarnation and variation of the character to complete perfection, and the addition of his own signature eccentricity is delightful to see.However he is overloaded with other roles and sadly falls short of the versatility required to pull them all off. His turn as the three spirits is rather disappointing, and if it weren't for the animation it could be easily seen that it was the same actor. The Ghost of Christmas Past is dull and tacky; the Ghost of Christmas Present is quite quirky and entertaining, but very forced; so perhaps the dark and chilling Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come would have to be the best of the three, but it was mostly the animators – not Carey – that created him. Though in spite of all this the revelation scenes are still wonderfully crafted, giving both the audience and Scrooge a genuine jolt.Gary Oldman also has his hands full, but he surprises us all by managing to deliver a splendid variety of cameos.He is very convincing as the soft and kindly Bob Cratchit, who works for Scrooge and every day endures horrible torment. His grotesque and disturbing turn as the ghost of Marley – Scrooge's business partner, whose death on Christmas Eve forms a large part of the man's bitterness towards the festive season – is truly memorable. The chemistry is marvellous between him and Carey in these two parts of his. He also plays the adorable little Tiny Tim, whose vulnerability and sweetness always touches the hearts of audiences and Scrooge.Other cast members include Colin Firth and Bob Hoskins.",A Christmas Carol
94,kylehodgdon,Amazing in 3D,7,15 November 2009,"This was the first movie that I have seen in 3D since the 1990's and I must say that I was absolutely blown away! I had no idea that 3D pictures have advanced as much as they have.The character of Scrooge is done very well. It felt as though Carey gave it his all with his voice acting. Scrooge's fingers are really neat to look at. I also really liked this version of the Ghost of Christmas Present. I wasn't too crazy of the Ghost of Christmas Past, but that is a very minor complaint.The script did a pretty good job in turning a relatively short story into something that is feature film length. It did spend a lot of time flying around and taking advantage of the 3D aspect, but that is probably better than the alternative of adding a lot of unnecessary components to an already complete story. This was not my favorite version of ""A Christmas Carol"" that I have ever seen, but it is quite good. If you want to see this film, make sure it is in 3D, it's well worth it.",A Christmas Carol
95,robert-259-28954,Jim Carrey does it again.,8,14 December 2012,"I found it amazing that Carrey has managed to pull off a double ""Christmas miracle,"" first with ""The Grinch That Stole Christmas"" to this most recent adaptation of the Dicken's holiday classic. His English accent was so totally believable that it was only halfway through the film that I realized that it was, in fact, the rubber faced comic. While ""The Grinch"" remains my favorite Christmas film of the past three decades, this most recent installment was surprisingly good, in large part simply to it's clear homage to the original film version, namely, ""Scrooge,"" starring the superb Alistair Sim in the 1951 British masterpiece. Most of the adaptations to follow were of such poor quality that they don't even rate mentioning here. It is clear to see that the believability of computer imagery has improved over the years to such a degree that I fear, alas, that it may even compete favorably to live actors. In any event, the film was worth viewing, but after seeing the black-and-white original, everything else pales in comparison. Merry Christmas everybody!!",A Christmas Carol
96,ihrtfilms,Average version of a classic story.,4,5 September 2010,"Dicken's classic is animated to life in this new version, with Jim Carrey playing Scrooge and the Ghosts, all animated with performance capture technology. This style of animation has been used before, in Beowulf for instance and whilst it at times works for the most part I struggle with it as the sense of realism becomes borderline. In this instance it looks okay, but the better scenes are the ones where people aren't in close up. The human characters rarely look anything more than bad computer game characters. On a few occasions does it work well, a candle lit Scrooge's face. General scenes where presumably they used regular animation are often wonderful, flying over a snow covered London or the scenes where Scrooge falls through the air are very effective.Jim Carrey does well here playing the old Scrooge and is less Carrey than normal, his performances as the three ghosts are also okay, despite annoying accents. The film is for the most part very dark with scenes such as the ones with the Ghost of Christmas yet to come really ominous and perhaps too dark for a 'family' rated film.The story is a true classic, but whilst there is some things to enjoy, it is perhaps a story I prefer told as a live action story.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com",A Christmas Carol
97,rdukeesq,very good not humbuggery,7,13 May 2011,"So I saw Disney's a Christmas carol from from 2009, starring Jim Carrey and directed by Oscar winner Robert Zemeckis. So is it good. I say indeed not humbug. It was good. I saw some reviews which said it was a little dark but that is one of the things I liked about it. I am not religious, and I sprung forth from the loins of jews, but this has always been one of my favorite stories. It can be a little dark, but in the end Scrooge wakes up and its still Christmas day, he hasn't missed it! I saw the preview for this film, when I went to see Avatar in 3d, and having seen the movie in 2d I think it is one of those flicks where the 3d makes the movie that much more of a visual feast for the eyes. The animation quality is mixed for me, Robert Zemeckis is kind of a master of getting details down in terms of look, but I have found the character's motions here, and in his other CGI driven movies, to be kind of clunky. But I thought it was very true to the original, very creative, visually stunning, and very likable.

98,C-Younkin,Younkin Reviews Movies,6,3 November 2009,"Robert Zemeckis tries motion-capture animation for a third time, a technology that's been a mixed-bag, creating some very pretty pictures and allowing actors to portray multiple roles but lacking the one thing that a Zemeckis flick always prided itself on in the past, which is a soul.Scrooge (Jim Carrey) is a miserly old man who clings to money while neglecting humanity, his nephew (Colin Firth) and employee Cratchit (Gary Oldman) included. On Christmas eve night he is visited by the ghost of his former partner Marley (Oldman) who tells him his one chance at redemption is to be visited by spirits of past, present, and future (all played by Carrey). Of course this is a timeless tale, but like the best re-makes of ""A Christmas Carol"", you want to see something new. There isn't much of that here outside of the visuals. Zemeckis' vision is darker and scarier, but not necessarily better. The appearance of Marley's ghost is more haunting than anything in ""Paranormal Activity"" and there is a lot of disturbing ghostly and death-related imagery. These are probably the scared-straight type visuals Dickens would have wanted, but parents with young kids should be careful.The scenery still has that joyful Victorian-Christmas feel and the characters look terrific. Scrooge is perfect as a bony, hunched-over figure with a long scowling face and protruding nose and chin. The ghost of Christmas past looks like aflying flame and is probably the movie's funniest visual. (The other is how much Bob Cratchit looks like Clint Howard.) And the ghosts of Christmas present and future are intimidatingly well-created. The movie works the best when Scrooge is at his meanest and there isn't a scene where Carrey doesn't commit to his performance, but like the rest of the movie, it doesn't have the originality of a say ""A Muppet Christmas Carol"" or ""Scrooged"". Michael Caine and Bill Murray are still the Scrooge-champs. The biggest problem though is that Zemeckis is still hindered with motion-capture, which animates the actors faces and movements but also makes them look emotionally hollow (especially around the eyes). And this is one of the few ""Christmas Carols"" where the Cratchit and Tiny Tim characters seem minimized in favor of stylized visuals and unnecessary action set-pieces, and where Scrooge seems to transform simply because the screenplay requires it. The richness of the story never comes through. Oh, and I still fail to see the benefit of 3-D.",A Christmas Carol

What I enjoyed the most was the visual effect of the film. I felt like I was in the movie and a part of what was going on. I can't really comment on acting e.t.c as it is an animation in the main part. The visuals are stunning and they have designed it with 3D in mind.

101,petit76,imax3d,10,4 December 2009,"Some followers of my comments would think why Evren Buyruk has waited so long to write a comment on A Christmas Carol . here is my impartial review over this Jim Carry masterpiece .I saw A Christmas Carol in IMAX 3D, and was so impressed by it that I saw it again in RealD, the other 3D process in which it is being shown. I'd like to share some observations with you as to the similarities – and differences– that I observed between the two formats.The similarities: the 3D effect is essentially the same in both formats. That's not to say that there aren't differences in the 3D experience, but the ""depth"" of the image is as apparent in the RealD format as it is in IMAX. One method won't cause images to ""pop out"" more than the other will. And the extra ""dimension"" that the 3D effect imparts to the story is equally real.The differences:If your nearby cinema has the film in the IMAX format, it's probably also playing it in RealD, as well as in 35MM ""2D"". The IMAX ticket will be more expensive than the RealD ticket, and that will be pricier than the 35MM ticket. You do get what you pay for.The IMAX screen, being so large (70 feet or so across), takes up a larger swath of your vision than the RealD screen will (35 feet wide or so). Because the IMAX screen is so big, the 3D effect is more immersive than it is in RealD. This is most apparent in the film's four ""fly- through"" scenes (one at the film's opening, and one in each of the three ""ghost"" sequences). The 3D effect is the same either way, but because your eyes have less ""non-screen"" area to see around the picture area, you are more ""swooped up"" in those scenes during the IMAX screening than you are in the RealD showing.Sonically, no other theatrical experience can quite compete with IMAX, simply because the IMAX sound system has more speakers and more amplifier power than you are likely to find in auditoriums with the digital sound systems used for RealD or 35MM showings. If that is uppermost in importance to you, IMAX is your winner, hands down.Visually, there are some differences. Because it's film, the IMAX image has a certain amount of ""jitter"" to it. It manifests itself at the end of the film, during the credit roll. You will see some of that jitter on the screen, as the credits seem to ""stagger"" their way up the screen. The jitter is always there during the IMAX presentation, of course, not just during the credits. If you have noticed it before when you went to the movies, digital projection provides welcome relief from it.I saw the film in IMAX early in its run, but had I waited a few weeks to see it, I would expect to see that the print had accumulated some dust and scratches as it ran through the projector again and again; but the RealD screenings, which are rendered from a hard disk, would have none of those defects, even weeks after its opening.Then, there are the differences between the two 3D technologies, especially as they apply to the glasses worn to see each format.IMAX 3D relies on ""linear"" polarization. Its biggest drawback is that the surfaces of the glasses need to remain essentially parallel to the surface of the screen in order for the 3D effect to be optimal. And, the wearer's head needs to remain perfectly level throughout the screening. Tilt your head slightly, or turn away from the screen even a little, and the 3D image will start to ""ghost"" or produce visible after-images, particularly in areas of high contrast, such as credits against a dark background. Tilt your head too far, and the 3D effect goes away altogether.This means that your seating choices in the IMAX theatre, as large as it is, are limited. You want to sit dead-center to the image, both laterally and vertically, so that your glasses aren't tilted by you having to look UP or DOWN to see the image. Don't be faked out by the overall size of the screen as you walk into the theatre; this movie is in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, so it will not fill the entire height of the IMAX screen, only its entire width.If you see the film in IMAX 3D and then see it RealD, the first thing that you are likely to notice is that the IMAX image is a lot brighter than is the RealD image, but if you choose to see it only in RealD, that image won't appear to be ""dim"".RealD uses ""circular"" polarized glasses, and that means you don't have to be as careful where you sit, or how perfectly aligned your glasses are to the screen. Even if you tilt your head as far as you can, the 3D effect won't disappear, and ghosting will be far less obvious.Is this version of A Christmas Carol, with all of its technological wizardry, worth seeing, compared to any of the other movie or TV versions?Well, yes, it certainly is; the fantasy that Charles Dickens built into his story practically begs for it. And Jim Carrey acquits himself wonderfully in the role of Ebenezer Scrooge. Yes, you'll spot him - and his trademark facial contortions - beneath all that motion capture. Is it worth the extra bucks to see it in 3D?Absolutely, if for no other reason than to see how skillfully Robert Zemeckis and his team have manipulated it. The added dimension augments the terror that Scrooge feels as the spirits transport him to the edge and back.Is it worth spending the even bigger bucks to see it in IMAX 3D instead of RealD?

102,plutus1947,Watch It In 3D,9,14 November 2009,"It was many years ago I actually saw a movie in 3D and at that time it was quite hit and miss.With technology today 3D is REAL 3D and it is as though you are really there, right down to watching the snowflakes fall literally right in front of your eyes.I doubt I need to mention anything about what the movie is about as I am sure virtually everyone knows the story of Dickens's Scrooge.Although I have not been too partial to Jim Carrey since his stupid and foul mouthed comments on a live award show a few years ago, I still consider him a great actor.In A Christmas Carol he plays several parts including Scrooge and the 3 spirits and plays them extremely well.Added to his voice-over are those of Colin Firth, Bob Hoskins and Gary Oldman. Even Callum Blue (Mason in Dead Like Me) had his part to play. Quite apt really to have a Grim Reaper in A Christmas Carol.This film was wonderfully made and produced and will rank among the very best of the great many Christmas Carol movies made.I saw this movie in 3D and feel this is the way to watch it but I am sure it is just as good in the normal screen 2D format and possibly a little less scary.One word of warning!! This film is a PG rating in the UK and it can be very scary for really young children and those who may be of a nervous disposition so please think very carefully if you are considering taking your children to see it.This is very sad really as the name Disney is, or was, synonymous with the word children and if I remember correctly when Walt was alive he would never release any movie which was not suitable for any child, no matter how old to watch.I truly wish the Disney Studio would go back to making films purely for children.

Led into temptation by the C.G.I., the SFX and all the awesomeness of modern movie-making technology, he is now devoid of all the emotion, freshness, thrills that made the fame and valor of his previous masterpieces, as ""Back to the Future"" or the unforgettable ""Forrest Gump"".The danger was in air already since the tiresome and useless ""Beowulf"", but now it became plain for all to see.""A Christmas Carol"" is simply too perfect, in all its spectacular redundancy, to be able to express any feeling at all anymore. It's like a genetically modified tomato injected with steroids - huge and spherical and tasteless, with an eau-de-cologne flavor. It's so permanently over-the-top, that it becomes limp and boring.Well, it's obvious that modern cinema moves on its way towards this key of expression, so the lesson to be gathered by all, out of Zemeckis' artistic passing away, is quite obvious: learn to become MASTERS of the new profession - not its SLAVES!",A Christmas Carol
104,MRavenwood,"In Technical Respects Only, A Fine Film",6,6 November 2009,"Bottom line: I was not entertained by this film. Yes, I saw it in 3-D, yes the effects are interesting, but I do not feel they supported the story in any meaningful way. The story's telling felt soul-less and more like an obligatory Christmastide money-grab than any coordinated creative effort. Part of that comes from the cold nature of the effects, which interrupts the actor-audience connection. WAY to violent and intense for kids. I would NOT bring kids under 10 to this myself.Having said that, the lighting work done by the animation team is something very special, as was the texture of the backgrounds (i.e. bricks, cobblestone, snow.) The fire in the fireplace also looked fantastic. So the animation is brilliant, but there's just no ""happy"" in the story.Lots of hard work by Jom Carrey, don't get me wrong. I just thought it was too over-the-top intense and overwrauht in some places and did not compensate for the dark nature of the film with redemptive balance. It was ""and they lived happily ever after"" sudden redemption. Not my cup of tea. See the live-action version. Your mileage may vary.",A Christmas Carol
105,kill-the-boxtrolls,A BIG let-down,7,11 September 2011,"I first saw this film when it was still in the theaters and when I came out, I thought ""It was disappointing to me."" I first saw the Christmas Carol from the 30s when I was 5 and I loved it! Then, a couple years later, I was introduced with a video called ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" and I admit I still love it. Now, I'm pretty much grown out of it I was pretty excited to see that a brand-new Christmas Carol movie was coming out. Yet, I was expecting it to be pretty funny and to be kind of a fun thrill ride. Then, when I went to the theater, I thought, ""Oh, I'll like it"" but I got bored in the middle. Obviously, the movie is NOTHING like a plain comedy or even action-adventure film. No, it turned out to be quite a thriller like the other Christmas Carol films, but I still thought it was kinda funny and somewhat fun. Today, I saw this on STARZ and I seemed to have liked it a little better than before, but was still a horrible let-down for me. I guess I have grown out of a Christmas Carol, but I heard a lot of critical acclaims for this film and how it was well-received, but I know I'm not the only one who thought this film was embarrassing and generic. Well, you know, I could say that the visuals were nice, the script was flat, and some of the characters and even the ghosts were annoying. Yeah, I didn't like it at all very much. Although, I thought Jim Carrey had to be the film's best since his voice was so unique that it didn't even sound like him, and had definitely deserved the KCA award (even though I don't like the KCA very much anymore).Overall: It's done a great job capturing the brilliance of the book and adding in some stuff to entertain older kids, but had the right to maybe scare the little ones, but while I thought the book was quite a let-down too, I stood up for myself that I'm not into ""A Christmas Carol"" very much anymore 3/10",A Christmas Carol
106,ChristianUnchained,A much better movie than I expected,8,23 April 2013,"While the dazzling visual effects make the package more kid friendly, this version of a Christmas Carol is decidedly dark and scary. Jim Carrey's performance is really quite good, but it's the important themes that will stick to you, portrayed in a very poignant and dark manner. Its portrayal of these themes and Scrooge's metamorphosis into a better human being are all enhanced by the great animation and character animations. Use of original Dicken's dialogue is well executed and the story follows the original quite well. The finale, if you care enough, will keep a smile on your face. There are a couple ""Polar Express"" moments of theme park attractions, which are throw-ins to keep kids happy and awake, but also to get some 3D sales. Despite the previous, the final product is a surprisingly emotional, not to mention powerful and frightening, adaptation of the Christmas classic made for a more adult audience looking for substance rather than thrills. Tremendously better than Zemeckis' previous. Or maybe because not matter how many iterations of this classic tale are told I'll still love this classic Dickens tale? Maybe so. Still, it's surprisingly good.",A Christmas Carol
107,J_Trex,Superb Version of Scrooge,9,22 November 2009,"I just saw this in 3D and I was amazed at how good this was. I'm glad I saw the 3D version because the special effects were phenomenal. The portrayel of Dickensian London was breathtaking. The screenplay adaptation by Robert Zemecki was pretty straightforward but what really set the film apart was the incredible graphics. It was simply mind boggling. I think this is going to be a Christmas classic.When the movie first came out, the critics were lambasting it but I think they largely missed the mark. This was a great adaptation & the 3D effects will make this a holiday tradition. Jim Carrey was great in multiple roles (he played Scrooge but also Ghost of Christmas Present), Colin Firth as the nephew and Gary Oldham as Bob Cratchitt were very good.This is great holiday entertainment. If you can, go see the 3D version but standard version is good to.",A Christmas Carol
108,blackmambamark,"Really good Christmas movie, but doesn't really hit you between the eyes like you want it to",7,10 November 2009,"Yes....we all know the story all too well. However, is there really a definitive Christmas Carol movie? You know, one we all think about when we hear its title. There really isn't if you think about it. When i think of the character Scrooge.....i think about George C. Scott's in the 1980 version. When i think of funny adaptations.......i think of Bill Murray's ""Scrooged"". But don't laugh when i say this......but the first movie i think about is.....""A Muppet's Christmas Carol"". Why you may ask........because it captures that Christmas feeling more than any of the others........plus those muppets are so damn entertaining. I don't care what you have to say about the man lately......but Robert Zemeckis still makes damn good movies. ""Beowulf"" was still good in my eyes, and ""The Polar Express"" is easily one of my favorite Christmas movies of all time. The reason i bring those movies up is because they both choose to use CGI and animated effects. Both are astounding in my opinion, and clearly above the rest. But this movie is hands down Zemeckis' best work in this field. Story wise....no........but as far as effects, there is no comparison. The realism of each characters face is done so very well, with every little detail gone un-noticed. Plus, the choices they used in the cinematography were just plain amazing to watch. The 3-D also brings it out that much more. Visually.....it was mind blowing. However.......there still were some problems with this one. First was the story. Like i said, we all know it. But still, i was hoping Zemeckis would capture the ultimate feeling from each individual character, not just Scrooge, in a more brilliant and meaningfull light. The beginning was not drawn out, and pieces of Scrooge's life felt like it was missing just a little more depth. Which is really surprising to me, because Zemeckis usually makes great strides when it comes to depth in his movies. I mean come on, ""Back to the Future"", ""Forrest Gump"", both movies with depth oozing from its pores. I don't know, i think if they broke free just a little from Dicken's actual story, and modified it just a little for the sake of the screen, it might have been told in a better light. Don't get me wrong, the did change just a little.......but a little more couldn't of hurt. Now the other thing that bothered me a little in this one was Jim Carrey. I am a big fan of his, and do not deny his numerous talents that he has shown me in the past. He did not do bad in this, he was good, however i don't feel like he was the right choice for this role. They could have kept him yes, but did he really have to play every single ghost? They couldn't hire someone else? Because his voice didn't really fit the profile of each of these ghost. Sure, maybe his face did, but something just didn't feel right when you watched him go to work. My opinion, i think that if they kept him, he shouldn't have taken on numerous roles. I still think Geroge C. Scott is the best scrooge though.......no comparison. Bottom Line........i know what you, me, and everyone we know is looking for when we go into this movie. We expect to come out ready for Christmas, have joy in our hearts, and ultimately feel like you just watched something truly magical. Basically, you want to feel like a kid again.....you want to feel the magic once more. This movie provides a little of that, but not quiet the level you expect. It was missing that something extra special. Don't get me wrong, the movie was entertaining, and did put me in that Christmas spirit. But it is not near the ranks of the Christmas classics. Zemeckis got it right when he made ""The Polar Express"", but he didn't really hit the nail square on the head with this one. It was good, but not incredible. But i would easily take that compared to the other crummy Christmas movies that have come out the past couple of years.",A Christmas Carol
109,brownah18,A Christmas Carol to Remember and Cherish!,8,25 November 2009,"We all know the story of a Christmas Carol which has been done before in musicals, movies, and even with the Muppets done in the past by Disney. In this remake, Jim Carrey plays Ebenezer Scrooge who is a mean old man who is selfish and only thinks about himself. His business is to help the less fortunate, so he is somewhat of an investor of some type in think. Scrooge is visited by three spirits, but before that his partner from seven years ago Jacob Marley comes and haunts him telling him about how selfish he has become and how he will be visited by three spirits. Scrooge is first visited by the ghost of Christmas past taking him through his past childhood when he was a boy. Only to have returned from seeing one spirits guidance the next one is waiting for him, the Ghost of Christmas present who shows him Cratchit's ( played by: Gary Oldman) family and poor tiny Tim who is crippled and has to use a crutch. Seeing his nephew Fred (Colin Firth) who even says a toast to his uncle's health, even tho he hates the person he is and has become. The spirit of death shows Scrooge how the death of tiny Tim has affected the whole Cratchit family, but most of all Cratchit himself. Seeing his own name on the grave stone, he decides to change and become a better person than he has been in the past.Carrey, who is modest about his performance in this movie, has done a great job making this movie really enjoyable. He said once he read the script, he was delighted to be a part of this movie and making worth while. Adding star actors Oldman, Firth, Robin Wright Penn, and Bob Hoskins to the picture and you have a great set of people to make this movie more worth the cost of a movie ticket. Unsure of what 3D is like, even without seeing that with the classes instead just seeing it in 2D the movies graphics make this movie so realistic it makes you want to see more animated type movies of its kind made. This movie follows Charles Dickens story of A Christmas Story right to a tee which makes it so well done. Carrey had a great time being in this one, and has shows he can be in a variety of movies from the Number 23 to Horton Hears a Who, Carrey is always challenging himself to do a variety of movies. I would recommend this movie and it will be a fun one for the whole family to see this holiday season!",A Christmas Carol
110,Gerardrobertson61,Enjoyable Scrooge Tale,7,15 February 2015,"I have just finished reading A Christmas Carol and was keen to see how close this animated version was to the actual book. Some of the quotes are directly from the book, the ghost appear more or less as I imagined them while reading and for more parts, this was fairly close to what Dickins had written, however, the flying sequences were a little bit out of context to me. Jim Carrey was a surprise as Scrooge and carried off the voices very well. It is a dark movie and maybe a bit to scary for little kids especially when the ghost are on the screen.

Ebeneezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) hates everyone and, even moreso, hates Christmas. But one Christmas Eve, he is visited by the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future The main appeal of the movie for me was the motion capture, just because I remember the entire hype being about that. It's not bad and, at times, it's excellent. But it's clear that having the entire movie animated around the motion capture was a bad idea. It's not very realistic; whereas Gollum in LOTR is so unbelievably lifelike.It's the Jim Carrey show, too. He is brilliant in it, and I don't fault the performance at all. But he's a good actor in an averagely made movie. There's decent support from actors like Gary Oldman and Colin Firth, but nothing to shout home about. Maybe, MAYBE, this will be fun for kids, but I doubt that too.So you can tell that I found the movie boring. I didn't hate it; it's just boring. Frankly, I'd rather read the book.",A Christmas Carol

114,RLTerry1,Brilliant and Timeless,10,9 December 2016,"An exhilarating visual array of breathtaking motion-capture animation with a touch of the macabre! Disney's A Christmas Carol directed by Robert Zemeckis is an outstanding adaptation of the literary classic. Instead of attending the cinema this week, with the box office offerings on the anemic side as we gear up for the bulk of Oscar season heavy hitters, I decided to rewatch Disney's A Christmas Carol. Charles Dickens' masterpieces have long sense been a source of inspiration for film adaptations of literature. Specifically, A Christmas Carol was actually one of the earliest films period–let alone adaptations. The first adaptation of A Christmas Carol was a British film in 1901 titled Marley's Ghost. This classic work has been adapted for film, theatre, radio, and television more than 100 original/separate times, collectively. But why??? Why this novel? Quite possibly, this single work of literature has been brought to life for the stage, speaker, or screen more than any other with only a few possible exceptions. Perhaps, because it is simply timeless– transcends all generations. Writer-director Robert Zemeckis showcases his ability to put his spin on the timeless tale by perfecting the motion-capture animation techniques that made his adaptation of The Polar Express so visually stunning. Although Patrick Stewart's Scrooge in the TNT original movie from 1999 is my favorite Scrooge, I feel strongly that Zemeckis' film is closest adaptation to the spirit of the novel and brings it to life in the way Dickens himself may have imagined.Prior to analyzing this adaptation, as it is a story most of us know and cherish, I'd like to look at why. Why has this work of literature been adapted for nearly every storytelling medium? The short answer is that it is a story that is as relevant today as it was in the 1800s. Much like with his other masterpieces, Dickens captures so much about the human condition, in what amounts to a short story. The novel is not terribly long. With many in the U.S. feeling as though, much like in Dickens' world, that we are being divided up into the rich and poor, this novel rings especially true. In fact, there are definitely high profile people in our economy echoing Scrooge's words ""have we no prisons; have we no work houses???"" Not that we have a physical debters' prison or work houses (in the old fashioned sense), but there are certainly elements of our society which parallel them. The story hits close to home for many. Furthermore, the novel, and subsequent adaptations, are regarded so highly because Dickens encapsulated every aspect by which mankind judges one another: past, present, and future. This is the foundation of a single person or people as a unit. Through Scrooge, Dickens shows us that if we look at our past, present, and future, then we can see the impact we have on those around us and even ourselves. By seeing how we really are, we can make the decisions to develop an approach to change ourselves to be about the business of mankind.Interestingly, the ghosts show Scrooge how Christmas past was a time of magic (although it ended in heartbreak for Scrooge), Christmas present depicts how commercialism and greed have all but wiped out the magic with a glimmer of hope as shown by Cratchit and Fred, and Christmas yet to come shows Scrooge–and us–a world without the magic of Christmas: a world that we created. Another reason why this story is so powerful is because Dickens wrote the character of Scrooge to be a complex, multi-layered human who acts very much like a mirror to many of us. On the surface, he looks like a stereotypical old miser, but after looking into his past, we are given a glimpse of how he evolved–not unlike many of us. This story is also powerful for those who recognize the religious origins of Christmas or not. The focus of the story is on generosity, hospitality, love, compassion, as well as selfishness, greed, and sociopathy; but, it very much includes and makes reference to the religious underpinnings of this special time of year. Simply stated, this is a dynamic story of redemption that transcends generations of people.Zemeckis' adaptation is a beautiful usage of 3D storytelling technology. Ordinarily, I am not a fan of 3D movies, but this one is an exception for sure. I did not watch it in 3D last night, but I remember watching it in 3D when it came out in 2009 at then Downtown Disney AMC. Zemeckis is one of few directors who knows how to use 3D effectively without it seeming like a gimmick. His use of 3D in A Christmas Carol greatly enhances the visceral appeal of the movie. One of the principle differences between this and other adaptations is just how supercharged it is with visual effects, intense chase scenes, and flying through the street of London. But, as Scrooge himself acknowledged, spirits can do anything–they're spirits. Zemeckis does not hold back on the dark elements of the story. If you have read the novel, you will recognize that there are very dark parts. In many respects, A Christmas Carol is a supernatural horror film. After all, how else was Scrooge going be so scared that he would make a 180 and change his miserly ways???There are few Christmas movies that capture the spirit of the season better than A Christmas Carol. Zemeckis' adaptation is my pick for best translation of page to screen. The cinematic excellence of Disney storytelling is woven throughout this film and makes for a thrilling journey. If you are planning to watch some Christmas movies this holiday season, I highly recommend this version of A Christmas Carol. But if you have very young children, it may be a little too scary for them. Whether you are young or young at heart, the magic of Christmas rings all too loudly in this timeless story brought to screen once again.",A Christmas Carol
115,iamyuno2,A Very Good But Not Great Version Of The Dickens Classic,8,28 December 2013,"This movie uses computer animation to great effect, at least until it gets too enamored of itself and delivers an overly-long animated sequence toward the end that seems to be done more to impress than to serve the story properly. In fact, until the denouement, this movie was on its way to becoming another Christmastime classic. Instead, after the overly-long animated sequence I mentioned, it seemed to get impatient and gloss over crucial tear-jerking final scenes that were the very reason for the movie to exist and the most moving part of the story. When the Ghost of Christmas Future shows Carrey's Scrooge the Tiny Tim death scene, for instance, much of Dickens' dialog is cut. We don't see Cratchit's son reciting the Bible or the wife trying real hard to hold back the tears (saying, ""the light hurts my eyes"") - instead she bawls like a baby, which was not what Dickens intended and it ruins the scene. Also, we don't see Bob Cratchit's attempt to put on a sunny face, his description of Tiny Tim's grave site or his sudden collapse into tears as he says, ""Oh Tim, my Tiny Tim"" - all of that is cut out. Why? Did they run out of time? Patience? When Scrooge wakes up after seeing the three ghosts, the movie for some unknown reason doesn't properly show him unusually giddy with joy, it doesn't have the maid come into his bedroom nor do we see him dancing like a little child or doing a handstand and scaring the maid - so there's no proper build up showing why the maid would think he's gone mad. Why? When Scrooge timidly goes to his nephew's house for Christmas dinner, they cut out the lines Scrooge said to the nephew's wife that made that scene so poignant and special (something to the effect of, ""can you forgive an old man who has had no eyes to see lo these many years?""). Why? When Cratchit arrives late for work the day after Christmas, they cut out much of Scrooge's explanation of why he suddenly decides to become a generous boss to him. Why? The hugely disappointing final scenes in this film, then, turns what could have been a great film into a passing fancy. That being said, Jim Carrey does an exceptional - if uneven - job in his many roles. (His accent, though, seemed to vary a bit over the course of the movie.) Worth seeing - but just once - if just for the incredibly realistic and creative animation work.",A Christmas Carol
116,Targe,A spectacle of modern special effects brings the true story to life,8,29 November 2010,"I was highly sceptical of this movie, I am always suspicious of Jim Carrey 'vehicles'. I must say I was very surprised, and enjoyed this movie. Why, I can say for 1 is that Jim restrained himself from his usual inane and over the top physical comedy, other than one brief outburst playing a younger and decidedly less evil Scrooge in the Christmas past section. In fact, Jim channelled his inner Scrooge, and his own battles with mental health, quite well, I highly suggest watching the 'making of..' parts on the disk to see this.For two, they stayed faithful to the book. I cannot begin to stress how important it is for directors to try to do this whenever possible. The good ones, Peter Jackson comes to mind, GET this. Don't try to re-invent a story, you are NOT better than the author, you will just end up SCREWING IT UP. Leave your ego at the door and just DO THE BOOK. This is what this movie attempts, using the fantastic technology of 'Mo-Cap', which is, rigging real actors with sensors, having them act out the entire movie, and then translate it graphically to animation. For this reason, many of the animated characters are exact replicas of the actual actors, and others only slightly modified as if they were wearing elaborate make up. This brings tremendous believability to the movie.Jim is amazing as he channels Scrooge, or perhaps his own tortured manic depressive self, to perfection.Some of the stunts are a bit over the top, but they succeed in turning an otherwise rather dry and droll holiday story that 'adults watch' into something for the whole family.Some other scenes are rather dark, Gothic, depressing, and downright SCARY, but this was only done as a tribute to the original work by Dickens, who did write this as one creepy Christmas ghost story. For this reason I would err on the side of caution with the smaller kids, and have a blanket ready to throw over their heads for the third ghost, who is one very scary grim reaper.",A Christmas Carol
117,rams_lakers,Did we really need another Christmas Carol?,5,6 December 2009,"There have been 10 versions, with Captain Picard (no less) being the recent one to be overtaken. So why another? Oh yeah - we needed a 3d one. *cough* In the world of bad remakes that didn't need to be made, this one joins the list - but perhaps near the bottom. The top (dis)honors go to The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Longest Yard, and The Omen - but that's another rant.I just saw the new 3D Christmas Carol in the theater and as we were walking out I commented that it reminded me of a scary Disney ride on steroids. Don't get me wrong, I loved the original Haunted House at Disneyland - BEFORE all the makeovers to dumb it down because some people were supposedly fainting. (wimps!) And don't even get me started on the Nightmare Before Christmas theme. ""Yeah let's just make the Haunted House ride fun and happy rather than scary!"" Sheesh.Anyway back to the review. I thought the animation was so-so. As in so so bad. Were people really that ugly back in those days? They all looked like creepy cabbage patch dolls. I wanted to reach out and poke them to see if they had any feeling. And what's with Gary Oldman's huge head? He looked the worst of them all.Being my first ""new 3d without the blue/red cardboard glasses"", I thought the 3d effects were pretty cool - especially the flying scene with Scrooge and the candle head ghost.Jim Carrey and Johnny Dep appear to be in a race for who can play the most characters out of our childhood stories. Carrey is a bitterly sour - yet effective - Scrooge. So much that when he turns nice at the end I'm really not 100% convinced. Couldn't he still just snap at any moment and start choking a caroler? Carrey's annoying ""fake laugh"" was incorporated into the ghost of Christmas Present, and after the third round of ""HO-HO-HO-HO-HO-HO"" I was already sick of hearing it. Alas, more rounds followed.I gave this a generous 5 out of 10 stars because despite the average production I thought the 3d was pretty cool and that Jacob Marley's ghost was portrayed frighteningly well. This film will scare young kids, which again brings me to the question of why they toned down the theme park Haunted House so much and then presented this Marley ghost in all his howling jawbone-dropping glory.I don't think I'd see this again because it really didn't get me in a happy mood, but more of a creeped out feeling. I expected that from the ghosts - but not from those hideous animatronic vacant eyed cabbage patch townsfolk. I kept waiting for this to end so I could get back into the world of real people.",A Christmas Carol
118,gatorgus48,Disappointing.,3,19 December 2020,Ham handed and overacted. One of my least favorite versions.Creepy faces and over-the-top scenes detracted from the story. Unnecessary 'action' scenes didn't help either.How do you muck up this story?,A Christmas Carol
119,eragonbookfan,The Albert Finney version from 1970 is bar FAR the best - check it on YouTube!,3,1 November 2014,"And I say that simply because it's strong point is because it's a musical (being nominated for 4 Oscars!); and also because it's quite underrated as well. Even Jim Henson's ""The Muppet Christmas Carol"" is far better than this 2009 Jim Carrey version.With Christmas soon coming around the corner, I want to write this review in saying I'm still baffled to this day that Disney was what created this - all the characters are simply just motion-capture of the actors, each has such an over-the-top design, and the imagery... SERIOUSLY what is with the imagery in this movie!? It's freakin' TERRIFYING! But to be fair, I don't dislike Jim Carrey at all; I think he's got one of the kindest faces, I have been a fan of his since watching ""The Grinch"", of where I think he played a much more believable Christmas-hater, with really incredible makeup. But the difference between Finney and Carrey, is Finney was and still is really versatile! And I give Jim Carrey credit for *trying really hard* to play different characters... but unfortunately, I just see Jim Carrey - I don't see him playing characters! I have the same problem with Leonardo DiCaprio & Tom Cruise - I don't see them playing characters, I just see Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Cruise! But that aside, I think the only great/interesting part of this film is when in the future, the scene where Scrooge learns of Tiny Tim's death, and where Bob Cratchit stops right in front of him, not knowing he's there, to show him his grief-stricken, tearing eyes, I have to admit was really powerful! But there's just so much weirdness & bad things in this movie that it really OVERWHELMS the good stuff. I'm kinda glad I didn't see this in theaters, even though I like 3D; but it've probably given me nightmares.(Want better Disney 3D films?? Just go watch ""Wreck-It-Ralph"", ""Frozen"", ""Tangled"", or even ""Meet The Robinsons"".Again I'll say, this shouldn't be a ""Disney"" film (nor should ""never Cry Wolf"" btw.) Yes, I'll admit Albert Finney's version has got freaky imagery as well, but it's very few occasions, and it isn't over-the-top. But the film overall WORKS, and I still think is the best version ever of Charles Dicken's classic story, also because it EXPANDS on the source material in a creative way! And I believe every family in the world should own it. I'm serious; check it out, you won't be disappointed! ^^ Long story short, this isn't a good version of ""A Christmas Carol"", and I think it's no problem at all to say which is the best even if there are so many versions. But I've seen nearly all of them, and I'm sticking to my words.3/10",A Christmas Carol
120,Alise_shenle,Better than I thought,8,7 January 2010,"Well, to begin with, I did not want to watch A Christmas Carol. Because I thought it's a boring Christmas flick, some more a boring Dickens story (Sorry, i'm sure many of you are fans of Charles Dickens, but I can't stand his saccharine sweet, predictable tales like Oliver Twist/Great Expectations) I read the real story, albeit the abridged version, but still. The movie mainly follows the plot of the book, with a little differences. For instance, the book is not so scary, and they never explain how all 3 spirits visited him in 3 days, but they just show the ghosts come one after another. And the Ghost of Christmas Present didn't wave and the whole floor became transparent and they flew around. in the book scrooge was made to interact with the people and feel more like he's there. This movie is really quite scary, especially when the ghost of Christmas present became a skeleton but kept on laughing.",A Christmas Carol
121,chrisbishop5000,Let the bells ring out for A Christmas CAROL!!!,10,9 December 2009,"This has is without the shadow of a doubt this best film adaptation of the classic Dickens story EVER! Take it from me! The visual effects sparkle like never before. Jim Carrey makes a change and gives us a dark, dramatic character, nothing like all his other previous parts in past films. I went to the Vue cinema in Worcester with my boyfriend Paul today to see this perfectly-made festive movie in 3D. Our special glasses were made of plastic rather than cardboard. I honestly thought I'd get scared seeing it in 3D and knowing how the story itself has its menacing moments but, apart from a few occasions the startled me out of my skin (like the Jacob Marley doorknob), it was fine; perfectly OK for all ages! I loved it! Not a single part was flawed. Well done, Disney!",A Christmas Carol
122,ricardopthomaz,The best version of the Dickens book to date!,10,1 January 2014,"This movie can be a very underrated one because of the CG factor. Now if CG was the best choice for a movie like this can be a very debatable thing among fans. What I do know is that this is the closest and more accurate interpretation of the Dickens book ever made, and I speak with very much property because I'm just obsessed with this tale and saw every single version existent of this. This one wins because it follows the book in a very close fashion. Still, some things concerning visual decisions, specially for the three spirits received some adaptations and some action scenes and other minor adjustments were made to better suit and enrich storytelling, but to me is, without a shadow of doubt the best and most amazing version of the classic tale. Worth checking out!",A Christmas Carol
123,mokshjuneja,Visual 3D appeal,6,25 November 2009,"Christmas Carol I just cant see any horror movies. The closest that i have enjoyed a ghost movie is Ghost-Busters. The Patrick Swazye Ghost movies was watched only on cable, never in theatre. This movie is not a horror movie, but there were ghosts and very ugly looking characters and very scary ghosts specially, when you see the Disney tag name.Jim Carrey is awesome best, but then you cant just make the man do all the characters in a movie, give others a chance. He is good and he plays the 60 year + Uncle Scrooge the character from the Charles Dicken's novel who hunches, walks with a walking stick, but then falls from a whirlwind and topples onto a huge flight of stairs and is being chased by demented Ghost of Christmas yet to come and still manages to stand, which all is very commendable and entertaining. With a performance and the central character so strong, the other characters automatically are away from the limelight.With Christmas Carol, now Jim Carrey does a second movie where the protagonist hates Christmas, the other movie being How the Grinch stole the Christmas?. One question that I have in mind does Jim Carrey hate or love the spirit of Christmas?The graphics was over - powering and 2D was very effective, specially because the story is based in the winters in London and then you have snow flakes landing in front of your eyes and the visual seems like snow flakes might just be falling in front of you.Overall, if you have scared of horror movies, then be prepared to be spooked a bit. Visually, a very entertaining movie.",A Christmas Carol

125,harj-41-607090,Most likely a Christmas classic,8,31 December 2011,"This is a film that may over time become a Christmas favourite, it ranks in my view as one of the top 4 of the many adaptions of the classic tale. The reason why this is so good is not only in the reasonably faithful delivery of the story but also for two particular reasons: Firstly because of the masterful presentation of a number of Christmas Carols through subtle undertones at points throughout the film rather than an open rendition. Secondly because of the superb backdrops many of which can be substituted for Christmas cards. I originally saw this film in 3D, however this is a 3D film which genuinely benefits from 3D technology and which didn't use 3D to get a bit more money from the punters. Jim Carey was an unlikely Ebenezer Scrooge, however he carries the part wonderfully. Overall a Christmas classic.",A Christmas Carol
126,LydiaOLydia,"Who is the film for, exactly?",2,24 January 2010,"Look - I appreciate that this film is ""faithful"" to Dickens' novel. I have no complaint there. However, there are plenty of novels that don't deserve in this day and age to be put to screen ""faithfully"", and this is, evidently, one of them.To summarize the plot: in the first five minutes we learn that a frail old man is not very pleasant and doesn't like Christmas. You might even call him a Scrooge. Then, for the next hour and a half or so, he is tortured mercilessly by forces apparently representing the interests of all that is good and kind in the world. Finally, in the last three minutes, we show that the effects of the torture have worked and so he becomes a nice guy. Had the spirits instead have told him to act like a chicken, after that much torture, he'd be out in some field clucking and pecking. If this sort of torture were done at Guantanamo... well, you get the idea.Given all the torture, as various reviews, both pro and con have pointed out, this is not a film for children. Or so they say. Perhaps this is a film then for those adults who enjoy watching 3D Christmas movies in cinemas on their own? I don't know many such adults. But assuming they do exist, we can assume only that they fall into two classes - narrow minded religious nitwits who sit there approving of seeing the old man getting tortured as through this they see vindication of their 'piety' and S&M enthusiasts (""that's it ghost - now spit in his hair"").So who is this film, for, exactly? One struggles for a satisfying answer.Furthermore, while I find no particular fault with Jim Carrey's acting, I nevertheless find the choice to make this movie in 3D exceptionally odd. Yes, this is doubtlessly the height of the 3d animators craft right now, but the characters continue to look dead and inhuman and the limits of the 3d technology become apparent at times when it becomes clear that the graphic 'world' is little more than a slightly better done PC computer game.But more to the point - ""A Christmas Carol"" is a quintessential human tale. It requires humans. Various English cities and towns can be mocked up to provide a passable Victorian London. This movie is a cruel exercise in hubris, and an absolute stinker.I'm not sure if this is a 2010 or 2009 film ( I saw in Jan, 2010), but this gets my early vote for worst film of 2010.",A Christmas Carol
127,bdl7431,"Not great, but not bad....",7,6 November 2009,"A Christmas Carol – let's face it, this is one of the most powerful ever tales written, and has well withstood the test of time. With good reason, the story has been told many times both in live action and in purely animated forms (there is an animated version starring Mr. Magoo that is actually rather good in my mind). The challenge each time is to tell a story that follows the viewer's expectations of the story while trying to be fresh about it.Thus, we have the most recent incarnation, done using motion photography of actors which is converted into animated video. So, how does this version stand up?Well, it isn't the best, and it isn't the worst either. Zemeckis has taken an old story, stayed true to it, and created a somewhat unique version of it. Now, I saw the 3D version of it. Frankly, with the exception of a couple of places, the 3D added a minor amount of interest to the story. To give Zemeckis credit, he generally didn't shove the 3D into the watcher's face.Nevertheless, the problem with the film is that much time in spent in pure spectacle. Some was OK – when the Spirit of Christmas Past takes Scrooge back in time, the flying sequence is short, exciting and adds some interest. However, when the Spirit of Christmas Future takes Scrooge, there is a long chase sequence that is reminiscent of the 3 Stooges and Saturday morning cartoons. This disrupts the flow of what should be one of the most serious and scary parts of the film. Character portrayal was uneven. Certainly, Carrey's Scrooge is quite good, as was his portrayal of many of the characters. I will admit, Carrey has come a long way from such movies as Ace Ventura. He demonstrates a good range of acting in the portrayal of the various Dicken's characters. But the portrayal of some of the other character's left me scratching my head. In particular, the animated version of Bob Cratchit reminded me of Mad Magazine's Alfred E. Neuman for some reason. And the movie's end seems sudden and left some ends loose. For example, Scrooge sends a turkey to the Cratchit family, but then there is no follow-up – what happened when this massive bird suddenly appears at his doorstep? So, overall, a decent enough film – but with flaws.",A Christmas Carol
128,SebaZava,A flawed but undeniably entertaining CGI adaptation.,8,30 November 2009,"A Christmas Carol is one of Dickens' most famous stories and, in turn, one that is adapted to the film medium all the time. While Robert Zemeckis' most recent version might be the most emotionally involving or mature, it definitely is the most fun and visually stimulating one. I'm sure many people will criticize because, to them, it trivializes Dickens' original story, turning it into something that belongs on a Play Station 3. And to a certain extent, this is true - the film looks amazing, but videogames are also starting to look equally amazing. But I disagree. While this aspect might be somehow distracting, the movie is entertaining enough to make one forget the - sometimes - cheesiness of the - admittedly impressive - animation and just enjoy the story.I won't re-tell the story of the ever selfish Scrooge (here played by a CGI Jim Carrey) and how he gets visited by three ghosts in order to change the way he lives and views life and the people around him. It's well known enough, and for those four who don't know what I'm talking about, I'm sure you'll be able to find enough information about Dickens' story on the web. (Or better yet, you could actually read the original tale.) What I want to do is to focus on the way Zemeckis interprets the story - because, although for the most part he stays very faithful to Dickens, he has added a couple of scenes and situations that, although they make the movie somehow more entertaining - especially for children - they feel out-of-place. Consider the scene in which a tiny Scrooge gets involved in an action-packed chase - it's all very pretty and visually stimulating, but it doesn't feel like it belongs to a movie of this sort. Don't take me wrong, though - although there are ""showy"" moments like this in which Zemeckis is clearly trying to make the most of the 3D version of the film, A Christmas Carol is dark and faithful enough to the original tale for adults to take it suitably seriously.Voice work is excellent. Jim Carrey is just perfect as Scrooge, and his work voicing the three ghosts is really good too. Gary Oldman plays a variety of roles - although one of them actually features his own physical likeness - and Bob Hoskins, Robin Wright Penn, Colin Firth, and Cary Elwes all do their jobs in their smaller - but not unimportant - roles. Visually, as said before, the movie is a marvel. Characters look very lifelike - surpassing everything Zemeckis accomplished with his previous two animated movies, The Polar Express and Beowful - the eyes are getting less and less creepy with each production - and the overall design is breathtaking. The opening scenes, in which the camera flies over Victorian London, is simply phenomenal, and although the ""action"" sequences are definitely out-of-place, they are quite entertaining on their own right.What else can be said about the movie? It isn't the most emotional version of the story - if there's something that clearly makes this interpretation inferior to previous adaptations, is that Zemeckis favours visual razzle-dazzle over emotional impact. The film looks amazing, that's for sure, but Scrooge transformation didn't affect me that way I would've liked it to. Still, that doesn't mean the movie lacks any kind of emotional impact - it just isn't as powerful as it could have been. The thing is, being an animated Disney movie and all, this version of A Christmas Carol is clearly focused on entertaining kids, so - at least from a marketing standpoint - it made sense for Zemeckis to insert more ""actiony"" scenes so that children wouldn't get bored.So is this the best version of A Christmas Carol there is? Definitely not. But it certainly is the most visually stunning, and one of the most entertaining. Indeed, for those who haven't become tired of watching the same story time and time again - in different versions, of course -, this represents a solid hour and a half of pretty-looking, solidly-acted, animated entertainment.",A Christmas Carol
129,whatever_123,It was scary and I liked it!,9,6 November 2009,"Wow. This is a HUGE step up from The Polar Express, which sucked beyond any other Christmas movie. A Christmas Carol has always been a great Christmas story, and it's been redone a thousand times, but this one tops them all. This movie, while being warm and magical, is also very chilling and scary. Parents, if you have sensitive kids, DO NOT TAKE THEM TO THIS MOVIE. Their were many frightening parts in this movie. Scrooge seeing Jacob Marley's face on the door knocker made me jump a mile off my seat. The meeting with the ghost of Marley was also terrifying, with his huge clanking chains and his haunting screams. There was quite a bit of fun flying-around action, too, like when Scrooge is flying around with the ghost of Christmas past, or when the huge black horses of the ghost of Christmas future is chasing scrooge through the streets. It was very exciting and kept everyone on the edge of their seats. The animation... was... hmmmm. I'm not really sure. It was a step up from that horrible Polar Express, but it still wasn't great. Pixar could make more realistic looking people without all the fancy actors with sensors all over them! Scrooge was animated very well, but the normal townspeople and all the other characters looked like they were made of wax. Especially poor Bob Crachet. The poor dude looked like an Ewok with his too big head and small body. There were a lot of really cool effects, though, like the ghost of Christmas future, who starts out as a shadow, then his hand comes out and points at scrooge and such. All in all, it was a very good movie. Haunting and creepy at times, but it was sweet and tons of fun.",A Christmas Carol
130,Apemangalore,"A darker, more terrifying version",7,7 November 2009,"Going into A Christmas Carol, I was both excited, yet apprehensive. As much I'm a fan of Robert Zemeckis' work (my favorite of which, unabashedly, being '07's Beowulf), I couldn't help but feel worried that this would be just another retelling of the story in the exact same manner. Fortunately, this Christmas Carol takes a very different approach, focusing primarily on the horror aspect of the classic story.While I was already somewhat worried upon hearing that this movie was even going to get made, knowing that Jim Carrey would star in the lead role didn't help much. Now, I personally appreciate Carrey's brand of humor, and have enjoyed most of his comedic performances. However, he's usually hit (with The Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) or miss (with The Number 23) when it comes to his dramatic roles. So, I initially didn't know what to think about him being put in the role, and didn't hold out much hope after watching the trailers. To my surprise, however, Carrey actually ended being phenomenal as the old miser. Every aspect of his performance, right down to the way he moves, nails the character perfectly, and the unnaturally thin body of Scrooge sure is one monstrous creation.Speaking of the CGI in this film, A Christmas Carol has never looked so beautiful, yet so frightening, than in this version. For those of you who are planning on seeing this film, definitely try to check it out in IMAX 3-D, as it just adds so much depth to the experience. Occasionally throughout the film, the 3-D is used in gimmicky ways, but for the most part, I thought it was handled pretty appropriately.As I said before, this movie feels more like a horror story, as opposed to the joyous, feel-good tale of previous adaptations. There are some truly nightmarish images here, especially throughout the middle portion of the film, when the Ghost of Christmas Present arrives. As a result, though, Zemeckis strays away from the heart of the story, which I think is really going to disconnect a lot of viewers. I walked out of the movie split, honestly, and had to analyze it quite a bit more afterward.Overall, Robert Zemeckis' take on A Christmas Carol is a darker, more terrifying version of the tale, and one that – if seen at all – should definitely be viewed on the big screen. The imagery is dazzling, yet disturbing, and the performances are brilliant all across the board. Just don't expect to be in a very ""Christmasey"" mood afterward.",A Christmas Carol
131,simon3818,amazing,10,19 November 2009,"Watched this version of the film today and I was surprised and totally amazing. Its brilliant. I was expecting something like English accents and a bad take on the book and previous films but I was so so wrong. We know the story so I don't have to explain it. Jim Carrey's voice character of Scrooge was fantastic, he sounded so convincing I swear at one point it was the voice of the late Alastair Sim. - I didn't realise that he did other voices as well. The film is consistent to the book and the 1951 version although I noticed some lines put in and a few bits left out but it doesn't matter. It worked so well. I say this is a must for all fans of the story - Its definitely on my DVD list.While its in the cinema GO AND SEE IT!!!! 3D is best.",A Christmas Carol
132,rdfarnham,A very disappointing carol,1,6 November 2009,"WARNING--LOTS OF SPOILERS AHEAD.I am somewhat of an aficionado of the Carol so I really looked forward to Disney's latest release. I had really hoped that Robert Zemeckis would work his magic but, unfortunately, like most adapters of the Carol he felt the need to ""improve"" it. What he ended up doing was somehow removing most of the warmth and humanity from Dickens' well-loved story. The movie starts by showing Scrooge removing the coins from the eyes of his late partner, Jacob Marley's, corpse. Yes, it shows that he is a miser it also shows he has no regard for, and almost contempt for, the one man in his life who was probably as close to a friend as he ever had. This scene was totally unnecessary, the story is over 150 years old, and we all KNOW that Scrooge is a stingy miser. The first part of the movie is lighted in an authentic manner giving everything a dark and gloomy look. Unfortunately this darkness pretty much negates the 3-D effect. In fact the 3-D effect is pretty much negligible throughout the film, adding little to it. The only time it is clearly in 3-D is when it is snowing and the snow seems to be landing in your lap. I will admit that Mr. Zemeckis uses much of the original dialog from the book throughout this movie but most of the action is heavily modified or totally new, and is, to anyone who is familiar with the book, intrusive and irritating. For example, in the book the door knocker changes into Marley's face and then disappears. Here it not only appears but also screams in Scrooge's face causing him to fall down the front steps.When Marley enters the room he doesn't just enter the room, he throws several of the heavy boxes he is chained to through the door first.When the ghost of Christmas Past appears he looks like a candle and his head is, in fact, a candle flame floating above his body. At the end of this session Scrooge jams the candle-snuffer over the ghost's head just as in the book. Unlike the book he holds on to the snuffer and it suddenly blasts off like a rocket taking him high into the sky, then disintegrates and leaves him flying. He sails past the face of the moon in a scene reminiscent of E.T.s famous scene then falls seemingly miles toward the ground before waking up on the floor beside his bed. The whole segment is gratuitous and, quite frankly, childish. When the Ghost of Christmas Present appears the ceiling in Scrooge's room is suddenly about 50 feet high. The Ghost looks exactly like Jim Carrey except with a beard and his expressions are the same smirking expressions that Carrey usually displays making the Ghost, at least to me, very unpleasant. One of the things that made this segment so important in the book was that the Ghost took Scrooge around London and let him mingle with the people (albeit invisibly) to get a feel of the holiday spirit. Here, the Ghost apparently lifts the upper story from Scrooge's house and they fly around the city in it. Part of the floor becomes transparent and Scrooge observes everything as if on a television screen. Yes, he sees what's going on but, he does not mingle and there is no feeling of his gaining humanity. At the end of this segment the Ghost says that he only lives for one season and abruptly ages, dies (while still laughing Ho, Ho, Ho) rots and turns into a skeleton, then disintegrates into dust and blows away.The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come segment is, quite frankly, very frightening. Unlike most versions of the Carol the Ghost is mostly shown only in the shadow and becomes solid only rarely. There is a long segment which I found to be not only frightening to a younger child but totally outside the spirit of the book, gratuitous, and frankly stupid. The Phantom Hearse, mentioned only briefly in the book, chases a terrified Scrooge for what seems like miles. For some unexplained reason Scrooge suddenly shrinks until he is smaller than a mouse, he slides along a rooftop smashing into icicles, then falls off the roof and lands in the bag of the charwoman, Mrs. Dilber, who is taking Scrooge's belongings to sell. Scrooge witnesses her total lack of feeling for him and is aghast at how easily she stole things from him, still not realizing that in this future he is dead. In the graveyard scene Scrooge, who is now again full size, is understandably terrified and, as in several other versions, he falls into his own open grave and he, and the audience, realizes that it ends in Hell. He is, of course, saved and reformed in the end but the feeling is not that he was reformed so much because of what he learned as that he is frightened into it. Throughout the movie Scrooge is thrown, launched, battered and generally physically abused for no apparent purpose and with no apparent damage. The ghosts, up to and including Marley, do not seem to be the friendly, helpful and caring spirits of the book but seem, instead, to be enjoying making Scrooge suffer rather than helping him to learn. Overall I found the movie to be cold, depressing and one of the least satisfying versions of A Christmas Carol that I have ever seen. I own more than 20 different versions of this story on tape and DVD. This version will NOT be part of my collection.",A Christmas Carol
133,hugosoup,"This movie is an underrated gem! Parents, go see it with your older kids.",6,5 January 2019,"I don't get why this movie doesn't get talked about more, me and my family watched it for the first time in theaters when I was only 10 years old and my brother was 9, it made for a good, albeit a little bit scary and more dark retelling of the classic Charles Dicken's book. This is a great, underrated movie; trust me, this version of A Christmas Carol is worth your time. So I recommend families to watch this on Christmas, however, I will say though is that if they're under 9 or 10, then maybe wait on this one until they get older because unlike most versions of a Christmas Carol, this movie has some scary scenes in it, but it's a harder PG, like 1980's PG I'd say, I thought it should've been rated PG-13 for scary, disturbing images. It was scary for me and my brother at 10 and 9 years old, but take this as an observation, not a criticism. It's a great movie for older or more mature kids and their parents. I just watched it again at 19 years old and it still held up well for me. Go out and rent or buy this movie, it's a somewhat funnier, yet more dark telling of the original story.",A Christmas Carol
134,omahonyjason,A magical film that stays wonderfully true to the source material,8,14 December 2009,"A Christmas Carol is possibly one of the best know and best loved Christmas stories of all time. It's a classic in the true sense of the word with more than 40 adaptations, the first of which hit cinema screens over a century ago, way back in 1908! Disney's A Christmas CAROL, however, is a little different in that it comes to our screens in gloriously animated 3D and, while 3D was long dismissed as a cheap gimmick, there has been a recent surge in both the number and quality of 3D movies.Disney is synonymous with animation and is similarly placed at the cutting edge of 3D technology, as anyone who has visited Euro Disney and seen HONEY, I SHRUNK THE AUDIENCE will attest. Not only are the Euro Disney 3D effects absolutely fantastic, the cinema is littered with little water spray guns which add a sensory element to the visual 3D rain, while at one point thousands of rats run towards the audience and, as the 3D rats run past, little air guns at ankle height puff out air creating a terrifying effect of rats brushing against your shoes. Everyone in the audience, myself included, actually screamed while pulling their feet from the floor. Brilliant! Cinemas that play A Christmas CAROL have, obviously, not been retrofitted with such devices but I'd wager that they're not too far away. Robert Zemeckis, the director of A Christmas CAROL, has been churning out successful movies for decades from the BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy in the 80's to FORREST GUMP in the 90's. Of late, though, he has concentrated on motion capture technology, bringing THE POLAR EXPRESS (2004) and BEOWULF (2007) to screens with varying degrees of success.The premise of A Christmas Carol is well known, but to recap very quickly – Ebenezer Scrooge, who is played to wonderful and amazingly life like effect by Jim Carrey, begins the Christmas holiday with his usual old misery-guts contempt, barking orders at his faithful clerk, played by Gary Oldman, and his cheery but broke nephew, played by Colin Firth.But when his dead partner visits and the ghosts of Christmas, Past, Present and Yet to Come take him on an eye opening journey to the past, present and future, they reveal truths that old Scrooge is both reluctant and scared to face. He realizes he must open his heart to Christmas cheer and undo the years of ill will before it's too late.This is a classic Christmas story, made by a classic animation studio, in the hands of a classic director. And I absolutely loved it. If you want to do something with for Christmas then this should be it. It's a magical film that stays wonderfully true to the source material, right down to much of the dialogue. It's terrifying in parts, heartbreaking in others and the animation and 3D wizardry are simply breath taking.Against that there is a drawback, and at the risk of sounding a bit like Scrooge, it's the cost. A Christmas CAROL will set you back 11 euro in Tralee as opposed to 9 euro for a regular movie. And while I was gobsmacked to pay over a tenner for a cinema ticket, the movie was worth it in the end. It's a wonderful Christmas movie and maybe the best adaptation of Dickens' tale to date.",A Christmas Carol
135,owlmarvel,A good Christmas Movie,8,26 December 2019,This is a great family movie to watch at Christmas. Disney do a good job with the effects and Jim Carrey as Scrooge does a really good job playing him. A good movie afterall.,A Christmas Carol
136,aristofanis,Mankind is your business!,7,16 December 2009,"'Mankind was my business!' says Marley's ghost. At this point the animated character has his jaw dropping and his voice distorted. The ever important words can be hardly heard. Blunders like this illustrate the prevailing of grotesque effects over essence in this film.Zemeckis manages to produce some beautiful 3D journeys above Victorian London and some innovative ideas especially in the segment of the ghost of Christmas present, with that transparent wooden floor as well as the depiction of clocks indicating the time ticking away while the ghost dilutes into skeleton and dust.Unfortunately a long scene of horses chasing a lilliputian Scrooge does not make any sense! Apart from Crachet, the animation buffers much of the acting and I am certain that Carrey as he is himself would be more convincing as Scrooge than the exaggerated figure produced in the film. There is something fake about it and its accelerating pace that deprives it from the touchy and cathartic feeling one should get at the end. Too bad.",A Christmas Carol

I know it's near, but not everyone is going: ""Oh my God!! Christmas is right around the corner!"" The title certainly did not get my attention, but I had to go see it with my little cousin who is 5. Nice effects, cool graphics, but you know, it's kids that like these kind of movies. Not the older kids. But I can say that it was kind of worth watching.Normally I don't really recongnise the actor's voice in animation films, but the Jim's Carrey's character, I kind of picked it up. Good choice though, hiring him for the main lead. Well, pretty much A lot of leads if you look on the cast lists! LOL!

I am surprised it was done by Disney because while the film definitely has it's comedic moments they didn't shy away from showing how dark the tale can get.From the animation, to the musical direction this film portrays how powerful the story is. Andrea Bocelli's performance of the song ""God Bless Us Everyone"" is beautiful, and moving. It brings the film to a wonderful closing.Again while probably not the greatest retelling of Charles Dickens classic tale, it was the first one I've seen that didn't try to water down the powerful story that Charles Dicken was telling.10/10.",A Christmas Carol
140,papacorn,Classic Warmed Over and Sanded in 3D,6,26 November 2009,"This movie has been advertised for months and the anticipation level, at least for me, was pretty high. Jim Carrey doing Scrooge, and more. was a big draw. What I didn't realize is that it was going to be the sanded faces that are starting to be a standard fixture in computer ""enhanced"" movies. Colin Firth, simply adorable, was like some guy from Shrek, skin all smoothed out and no light in his gorgeous eyes. I found it lacking the human touch which is what A Christmas Carol must be about in order to succeed. No matter the version, no matter how often seen, regardless how hokey, it always brings at least a couple of tears to my eyes. Not this one. It was bland, bland, bland. If your kids aren't used to seeing scary movies then be warned. The first spirit is pretty creepy. Nothing much spooky again until the ending when Scrooge sees his tomb. Then the scene becomes the kind that nightmares are made of. It's simple but it's one of falling and falling into a deep hole. Even in 3D the building interiors seemed undeveloped and flat. The animation wasn't awe inspiring. This was no showcase for the talent of Jim Carrey nor the rest of the cast. I left dry eyed, unmoved and short more bucks than usual for the 3D kick.",A Christmas Carol
141,Sherrill777,You can do better,5,22 November 2017,"The Bad:For some reason, I just didn't like this movie. It's hard to pin down why, since there are so many version of this tale out there and I enjoy almost all of them – why not this one? Perhaps it's the animation? The motion capture technique used should have made the animation more realistic, but really, really didn't. Perhaps it is the fact that I never end up caring for Scrooge, but also didn't like how callously he's treated. Perhaps it's the fact that Jim Carrey (an actor I don't particularly care for) seems to be every single character. Several scenes, especially ""chase scenes"" drag considerably as well.The Good: As with any re-telling of this famous tale, there's a fantastic moral wrapped up inside. This movie is also more authentic to the book than most, which was written as a Christmas Ghost Story, not a sweet, touching family story. I like that some of the dialogue is ""Old Fashioned"" - taken directly from the book.The Mom View:If I were to pick a version of this story to have my kids watch, it wouldn't be this one. For the youngest, I'd pick the animated Mickey version. Slightly older, and I'd go with Muppets. Older still and I'd pick either the 1999 version starring Patrick Stewart or the 1951 version. So while this isn't horrible, it's kind of mediocre, forgettable, and not worth the effort of finding when there are better versions out there. My overall opinion? Meh.",A Christmas Carol
142,JeffersonCody,"It's visually spectacular, but emotionally hollow: What a disappointment.!",5,4 November 2009,"Having just come from a preview screening of ""A Christmas Carol"" I can confirm the worst suspicions of genuine film lovers. And anyone who has an ounce of love for Charles Dickens.The film is spectacular to look at and the kids will no doubt enjoy all the whiz bang action. Unfortunately this is the Disney and Robert Zemeckis' version, not the Charles Dickens' version we know and love. The storyline is the same but .............Of course it will probably make a fair amount of money, but gosh it was unsatisfying.The film has no soul, no beating heart, no emotional lift at the end. I didn't even have a lump in my throat when it was over. What a bitter disappointment. The magic is gone, to be replaced by an f/x laden thrill ride. Tiny Tim (Gary Oldman, I kid you not - he does three characters) has one line of dialogue. Thus the character of Tiny Tim is barely a factor in this version. Tiny Tin, who for me has always been the heart and soul of this wonderful story. Are Disney and Zemeckis crazy?. Or just greedy? Where is their spirit of Christmas? But wow, we get to see Scrooge (Jim Carrey, who plays nine characters) fly to the moon and back in 10 seconds in 3-D. Visually dazzling, but emotionally bland and hollow would describe the film perfectly.It is an understatement to say that the 1951 film starring Alistair Sim is a fifty times more effective - and affecting, experience.Let me just add that while I certainly enjoyed aspects of the performances of Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Bob Hoskins, Cary Elwes (also in multiple parts) and even Jim Carrey, the actors are not well served by this format of film-making. In fact, while their names will help sell the picture, their wonderful talents are dimmed here. You must see what they do to poor Robin Wright Penn; she's been bland-ed out visually.Really, how could they mess this one up.",A Christmas Carol
143,Elori,Soulless and joyless,3,16 November 2009,"How could they make ""A Christmas Carol"" into such a cold, uninspiring tale? It feels as if all the emotion has been taken out, from the characters, the story, and even the fantastical elements. The voice actors are badly miscasts, especially Jim Carrey himself, who feels out of place all the time and slips into some mannerisms a few times. The use of horrid 3D computer graphics certainly does not help: the characters look like ghastly marionettes, inhuman and unfeeling. The point of the story is completely missed, as is Scrooge's personal development, and even the ending, which was supposed to be a celebration of the Christmas spirit. Just compare to Pixar's ""Up"" and the range of deep emotion there, and then look at what a cold and hollow tale this 3D ""Christmas Carol"" is. I'm pretty sure this vast misstep will soon be forgotten, as it's so badly misdirected to ever become a true Christmas classic.",A Christmas Carol
144,guenzeld,beyond belief,1,3 November 2009,"A kind friend did what he honestly thought was a favor by inviting me to a press screening of this movie. When we were into about seven minutes of it, we stared at each other in utter disbelief.We had hoped that after the abysmal POLAR EXPRESS, an artistic disaster of the first magnitude, that Mr Zemeckis might have learned his lesson and started to re-think his outlook. Alas, EXPRESS - which was so overdone as to be stomach turning with its constant assault of eight-frame cuts and roller-coaster effects - was a mild drawing room comedy compared with this. Any sense of wonder, any idea of enchantment, any thought of storytelling was utterly and totally trampled underneath by a director who is apparently trying to hide a meager talent under an avalanche of digital effects. And the over-the-top gimmicks of Mr Zemeckis are matched by the equally over-the-top voice work of the usual crowd of thespians who confuse screaming at the top of their lungs with acting.This is a dreadful, awful mess. It is charmless and stupid. A film lover's time will be much better spent by watching the Alastair Sim 1951 film. That film was made by artists, not amateurs.",A Christmas Carol
145,smerph,A missed opportunity,6,23 December 2013,"Let's start with the positives; for the most part this is a very faithful adaptation of Dickens's story with even the oft-exercised sequences making it from novella to screen.What of the negatives? Well, the Hollywood factor, frankly. Jim Carrey is a fairly mediocre Scrooge - succumbing to the sniveling stereotype previously performed by Albert Finney, rather than a fully-rounded characterisation. I have nothing against Carrey, with The Truman Show and Eternal Sunshine being firm favourites of here - but I wish we'd got THAT Carrey here, rather than the one who gave us The Grinch.It's actually pretty tricky to overlook Carrey too as, aside from playing the protagonist, he also grabs a ridiculously large amount of other roles. I'd suspect there was some budgetary reason to doing this, were it not for the fact that The Polar Express suffered similar overdoses of Tom Hanks.The Polar Express, of course, was another festively themed feature from Robert Zemeckis and, while the character designs here are not nearly as distracting, this does bring back memories of that similarly underwhelming effort.Another problem is the 3D aspect of this feature, meaning that we have to suffer rather pointless sequences that have been designed purely for a visceral thrill when wearing tinted glasses. While this don't detract from things to much, it's particularly irksome in the ""Yet to Come"" segment where Scrooge is shrunk to Tom Thumb proportions for precisely no reason other than to show off the three dimensions.All in all, this isn't terrible but I find it interesting that this is hyped as Disney's Christmas Carol, when they have two further adaptation in their stable (the charming Mickey's, the outstanding Muppets') that best this in numerous ways.",A Christmas Carol
146,Warren-Watched-A-Movie,A Mature Animated Take,7,1 October 2020,"Jim Carrey pulls an Eddie Murphy and aside from Scrooge he also voices the Ghost of Christmas Past who is depicted as a man with a flickering flame for a head and a candle body (Lumière?), the Ghost of Christmas Present who is shown as a tall man with red hair, a beard, and a green robe, and he had a hand in portraying the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come who looks like the Grim Reaper and occasionally chases Scrooge in a horse drawn carriage.The rest of the voice cast is pretty good. They are all strong actors. The amazing Gary Oldman is Bob Cratchit as well as the ghost of Scrooge's former partner Jacob Marley, Colin Firth is Scrooge's nephew Fred, Bob Hoskins gives life to Mr. Fezziwig as well as a fence named Old Joe, and Robin Wright Penn is Scrooge's sister Fan and as well as Scrooge's fiancée Belle. Cary Elwes has a handful of parts and also was a stand in when necessary since this film was created in part using motion capture technology.One thing I never understood is why do studios stuff animated films with so many name actors? Does that really draw in audiences? You are not actually seeing so and so in the part. You are just hearing them. And the character could have been modeled physically on anybody. Just cast competent voice actors. I think Peter Cullen or Frank Welker for example could do just as good if not better than some name actors that get hired for these films. Just a thought.Once again, I must state that I have a consistent issue with CGI films as stated in other posts. My issue is that as the technology advances, the film itself usually does not continue to look as good as when it came out. Hand drawn animation has staying power that something done on a computer just does not. It is art while CGI is a special effect. So far so good on this one. The film is beautiful. It is a rich film that has a clear style rather than just a ""look.""We have an immersive, detailed environment that could only be accomplished in CGI and not in hand drawn animation. This was the right way to go here. They do go a bit heavy in establishing the season though. I think they should have pulled back a little on the decorations and snow in the background because I cannot imagine anybody has that kind of decorating budget nor is there that much snow consistently on the ground.The script is solid and aside from one extended scene that exists more to demonstrate the cool visuals you can do with CGI, we have a story fairly faithful to the original book. It is mostly drawn from the book, especially the dialogue, with some padding to certain moments to justify the story as a feature length film. Zemeckis did not try to put his own spin on anything here. The film can be darker at times than other versions, but this only occurs where appropriate. The story is not all lollipops and gumdrops. It is about a man being saved and that can go to darker places. While it is an animated film, it is more intense than most and definitely significantly more than traditional Disney material.This is a story of redemption after all and they keep that front and center. Scrooge has lost his was as a human being and these spirits have come to guide him back. If Jim Carrey had been, well, Jim Carrey then the themes and message at the heart of the story would have been lost. He was very subdued and serious here. He turned in a performance rather than a caricature. It is clear he worked hard to get not only accents but performances right.The performances are treated more like you would find in a dramatic live action presentation than in animated material. The characters are expressive in a natural way. The shots are framed for impact and dramatic effect. Robert Zemeckis treated this like a live action film and thus created something wonderful.This version of the classic tale is visually strong and strong in script. Disney's A Christmas Carol is a fantastic addition to the Christmas Carol catalogue. It is a definite crowd-pleaser that could easily become a holiday favorite for you. Find it and watch it.",A Christmas Carol
147,bryanplateado,The best Christmas Carol movie!,8,10 June 2021,"Disney's A Christmas Carol takes the story of Ebenezer Scrooge and turns it into a visually and interesting movie. Jim Carrey was a great choice for the role of Scrooge and all the Christmas ghosts. Robert Zemeckis' direction is on point with this movie, and his script was amazingly written. The visuals are probably the best things about this movie. Even though the dark tone in the movie can be too much at times, the visuals are amazing and impressive. Disney's A Christmas Carol is a great take on the great Scrooge Christmas tale. The dark tone can be too much, and there are some disturbing moments in the movie for sure, but this is still a good and visually impressive movie that I recommend to watch for the cast, crew, and visuals.",A Christmas Carol
148,Sinemah_Freek,"An absolutely splendid movie. At the very least, my all time favorite of the ""Scrooge"" movies",10,7 December 2009,"The following five ""A Christmas Carol"" movies are considered by many to be the finest of the entire bunch of ""Scrooge"" movies - H.V. Esmond (1922), Seymour Hicks (1913), Alastair Sim (1951), Albert Finney (1970), Seymour Hicks (1935). My personal favorite of these movies has always been the Alastair Sim 1951 version.That is, until now. Until this newest, and in my most humble opinion, most wonderful version of them all. I just could not have speculated by any means that such a level of movie making could have been reached in my lifetime. There was not any particular element in the entire movie that I loved more than any other elements in the movie. It was just the entire movie as a whole. Considering the elements of the movie individually, though, I asked myself some questions about the elements in the movie. Was it the fantastic special effects that were made even more beautiful when viewed in 3 dimensional mode? Was it the absolutely gorgeous, lush, extremely stirring and emotionally domineering musical score presented in the style of the very best of the older Walt Disney offerings? Was it the acting, which I found more than splendid, more than stupendous, verging on an almost otherworldly level of artistry and skill? Was it the simple fact that this version was almost 100 percent in keeping with Charles Dickens original writings? Any of these elements of the film would have made it a prize winner by themselves. Although, the entire combination of all of these film making elements put together, for me personally, and hopefully for anyone that views this delightful offering, will prove that this movie is absolutely the finest animated (or semi-animated) movie EVER made. This movie is, in my humble opinion the finest Disney movie EVER made, and is possibly is the FINEST movie ever made, period.",A Christmas Carol
149,kevinthecritic-15200,Christmas Carol: Classic not Overwhelmed by Carrey's Humor,6,12 November 2019,"Jim Carrey generally makes good films, whether playing Stanley Ipkiss in ""The Mask"" or Count Olaf in ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"". When it comes to classic stories however (i.e. ""The Grinch"" or ""Horton Hears a Who!""), Carrey lets his own unique brand of humor overwhelm the audience and therefore ruin the original story. This is not the case in Disney's ""A Christmas Carol"".If you don't know the original story, it's about a very old man named Ebenezer Scrooge (Carrey) who treats everyone like garbage and hates Christmas. This changes when the ghost of his old business partner, Jacob Marley (Gary Oldman, ""The Dark Knight"") comes to warn him he will be haunted by three other poltergeists that night. The ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and possible Future appear and take Scrooge on a life-changing night.The ghosts have one basic emotion each. The Ghost of Christmas Past has the willingness to show others flaws. He shows us this as he takes Scrooge back in time to before Scrooge was rich. His aim is to show Scrooge that he used to be in a romantic relationship before he got mean and had too much money.Next is the literally ""laughing till his death"" Ghost of Christmas Present, who shows Scrooge what people think about him now. Scrooge doesn't realize the hatred others feel for him because he never paid attention before.The Ghost of Christmas possible Future is the scariest and longest ghost we spend time with. He does not speak a word; he only points Scrooge in the right directions. There is a sequence with a ghost horse that is 8-10 minutes long. It is in this sequence that Jim Carrey shows us the weird but lovable guy he is. This scene extends longer than necessary. I thought to myself, 'we know he's shrunk-get him back to his normal size, enough already.'Over the years, there have been many copies of the beloved story ""A Christmas Carol"", ranging from the Looney Tunes ""Bah-Humduck"" on Cartoon Network to the Bill Murray film ""Scrooged"". Both of these stories messed up this tale, and for a long time, that's all there's been. But now, Robert Zemeckis, director of ""The Polar Express"" has taken the wrongly copied holiday tale and turned it into something that most people can enjoy together. The film has very famous voices in it, including Carrey, Oldman and Colin Firth as Scrooge's holiday loving nephew Fred.Unfortunately, the film is PG for scary sequences and images. The scary sequences in the movie are when Jacob Marley's ghost visits and a 10 minute chase scene between Scrooge and a ghostly horse. I personally believe Zemeckis put the sequence described in the movie (it wasn't in the book) so the film could get a PG rating as to attract more then young children.It was one of my favorite sequences and least favorite sequences in the film. I liked that it was very fast moving (you normally can't do that unless it's ""Transformers"", which is 95 percent action) but it also went on too long.I recommend this for kids ages 8 and above. Younger kids will not be able to handle the scary parts, including the scariest thing, the Ghost of Christmas Future himself.",A Christmas Carol

AMAZING film!,10,22 March 2010,"I missed the 3D experience, and the cinema experience for this film, so I just rented it on DVD. GUTTED!!! I wish i saw this in the theatres because this film blew my mind. At first I thought this film was a strange match, all this technology used on a story that in past incarnations did not titillate the senses, nor warrant all the effects used. I was wrong! It brought, beauty, adventure and charm to a usually dull story. I never understood why Scrooge was so remade and retold over the years. It was to get to this point, mo-cap! And its incredible.Anyone nay-saying on this film deserves to have their inappreciative eyeballs kicked from their heads! And the book-smarts people, go read a book and stop whining about films trying to compare.This film was beautiful on a visual, emotional and acting/performance level. Carrey deserves at least an Oscar for his acting skills in this, as does the vfx team that brought that world to life. Stunning on every level.Its scary for some kids, and the dialogue is more for adults, but who cares? Animation and computer graphics are for all of us, not just children. I was a fan of Beowulf but this flick just beat it. I really wish i'd seen this in 3D.

154,kevcom,Do some basic research parents,8,12 November 2009,"I read that this film has been labeled by parents as a ""Disney Bomb"" because it's too scary for their young children. Parents who take kids to see any movie need to be aware of something: if it's rated PG there are likely going to be scenes that your six year old will not enjoy -- even if the name Disney is attached to it. The cutesy versions of A Christmas Carol (The Muppet Christmas Carol and Disney's own Mickey's Christmas Carol for example) have little in common with the classic, and sometimes very scary Charles Dickens story. The plot should be familiar to just about anyone who has been alive sometime during the past 150 years, and the fact that there are spirits (ghosts) in the story should also be a red flag to parents. Especially since two of them are downright frightening in just about any version of the story.The truth is that this is one of the most beautiful and faithful remakes of the Dickens classic. The dialogue is taken nearly word-for-word from the book, and the look and feel of the film brilliantly capture what you would imagine wintertime in London in the 19th century to be like. A few of the special effects are a bit over-the-top, but most work well and add enough pizazz for cynical modern-day audiences. The scenes featuring the Ghost of Christmas Present are worth the price of admission alone.Once every few months I'm dragged kicking and screaming to see a new film. I can't stand wasting my hard-earned dollar on the crap Hollywood throws at us these days, but every once in a while I'm pleasantly surprised and thoroughly enjoy a movie. This was definitely one of those rare times.",A Christmas Carol
155,aschein81,"Not a typical cheery, fast-paced kids film....much darker and in the spirit of Dicken's work",8,7 November 2009,"One thing I would like to point out for those who are thinking of seeing this is that the ""Disney"" at the beginning of the title is really false advertising. This film felt NOTHING like a typical Disney family movie....and that's actually a good thing from my point of view. The film is incredibly dark, has only one big action sequence (which doesn't take place until 1 hour into the film), and lurches along at a pretty slow pace. The film also has almost no music in the background, except for the very beginning and very end scenes. It is at times like a vintage silent film from the 1920s...with individual scenes that go on for far longer than kids' movies (or more specifically Disney) allows because of viewers' short attention spans.To be more specific, this film is nothing like typical kids movies. I did not laugh one time throughout the film. Animated kids movies usually are action comedies with both numerous comedic moments and chase scenes/action to keep the young ones entertained. I will say this one more time: kids and teenagers who are expecting a laugh-a-minute Jim Carrey action film will be solely disappointed and bored. Some of the kids sitting near me got up to walk around a couple of times because they were clearly bored. Whereas myself, a 27 year with a developed attention span was actually appreciating the slow nature of the film. To some of you reading this, this will make you want to avoid the film and that's OK. Everyone has their preferences for films to be a certain way. Personally, I felt that Zemeckis had a lot of balls to make the film this way....with extremely slow scenes without music to emphasize the loneliness and hopelessness Scrooge feels with his existence. Zemeckis also uses the widescreen format extremely well to show all of the empty space that is always surrounding Scrooge throughout the film, especially in his home and office. There are very few close-ups of him at all. Some may not see this is as a big deal, and much prefer action scenes and comedy...but I disagree...this is about the artistic details of telling the story. Zemeckis' job is use images that tell the story in the way it should be told.Lastly, one of the other criticisms of the film might be the fact that Zemeckis chooses to use much of the original dialogue Dickens wrote. This dialogue is sometimes difficult to hear, especially since people are speaking in a more formal way with English accents. I myself couldn't make it out sometimes, but that's because I'm not used to hearing it. However, I would again go back to Zemeckis trying to be faithful to the spirit of Scrooge and who Dickens wanted him to be...not what Hollywood or Disney wants him to be. In fact, I'll bet that if Zemeckis had his way he would have dropped that 5 minute long chase scene where Scrooge goes for some physical comedy. I would bet that Disney forced him to add a lengthy action scene like that in order to get their backing for the film. When you see the film for yourself you will see how that scene really does not fit with the mood or tone of the other scenes in the film.Note - I chose to see this film in 2-D in order to focus more on the story and characters than be distracted by things coming out of the screen towards me, so I can't say what 3-D is like. However, I can't see the film being all that different.",A Christmas Carol

157,Trangor,Love A Christmas Carol ? - You Will Like This (3D),9,16 November 2009,"I can't speak for the 2D edition since I have not seen it.But I can say that the 3D version is exhilarating. Dicken's London is re-created with much of its beauty and, yes, ugliness. The visual design of many of the scenes and how we are swept into and through them is simply stunning.On the negative side I have to put in a dig at some of the artwork, agreeing with another reviewer's comments that some inept Shrek artist seems to have been mistakenly allowed to contribute to the film. This is perhaps the main reason for the less than excellent rating.However, the story is as good as ever and brought magically into the 21st century. The 3D effects are used masterfully to add atmosphere and, for the most part, are not overdone. Carrey brings that special flavor of his (as much as he can) to the animated feature. Overall, it is the same Dickens story but polished and made new.A warning here, our smaller viewers may find the imagery and action too much. This is not really a film for sensitive toddlers. Both of mine (and they are 7 & 10) spent some time hiding their eyes from some of the more intense scenes, like Marley's ghost.I have never seen a movie more than once in the theatre, at least for my own enjoyment. But this could be the first time I am tempted to repeat the experience. Merry Christmas.",A Christmas Carol
158,odysseyinoregon,Great Fantasy-Animated film,10,18 December 2010,"Boy, I did enjoy watching this movie filled with Christmas Magic since I was growing up. Which is based on the Charles Dickens story ? Scrooge was my favorite characters since, I was growing up. It wasn't a bad movie after all. Have no complaints. The first Disney-Animated film was Mickey's Christmas Carol was also my favorite cartoons not just about Scrooge as Donald Duck's Uncle who was rich ? In this movie Jim Carrey did a good job doing the voice of Ebeanar Scrooge, who had a boring Christmas ? He thinks no one gives him appropriate attention.

159,DietCoke13,A Christmas Carol,1,24 December 2010,"I've seen many versions of A Christmas Carol, and this one is surprisingly, and disappointingly, terrible. I was stunned at how bad this version is. It has no soul, heart, and does not at all capture Dickens's story at all. The pace is way too slow. I found myself saying, ""get on with it already"". I like Jim Carrey, but he is all wrong in this. I like Gary Oldman as well, but he is all wrong in this as well. I seem to be in the minority in my opinion. I suggest watching Albert Finney as Scrooge, Bill Murray, Alistair Sim, Michael Caine, etc., but just skip this version all together. I ordered it as an ""on demand"" and could not believe I paid to watch it.",A Christmas Carol
160,a-orourke-292-969653,So cool like Christmas movie! The best!,8,9 June 2012,"Well, Jim Carrey is so brilliant as Ebenezer Scrooge. I have to admit that he plays very well his role. Sometimes very funny in the film. For me it is a great movie and I really enjoyed it. There are some very good special effects and some very great pictures. Between the three Christmas ghosts I preferred the Christmas past. He was the best special effects ghost. The Christmas future ghost was more boring. It was only a black shade who doesn't talk and only shows things with his finger without doing anything special. I have to admit that it was the scarriest ghost in the story. That is already one thing of good about it. Christmas present was also a good one. I really liked his power of changing things. He seemed to be the happiest character and looks so much like Santa Claus. He laughs too much and gives us the feeling of smashing him.The ghosts were SO COOL! Ebenezer Scrooge has so much bad feelings meaning that he had a very difficult life. It is a very great story to see with the family during Christmas vacation and if you hadn't seen it yet, I really want you to see it. You are not obliged if you don't want to. My vote is 7 or 8 on 10. I have to see the movie again to be sure about my rating. It was an asperger review. My name is Constantin and I am fourteen years old. Hope you understood and enjoyed my writing review. People can't always understand me sometimes. I have different ways of explaining things and writing things. I am a learner in English. Thank you very much!",A Christmas Carol

162,macrths,A great adaptation of my favorite Christmas classic,9,27 November 2009,"Many people may have criticized this movie for being too dark. To those people I say, ""What do you expect? A Christmas Carol is indeed rather dark, and most definitely not intended for little kids, so don't expect another Up.A Christmas Carol is a wonderful adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic, and its darkness is what makes it so great. It is truly Victorian, and therefore more believable. Jim Carrey surpassed my expectations with his portrayal of the miserly old man, Ebenezer Scrooge. This is nothing like typical Carrey-esquire performances, like The Cat in the Hat or his other Christmas tale, The Grinch. This man can actually act if he wants to. The supporting cast is also great, with solid performances from Colin Firth and Robyn Wright Penn.I have only one minor issue, which prevents me from rating the film a ten. During Scrooge's visit with the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, Scrooge finds himself in an intricate CGI chase between himself and a carriage led by a pair of menacing horses from the underworld. As well done as this sequence is, it seems as if it is inserted for an excuse for Disney to produce a cool CGI chase scene. Not necessary for five minutes. Especially since scenes such as Fan's death (the reason why he resents Fred so much) are cut. That is much more important to the story than a miniature Scrooge running around London while a pair of horses chase him.Other than that, A Christmas Carol was a beautiful film, almost as good as my favorite Allistair Simm version. A solid 9/10",A Christmas Carol

I thought it was another ""Earth Girls Are Easy"", over the top type movie. To my surprise, it was something of a basic telling of the story. I'm not a big fan of the animation technique, but this was a pretty good movie. I think that it was a very good ""telling"" of one of my favorite stories. I did watch this with a couple of my grandchildren, and it may have scared the ""dicken's "" out of them, so it could be a bit spooky for the under eight set. I think people will still be watching this movie years from now.",A Christmas Carol
164,bentalk,Leave in the middle....,2,22 December 2010,"The beginning of the movie is wonderful, the Victorian Christmas looked wonderful with it's sparkling frost.However, Disney took over the Dickens story - saying it's faithful because they lifted text from the book. The introductory flying camera view of London was lovely, with great music.After that, it's all tosh - scary moments punctuated with silly chases (the final ghost is postponed for ten minutes whilst Scrooge is inexplicably shrunk to a midget and slides around flat surfaces accelerating as if down a mountain).Jim Carey draws a fine line between humour and annoyance - and in this movie, playing a seriously scary ghost with his smug grin just failed miserably. Let's face it, nobody can love Carey more than he loves himself. Generally they didn't make too much of a mess of pretending to be English, but the ghosts came up with some seriously silly accents and it just wasn't English. Can't they afford good British actors? Or is it Disney's business to take good classic originals and spoil it by doing a 'fresh take'? Why can't they stick to writing their own stuff if they want to do that?In typical US Television style, (referring to the way the credits whizz up the screen at a rate that ensures you can't read them unless you record it and freeze frame) , they wrap up the HIGH point of the movie, after showing the depressing life he led, the missed opportunities, and the terrible horrors to come, they wrap it up in seconds by having him order a turkey, but the movie is too lazy to follow it through to the climax of the story. We never really saw a changed man, it was not at all plausible ...This scrooge looks as if he just ordered a few changes quickly before the end of the movie and it really fell flat.Trust me, I love Disney, I loved Polar Express, and I read Dickens - if you get this movie, turn it off after 15 minutes and have a happy memory... Better still, watch a better version. Black and white is nice - from 1950 I think it was with Albert Finney. Now there's a movie that will make you cry (not because you wasted the time to watch it!)

It probably won't be awesome when it comes out on DVD, but I still think the visual effects will look amazing, even in your living room.I was also impressed by the story. The story is almost 100% true to Dicken's original story, a rare delicacy in film. The thing about this movie, is that you can actually look into the characters and feel something inside you. When they're sad, you feel sad. When they're happy, you feel happy. I just felt a great connection with the characters, that I just can't feel when watching any other film.

It was boring. Jim Carrey was bad. But its probably the ""acting"" of the CGI characters, stilted, stiff, and emotionless, that just ruins everything. They're sock puppets, fake CGI sock puppets at that. Your average video game cut scene has more life and vitality. I'd rather watch the muppets act out this remake next time, at least the muppets are REAL sock puppets. Robert Zemeckis is credited for the script, well, the man needs to hire a writer next time. I know it's a remake, but it felt like a remake of this film and ten other films, it was instantaneously identifiable as a boring retread. Like a made for TV version of a movie already done far better.I turned it off about halfway through, its utterly unbearable for anyone over the age of 10 I would think.",A Christmas Carol
168,bluhmfamily,"The dark side of Disney, but still amazing!!!!!!!!",8,18 December 2010,"When I first saw the preview for this movie, I thought that it was gonna be too kid-friendly and was gonna be like a reboot of Mickey's A Christmas Carol. When I finally saw this, I was amazed that a company like Disney could have a ""dark side"" to them. Although the beginning of the movie where Scrooge takes away the coins that were covering Marley's eyes, the scene really didn't need to be put in. The movie then moves on to seven years later when the scene in the book is repeated. The as we cut to Scrooge arriving at his home, it's that famous scene were Marley's face is on the knocker, this time Marley screams at Scrooge (the part still scares me to this day), in other versions would just have him shout SCROOGE!!!!!! Then the scene were Marley's Ghost appears should be only for viewers over 12 or 11 because what ""Dark Disney"" was just a little over the top. After the bell rings one; The Ghost of Christmas Past comes, instead of being a mixed gender and age, ""it"" is now a floating candle which I like better since I guess ""it"" is supposed to be the light of the past.After a non-needed and kid-friendly flying scene, we now cut to The Ghost of Christmas Present, who apparently laughs too much. The ghost's death was creepy though. Then we now get to The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come a.k.a The Ghost of Christmas Future. This ghost officially made Disney a dark company. The scene were the ghost actually has Scrooge fall into his grave was actually a scene from the Micky one, this one was darker.Even with this movie it it still hard to determine if Scrooge dreamed the past, present, and future stuff or if it all really happened. At the end of the movie, Scrooge is now a nice person and is dooming good to all that he did wrong.Something all the other reviews should try to spot in the film is that maybe the three ghosts were Scrooge himself maybe. I give ""Disney's A Christmas Carol"" a 8 out-of 10 due to the useless scenes, but the best version I've ever seen!",A Christmas Carol
169,thetimegivenus,Was This Just a Showcase for Disney 3D?,4,29 December 2010,"I must say that I had high expectations for this film. While I am very familiar with Dickens' masterful tale, I had never seen it as a movie, and was greatly looking forward to it.Unfortunately, Disney has almost ruined it in this animated feature film.The Good: It was very well made, technically speaking. The detail they put into the animation of the film was incredible, and it would have been amazing in 3D! That is also however, where Disney failed in this film.It was also good in that, for the most part, it stuck to the book. There was only one place where the changes made to the story made no sense what so ever, but more on that later.The Bad: I believe that the film was mainly made to show off what could be done with 3D. As I mentioned, the animation was technically well done, but there where many things that seemed like they had been added to the story just to show off what Disney can do with 3D. For example, toward the end of the film there's a scene where Scrooge is chased through London in miniature by the ghost of Christmas-yet-to-Come, who turns out in the end to also be the angel of death.While I'm sure it looked great in 3D, it didn't really have anything to do with the Christmas Carol Dickens wrote. The whole scene should have been cut and replaced by other, more meaningful, scene that Disney left out.Conclusion: While I was very much looking forward to watching the film, I was greatly disappointing. Maybe if I hadn't had such high expectations I would've enjoyed it more, but I doubt it.Hopefully I can find a better rendition of Dickens' classic story to enjoy later this Christmas season.",A Christmas Carol
170,YankeeDood,Effects Over Story,7,10 November 2009,"I saw this today at a ""early bird"" matinée which cost $8.00. Gee, I can only imagine what the normal ticket price is! Anyway, I went in thinking this would be a truer version of the Charles Dicken's 1843 novel as promised by the director. Well, I was disappointed with that end of it. Many scenes and words from the book are left out (i.e. when Scrooge ate dinner after closing his office Christmas Eve before going home). Because the movie obviously focuses more on 3D special effects than on characters and story, so we are left with little to take interest in more than the overdone zaniness which James Carey is well known for. But even the eye opening effects got annoying in parts. When Scrooge shrinks up and flies through tunnels and crashes into icicles, I thought it would never evolve into the next scene, until finally it did (by the way, this scene also is definitely not in the book). Now, I did love ""The Polar Express"" which Robert Zemeckis also directed. But unlike ""A Christmas Carol"", the effects blended in nicely with holiday nostalgia and a winning soundtrack. I barely recall hearing that much Christmas music in this movie other than hints of ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"". So Zemeckis just didn't pull me in with as much holiday spirit this time around. But overall, at least this animated version is cute and I'm sure kids will eat up all the wild effects. So it makes a decent family outing, but I wouldn't go beyond that. For me, and many others, the champion of all versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" remains the one made in 1951. Alastair Sim's emotional performance is one tough act to follow, so I doubt any other version will ever top it. Some believe Sim owns the role and the more overly-anxious actors I see playing the old miser, the more I tend to agree.",A Christmas Carol

You can't explain why you laugh at a particular joke; analysing will kill it. But here's my attempt.

Some loved it, some liked it, some didn't like it, and some hated it. To me, I'm in that ""mixed"" category. Out of curiosity, I went to see ""A Christmas Carol"" in Real D 3D. I feel as if that ""A Christmas Carol"" was a fun holiday movie to get you in the spirit, but the movie wasn't that great. The voices by Jim Carrey and his jovial attitude at the end made this film fun, and so did his serious attitude when he played the mean side of Scrooge. To me, I think the 3D is what this film is all about. If I saw this in 2D, it probably wouldn't have been as much fun. I think that this film was a great way to help you get in the spirit of Christmas, but it wasn't really that great of a movie altogether. The script is at times dull, and at other times really fun. It really depends on the way you perceive it.The 3D was great and it must be seen in theaters, because most likely the 3D won't work or look as good if it comes out in that format on Blu-Ray/DVD.

178,whlane92,A layman's Christmas Carol.,7,2 January 2010,"I think the reason for the divide in reception is due not to the movie, but to the audience. I think this is more of a layman's Christmas carol, somewhat plebeian in nature. I have read the actual story and watched the movie. (and personally liked both) Do not get me wrong The movie does make an above average effort to remain true to the story; much of the dialogue was taken word for word from the book, and all three ghosts bore resemblances to their drawings in the book.However, the movie also uses its special effects to create features not at all found in the book. The chase scene with the 3rd ghost is the best example; as hard as you may search the book, Scrooge does not try to run away. I think that scenes like these were made to appeal to our less intellectual, more action oriented masses without, in theory, disgusting the more educated people or the Charles Dickens fans. It failed in the 2nd task. While most of the literary ""laymen"" I have heard from liked it, those with background in Dickens were sort of....ya.And about the whole ""Disney Bomb"" complaint.... That is why I liked this movie. This is the only Disney Movie I have seen that I truly respect, as it isn't all about rainbows and flowers.

To me, who has watched several adaptations of this story, this one is the best version. Robert Zemeckis meets my expectations and keeps me interested in his creations like Forrest Gump, Polar Express, Beowulf, etc. If you really want to enjoy this animation you'd better watch it in original language (English) because I watched a Russian version many interesting speech and accent details are lost ""in translation"". Jim Carrey's voice with Scottish accent is amazing although the main character has no resemblance of an actor.

184,jtrascap-1,Wow that stunk!,3,29 December 2012,"I knew it existed but never watched it. I've seen many a Jim Carrey movie so I thought I'd give it a go. I want my life back. That ruined everything I ever knew about 1) the Dicken's novel, 2) Jim Carrey movies, 3) Animation, 4) Redemption stories, 5) Broadcast TV movies, 6) the Hollywood movie system, 7) The possibilities of computers ruling the world (if computers were that smart they would have revolted during the production)...I could go on, but suffice to say it was perhaps the biggest steaming turd I've seen paraded through the holiday season (and that includes the fruitcake). Ignore that this is looks less like Victorian London and more like Uncanny Valley (it's well known that the director just-keeps-trying to make this kind of animation work, which is rather endearing...kind of like watching the dog continually chase his tail). Ignore that the colors are flat in tone, or the eternally the zooming camera that can't get a sense of space - just depth (seriously - being trapped in a room with a ghost just doesn't seem to be good enough - it's got to zoom through the city WHILE in the room). Ignore that they seem to have confused this movie with ""The Rescuers"" towards the end. IGNORE that you can see - in your head - Jim Carrey constantly acting out of the side of his mouth, trying to act..desperately trying to act, but abjectly failing - and not even convincingly. Ignore all that and more - seriously, it's a car crash - but the single, most terrible thing about this travesty? They rushed the end - no sense of redemption, no sense that he's seriously trying to reconnect with his fellow man, not even a scene at the Cratchit's receiving the goose - just a rush to the end with Scrooge dropping spare change in several random scenes. He's paying his way back in...no sense he's trying to make his life better, and better for all. The just completely miss the point of the whole thing. Idiots.

Looking back on it now it is still a little creepy, but at the time it really scared me. Whether or not it is true to the book I cannot really say, but I am fairly certain that it is a tad more accurate than the Muppets' version. In saying this however, I must point out that the Muppets' version is a family movie. THIS IS NOT A FAMILY MOVIE. Going back to a previous statement, I am not sure how close this is to the book. If it was an exact replica of the book then there are certain aspects of the book that are just stupid, for this movie contains some really stupid scenes. Not wanting to spoil the movie for you I will not mention them, but I am sure that if you watch it you will pick them up for yourself.A word of advice for parents.

186,IDanceWithFishes,"An unique, unsettling affair",10,19 November 2009,"I came to this film expecting clichés, perhaps slight jumps later overtaken with fuzzy warmth and overt joy which is present in the majority of Scrooge adaptations.However, what I found was a bleak portrayal of Victorian London seated in compromising realism, with a bleakness and grim nature which was both enthralling and quietly disturbing. As the movie continued, it moved into uneasy territory with the three ghosts, whose presences were both comforting and fearful.I guess I should talk about the Marley scene. This was terrifying, with it's lingering silences and intense anticipation of his visit. The door knocker was a definite jumper, making me literally leap out of my seat. The guy's actual appearance was creepy, with his slowly decomposing corpse and dragging chains wound around his body. In a specifically disturbing scene, his jaw unhinges itself, cracking open his cheeks and his hands act like a flapper so he can speak.Yuck.All humour displayed in this piece is pitch black, with no cutesy critters or double edged one liners. The first ghost, usually predicated as the gentlest, is strange, with his flickering head and discerningly humorous face. One of the more shocking scenes is where all the faces of the past flicker on his features in a grotesque morphing session. Despite his pathos, he is not without his darker side.Things get worse with Present. He's less of a jovial, benevolent spirit but more a commanding judge with a harsh kindness, dripping with malice in later scenes and having the most haunting death I've seen in a while. And an interesting take on Ignorance and Want, as we actually see what is to become of them in adult life. One of the more disturbing scenes, due to it's truth not just in Victorian London but in society today. On a side note, Present's booming, musical laughter is turned upside down in this version, transforming it into something manic and unnatural.The scenes with Future are scary, and laced with an unpredictable edge. Though yes, we have chase scenes and miniature adventure, but the threat is still very much there and these scenes meld effortlessly into the story, merely adding another abstract element to the picture. Future is portrayed as the traditional grim reaper, but his ""shadow form"" is frightening on a subconsciousness level, and his bony, coal coloured pointer he has for a finger is something that caused shudders for myself.Jim Carrey plays a brilliant Scrooge, portraying him for the nasty miser that he is (this Scrooge is absolutely detestable) but with pathos and humanity, whilst also being a mixed batch with the ghosts. Past is a breathy Irish which locks in nicely with the ghosts otherworldly state, but Present....I'm not exactly sure what Present is, but hey, it works well.Gary Oldman does a mediocre Crachit, but really shines as Jacob Marley, from his bizarre manner to his varied, ghastly voice. The other gifted cast perform their roles effectively. The setting and animation is magnificent, the location of London captured with full flair. Scrooge is brilliantly animated, so much that the other characters suffer in comparison, but it is not really noticeable. Motion Capture is a mixed bag, but it works wonderfully with the mood here, adding a sub human quality which frankly I enjoyed.People complain about the lack of emotional fuzziness this story lacked, but I felt it did it well, though differently. The sorrow of Scrooge's past was subtle and underplayed, to the cracking in the old school house's walls to Scrooge's vast isolation in the world, as everything is large and ominous around him. Frightening, but poignant as well.The abstract nature of this film gathers the idea of a dreamlike, supernatural journey which I absolutely love. Scrooge's fear is our fear; his journey our journey, and whilst others didn't feel the ""emotional attachment"" it was though the experience of travelling with Scrooge could the audience form an connection and sympathy with the old skinflint.A stylistic, beautiful, dark piece of art. Sad, profound and terrifying, tackling human themes with no compromising coziness. I love it for that reason, and personally, I thought it was fantastic. Not without flaws, but that depends on how you take it.*DO NOT SHOW THIS TO YOUNG CHILDREN.* It is bluntly horrifying and disturbing in parts, and the whole mood of the film will not appeal to HSM obsessed youngsters. For its themes and imagery, it should have really be a 12. But for those who fancy a unique, challenging take on an old classic, I highly recommend this.",A Christmas Carol
187,roffma,Great Display of 3D capabilities,6,19 November 2009,"Since I am not a huge fan of Jim Carrey and not really into Christmas movies I wasn't sure how much I would enjoy the movie but I really wanted to see the impact the 3D effects would have when applied to a well known story.The movie itself is quite good but there have been better versions of A Christmas Carol, however the 3D effects greatly enhanced the movie and made it quite entertaining. It was my first experience with 3D movies and apart from the glasses being annoying at times it was thoroughly enjoyable.The plot is relatively unchanged from the original text and the acting (animation) is very realistic making it quite enjoyable to watch.",A Christmas Carol
188,gogul1,3D beauty,7,15 December 2010,"3d is the best thing to happen to cinema since colour. Why? It's so much fun. I'm not saying all films should be 3D but the ones that could, should. Take this film, good in 2d, great in 3d. I have this on 3d blu ray and it is so good I keep watching it over and over. It can take tour breath away, especially if you have a large enough screen as the flying sequences excel in this. Jim carrey is his usual self (he will be heralded as a great actor like all the classic greats in 100 years time) and you can easily see who is who from the motion capture expressions. Visually this film is gorgeous, Charles dickens would cry at how great it looks, the story is very true to the original (until the last act) and surprisingly scary, the story was not toned down for the kiddies. 3D really is another stroke of genius for cinema when used appropriately! Watch in 3D if you really want the full experience, it loses a little bit of edge in 2D.",A Christmas Carol
189,Smug_Grinch,Not really for Children,6,27 November 2010,"At least not the ones under 10 or 12, I should think. Bob Zemeckis is an outstanding director. I have loved everything he's directed. But this one had me scratching and I even jumped some. I know Zemeckis wanted to remain faithful to the story, which is always a good thing, but he forgot who his demographic target was.This is a Disney movie for children, and most are garnered for the 8-and-under market. There's some harsh language. It shows two starving children, then the girl transforms into a full-grown woman and dances promiscuously around Scrooge. And it's quite scary at times. At 36, it made me jump. Some 5-year-olds will pee all over themselves.And the language! They speak Victorian English straight out of the book. Most Americans have never even heard of some of the words they used! I found myself relying on the captions quite a bit to understand the dialog. And the tones of the ghosts were sometimes hard to make out. The Ghost of Christmas Past whispers all the time and the Ghost of Christmas Present has a Scottish accent.There are a few fun scenes created and garnered directly for children, but I wouldn't risk it. Bottom line, if you want your children to learn about Ebenezer Scrooge's folly and redemption, watch Mickey's Christmas Carol or A Muppet Christmas Carol. Or, if you're an adult like me and want to have fun, watch Bill Murray in Scrooged.",A Christmas Carol
190,conorstack,Severely underrated.,8,24 November 2019,"This is a unique take of A Christmas Carol, as well as my personal favourite adaptation which features distinct animation, great transitions and very compelling translations of the original story among other things along with adding elements to justify its existence.",A Christmas Carol
191,aaronkalvani,What a bore...did they not learn from their mistakes in Polar Express,1,6 November 2009,"Good special effects, but what scary terrible characters. I saw this film at the premier in London and thought perhaps with Jim Carey opening the film with Colin Firth it may be good!! But, OH boy, it was horrid. The 3D was good but compared to UP, it lost its place. But worse of all I know the story and I have seen better versions in cartoons than in this film! Why?? Well, mainly because like the Polar Express the characters where hideously ugly, moved like zombies and terrified the kids even when they where supposed to be kind humble characters!! Worse of all the cinema was empty, spooky and the film was simply boring!!! Oh one last thing, the end had no feel good atmosphere or Christmans spirit. Lousy soundtrack!! HAd more fun looking at an old Charles Dickens Xmas Card!! Role over Jim Carey, your days are over too!!",A Christmas Carol
192,hbenthow,"One of the better adaptations of ""A Christmas Carol"".",8,31 May 2011,"I once caught the last 30 minutes of ""A Christmas Carol"" (2009) on television several ago, and was somewhat disappointed. The character animation was of a strange sort, almost realistic in shape and movement, but yet without realistic texture. The result was that they looked like something out of a video game....and a little creepy. Plus, there was a coach chase that seemed out-of-place. On the other hand, I found the music to be excellent.A few days later, I caught it again, this time from the beginning. Oddly enough, my reaction was completely different this time around. I found it visually spectacular, and the characters had entirely lost their creepiness. The movie no longer looked like a video game, but like an oil painting magically come to life. I wound up thoroughly enjoying it.The visuals take a while to get used to, but are actually quite spectacular. I would not want to see this style of animation become the norm, as I believe that animation should be more stylized. If animation gets any more realistic, it might as well be live-action. As it is, some people have said that about this movie, and I can't say that I entirely disagree. However, it worked perfectly for this movie, as it gave it the look of an oil painting come to life, enhancing the atmosphere. The characters' facial expressions are impeccably copied from actor to digital image, without losing any of the soul or emotion, and the backdrops are breathtaking.The actors are all excellent in their roles. Jim Carrey is excellent as Scrooge. The voice, expressions, mannerisms, and emotions are all well-done. Gary Oldman, as usual, is excellent in his multiple roles as Bob Cratchit, Marley's ghost, and Tiny Tim.Alan Silvestri has been phoning it in for a few years, composing fairly good but forgettable scores for the ""Night at the Museum"" movies and ""G. I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"". However, this time, he pulled out all the stops and gave us the type of bombastic musical tour de force he is known for. The music is appropriately ""Christmasy"", and at the same time bombastic, with some parts triumphant and others dark and menacing.For the most part, the movie was remarkably faithful to the book, easily one of the most faithful adaptations. However, there were two odd changes that came out of nowhere. One is when Scrooge extinguishes the Ghost of Christmas Past. As he pushes the snuffer down, it blasts off thousands of feet into the air, with Scrooge hanging on for dear life. He eventually falls, screaming, back into his own bedroom. The scene is bizarre, and doesn't really make sense. The second is a carriage chase, with the Ghost of Christmas Future chasing Scrooge down the streets of London with a coach and four creepy, red-eyed horses. Scrooge then falls down a drainpipe, thus shrinking to a few inches tall. The following scene is right from the book, only with a shrunken Scrooge, and some added humor. This scenes, as well, came out of nowhere. It was rather pointless, and stopped the plot for a few minutes. However, it was beautifully shot/rendered/whatever it is, excellently scored, and very atmospheric, so it's not a huge flaw.Overall, I found it very enjoyable. Like most adaptations, it deviated a little from the book, but other than a few slight changes, it is remarkably faithful, with most of the dialogue being word-for-word from the book. Other than the Ghost of NASA Past liftoff scene and the carriage chase, it was almost perfect.",A Christmas Carol
193,dashopaholic,Disney and Jim Carrey's A Christmas Carol,3,21 November 2010,"Definitely watch the RATING on this one. It IS too scary for wee ones! That said, I have to say I didn't care for it. Director Zemeckis's interpretation of Charles Dickens book wasn't very good. Then weirdly he threw humor into. When the ghost of Scrooge's partner, Marley comes to see him, his head wrapping comes undone when he gets really upset and his jaw then starts flopping madly and his tongue lolling crazily out of his mouth. Why? It served no purpose and was NOT funny. Just really gross. Jim Carrey as Scrooge is just a major miscasting. Gary Oldham who played Bob Crachit would have been a better choice! I spent a buck on this one at redbox so I can live with the loss of $1. But I would be TICKED off if I had spent my minimum wage salary on this one at the theater! The critics had tons to say about the computer generated The Polar Express. #1 that it was just too creepy to watch. I loved The Polar Express. But I definitely get what they meant. This one is just creepy. There are so many GOOD versions of this movie out there. You would do better to view one of them! LOVE the Muppets Christmas Carol; Mickey's Christmas Carol; the musical Scrooge with Albert Finney; Alistair Sims 1932 version; Patrick Stewart's version; even Henry Winkler's An American Christmas Carol!

This will become a modern day Christmas classic rewatched year after year.,A Christmas Carol
195,bateman_1116,Awesome!,8,10 November 2009,"One of my favourite stories,even if told by the Muppets! Carrey does a great impersonation of Alistair Sim, the best version of course. The animation steals the show but can't conceal a very great story. Not for the little one's I think, unless you want to pay the therapist's bills after. Carrey does a great many voices in the film and there is a nice touch that all the characters, although animated you will recognise by there facial characteristics. Zemeckis does a great job and you feel he steers it nicely along. A real Disney film, the best since Ratatouille and I will be buying this one on blu-ray, hopefully in 3D, the best way to see it. Go and see it. Really.",A Christmas Carol
196,surirockz94,A visual Delicacy With a Mediocre Takeover,7,20 March 2016,"Charles Dickens classic tale ""A Christmas carol"" was a piece of envision journey through humane and morality things. This adaptation was quite good with its delightful visual style and tone, but director Robert Zemeckis made it too slow inits pace and delivering the content.Coming to the visuals it was a motion capture computer generated image film which was an innovative and fascinating in every moment. A delightful sight of humans ethics ans perception.The actors were marvelous as they were every time, mostly Jim Carrey the comedy king who depicts the story within himself in three different roles and emotions.Portraying the aftermath of a human with three ghosts of past, present and future in one dream on the eve of Christmas night was a level of balancing the human with god making everyone happy and his life meaningful, but the storytelling of the film was a bit too slow paced which makes you impatient .....Good, can be GREAT",A Christmas Carol
197,castleread,Brings a classic to life in all its brilliant glory!,10,19 November 2020,"I saw this in the theater during its original release and full 3D glory. Faithful to the book and Dickens' dialogue, this version brings the story to life in a way only accomplished through animation. This was never intended as a children's story in the first place, so any criticism for that is uncalled for. (For kids, see the charming Muppets version instead.) This is a story about greed, repentance and redemption. A worthy lesson for anyone. Brilliant voice acting from Jim Carrey and Gary Oldman reveals their reverence for the classic. Colorful, clever and engaging. A must-see every year!",A Christmas Carol
198,Taigan,A mostly faithful rendering.,7,6 November 2009,"This is one of the most faithful renditions of the original Dickens Story that I've seen. Almost all the dialog is taken verbatim from the book and the settings mesh easily. The 3d effects are, for the most part, enjoyable (although I find them to be most effective in creating an illusion of depth, not when they make things come out of the screen.) The design of the Ghosts was well done. The appearance of the Ghost of Christmas Future was wonderfully eerie. And Present was wonderful. Past looked good, but its ""flickering"" physicality got a bit distracting.Jim Carey performs admirably in this. His Scrooge is spot on and has none of the Jim Carey mugging that I was afraid of. His performance as the Ghosts is also enjoyable though some may be put out by the choice of accent for the Ghost of Christmas Present. The other voice actors did well also. I didn't realize until the credits that Carey was not the only one wearing multiple hats.My biggest problems with this version were where it departed from the original story in the interest of spectacular visuals. The scene shown in the ads where Scrooge is riding the Ghost of Past's hat like a rocket is one such example but the most gratuitous example was the carriage chase scene with the Ghost of Christmas Future. It came from nowhere, added nothing to the story, and frankly distracted from the movie. It was like there was this five minute interruption in the movie where the animators showed off before going back to the story. Still, it was overall positive and a nice start to the Holiday season.",A Christmas Carol
199,ihazhart,Holiday Spirit? Yeah...for Halloween!,1,16 February 2011,"The makers of this movie took a beautiful story, butchered it as violently as possible, and then hung that slab of meat up in the store window and advertised it.I've always considered this as Dicken's best work. But this...this is a monstrosity. This is a abomination, a Frankenstein that somehow made theaters. Christmas spirit? Puh-lease! Every bit of warmth was sucked from this movie and replaced with the most ghastly, horrifying scenes imaginable.Here's what happened: it begins with Scrooge taking coins off his friend's CORSPE, only made creepier by the realistic animation. Then he goes home through a gloomy, downcast city filled with wretches. The knocker on his door not only turns into his dead associate, but screams and flings him down the steps. And when Marley confronts him, he is a terrifying being covered in chains and moaning. Then in a very unpleasant manner, his jaw comes unhooked, an unnecessary moment with the only purpose to freak the audience out. And the ghosts! Every single one of them scared even ME! The ghost of Christmas past, shaped like a candle, flickers and groans and shape-shifts his face in a rapid, nightmarish way.The ghost of Christmas present laughs maniacally while he rots to a skeleton, A clock chiming ominously. And the symbolic children are now skin-and bones, trapped in a straight-jacket and shrieking bloody murder. They make Gollum from The Lord of the Rings look like a cuddly teddy bear.Then the ghost of Christmas future...You can only imagine. He looked more like a Ring-Wraith than a ghost, but even *they* are less scary than him (sorry, I'm sure the LOTR references are getting old).If you want a good version of Dicken's classic, try the charming musical ""Scrooge"". But otherwise, stay away from this if you can help it.And above all, don't watch it for ANY holiday...except Halloween.",A Christmas Carol
200,mccurdy444,Better than I thought,7,9 November 2009,"I took my grandson to see this, but I was dreading it. I'm not a Jim Carrey fan but it's a Christmas movie, after all , so I bit the bullet and we saw it at the IMAX in 3-D.The visual effects are great, even though a lot of it was :""Look, we have 3-D!"" They stayed very close to the original story, though they added a miniaturization segment that was unnecessary. Carrey was muted and did a great job with some occasional clowning around. It was actually scary in some parts, as it should be, but not overwhelmingly, and there were some laughs as well.I have always enjoyed this story, because it's one of redemption, and there is no better time than Christmas to tell it. It shows people being compassionate, even in the face of someone as seemingly heartless as Ebeneezer Scrooge. I was first exposed to this story as a little boy watching the animated version with Mr. Magoo that came out in 1962 and is shown every year on TV. There are many such movies that define the season and I truly expect this to be one of them, along with Christmas Story, Home Alone, Miracle on 34th Street, and It's a Wonderful Life.Like the Macy's Parade, we all have our list of must-see holiday movies, no matter how many times we have seen them. I really expect this to make this list, with one caveat- I'm not sure how well the non 3-D version will translate to the TV screen. But the story is timeless and this movie does a good job of telling it.",A Christmas Carol
201,bobbo72,Great rendition of Christmas Carol,9,19 November 2009,"At first I thought this would be awful. I dreaded seeing this classic Dickens tale made into a farce by Zemekis (he has the rare gem, but usually his movies are awful). I expected Jim Carrey would be hamming it up as Ebenezer. To make matters worse, it will be a kiddie 3-D Cartoon no less.My wife dragged me kicking and screaming to this and I was extremely pleased that I could not be more wrong. Carrey does a very good job, bordering on brilliance, in his roles as Ebenezer and the 3 Ghosts of Christmas. Collin Firth and Gary Oldman provide excellent supporting roles.Great performances, but the visuals are the real star here. Yes, this has the same motion capture as Beowulf and Polar Express, but this was a great improvement on both. It didn't have the chilly computerised look and feel of those two movies, this had an amazing warmth that had you completely immersed into the picture.Really a great surprise for those doubters.",A Christmas Carol
202,moviefreak907,A pleasant surprise!,8,12 December 2009,"I was eager to see this movie, yet so afraid that Jim Carrey would turn it into a slapstick comedy and take away from the book. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the script of the film was taken almost directly from the book, verbatim. The characters were excellent representations of Dickens' descriptions, right down to their words and clothing. The movie really made you feel the story. For me it was like reading the book all over again, with sights and sounds perfectly complimenting it. The animation was remarkable in terms of the fact that at times I actually thought I was looking at real people; however, the characters seemed to lack emotion. With the exception of Scrooge, the Ghosts and possibly Crachit, everyone looked as if they had been cut from the same mold. The 3D effects, though perhaps not as dramatic as advertised, were a nice bonus feature, and very good during the snowing, raining, and ""Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come"" parts.I would give this movie 8 stars out of 10, only because some parts might be a bit dark and intense for some. But overall, this was a fantastic movie that I'd gladly watch again!",A Christmas Carol
203,divagal2000,3D is the bomb!,8,26 December 2009,"I was completely blown away by the 3D effects of Disney's A Christmas Carol! I remember watching Hondo in 3D YEARS ago, and being awed by the effects, but those were a pale comparison to what I saw in A Christmas Carol! It was like being in the same room with the characters, or out on the street watching them. I loved how those effects drew me into the 1800's, and allowed me to see what life must've really looked like then. Until they develop ""smell-evision"", 3D is the next best thing! Having said that, I truly longed for the creators of this movie to have spared us the roller-coaster ride through London with Mr. Scrooge, as well as the interminable shrinking of Mr. Scrooge, and instead have spent more time developing the characters. Yes, we are most of us very familiar with them already, but this was the first time I have ever experienced this story in any form where Tiny Tim did not tug at my heart. Not enough time was spent drawing us into what really caused Mr. Scrooge to learn to love him. Besides that though, this movie really blew me away. I can't wait to see it on DVD (or, in the future when they figure out how to bring this into our homes without the glasses). P.S. I LOVED Gary Oldman as Bob Cratchit!",A Christmas Carol
204,roadwaycircus,Spectacular,10,23 November 2009,"2 days ago, I saw this movie in theaters.I loved it!The f/x and visuals were very lively. And, in my opinion, Jim Carrey is probably the best Scrooge. He brings life to the character and also takes his role very seriously.The one thing I'll remember about this film is the nightmare scene with Scrooge and The Ghost of Christmas Present.

206,longj65,Breathtakingly beautiful!,10,25 November 2009,"I saw the 3D version of this movie on November 24. I was blown away right from the beginning as the movie takes the audience soaring over the rooftops of 19th century London, stopping every now and then to peer down into the windows of beautiful halls decorated for the Christmas season with tables being spread out with festive meals. Or down into the streets to see the common folk play and interact and work as they would have back then. The animation was superb, making me think at times that I was watching a live action movie with real actors. The movie made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me want to see it again. And it stayed pretty true to Charles Dickens' intention for writing the story, that of keeping the spirit of Christmas alive every day and feeling empathy and compassion for our fellow man. And the movie wasn't a watered down ""happy holiday"" movie that we've grown accustomed to in this day and age when saying the word ""Christmas"" at Christmas time is not politically correct. There are many beautiful traditional Christmas songs sung throughout the movie. I would recommend any fan of A Christmas Carol, no matter how many versions you've seen, to see this one (and in 3D before it leaves the theaters!).And for people who say this isn't for children: the theater was packed with children when I went. Their ages ranged from approximately 2 years to 7 or 8 (and of course teens and adults were there, too). Not a single child screamed or cried or whined, and I heard many of them around me ooooo'ing and ahhhh'ing over the movie and laughing at the funny parts (which are numerous).",A Christmas Carol

208,KongKongAGAIN,Surprisingly Brilliant,10,24 December 2010,"As have most people in American culture, I have, since I could, seen countless re-tellings of Charles Dickens's, ""A Christmas Carol."" Beyond the cute and colorful Mickey-Mouse renditions, I've found most to be repetitious, uninspired, and ghastly effusive tributes to some vague ""Christmas spirit"" that, by the end of the usually one and a half hours, I've found myself more annoyed with than enchanted by.It's as unexpected as it is wonderful, then, how Robert Zemeckis's attempt at the classic tale is more opposite to these attributes than anyone even could imagine is possible. A story so numerously recited surely must have extinguished any hope for creativity or meaning, mustn't have? Evidently not. Zemeckis handles his film with a level of humanity and maturity, thoughtfulness and sincerity I never thought could even be found in the pages of Dickens's nineteenth-century novella.From its visually arresting imagination, to its enveloping sounds, to the perfect performances delivered by its cast of voice-actors (most notable among them, Jim Carrey, in the leading part), this version of ""A Christmas Carol"" is not only among the finest interpretations of the classic story, but it is, I believe, one of my new all-time favorite Christmas films.",A Christmas Carol

Therefore, I shall write that I thoroughly enjoyed this version. The opening sequences of Victorian London are breathtaking. I could have watched those for an hour and a half! The story remained true to Dickens' vision (should he have chosen to use that word) I am very glad to say. It is one of the very few films in which I did not feel sleepy during recent visits to the cinema and that's a joy to write. Yes, Dickens' message arrives loud and clear. Now we arrive at the deficit side of the argument. Jim Carry is fantastic...normally. Nevertheless, he occasionally slipped into the realms of Mary Poppins; Dick Van Dyke territory and it's so noticeable. Enough to produce a little smile of embarrassment. An Englishwoman notices these things. More has to be written. There was little emotion. It was bland and the film had no heart. The artwork, animation and presentation was flawless, except a little more work needs to be put in on producing flames. Haven't quite got there yet. But let's give it a resounding yes for FX! Well done all. It's not easy getting me to cry over a drawing, but I will admit to producing two tears during the performance.

Here are some excerpts from our reviews of ""Disney's A Christmas Carol.""Albert's Take: ""'A Christmas Carol' represents a new height for animation as both an art form and as technology – every character and environment is a visual marvel, endlessly fascinating and absorbing. Heard of the Uncanny Valley? Neither has this movie. ""On the other hand, it's still 'A Christmas Carol' – same slumber cap, same four-poster bed, same lockboxes, same flowing robes  you get the picture. ""How curious that the filmmakers chose Dickens' classic as the showcase for what has to be the most state-of-the-art animation to grace movie screens. The story is time-worn and familiar to begin with – if we can't exactly quote from it, we can practically finish every other line – and the filmmakers do painfully little to adapt it, evoking an uneasy déjà vu about the character design and plot developments. ""So while it may be worth watching as a barometer of how far animation has advanced, 'A Christmas Carol' will probably be remembered foremost as a missed opportunity – or as a sign of great things to come."" Don's Take: ""Robert Zemeckis brings us a spiritual successor to his 2005 film, 'The Polar Express' with an up-to-date version of the Dickens classic 'A Christmas Carol.' He makes almost no attempt to embellish here and stays staunchly faithful to the source material. Jim Carrey speaks with a sneering British accent, and we get the familiar stories of Tiny Tim and Bob Cratchett, and Uncle Scrooge's well-meaning-albeit-smugly-meddlesome nephew; it's all there and done quite well. ""{Zemeckis's} telling of the story, while hardly original, is lucid and sincere. There are moments in the film that I was unexpectedly moved. The scenes revolving around his younger, more carefree days and the scenes involving the wife he lost on account of his selfishness and greed were especially effective.""Please visit our blog and read our full reviews.

211,mileydurbin,A Fine Resource For Anyone Interested In Directing,9,4 December 2009,"I had no idea I would have this much fun seeing ""A Christmas Carol"". I have seen practically every version, and I wasn't too thrilled to see exactly how Disney portrayed it, especially with Carrey as Scrooge.I love how the film opens and ends with the book ""A Christmas Carol By Charles Dickens."" The opening credits were amazing; it took you through the little Victorian town and made you feel like apart of the movie. I found it very creative and fun. As my favorite part, I'm torn between when Marley comes to visit (the shot is on the door, and you can hear his chains being dragged up the steps, and when they stop at the door, the doorknob slowly turns) and the Ghost of What Is Yet To Come visits (when Ghost of Christmas Present dies, Scrooge finds himself in an old clock tower. It's eerie, and all you hear is the ticking of the clock, while a large shadow of the ghost looks as if it's coming from or behind Scrooge. When Scrooge turns around, nothing's there; it's just a shadow. When Scrooge questions the ghost, the ghost neither moves nor replies. It gave me the chills!) The one thing that captured my attention most was the directing. Since I plan to become a film director, I'm always paying attention to things in a movie other than the plot or the acting. I highly recommend this film for anyone who wants to have a career in film.Another thing that I liked was how detailed the animation was. I'm not too big on computer animation, but I thought that this film was wonderfully done- it was so detailed! It grossed my mom out, but I reminded her that people back then probably did look gross and dirty up close (that still didn't change how grossed-out she was).I thought that the Victorian town was beautiful. I've always been into stories that take place around that same place and time, and though it was used as a brief background, it was incredible! (I also pay attention to the setting and lighting of films.) The only thing negative I have to say is that since Jim Carrey was in it, they felt they had to be funny about it, when really, it was pretty creepy and affective without it. I was really surprised that this was a Disney movie, because I felt it was driven more toward adults. Not only were so many scenes creepy and haunting, but the language they used was sometimes hard to follow. They used mature terms (not inappropriate) that even I sometimes had trouble following.ONE LAST THING: the only regret I had when seeing this movie was not seeing it in 3D.",A Christmas Carol

Well, let's just say, I was not a fan.Mr. Carrey was vocally distinguishable in ever role that he played, and not in a good way. I could live with that. What I cannot live with, however, is the fact that Ebenezer Scrooge is British! Is Carrey unaware of this? Has he never read Dickens? Does he not know that this is set in Victorian London?

213,grzinnj,Prescription glasses kept me and wife from 3D movies ... until now.,9,16 November 2009,"This is not so much a review of the movie itself, but a review of our first experience of a 3D movie. Our misconception prior to seeing this movie was that wearing the 3D glasses over our oval-rimmed prescription glasses would be cumbersome, awkward and too much of a hassle to bother with. So, we were relegated to the 2D version of the movies.With this movie, we finally decided to give in and just go for it.As it turns out, the 3D glasses fit perfectly over our prescription glasses! Not awkward at all. Would I prefer the option of a clip-on version of 3D glasses? Of course, but we can definitely deal with these 3D glasses. And we will see many 3D movies in the future.Not only was the movie 3D, but also the preceding trailers and the green trailer rating screens. It was interesting to see how things did actually appear to be in front of other things. An amazing bit of the 3D effect are the snowflakes! SPOILER! I took a peek outside the glasses to see how the 3D magic is done. I noticed that things close up are sharp, but things in the distance are blurred or doubled. Very Interesting.The 3D brings new life to a story that was previously 2D. Jim Carrey does a great acting job, as always. Though it costs an extra $4, I would definitely recommend this movie to bespectacled movie goers!",A Christmas Carol
214,mrsmagloo,"Strange Like ""Polar Express"" but Ultimately Satistifying",9,6 December 2009,"My family (including my very rapt 8-year-old grandson) were lucky to see this in a ""Medical IMAX,"" which is state-of-the-art, and were not disappointed. While the preview of Disney's upcoming 3-D ""Alice in Wonderland"" with Johnny Depp looked more colorful and eye-popping, ""A Christmas Carol"" had me laughing and crying out loud, even gasping in fear. The technique used to animate is uncanny (the same one used in ""The Polar Express, and Scrooge's fiancé Belle and other minor characters did look rea in spots), I still didn't always like it. What DID like were the animation of the Three Ghosts, in particular, the Ghost of Christmas Past. That thing that will haunt me for the rest of my life. Part Gray Alien, part Caspar, part alter ego, it is one's life flashing before you at the moment of death. Hand's down, it is THE best depiction of this particular Dickens character. Quite frankly, it deeply shook me to the core. The Ghost of Christmas Present dazzled me with his beautiful room and ability to be everywhere at once while still being in the same room, which is the idea Dickens was trying to convey in the first place. The mostly two-dimensional simplicity of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Be was brilliant. His silence and darkness is what scares us most about the future.Kudos should also go to the incredible attention to the detail of the period costumes, furniture, and warm hues of the wood, the metal, and every scrap of fabric, every whisker on a animal, even the hairs on Scrooges nose were carefully put in. Detail was a priority to everyone involved in the this movie. Bravo!Finally, it is Jim Carrey's vocal and facial performances, not only as Scrooges (in all stages of life), but as ALL THREE GHOSTS, that should challenge the Academy to create a new category, for best performance by a lead actor ... in an animated film! One hundred and sixty-six years after he published it, Charles Dickens would (if still with us) count this incredible adaptation of ""A Christmas Carol"" as on of the best. The 1951 Alastair Sim version, of course, IS the best, but for me, George C. Scott's tour de force performance in 1984 is damned close. There is also a rarely aired 1971 animated version that is incredibly sublime, and available on DVD. Do check it out.",A Christmas Carol

The graphics and animation are quite beautiful the attention to detail is fabulous.Though not a fan of Jim Carrey, his performance was brilliant, in all the roles . The only aspect of the movie, I was put off by was Scrooge's (Jim Carrey's) strange accent. Although, this could have been the accent spoken in England, the time Scrooge lived. The movie can also be a little scary in certain scenes for the younger kids. It sure gave me a fright or two! Reading the book before the movie definitely makes watching it a better experience as is the case with most book adaptations.",A Christmas Carol
217,nkskipper92,What in the world?!,4,7 November 2009,"Let's open with the good stuff: first, for the traditionalists, the movie actually follows the book fairly closely. And second, visually, the movie is absolutely incredible, even in 2-D. And Jim Carrey is actually a fairly decent voice for Scrooge.Now, in case the point hasn't been made clearly enough: THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR YOUNG KIDS. My 10-year-old had his hands over his eyes for sizable portions of the movie, particularly the ""death scene"" for Christmas Present, and the hearse chase with Christmas Future. And Marley on the doorknocker has to be one of the scariest things I've ever seen in a Disney movie.At times, the animation is almost crude. Fan looks like the guys who draw Shrek were having a bad day and drew her instead.But the story ... this is such a wonderful story. What was the point of doing it this way? Forcing Carrey to do so many roles that he ended up picking an almost-unintelligible one for Christmas Past? Having Scrooge shrink to half the size of a rat? Pretty much completely ripping off Edward Woodward's rendition of Christmas Present from the 1984 version, before inexplicably having him die and decompose? Truthfully? Save your money. Watch the Sim, Scott, or Stewart versions on television, and if you must, rent this one next Christmas.",A Christmas Carol

219,imgeorg,I paid to see the IMAX version twice. It's that good.,9,29 November 2009,"Charles Dickens' books weren't originally written for children at all. They were dark, yet truthful allegories on life for the common man in Victorian England. Given that background, then, I don't expect to have to watch a black-and-white grainy film with horrible sound to experience a ""moving"" version of Dickens' a Christmas Carol. I was moved, amazed and a couple of times made seasick by THIS version. I thought it was wonderful. I had never experienced IMAX or 3D, and taking a chance on this film because the Michael Jackson movie was no longer showing was pure serendipity. I was amazed at how lifelike computer images could become now. It was like the technology they use on quBo's ""Jane and the Dragon"" only the detail is 1000 times better! Hair, skin, clothing, textiles, a candle's flame - I was astounded by it all. AMC theater provided me with cool goggle-like 3D glasses that weren't the cheesy red/blue paper kind but a greenish/ mauve combination that fit reasonably well over my prescription lenses. From that point I pretty much viewed the film - twice, once in Boston and again in Oklahoma City - with my mouth open in amazement. Younger children (grade school and younger) will need to stick to the Donald Duck version. More mature kids who have a tolerance for scary movies will enjoy this, unless of course they feel it wasn't scary enough! I myself didn't flinch even once, but remembering that none of this was real always helps in that regard! And if you stay for the credits and appreciate reading the names of those who pulled off this technological coup, you are rewarded by Andrea Bocelli's beautiful Christmas song, ""God Bless Us Every One"", performed as nobody else can do it. I don't know if buying the DVD will be as enjoyable, unless they include copious amounts of Director's commentary to talk about the wonderful special effects. Dickens' story is all there, so what if they embellished a little, we all know how it ends before we even go to see it. For me is was that trip from beginning to end that has sold me on this film. I hate Jim Carrey, but I loved this film. I have definitely been spoiled now by this technology and hope more films will be made this way. This is the first 3D film I have ever seen on the big screen - thanks to Disney's A Christmas Carol, it won't be the last.",A Christmas Carol

The only good part about it was the end.",A Christmas Carol
222,pawlikowski,"More Like ""Disney vs. A Christmas Carol""",4,12 December 2010,"I'm a big, big fan of ""A Christmas Carol"" movies, including the 1938 version with Reginald Owen; the 1951 version with Alistair Sim (my favorite); the 1979 ""An American Christmas Carol"", with Henry Winkler; the 1984 version with George C. Scott; the 1992 ""A Muppet Christmas Carol"" with Michael Caine; and the 1999 version with Patrick Stewart.All of these are superior to ""Disney's A Christmas Carol"".First and foremost is the very creepy motion capture animation. I had the sense of watching a soul-less, zombie life form. It's creepy in the same way that scary clowns and ventriloquists dummies are creepy - they're imitations of life without being alive.Next are the deviations from the book. I well understand that a novel is not a movie script, and things may be added or removed to make a good movie, but the chase sequence where Scrooge shrinks to the size of a mouse was little more than an excuse to show off the animation tech. My wife and I were getting impatient halfway through the chase - I can't imagine how it would hold the interest for a younger audience.Patrick Stewart used to perform the entirety of ""A Christmas Carol"" alone on stage, with little more than a hat, scarf and cane as props. That's the beauty of it - the story is so compelling, it needs little to draw the audience into Scrooge's world.In this Disney version, I found the animation competing with the story, and too often, the animation won.It's not all bad. Jim Carrey's vocal work is terrific - far better than I expected. The dance sequence at Fezziwig's was magical, and Gary Oldman's Marley's Ghost was great.Still, this won't become a tradition at my house. I'll still run the 1951 Alistair Sim version on Christmas Eve, and one of the others on Christmas Day, and recommend you do the same.",A Christmas Carol
223,lucas9109,A Fun Ride! - Must see in 3D,8,6 November 2009,"A Christmas Carol was very entertaining and the animation was superb. You must see it in 3D! However, kids who go and see this movie probably won't understand the majority of the dialogue and will probably get lost. It has a lot of adult situations and the accents are pretty thick as well. Also, don't let the PG rating fool you. It's actually quite mature and in my opinion it's more suited for adults than kids as far as the dialogue and story goes. I think both kids and adults will love the animation and have a lot of fun - especially in 3D! Unfortunately, that might be the only thing the kids will like...Nonetheless, it's a great film and it's definitely Oscar worthy for the animation. I'll definitely be seeing it again in theaters and in 3D!",A Christmas Carol
224,ReaptheChaos,Not really a family film.,4,7 December 2011,"Not exactly what I was expecting from an animated Disney movie. In fact, for an animated feature I doubt children would even understand most of this film, let alone enjoy it. If you're looking for a cheerful family flick, you simply wont get that here. Though an animated feature, this movie stays accurately true to the original book written by Charles Dickens in 1843, both in tale and in dialogue .It's my opinion that this would have been better filmed as a motion picture rather than an animated feature. Like most people, I expect animated movies to be more fun, even a serious tale like A Christmas Carol could have been told with a few light-hearted laughs thrown in to lift the mood.",A Christmas Carol
225,matrixblde,Pretty Good,8,7 July 2011,"I was surprised to find this movie was rather enjoyable. The dialog is really close to the book version, including the time it takes for the three spirits to visit. This is a Dickens story done with Jim Carrey produced by Disney, NOT a Disney rewrite of a popular story pandering to four year olds. The story is supposed to be scary as for the whole reason behind the plot. Scrooge is scared into changing his ways. The language is old English and some people or children may have a problem understanding parts. The visual aspect of the movie is really good, 2D only since I can't watch 3D. The visual aspect of the movie diverged at several points from the book, including a useless chase scene. For the added pointlessness of some scenes is the only reason I deduct two points. Some others have pointed out certain anomalies, such as the London Bridge, servant's bells, language use by the boy child, but that does not take away from the story. If you have never seen or read A Christmas Carol then you should do so before allowing your small children to watch this. After all the story was not written as a child's story.",A Christmas Carol
226,Cloud67,THE Christmas Movie of this year and Christmases-yet-to-come!,9,2 November 2009,"Hi there fellow geeks, greekgeek speaking!I just saw a press screening of A Christmas CAROL here in Hamburg, Germany.First things first: I'm a biiiiiig Zemeckis Fan from 1984 (ROMANCING THE STONE) and ""all the time through""! This means: even the trashed movies by fanboys like THE POLAR EXPRESS and BEOWULF.I just can't listen anymore to all of those complaints about his ""performance capture"" films. They always type the same boring stuff – my advise: don't go to these ""dreadful"" Films.I was never a big fan of THE POLAR EXPRESS (love Alan Silvestri's Score) but I'm still a big supporter of the project. BEOWULF was much stronger and A Christmas CAROL tops all of that.Jim Carrey's performance is stellar! He is this movie. Colin Firth and Gary Oldman are not even really supporting actors but Carrey runs the show. His Scrooge (especially the present day one) is the best thing ""performance capture"" ever put ""on film"".The film is fast-paced (good 90 minutes long) and very spooky (for a PG Film). It starts off with soft goose bumps with the Ghost-of-Christmas-Past, goes surreal with the Ghost-of-Christmas-Present and switches to FRIGHTENERS-Territory with Ghost-of-Christmas-Yet-to-Come.So, was the Film any good: yes, perfect storytelling with perfect look – either you like good storytelling – then go see and love it, or you don't – then start bitchin' about ""performance capture"" all day long. I myself can't wait for YELLOW SUBMARINE and the next ROGER RABBIT! (or even productions like MARS NEEDS MOMS, AIRMAN and STONEHEART)Oh, one thing I forgot: In front of A Christmas CAROL they showed the Trailer for PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME. Fantastic!!! They managed to bring all the jumps and moves of the Prince to life. Can't wait!This was just not even a real review; I just wanted to let you know that it is a great film. If I have time I will write more.",A Christmas Carol
227,mteuschler,Sorry I can't give it a 10 out of 10,8,8 December 2011,"When I heard that Disney was going to make a new version of A Christmas Carol, one of my favorite Christmas books, I was enthralled and hopeful. Then, I heard that they were planning to do the movie in the faddish 3D with the added threat of IMAX; and my enthusiasm was dampened. Not enough to force me to eschew seeing the movie, but enough to make me lose just a bit of enthusiasm. Regardless of the 3D/IMAX specter, I continued to look forward to seeing the movie and planned an outing with my oldest friend, Janet (50+ years of friendship), and my favorite movie partner, Donna (35+ years of friendship). I was still eager to see the movie and finally the big day arrived (of course it was the opening day!). We met at the theater (of course the movie was my treat to celebrate our friendships). We shuffled into the theater and scouted out what we thought would be good seats (about 10 rows back from the GIANT screen). The movie started and oh man, I got dizzy immediately. Then the superfluous scenes of sliding down frosty rooftops and gutters came and I nearly had to exit for the men's room. Bottom line? I think 3D/IMAX ruined the film for me. I would suggest anyone wishing to view it simply buy the DVD and watch it on a wide screen TV. I'm sure it will be much more enjoyable from that viewpoint. All in all, it's still one of the best Christmas stories ever written, and Disney didn't ruin that, but it would have been at 10 for sure without all the bells and whistles.",A Christmas Carol
228,Jonwo,A Dark and Delightful classic.,9,12 November 2009,"Robert Zemeckis, the main pioneer of Motion capture films with films such as The Polar Express, Monster House and Beowulf attempts a new version of a story that has been many times before and needless to say it doesn't disappoint. Jim Carrey is a revelation as Scrooge and the three Ghosts but his performance is so good that each has its own personality, Bob Hoskins and Colin Firth are very good as Crachit and Fred. The 3D in the film is stunning and Zemeckis uses to a great degree but it's never a gimmick. It is a faithful adaptation of the story but it's not for young children and several scenes were quite dark and scary which actually added to the film and it's not as heartwarming as previous versions but the happy ending remains. If there is one or criticisms is that some scenes went on a bit too long and some characters were not as well animated and suffered from dead eye.Overall, a great Christmas film and it does show the potential of motion capture and if they continue to improve it then it's going a great tool for filmmakers.",A Christmas Carol

230,fiftychance,"Barely worth watching, 3d and music saved it.",4,22 November 2009,"I'll keep this concise: The pace at the beginning is slow, took a while before I stopped considering leaving to trade in tickets.There's an entire ~10 minute scene dropped in; I assume to lengthen the movie, since it serves little other purpose except perhaps as a means of getting Scrooge from on place to another.Not for kids, particularly the over-done, ""boo!"" ghost attacks, presumably put in to show off the 3d.Music is well done, and 3d is still impressive.Anyone not familiar with the original book (story aside) might be confused at certain points. Some things work better in writing, and some references are downright esoteric in this day and age.I've heard some positive opinions of the acting in this, but there were some parts that seemed stilted and off - whether it was from the nature of the animation or the acting itself I couldn't say.If you're going to watch it anyway, I sure hope you like seeing Jim Carry grimace.",A Christmas Carol
231,oliver9184,Immediate thoughts on A Christmas Carol,6,4 November 2009,"If you like Charles Dickens's festive story/parable A Christmas Carol already, you will probably like this film; it seems very keen to stay close to its source. If Dickens (who died before there were any films) were to watch this version I think he'd like it too, though I would recommend he watch the 2D version lest his eyes accidentally pop out of his head.Jim Carrey made an acceptable Ebenezer Scrooge, I think, but it was much more Scrooge than Carrey which isn't really what I wanted to see. I wanted this film to be an excuse for Carrey to do his thing; there's about a hundred other film and TV versions of this story I could watch if I want to care about the story itself. I could even read the book if I really really care. But I don't. What I care about is Jim Carrey doing the sort of crazy voice and energetic physical acting that no-one else can do. As it is Scrooge's snappy Victorian voice, though good, wasn't recognizably Carrey, the character didn't look a lot like him and neither did any of the other ones he played. Most importantly though, and most pertinently considering how this film is a showcase for the motion-capture technique, Scrooge's actions were not recognizably Carrey. This was a big disappointment for me after I was so impressed with Beowulf, in which the characters all looked and sounded like the actors who played the parts. A Christmas Carol has a different look - its much more of a cartoon. The bottom line is that someone else could have done Scrooge and the rest of the roles with much the same effect - say Andy Serkis or Crispin Glover, both of whom can do excellent voices. And these aren't actors who could have done Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events. Whereas Carrey made Count Olaf his own in that film he hasn't been able - or allowed - to do the same with Scrooge here.If Scrooge himself is a disappointment, the Ghosts of Christmas Past and Present are even worse. Past has been imagined as a sort of insane nuclear candle with a face. When Scrooge has had enough of his past memories he (quite wisely I though) tries to snuff the spirit out with the large conical candle-snuffer it inexplicably carries, the ghost turns into a rocket and blasts Scrooge into the sky. This is the image from the poster you may have seen on buses. It's not Scrooge flying on an out-of-control witches' broom, as I thought, but Scrooge being blasted almost into outer-space by the Ghost of Christmas Past, a candle, who has taken exception to being snuffed out.Christmas Present is a jolly giant with red hair, a bit like God or Jesus or Noah or something - this is I think the familiar representation of this ghost. But Jim Carrey has voiced it using the oddest and worst voice I've ever heard him use. It sounds like a mix of all sorts of different regional British accents. And this ghost is not good-natured enough. I thought this was going to be one of the funniest parts of the movie, some light relief between the dourness of Scrooge's past and the utter terror of his future. But really Present acts like a bit of a brute, constantly picking Scrooge up, messing about with him, bashing him on the head et cetera during the course him showing Scrooge the visions of Christmas Present. This petty belligerence wouldn't be so bad except for his massive size compared to Scrooge's thin fragile frame and Present's horrible accent. This role should have been for Sean Connery really, because it felt like bullying and it wasn't very funny (I'm not sure if it was meant to be or not); I suppose this is down to the fact that I maybe had more sympathy for Scrooge at this point and I really disliked Present from the off.I think a big reason for why I didn't like this as much as I expected to considering Zemeckis and Carrey were involved is Disney. I didn't realize it was a Disney film until right before I went in. I am not generally opposed to Disney at all but major talents on both sides of the camera tend to have to compromise and adapt if they don't already fit in with the Disney way of doing things which at first glance isn't supposed to be that strict anymore but still sometimes is. But I cannot really blame Disney for this as A Christmas Carol is much more a Disney story than it is either a Carrey or Zemeckis one. To be fair Zemeckis and the design people have got away with a surprising amount of scary scenes here, I definitely think they will have pushed right up to what Disney would let them in the Marley and Christmas Yet to Be Scenes. But Carrey could have been much more Carrey without diminishing any of this film's broad appeal. Ultimately I don't know if Carrey's direction or the motion-capture techniques should be blamed for that, or even Carrey himself - could be be getting old at last?",A Christmas Carol
232,Daantja,My fav Christmas movie,8,1 December 2019,"After hundreds of adaptations and contemporary revisions on radio, the stage and screens large and small, most everyone who's lived through more than four or five Christmases knows Ebenezer Scrooge's tale. A miserly husk of humanity, Scrooge is a sour spirit whose withering glance gives chills to the warmest of souls. And even after his business partner, Marley, shuffles off this mortal coil, the long-in-the-tooth but short-in-the-heart Scrooge keeps up his penny pinching precepts.Why, he even lifts the twopence from his former partner's forever-closed eyes!In Polar Express engineer Robert Zemeckis' animated take, the now ghostly and gruesome Marley reappears on a dark winter's eve to offer Scrooge another two cents. The spirit laments his lost and squandered life, and he warns his old friend-in none too friendly terms-that unless he changes his ways, he too will be cursed to endlessly wander the spiritual plain carrying an imponderably long and heavy chain of woes.Scrooge is dubious, of course.

Most notably the Marley door-knocker scene and the Ghost of Christmas Future scene as well.I also loved the use of classic Christmas carols in the film.All in all, it was a great film, one that really needs to be seen in 3D, although I think it would be pretty good in 2D as well.",A Christmas Carol

Most of the lines in the movie came directly out of the book. Also, Jim Carrey provided a very moving performance of Scrooge. The only part of the film that I really hated was in the final scene where Bob Cratchit starts speaking directly to the camera. I hate it when characters do that, but maybe it's just me.The only thing I would warn people about is that it gets a little frightening for an animated film at times.

237,shyweltman99,Did this need to be remade again?,5,10 December 2009,"Is Hollywood so intellectually bankrupt that they cannot come up with an original story? How many times has A Christmas Carol been made? How many times can you return to the same well and expect to find different water? The temptation of CGI graphics was obviously too much to resist. I can just imagine the producers meeting in which they played with the idea of turning this classic story into an action flick. That way they could play up the parts that had been hitherto ignored in previous movies, play and teleplays. All of the aspects that had been minimized, or completed with less than stellar special effects could now be given the treatment they deserved. Or perhaps that was not Dickens' idea in the first place? Perhaps he concentrated on the dialogue? Perhaps he was more interested in the human condition than the visual imagery of ghostly effects? What you end up with in this latest approach is an emphasis on all of the least important aspects of the story to the detriment of all of the important aspects of the story. You end up with a visual feast that is empty of humanity, feeling, or emotion. The director and producers, in their drive to create mindblowing CGI, has forgotten what the story was all about. They have created a skeleton frame of the original story made up of all of the inconsequential parts and not one bit of the meat that is the heart and should of this timeless classic.",A Christmas Carol
238,Horrorfan73,Beautiful adaptation of this story.,9,20 November 2009,"I was so thankful that Jim Carrey was the character of ""Scrooge"" and not playing Jim Carrey. I really think, even with my love of 3D and this story, if he had been his (Comedic?) self, I would have walked out and requested my money back.This adaptation stays faithful to the original story and, at the same time, updates it for current audiences. The 3D is beautifully done and really enhances the story, as not just a visual picture on the wall, but an entire world existing before you. There were times when it appeared to be snowing in theater itself. Victorian England is brought to life as gritty, harsh, cold and later, a spectacularly warm and inviting looking world. They used the 3D in fresh new ways to tell the story. Having the ghost of Christmas present show scenes to Scrooge, where the audience is able to see the layers of dimension through the floorboards of the room.The action sequences, which do not overwhelm the story, are both fun and somewhat scary. This story is told the way it should be, as a dark and enlightening experience.I will still have to say that my favorite adaptation of this story is the 1984 version with George C. Scott, but this one is pretty close.",A Christmas Carol

It makes you reviewed again what that you has done and also, in this Christmas season, makes you think of those people that are in need and had been neglected for all the while. I did reviewed my life after watching this movie and asked myself, did i really contribute to the society of just being a selfish ones in the society like the main character of this movie did before he was evolved to be a better ones. I do not know whether ones life would be changed after watching this movie but this movie is the one that having potential to do so.

240,ayashadini,A perfect film,10,3 February 2012,"I've been a fan of Disney animation for years,and no doubt they were all great. However, 'A Christmas carol' checks in at top spot on my list of most favourite animation films. This film is utter perfection and pure candies for the eyes. The depth of the characters,the effects and storyline will leave you begging for more. This film might not really suit children but for the adults,its a must watch. I was kept in awe for the most worthy an hour and a half of my life. The film appears dark at times but that's overshadowed by the perfectness it displayed.This film has taken animation to a whole other level and it has set the bar high. I urge everyone to take some time out,grab some popcorn and some extra pants ,as it might come handy at certain scenes. All in all,an absolutely amazing experience a movie can ever provide.",A Christmas Carol
241,mark-norman-01,Dreadful,1,27 December 2011,"If there is a more execrable adaptation of this much-loved story then I have yet to come across it.Its lack of soul borders on the heretical, its humour so out of step with the sophisticated and subtle wit of Dickens that the entire project is as close to shameful as it is possible to get.Jim Carrey, an actor for whom I usually have great affection and admiration, is self-indulgent in the extreme and has a bewildering lack of affinity for - or understanding of - the original story and its true meaning. His accents are both mystifying and wholly unnecessary and one can't help but wonder whether any one of his three 'named' co-stars Colin Firth, Gary Oldman or Bob Hoskins, might actually have done a far superior job.Zemeckis, who has become something of an evangelist for live motion capture, appears to have failed, in rather spectacular fashion, to have grasped the fact that A Christmas Carol is a story about human redemption that has, at its core, a religious context ('Have you many brothers?' 'More than eighteen hundred' references the birth of Christ and suggests that each Ghost of Christmas, whether past, present or future, is an incarnation of Christ himself). Instead Zemeckis treats this as a straightforward ghost story, in the process removing the very heart of the message the story seeks to deliver.If you're looking for a heart-warming version of an ageless classic, choose Alastair Sim or Albert Finney or even George C. Scott. Choose Patrick Stewart or Kelsey Grammar. Choose the Muppets. But leave this one well alone.",A Christmas Carol
242,sussexbluenose,This version is more true to the Dicken's story than previous versions,10,23 December 2013,"In answer to some critical reviews regarding how bleak the film is, this is exactly how the Dicken's story was intended to be as he wrote a social story on the shocking poverty and the relentless pursuit of the Industrial Age. The animation was excellent with the right levels of rich colours and dark shadows. Overall the accents were good but I disagree that Jim Carrey's accent was strange if sounded to me that it was based on a London accent.The scenes with the three ghosts were incredible especially the first ghost of Christmas past.",A Christmas Carol
243,sara-warner,Too dark,2,25 November 2011,"The whole thing is too dark in both senses of the word. Dicken's stories can often seem dark but of all his tales A Christmas Carol has the most light and warmth and this did not come across at all. Definitely not suitable for younger children.The worst part for me is where Scrooge is being chased by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come and a coach and horses. The director has added in big action scenes where there are none at the expense of the story. In addition Jim Carrey did nothing for Scrooge's character. Carrey jokes about (badly) where jokes are not appropriate - even in the Muppet Christmas Carol Scrooge doesn't make bad jokes. I could not feel for Scrooge at all. I was neither disgusted by his greed and avarice nor happy for his enlightenment. When I got to the end of the film the only thing I was happy about was that it was finished (and if it wasn't for my husband I would not have watched it to the end).Having watched this on a movie channel I was also disappointed by the total blackness that engulfed almost every scene. Even with all the lights out and the brightness on the TV turned up full, in a number of scenes the screen was almost totally black. I have found this to be a problem with other films made for HD shown on regular TV but never to this extent.For a much better Scrooge, Michael Caine (Muppet's Christmas Carol) or Alistair Sim (A Christmas Carol). I understand that the Patrick Stewart version is good to so maybe I'll try that one next.",A Christmas Carol

245,leadcastle,"Unhappy, confusing, and very disappointing.",4,24 November 2011,"Going into this movie, I wasn't expecting a whole lot. I remember getting excited when I heard about it and growing less excited when I saw the trailers featuring scrooge flying around on a torch muff and shrinking in size. I saw it anyway, and here is my honest review of the film: The movie, right off the bat, starts with a grotesque image of dead Jacob Marley's face while two mortitians are preparing his coffin. From this point on, the film relies very heavily on using very creepy jump-scares that I'd expect from a typical summer horror film. Many of them not only stray from the book, but are over the top and unnecessary. They're scary and don't balance well with the lighter, actually visually pleasing parts of the film.The characters are a different story. Jim Carrey did well playing Scrooge, but this movie's version of Scrooge changed him from ""selfish old asshole"" to ""sick, sadistic bastard,"" made evident when he steals two coins from Marley's dead, closed eyes. The ghost's themselves vary greatly as well. The Ghost of Christmas Past looks like a candle with Jim Carrey's face, and he hisses when he speaks. The Ghost of Christmas Present is done well, except for his excruciating and very drawn out death by heart attack and decomposition. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come wasn't fantastic, and it was disappointing to see his character done mostly through a shadow. All of the other characters are done pretty well, give or take the poor dialogue pacing here and there.A good chunk of the movie contains a number of drawn out chase scenes, which are interesting at times but are 100% filler. There are some scenes that are scary, funny, and sad, but they aren't spaced well, and it leaves the viewer emotionally confused. The scene where Marley's ghost talks to Scrooge turns to creepy to forced comedy in a scene where no comedy belongs.On the other hand, there are plenty of well made, acted, and downright beautiful scenes that will lift your spirits and put you in the Christmas mood. The scenery and many of the visual effects are absolutely breathtaking, and really add a lot to a film lacking in so much else.Ultimately, even with all the beautiful scenery, the forced humor, scary scenes, and mixed emotions will leave viewers confused, unsatisfied, and even disturbed at times. With all of the regular complaints aside (the eyes looks dead, I wish Zemeckis would stop making these films blah blah blah) this was a big disappointment from such a great director. It had a lot of potential to be very memorable, but came off as confusing and creepy. It's not a movie for kids, but hey, animated movies don't have to be. It's not really a good movie either. There are so many other better versions of this beloved story, and this version will most likely make you feel unhappy. This movie is simply a waste of time.",A Christmas Carol
246,giuseppeabba001,Best adaptation ever!,9,2 December 2012,"A fantastic tale of festive wonder! For me, this film is the best adaptation of 'A Christmas Carol' to date. The enriching CGI helps unravel the classic tale of an old miser named Ebenezer Scrooge, who loathes Christmas and anyone who enjoys it. Accompanied by wondrous music composed by Alan Silvestri and perfect voice acting, the viewers are taken on a journey of joy, misery, fear and wonder in the world of a snow covered Victorian London. The Christmas ghosts also fulfill their roles in the film and some even manage to be truly scary! This movie manages to put you in the Christmas spirit while pulling you in and keeping you entertained.Definitely worth a watch and not to be missed!",A Christmas Carol

Strange to see a Disney movie drop the ball so hard.",A Christmas Carol
248,pemolloy,IMAX 3D vs. RealD,8,13 November 2009,"I saw A Christmas Carol in IMAX 3D, and was so impressed by it that I saw it again in RealD, the other 3D process in which it is being shown. I'd like to share some observations with you as to the similarities – and differences– that I observed between the two formats.The similarities: the 3D effect is essentially the same in both formats. That's not to say that there aren't differences in the 3D experience, but the ""depth"" of the image is as apparent in the RealD format as it is in IMAX. One method won't cause images to ""pop out"" more than the other will. And the extra ""dimension"" that the 3D effect imparts to the story is equally real.The differences:If your nearby cinema has the film in the IMAX format, it's probably also playing it in RealD, as well as in 35MM ""2D"". The IMAX ticket will be more expensive than the RealD ticket, and that will be pricier than the 35MM ticket. You do get what you pay for.The IMAX screen, being so large (70 feet or so across), takes up a larger swath of your vision than the RealD screen will (35 feet wide or so). Because the IMAX screen is so big, the 3D effect is more immersive than it is in RealD. This is most apparent in the film's four ""fly-through"" scenes (one at the film's opening, and one in each of the three ""ghost"" sequences). The 3D effect is the same either way, but because your eyes have less ""non-screen"" area to see around the picture area, you are more ""swooped up"" in those scenes during the IMAX screening than you are in the RealD showing.Sonically, no other theatrical experience can quite compete with IMAX, simply because the IMAX sound system has more speakers and more amplifier power than you are likely to find in auditoriums with the digital sound systems used for RealD or 35MM showings. If that is uppermost in importance to you, IMAX is your winner, hands down.Visually, there are some differences. Because it's film, the IMAX image has a certain amount of ""jitter"" to it. It manifests itself at the end of the film, during the credit roll. You will see some of that jitter on the screen, as the credits seem to ""stagger"" their way up the screen. The jitter is always there during the IMAX presentation, of course, not just during the credits. If you have noticed it before when you went to the movies, digital projection provides welcome relief from it.I saw the film in IMAX early in its run, but had I waited a few weeks to see it, I would expect to see that the print had accumulated some dust and scratches as it ran through the projector again and again; but the RealD screenings, which are rendered from a hard disk, would have none of those defects, even weeks after its opening.Then, there are the differences between the two 3D technologies, especially as they apply to the glasses worn to see each format.IMAX 3D relies on ""linear"" polarization. Its biggest drawback is that the surfaces of the glasses need to remain essentially parallel to the surface of the screen in order for the 3D effect to be optimal. And, the wearer's head needs to remain perfectly level throughout the screening. Tilt your head slightly, or turn away from the screen even a little, and the 3D image will start to ""ghost"" or produce visible after-images, particularly in areas of high contrast, such as credits against a dark background. Tilt your head too far, and the 3D effect goes away altogether.This means that your seating choices in the IMAX theatre, as large as it is, are limited. You want to sit dead-center to the image, both laterally and vertically, so that your glasses aren't tilted by you having to look UP or DOWN to see the image. Don't be faked out by the overall size of the screen as you walk into the theatre; this movie is in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, so it will not fill the entire height of the IMAX screen, only its entire width.If you see the film in IMAX 3D and then see it RealD, the first thing that you are likely to notice is that the IMAX image is a lot brighter than is the RealD image, but if you choose to see it only in RealD, that image won't appear to be ""dim"".RealD uses ""circular"" polarized glasses, and that means you don't have to be as careful where you sit, or how perfectly aligned your glasses are to the screen. Even if you tilt your head as far as you can, the 3D effect won't disappear, and ghosting will be far less obvious.Is this version of A Christmas Carol, with all of its technological wizardry, worth seeing, compared to any of the other movie or TV versions?Well, yes, it certainly is; the fantasy that Charles Dickens built into his story practically begs for it. And Jim Carrey acquits himself wonderfully in the role of Ebenezer Scrooge. Yes, you'll spot him - and his trademark facial contortions - beneath all that motion capture. Is it worth the extra bucks to see it in 3D?Absolutely, if for no other reason than to see how skillfully Robert Zemeckis and his team have manipulated it. The added dimension augments the terror that Scrooge feels as the spirits transport him to the edge and back.Is it worth spending the even bigger bucks to see it in IMAX 3D instead of RealD? If you care about such details as I have described here, and you have access to an IMAX theatre, sure. But is it worth driving 150 miles farther than another theatre playing it in RealD?Nah.",A Christmas Carol

I love the quality of the animation and the cast is top class.I would have given this film a perfect 10 BUT for the term ""Happy Holidays"". Happy Holidays? The clue is in the title, ""A Christmas Carol"". Yes, it's a Christian themed story of redemption written by Charles Dickens. In Victorian England, where the vast majority of people were Christian, they would have said ""Merry Christmas"".As Mr Scrooge said,""I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a school-boy.

Well, this version deserves credit. It is VERY close to the original tale (this points in its favour for me), but SO scary! My kids (10 and 15) did not seem as freaked out as me, but Marley's ghost, in particular, was terrifying. The jaw dropping off and all those chains were very scary. The superb 3D adds to the fantastic realism and overall impact. My only complaint is the Jim Carey's Ghost of Christmas Present accent is very odd. I assume he was aiming for a Lancashire accent, but missed the mark (ask any Brit - it was decidedly dodgy) Nevertheless, great movie!",A Christmas Carol
251,ashleyshell,Not a good choice to show to a class,4,20 December 2012,"After my 7th graders read a dramatization of the A Christmas Carol, I decided to show them this movie because of how faithful the dialogue is to the original. It turns out that it isn't so ideal for showing to a group of middle-schoolers.Much of the dialogue is WHISPERED by the characters. Some of the characters ONLY speak in a whisper (such as the Ghost of Christmas Past). I have to max out my volume controls in order to catch what's being said, and then suddenly something surprising will happen (such as when Jacob Marley shows up) and suddenly it's overwhelmingly loud, so I find myself constantly having to adjust.Also, there are a lot of drawn-out moments between scenes with no dialogue and little action, and combined with the sound issue, even my best students seem to have a hard time staying interested except for the over-the-top ghoulish scenes, which they seem to think are just strange.I might be able to deal with all of those issues if it didn't seem like the film was trying too hard to be ""cool"" visually at the expense of the story. There is surely a better version out there.",A Christmas Carol

The computer generated animation was fantastic, as well as the sound. Jim Carrey did a wonderful job of playing Scrooge. My favorite movie version is the classic, Scrooge with Alistair Sim as the title character. It is obvious that Jim Carrey's inspiration is indeed Alistair Sim, as he sounds just like him and some of his dialog is straight out of the Sim version. The 3D effects were probably the best I've ever seen and this plus the IMAX added greatly to the experience. I recommend seeing this film for the holiday season.

253,eag_83,NOT for very young children****Spoiler Alert****,8,10 November 2009,"****Beware spoiler**** While I did enjoy the movie very much I had the misfortune of sharing the theater with young children who were frightened and were constantly asking parents to take them home. I even heard one mother tell her child not to worry it will get better. It does not. The first appearance of Marly on Scrouge's door knocker made me jump and then when he came back to worn Scrouge of the three Ghost's visits it got a bit scary. While I found the Ghost of Christmas past a bit weird looking maybe a tad disturbing the children seemed to have no problem with him or the Ghost of Christmas Presant until the two ""children"" 'want' and 'ignorance' made their appearance and then the death of the ghost is a little disturbing. The Ghost of Christmas yet to come is where I heard a lot of ""I'm scared I want to go home"". To a child seeing Scrouge being chased by a black carriage pulled by two black red eyed horsed must be very frightening I know I covered my eyes at a few points and I'm an adult.

255,maria-neacsu,not quite a Disney story,10,3 November 2009,"Jim Carrey is full of surprises and the entire movie is a theatrical outburst of his talent, under the brilliant direction of Robert Zemeckis. Brilliant because it manages to make take the Dickens story and walk us through all its dimensions, without fear of sadness and, in the same time, he has the cold blood to use the magic wand for a happy end. I wasn't a big 3D fan until this movie, maybe because I didn't see any possibility to enrich the classical format, perfect as it became with the years... 'A Christmas Carol' gains a lot from 3D being a sensorial experience enhanced by IMAX technology.All in all, it's not a story for kids, because it's rather disturbing and contemplative.

256,bac522,2D movie not that good,4,15 November 2010,"I can only imagine that the 7 rating this movie gets here on IMDb is because of the 3D aspect of it seen in the movie theaters, but unless you have a 3D TV at home, the 2D version of this movie is rather uninspiring. First as someone who reads the actual Christmas Carol each year for tradition, if frustrates me when so many of these movies/TV shows stray quite a bit from the original Charles Dickerson work. This version isn't too bad until the third ghost appears, although the first ghost was just weird. The scene in which Scrooge is shrunk down to an ""Alice in Wonderland"" size is baffling to say the least and really detracts from the overall theme of the movie...it was at this point I lost interest in this movie. As for a Disney movie you wonder about the kid aspect of the movie, but outside of the 3D of the movie, most kids lose interest very quickly. The best Christmas Carol movie that kids will love is by far the Muppets Christmas Carol...spend you money on that DVD rather then this one! For those who are looking for the best Christmas Carol movie that attempts to stay close to the book, then check out the one Patrick Steward did in 1999 for TNT I believe...by far my favorite version of the Christmas Carol.

258,markmcc-1,A message this world needs now more than ever,10,7 November 2009,"With the near collapse of the world economy, the mass exodus of jobs overseas and the rampant corruption in governments worldwide, greed seems to be the prevailing concept driving pretty much all facets of our society. Anything is acceptable as long as it enhances the bottom line.In this selfish and gluttonous world, no message is more imperative than that so aptly delivered in this classic tale of greed and its consequences.After reading many of the comments on this board, I am reminded that there are many Scrooges among us who would like to skip the message altogether and judge the film strictly on its entertainment value and production qualities. I say if you're not in it for the message, you're missing the whole point.And the message is delivered with a skill that rivals any prior rendering of this masterpiece. I cannot remember a film other than possibly Passion of the Christ where I hung on every line with such anticipation and was never disappointed with the delivery of such poetry as that written by Dickens. I fought back tears over and over. I know many in the audience did as well. I could hear the sniffling.This is a classic tale and is treated as such but is told in such a powerful way using the latest technology. With the 3D we are inside the story, intimately involved with the characters, especially Scrooge. We can feel each and every emotion, each and every thought as it is born in his mind and oozes from his face so vividly detailed by the artistry of the animation. But the technology respects the story. It only serves to enhance it and embellish it in an enjoyable way and doesn't attempt to usurp or overpower it.Never before have we been able to experience Scrooge's journey in such a vivid and enveloping way. We are immersed completely in his nightmare. There is no limit to what the camera can explore. We feel like we are holding the hand of the ghosts ourselves as we are whisked around from place to place to witness Scrooge's life and lessons.Yes, Motion Capture tends to render many characters with lifeless mannequin-like eyes. However, this doesn't ruin the presentation and certain characters, namely Scrooge himself, seem to escape this effect.Zemeckis is brilliant. His use of 3D is, bar none, the best I've ever seen in any film. He uses it to help tell the story. Not as a novelty, but a tool to give us insight and to experience the wonderment of the tale.Carrey is spectacular. Many have said they are disappointed that this isn't typical Carrey. I think it's a credit to his true acting talent. He plays most of the major parts and delivers the lines with such pure poetry that Dickens himself would stand and cheer I'm sure.If this isn't Christmas magic I don't know what is. If this isn't a story for the ages presented in a way we've all wanted to experience since we first read it than I don't know what is.I say this is one of the world's greatest masterpieces told by a master.

Yes, not a fair comparison - Polar Express had a more upbeat storyline and, IMHO, the 3D graphics were better and broader in scope.If you want a decent storyline that is fairly true to Dickens novel, this will do it.

It was funny, scary, and unlike others who say this movie lacked emotion it was very emotional. You really started out hating Scrooge and ended up loving him, just how the story was meant to be. There is also an emotional part that even made some of the audience tear up, but at the end it really lifts you up and makes it feel like Christmas!I think this movie was awesome and would recommend it to everyone!

I would watch it again.I am very disappointed that the MPAA gave it a PG rating. I was aware that there would be scary images in the movie before I purchased my tickets. I was stunned. It was advertised as a family film for the holiday season but those statements were misleading. Beyond scary images and some cursing ( which the MPAA didn't state as a warning in their PG rating), there was an scene where the ghost of Christmas present is dying and a man comes at Scrooge with a knife and a woman dances around him with a not so subliminal message of prostitution. I'm befuddled as to how that slipped pass the ratings committee. Also there is a scene later in the film where three men are standing outside of a building and one actually appears to be snorting cocaine. If you have a child under 12, do not take them. Watch it yourself first and then decide what's appropriate. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES believe the ads for this movie.",A Christmas Carol

Dark ugly repulsive scenes including death, skeletons, drunkenness, theft from the dead, and worse. Disney should be ashamed for the misleading trailer. The whole film was was horrifying to watch. The rehabilitated Scrooge was all of about three minutes and didn't redeem the previous scenes. Jim Carrey was in love with the sound of his own laugh. The plot had major holes that they tried to cover with a line,""the spirits can do whatever they want."" Robert Zemeckis is so in love with this method of film-making that he used blunt force scare techniques instead of any subtlety. I wish very much we had not seen this film and I am going to spread the word to as many parents as possible that this film is inappropriate for children and to stay away.",A Christmas Carol
267,craigandkathleen1,An old story with a fresh telling,10,8 November 2009,"I brought my kids to the movie,I explained it is an old story that is about second chances. It's not a cartoon 1st with Christmas story second. It was written when author's who were successful could have all the spoils that the stars get now. It's a retelling of a very old story,placed back in time before electric,cars,or video games. It's almost as much of a history lesson as a story on second chances. So if 100 or so years of time travel scares you go see it and awe in the spectacle of the season and just enjoy it. I think it will be a classic as time goes by.Bravo Disney. Great for young and old alike but not a pixar movie. I would recommend this movie to a friend and will see it again before Christmas.",A Christmas Carol

Then there was a scene, Scrooge looking to his future at his funeral, men talking about his death and his money, a wealthy man takes a vile from his pocket then ""sniff sniff..."" Am I missing something? Because it seemed reminiscent of the movie ""Cruel Intentions"" There are a couple cuss words direct from the original book, referring to Scrooge.

The animation was very well done, although some of the features on the characters may have been a tad exaggerated. The film followed the book very well, and the overall flow of each scene was good. The Design for each of the three Ghosts were good, although I did have a small complaint on the Ghost of Christmas past being a little too ""bright"". If you are a fan of the original story or just wish to see a classic Christmas story, I urge you to see it.That being said this movie was not meant for kids under 8. Many of the scenes are scary, and the overall depressing nature of the film may not be suitable for children. If your child is sensitive, consider seeing another movie.",A Christmas Carol

I have not read the Charles Dickens book, and therefore don't know what the setting is like but the one in the movie blew me away. I watched it in 3D and the effects were amazing. I like the fact that although it is a Disney movie the ghosts were portrayed in a non-typical Disney fashion, and were actually kind of scary. Having said that, i don't think it would be a bad movie for younger audiences. Jim Carrey delivers again, and does voices that only Jim Carrey can do. I give it an 8/10 and would see it again.

This movie was way too intense and scary and should have been at least PG-13. Whoever decided it should be PG should be fired for misleading parents. Seriously, the ghosts, black horses w/red eyes, death, falling into a grave. The worst part was during the ghost of Christmas present, where the two creatures come out from hiding. They were not only scary, it was completely twisted! I was embarrassed that I brought the kids. Disney should be ashamed for labelling it PG.

As my fiancé said as we left the theater, ""This is the REAL Dickens!"" And it is--this isn't Mickey, even if it is by Disney. As far as the other characters go, if you can't tell Bob Cratchit's situation, or if you don't realize what Fred's attitude is toward his uncle (he literally SAYS it during his party), then you might not have been paying attention. I personally liked the 3D effects, and yes, the ghosts are scary enough to make smaller children run. That's good, in my opinion, since they're supposed to be frightening.Long story short, you'll really enjoy this film.",A Christmas Carol
273,shaded-589-252593,Disney's A Christmas Carol Has No Soul,2,22 November 2009,"Disney managed to dehumanize this very human story with cartoonish renditions of characters and stunts for the sake of 3-D effects. It is not that it is animated; but, the characters are not convincing like they are in the movies, Polar Express or Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs. Scrooge has this unrealistically huge head, spindly body and he appears near death from the beginning. One wonders how he could possibly live long enough to gain the reputation of keeping Christmas well. Scrooge seems to be some ghastly bobble head with his head precariously swiveling on his little body, floating about the screen. Tiny Tim gets scant attention. One is not endeared to his character as he is in almost any other version of this tale.The movie is set in very dark scenes throughout much of the movie making it unnecessarily oppressive. There are gratuitous scenes throughout apparently designed just to be able to make use of 3-D and Dolby sound which add little to the movie. In particular there is a scene that goes on and on in which Scrooge is chased by a hearse for reasons unclear. It is a pity, since 3-D effects used properly could have made this a stellar version of this classic. I will say that the 3-D is well done, but in this case detracts from the story rather than enhancing it.Save your money. Any other version is a more rewarding experience.",A Christmas Carol
274,mail-589-316719,brilliant,10,22 November 2009,Without doubt this is the definitive version of A Cristmas Carol. Absolutely brilliant. The 3d definitely adds an extra dimension to this sometimes dark version of the Dickens classic. Not particularly a fan of Jim Carrey but here he excels - and to me his voice and the animated Scrooge mimics the role as played by Alistair Sim in the 1951(?) black and white version. At times his voice could be mistaken for Mr Sim.This is definitely a must see film - but parents be warned - even though it comes from the Disnrey stable it is quite frightening for small children - definitely one for the adults. Well done Disney - a film that will become a classic.,A Christmas Carol
275,sarqoe,"Kinda slow for adults, but good for kids",6,23 November 2009,"I'm one for animation and especially when it's 3D - the 3D effects was very well done. While I like the story itself, and the moral of the story, i think it was slow to take off - if not the the 3D effects amusing me, I doubt I could even rate it at 6. Kids would enjoy it more than adults. They have a nice lesson to learn from this movie though teenagers could learn something from it too. The slowness is quite typical of ""charles dickens"" stories though, so if you like these fables, you probably would appreciate it more than most.Jim Carey fitted the Scrooge character very well. His ""skirt"" doesn't reveal much though whenever he falls. Maybe there is nothing drawn there. Oops.",A Christmas Carol
276,mowog01,Could have been great...,5,26 November 2009,"Watched this in 3D, and enjoyed it very much. The graphics were largely beyond criticism, and the 3D effects very impressive indeed. The dialogue was also good and seemed to stick closely to the original, and the whole thing rattled along at just the right pace. However, the whole movie was marred by Jim Carrey's appalling attempts at various regional British accents. The voice of Scrooge would have been bearable, but the (apparent) mock-Irish/Scots/Welsh of the Ghost of Christmas Past, followed by a Ghost of Christmas Present who seemed unable to decide where he came from (best guess: Yorkshire via Zimbabwe) was just too much. I suspect non-Brits might not even notice, but for me it spoiled the movie - it's a little thing, but it really grated after a while. Would some accent-training have been out of the question?A complete, researched and comprehensive list of American actors who can do a flawless British accent:(1) Johnny Depp (2) Gwyneth Paltrow (3) Gillian Anderson (4) That bloke who was in Heroes (5) Erm...

Some of the sequences made me cringe and I gasped aloud a time or two. When we left she said it was a really good scary movie. I thought the same thing. We are not, however, fans of modern horror and prefer our frights on a lower key than most of today's offerings. If you have an upper elementary or unsophisticated middle or jr high schooler this is a fun way to be scared. I wouldn't recommend it for younger children.I think that this movie is a reminder that Dickens wrote a ghost story intended to unsettle not soothe.",A Christmas Carol
278,cryos01,A Christmas Classic Retold,8,12 December 2009,"I just got back from watching A Christmas Carol (not the IMAX version), and I was rather impressed with it overall. It's not in the sense of comedic styling a ""child's movie."" It's an honest to goodness retelling of the Dickens novel as befitting such, albeit over-intensive on the third-person flying-through-London bits and somewhat slapstick on occasion. I found that as the movie began, it was pretty easy to be critical about it, but the Dickens charm just _shines_ through this. The characters are dynamic and complex, the musical scores of classic Christmas carols are both thrilling and tender, Jim Carrey manages to completely hide the fact that he's voicing like 8 different characters, and it's impressively animated, if a little fantastical at times.Even the flight scenes have a little Fridge Brilliance tucked in: Each sequence, you can see things that simply don't make sense, but given the interpretation of it being ""dreamlike"", it all makes sense. Scrooge doesn't realize the irrationality of the things happening around him at times because it's more like a dream than anything else. There's the sense of lucidity of the audience that can criticize his lack of awareness, but when things become truly strange, even they realize how utterly fantastic the things that are happening are. It feels like something that a psychoanalyst would jump all over: Some things happen that seem to not have a reason at all at the time, but develop psychologically that sense of confusion.I myself felt somewhat ""Scrooge transformed"" as the movie went on. I could be mean about its shortcomings, but after a while i just fell right in and took it as the heartwarming story that it was. Some scenes are deliberately ""shock"" driven, but such are dreams, aren't they? The bizarre and symbolic happenings throughout are key to the understanding of the overall effect that it has on Scrooge's temperament. It's deep, it's pleasing, and it doesn't try to add too much sentiment to the classic: it's the novel in a dimension compatible with all ages, not necessarily an innovative or revolutionary dimension, but a fitting one for the media.I didn't even see the first 10 or so minutes of it, I arrived late to the theater, and on top of that, the fire alarm went off 5 minutes in after i started watching. So they evacuated the building, got the fire department there, sat around while they discovered that the old clunky popcorn machine had set off the detectors, and then for the _whole rest of the movie_, the fire alarm lights were _STILL ON_. Apparently they couldn't get it to reset, so they simply played the rest of the movie with their blinding flashing going on all about the periphery.And you know what? It was _still_ enjoyable.I could still find myself absorbed in the story, despite the occasional ""Oh, what's that flashing OH YEAH, THAT. =_="" I was impressed and overall satisfied with the movie. The 3 Ghosts are portrayed in a fantastically creepy way. They're recognizably inhuman and even give off an Uncanny Valley sort of feel, but they're very emotional and symbolic images of the times they represent. Granted, it's far from perfect. At times, the animation seemed _just barely_ off, but in the case of some, it might have been purposeful. Tiny Tim is a character in all right, if a little static, but his major purpose is as a _symbol_, as he was in the Dickens novel, and it carried very well.This is perhaps one of the few (and i mean FEW, i have maybe 5 others) movies that I'd actually go out and buy a copy of. It's really only a retelling: you already _know_ the story, but you can still appreciate the movie as something expanding on it. It's something that i would expect would have a great deal of replay value. You know the story, and you've gotten its purposes and even the symbolic meanings of it etched into your brain because it's a cultural standby, a classic that's as much a part of the mindset of Christmas as any Christmas special on TV. But you can still appreciate it for the _way_ that it's done, even if it's not done perfectly. It's not revolutionary, it's not amazing, but you can still like it because Dickens did it amazingly enough already, it doesn't need much else to make it good.",A Christmas Carol
279,Nurugio,Ghost of Christmas Present,3,12 December 2009,"I'd like to say that this movie is one of the wurst version I've seen, it's not joyfully like the others you know Christmas..., only after the last ghost i becomes good and then you got the happy feeling of Christmas.OK, so you guys don't you recognize the second ghost? it's like Jesus or GODI'm sorry for the religious people, but he looks almost the same just the way he sit on the tower ... and the way he dies too it's like Jesus the way he lies on the floor,OK that's it",A Christmas Carol
280,padolsky,Poor Version,5,21 December 2010,"I really liked the idea of Jim Carrey playing Scrooge. It seemed like something right up his alley in a twisted sort of way. And when I heard his voice with the English accent I was even more pleased because he seemed to really get into the role. His voice was genuinely good for this role. And when I saw Scrooge flying over the rooftops with Christmas Past I felt like I was flying along with him. It was a dizzying effect that was really wonderful. But as the film progressed I realized that the sympathy I usually feel for the Scrooge character was nowhere to be found. The film relies too much on the 3D effect to please the viewer and not enough on the dialog and story. To make matters worse, towards the end of the film, Scrooge is chased by Christmas Future, like it was some sort of James Bond film. How could one of the most beloved Christmas stories of all time be transformed into an action adventure film? Even the Bill Murray version is much better than this thing. I'm not sure what Zemeckis was thinking when he made this but I'll be glad if I never see it again.",A Christmas Carol
281,mcelwood,Deserves more credit than it gets,8,14 November 2021,"I know there are some things you can pick apart in regards to the character animation. However, in all honesty, the uncanny valley was never something that bothered me too much. I think there are many great aspects in this movie that deserve more credit than they get. The visuals are breathtaking, the score is some of composer Alan Silvestri's best work, and most of the acting is quite good, albeit not always seamless. Jim Carrey holds his own through some powerfully moving scenes and clearly takes his roles very seriously, even if a few of his line deliveries sound a bit too exaggerated. Gary Oldman is wonderful as always, and I actually thought Colin Firth was fantastic as Fred. He really captured his optimistic spirit and brought a lot of personality to the character. The film is not quite perfect. The chase sequence in the third act feels pretty tagged on, and there are a few scenes that might've been more powerful if they were less bombastic. On the whole, however, I still really enjoyed this film and thought it succeeded far more than it failed.",A Christmas Carol
282,janene_pearce,A Sentimental Christmas Favorite?,5,2 March 2011,"The ""Computer Age"" has got me really concerned. I'm getting the idea from all the ""networking"" sites on the internet that people have this notion that it's a way to deal with other people without having to actually deal with them. We're supposed to have increased human contact through this medium, but it actually has produced much less of the kind of human contact which really matters. A massive amount of it is impersonal, unemotional, empty and sterile, and the sad thing is - that's probably why so many people flock to it.Is this what we're looking for in our entertainment, now? If it is, then ""Disney's A Christmas Carol"" should be a popular favorite and will go right along with the techno-slick, keep-others-at-arm's-length-computer-age-relationship-desert that we're fast approaching. I'm sorry, but you've still got to have live, flesh-and-blood human bodies to convey the emotion and chemistry between characters that a poignant story like ""A Christmas Carol"" demands.

283,shadedsoldier,Visually Stunning...does Dickens Justice.,8,7 November 2009,My wife and I just went to a matinée of A Christmas Carol. I had come to IMDb earlier to see what users had to say about the movie. I have to admit that I was considering not going to see the movie after reading some of the reviews. I'm truly glad that I decided to go to see it. The 3D animation is unbelievable. I personally have not found another movie that has had such spectacular animation and perspective. I feel like this movie probably lines up most correctly with the actual Dickens' work. It has very dark undertones which ultimately serves as a great aid in driving the story home. I can understand some parents not wanting to take young children to this film. It's definitely not the Disney Christmas Carol that most of us grew up on. All in all...I think i'm going to go see this one again when Christmas is closer and the goose is getting fat. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone wondering if it's worth it.

284,fallenangel55405,Unfaithful to the Scrooge Legacy,3,8 December 2011,"This is possibly the worse adaptation I have ever seen of A Christmas Carol. Many scenes were definitely inappropriate for all ages and as a family movie should be (as this always has been)it should not make me as an adult nervous to continue watching. I've watched all versions since I was a kid, this one is the scariest...this is Christmas not Halloween.*SPOILER* Many things happened that never did in the originals and many things to me that just did not make sense and was irrelevant to the story. Days later I am still trying to figure out how and why Scrooge would be chased by a horse and carriage. Not only that but half way through the chase he shrunk...yes shrunk, randomly in the middle of being chased. Then somehow ended up in room where his stuff is being sold by his maid as hes 1 inch high. The ghost of Christmas past is a floating candle flame that seriously gave me a creepy feeling with his whispered raspy voice, as many parts did. The ghost of Christmas present mysteriously grows old and dies at the ringing of a bell when Scrooges time is up with him. Many scenes were omitted like the scene where the prize turkey is delivered to Bob and his family isn't even shown. The dialog was both hit and miss, some lines being word for word others completely there own adaptations.My sister wanted to give this 2 stars, I gave it a generous 3 for the few laughs and good feelings it did give me. Oddly I did not get the wonderful feeling at the end of this movie as I've always done watching the older versions. Sad because with CGI it could have been even more amazing then it was.

286,bug-u,Disney's A Christmas Carol is not Christmas Friendly.,1,6 December 2012,"The only reason I give it a ""don't bother"" over ""disappointing"" rating is that I literally feel no one should see this. It's more than disappointing to me, in fact, it's disgusting. I am a realist, and embrace elements of death etc. within life as only natural. This movie however, harps on that which seeks to terrify mankind and is not overall successful in portraying the tale's didactic elements. Being a literature fan myself, I wouldn't read Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, (essentially a semi-supernatural ghost story struggling to find a sense of natural belonging within the world), to my young child. Even if I did, it would be a benefit that they might not be able to fully imagine the terrifying elements. This movie however, is an entirely different monster than a piece of literature. Being a ""3-D/animated/family friendly"" film created by Disney, it is directly intended with children in it's audience. As an adult, this movie affected and engaged my imaginative capacity. I can only imagine what it's doing to a child. That is why, to me, Disney has really stepped over a line with this movie. In addition, lines between good and evil are so overlapped that it's disorienting as to which we are supposed to look to for understanding. I wouldn't even watch this with my family or friends because it is plain bad for the psyche. To me, the majority of it is just evil and terrifying, not ""truthful/accurate to a story by Charles Dickens."" If you wan't accuracy, go and read the tale.

Casting Jim Carrey as Scrooge is fine, but then using him for the ghosts as well is poor. The strange (Irish?) accent for Christmas Past and even stranger (northern?) accent for Christmas Present are intensely annoying and distracting. Whoever thought this was a good idea a should be re-assigned to wearing a character costume in Disneyland.

290,didier-peereboom,Not a very good movie nor an animation,2,23 December 2013,"Whenever 3D animation is discussed, the uncanny valley rears its ugly head. It is the simple fact that a smiley face :) can convey emotions infinitely better then a highly detailed 3D render of a human being.It doesn't help that Jim Carrey just isn't all that good an actor. He can do faces but he can't do bodies. And the story doesn't allow him to either. Scrooge comes as a cartoon character of an old man, inclusive ""hilarious"" moments when he catches a barrel and balances it on his feet like an acrobat.Sounds funny? Maybe but it isn't a funny movie. That is the movies main fault, it doesn't know what it is trying to be. Comedy, thrill ride, realistic, it comes and goes. And all the time there is the computer animation which never quite convinces. From the rather slipshot animation of the end chase scene where you are wondering if you are watching an animation proof instead of a final render, to the dancing scene where the characters are obviously floating across the floor.In better movies like the Hobbit, the rabbit sled has the same problem, it obviously isn't real but it is kept to short sequences mostly in the distance. Here the fakeness is in your face all the time. And it jars.Compare it to say ""A muppet Christmas carol"" and the uncanny valley becomes extremely obvious. When a sock puppet has more humanity then a digitized human actor, it is time to accept that doing an entire movie in this form just isn't worth it.Think of all the ""this ain't real"" moments you had in your movie going year and imagine someone stitching it together for an entire movie. That is what this movie is. And frankly it isn't needed. Normally CGI is used to achieve the impossible but there is nothing impossible about filming an old man.In fact, for a movie made entirely out of CGI, the special effects are rather poor. From the ""face in a candle flame"" of the ghosts of Christmas past to the ghost of Marley. I seen better. In movies older and with smaller budgets.Some claim the movie uses a lot of lines from the book. So? Most adaptation do that. The original book is rather short and doesn't have that much spoken dialogue to begin with.Some praise it for being dark... this reminds me of a romantic comedy Korean movie where the heroine is beaten until she mis-carriages. Know what you are trying to do. A dark/true adaptation of A Christmas Carol does NOT need chase scenes.There are a lot of adaptation of this classic tale. Some good, some bad. This is one of the worst. Because it takes the humanity out of a human story. Scrooged in this story is not redeemed, he is scared into submission. And that is very much missing the point of the story.",A Christmas Carol
291,manisekhar_kms,good but not excellent,7,11 January 2015,"Robert Zemeckis has adapted and directed this version of Dickens's much- loved classic and presented it in motion-capture animation, available in 2D and 3D, lovingly intent on preserving the Christmassy brand in every rich and rosy detail. He creates digital imagery derived from live- action performers – just as in his 2004 Christmas fairytale The Polar Express and the 2007 version of Beowulf, which Zemeckis produced. The advantage is that the actors' recreated physical existences are now seamlessly part of an imagined universe and so quite as malleable. Jim Carrey plays Scrooge not merely as an old man, but as the happy young apprentice shown to him by the Ghost of Christmas Past, as the more careworn coming man of business who chooses money over love, and even as the lonely seven-year-old boy. They all look plausibly like the various ages of Jim Carrey – although, for me, the motion-capture technique always makes children's faces slightly creepy and robotic. Carrey plays all the ghosts, too, interestingly suggesting that they are projections of his own conscience. Gary Old man provides the real-world template for both Bob Cratchit and Marley. Zemeckis places the characters in a London that twists and stretches its setting to reflect the macabre mood. Consider Scrooge's living room, as narrow and tall just as he is. The home of his nephew Fred, by contrast, is as wide and warm as Fred's personality. Animation provides the freedom to show just about anything, and Zemeckis uses it. Occasionally, he even seems to be evoking the ghost of Salvador Dali, as in a striking sequence where all the furniture disappears and a towering grandfather clock looms over Scrooge and a floor slanting into a distant perspective. The three starring ghosts are also spectacular grotesques. I like the first, an elfin figure with a head constantly afire and a hat shaped like a candle-snuffer. Sometimes he playfully shakes his flames like a kid tossing the hair out of his eyes. After another (ahem) ghost flies out the window, Scrooge runs over to see the whole street filled with floating spectral figures, each one chained to a heavy block, like so many Chicago mobsters sleeping with the fishes. I like the way that Zemeckis does it. He seems to have a more sure touch than many other directors, using 3-D instead of being used by it. If the foreground is occupied by close objects, they're usually looming inward, not out over our heads. Note the foreground wall-mounted bells that we look past when Scrooge, far below, enters his home; as one and then another slowly starts to move, it's a nice little touch. It's a faithful adaptation, and if you're taking little kids to see it, well, watches out – there are some scary moments, especially the time- honored shocker when ghostly Marley's lower jaw falls away. But there is a weird lack of passion here, almost condescension, and a sense that Scrooge's agonized moral journey into his past is potentially pretty dull, and so Zemeckis is always livening things up by whooshing the old miser excitingly through the night sky between visions – a London thrill-ride perhaps influenced by the Harry Potter movies. The hi-tech sheen is impressive, but in an unexciting way. I wanted to see real human faces convey real human emotions.",A Christmas Carol

This movie lets you experience the changes that overcame Scrooge in his journey with the three spirits as he learns to embrace Christmas in his heart once more. You start at the cemetery were Marley is about to be buried. You see a man that is so unwilling to part with his gold that he takes Marley's gold as payment for his burial. As he walks through the streets that everyone that is merry avoids him or falls silent at his approach. Skipping to 7 years later you see that he has not changed at all. Until he returns home and meets Marley's ghost and begins to fear for himself. As he travels with the Ghost of Christmas Past you see Scrooge soften and wish for the Christmases of his past. Then the Ghost of Christmas Present makes him regret that he will not have a family to make merry with come Christmas Day. The Ghost of Christmas Future then makes Scrooge strive for a chance to change himself so that he will not be remembered as the cruel, gold-lover man that people are remembering him by in the shadow he is shown. I would recommend ages 8+ to watch this as Marley dislocating his jaw is kind of gruesome.",A Christmas Carol

294,james_674,Worst Christmas Carol Version EVER!,1,20 December 2011,"This adaptation of the classic Dicken's novel ""A Christmas Carol"" has enraged me so much I am writing this review as I'm watching the film. It is absolutely terrible! the ghosts are completely misrepresented and the story is so disjointed you cant follow the story properly. It is far too dramatic in some places while rather silly in others. Considering the budget and cast, I am really disappointed, as I was hoping to see some of the Disney magic we all know and love, while showing one of my favourite Christmas books in a great film adaptation. This is no where near the case. It saddens me to think that the future generations of children will be watching this and thinking this is how the story really is. I recommend Patrick Stewart's version, or my personal favourite - Muppet's Christmas Carol - which has the right amount of child-friendly humour while still portraying the story well.",A Christmas Carol
295,anca3000,this is NOT for children!,4,26 November 2009,"So it's about Christmas time. We all know A Christmas Carol. It's a nice story, a teaching story, one should leave the cinema with Christmas cheer. Children should enjoy it and learn from it. Oh well.This movie was my worst movie choice for this year. Not because it is badly done... it is spectacularly done! The visuals are breath taking! Unfortunately, everything else was a disappointment. It is more like a Halloween movie intended to scare. There are scenes entirely unsuitable for young children, even I as an adult left the cinema with a bitter feeling. I strongly recommend watching it before taking young children to see it. And if you are looking for a feel-good Christmas movie, this is entirely not the right choice.",A Christmas Carol
296,darkgrin,Masterpiece,10,20 December 2017,"Wouldn't have been this specific way, I think Zemeckis would have felt betraying the message itself... It is righfully on the(my) list: to remind me on a yearly basis who we are and how we are (cruel and egocentric race), to constantly remind me, no matter the circumstances, that redemtion is posible, achievable and soul-filling with joy.If you can treat cruely with patience and good deeds with tears, I can guarantee a repeatable, enjoyable and emotional session. Well, not me... Zemeckis can!",A Christmas Carol
297,a_simple_melody,what the.... ?!,3,21 November 2009,"thanks to my parents, i have seen 10+ versions of ""a Christmas carol"" and this was the worst i have ever seen. the first major problem i had is that the story was changed. why on earth did scrooge NOT go see the cratchit family on Christmas morning?! that is one of the pinnacle parts to the story! what happened to the turkey he had the boy fetch? what was the reaction of the cratchit family? we actually are never told who belle is, so to kids, they have no clue who she is. why did they have scrooge stay at fred's? the other problem i had is all the added ""scariness"" to the movie. why show the ghost of Christmas present dissolve into dust?! the scary death horses chasing scrooge through the town, scrooge falling into an open casket, marley's ghost wailing, etc. i mean, if i were a kid, i would've been frightened of all that. there's a way to do it but i think those scenes were a tad over the top for kids. frankly all 3 ghosts disturbed me. the ghost of Christmas present spoke... well, almost in a perverted sort of tone. most productions portray the GOCP as a child... this version was super creepy. the ghost of Christmas present laughed to a point where he seemed more crazy than jolly. and frankly the ghost of Christmas yet to come was scary and the only one done well.i DID like the look of the film, although i didn't feel it was necessary for it to be in 3-D. actually, a lot of films coming out soon are in 3-D... what's that about?! i also enjoyed seeing the actors facial similarities in their characters. the voice acting was remarkable - i have always been a fan of jim carrey, gary oldman, colin firth, bob hoskins, etc. but this is just my opinion i am sharing.... this was a terrible remake of dicken's classic tale. i wish i could get my money back.",A Christmas Carol
298,mkamid,Excellent Animation and Even Better in 3-D,10,16 November 2009,"Disney and Robert Zemeckis have really outdone the visuals on this movie! The 3-D version is amazing and you get swept away in the detail of the graphics. A Christmas Carol is a classic film and this was an entertaining way to renew the story.Jim Carrey as Scrooge, and other characters is great, as are the other actors. The joy of seeing scrooge travelling through the beautiful scenes is exciting, especially the scenes between him and the different ghosts and realities.Definitely worth checking this out in the cinema, and its gotta be in 3D for the ultimate enjoyment.A great fun, festive movie!",A Christmas Carol
