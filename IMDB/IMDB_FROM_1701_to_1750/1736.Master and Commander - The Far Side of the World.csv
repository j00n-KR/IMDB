0,MartinHafer,"While the film lacks traditional thrills and pacing, it gets huge marks for replicating what life was like at sea.",9,7 June 2012,"""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is a very unusual film because the filmmakers obviously were not attempting to make yet another Hollywood style blockbuster. Instead, they seemed to be doing the impossible--make a film that tries very hard to replicate what life was like at sea back during the Napoleonic Wars. As a retired history teacher, this is the sort of stuff I love--even if in the original, the 'bad guys' were actually the Americans and it was set during the War of 1812! I assume they changed the enemy to the French to make the film more marketable. After all, it would be a hard sell in the large American market to get the audiences to root for the British Navy in this altercation! The story occurs around the beginning of the 19th century. The Brits and French have been fighting off and on for almost a decade (and would continue to do so until 1815). The action is set aboard a British Naval ship commanded by Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe). His ship has encountered a larger and faster French vessel and managed to escape. However, instead of running, Crowe plays a very determined man--and spends much of the film hunting down this ship. Along the way, there are lots of adventures--mostly of the variety you might actually have seen during the era. I could talk about them, but frankly this would spoil the suspense.Overall, while this film is very slowly and deliberately paced (which will obviously turn off some viewers), the film is so expertly crafted that for a reasonably patient viewer, it should be a very engaging film. The film looks great--with a lot of attention to details and accuracy. It also has the best looking sea footage you can find in a period film--especially when the ship is rounding the Cape (it must have been amazing on the big screen). The acting is lovely as well--understated but quite realistic. Well done in every way and the director really deserves kudos for this one. While I love films from the same period as ""Damn the Defiant"", ""Captain Horatio Hornblower"", ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and the like, clearly ""Master and Commander"" is superior when it comes to accurately portraying the life of a seaman.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
1,bkoganbing,"""This Ship Is Our Home, This Ship Is England""",9,7 June 2008,"For those who like action and adventure from a more romantic age you can't beat Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World for your needs. As a film it rates right up there with Captain Horatio Hornblower which starred Gregory Peck and Damn the Defiant with Alec Guinness, a couple of films I liked very much.Russell Crowe completely fits my conception of Patrick O'Brian's Napoleonic naval hero 'Lucky Jack Aubrey'. He's a worthy successor to C.S. Forrester's Horatio Hornblower. The books have been best sellers for years and this is Jack Aubrey's first screen appearance.The film opens with Crowe in command of a ship that's just seen a lot of action and it's not in the best of shape. Orders from the Admiralty come to him. There's a French frigate who's quite a bit bigger than Crowe's ship, nevertheless she's the only one near her in those southern latitudes so it's a search and destroy mission. One that can't be accomplished until necessary repairs are made.There's surprisingly little combat action in this film until the very end. It concentrates on character and goes into the most minute of detail the life on board a British ship of the line during the Napoleonic Wars. The action takes place in 1805 right after the Battle of Trafalgar and the United Kingdom is still keeping a lot of ships close to home.Crowe is nothing short of outstanding as Aubrey the charismatic captain of this vessel. He gets good support from the rest of the cast, my favorites being ship's surgeon Paul Bettany and Max Pirkis as the young midshipman who Crowe takes a fatherly interest in.In a sense the character's nickname of 'Lucky' is a misnomer. What you get Crowe's Jack Aubrey is a man of skill and daring and experience who knows how to take advantage of breaks and make his own luck. Never more so when he has that final encounter with the French ship.Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World gives you a real feeling for the Napoleonic era. I do hope that Russell Crowe gets another chance to bring 'Lucky Jack Aubrey' back to the screen again.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
2,Leofwine_draca,Above average seafaring adventure,7,26 August 2016,"Despite the unwieldy title, this film is an unexpected pleasure – an actor's film, which is a rare thing nowadays in Hollywood. It's certainly not an action film – there are only two major sequences and they bookend the movie – but instead it focuses on characters as they develop through action and reaction. As such it's a surprisingly mature piece of work, featuring some excellent performances from the likes in particular of Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany, playing the ship's captain and doctor respectively. There's no showiness here, just strong, subtle work, and it's hard to choose who gives the best performance between the two of them because they're both great.This is an adaptation of a novel by Patrick O'Brian, which I haven't read as yet, although I believe it's a loose version of the story. Whatever the origins, it looks great, with often breathtaking shots of scenery – the Galapagos Islands, for instance. The ships are models for the most part, yet it's impossible to tell this, as the effects are very good indeed. I really liked the strong undercurrent of humour running through the film – such as the ""lesser of two weevils"" joke – and the surprisingly touching moments of humanity, like the boy who loses an arm and yet goes on to become a hero.What happens on screen might be familiar – there's the usual catalogue of ship-bound perils like droughts, deserted islands, wrecks, storms, cannon battles and a particularly well-handled ""Jonah"" – but this is about a hundred times better than PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN which came out around the same time. It's no surprise that the latter production, a bloated Disney cartoon, was the more successful of the two and the one that went on to spawn sequels...",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
3,SnoopyStyle,Impressive battles and great Russell Crowe performance,9,19 July 2014,"In April 1805, Napoleon rules Europe. British frigate H.M.S. Surprise under the command of Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is ordered to intercept French Privateer Acheron. In the first battle, Aubrey quickly discovers that Acheron is actually bigger, faster and more powerful skippered by a smart tactician. He escapes only through his skills and experience. After being soundly beaten, Aubrey decides to keep going instead of returning to base to refit. The ship's surgeon and Aubrey's friend Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) clash with him more and more as the far ranging battle continues.The action is exciting and more realistic than sail seafaring battle movies before it. The most compelling are the splinters that fly everywhere. It is the CGI that pushes the envelop on this action. Realism is everywhere. It is dirty, ugly, bloody, and horrifying. Russell Crowe delivers a solid performance to anchor this movie in reality. Then there are the everyday things that happen in between the battles. This has the epic scale conflicts but the human size struggle.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
4,Hitchcoc,Awesome Nautical Tale,9,14 February 2006,"Despite his bad boy image, Russell Crowe is an actor for our time. He can integrate a softer side with power in his roles. This is a great adventure with magnificent seascapes and intrigue. The producers went to great length to make the presentation of life aboard the ship true to the period. Many of the seamen were actually children, even officers, who commanded the older, but less educated crew. As with most movies about ships at this time, the claustrophobic nature of the life was always evident. Crowe's character, Captain Aubrey, is duty bound to risk it all, against better ""advice."" All choices rest with him; it is his ship. The younger actors project an adulation that leads them to overlook their insecurities and latch on to bravery in the face of insurmountable odds. It's a French ship; they have no choice, thought they may die. The special effects are fine. Like so many movies of it's kind, at times the ship seems 400 feet long and at times 40 feet. So much action goes on on deck and above, on the masts. There are also some real human stories as subplots, including that of a young man who rides at the breaking point. The battle scenes are breathtaking. I wonder if there will be a sequel.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
5,claudio_carvalho,"Too Long Running Time and Title, and Totally Overrated Adventure",6,3 October 2004,"In 1805, during the Napoleonic Wars, Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is the Captain of the British frigate 'HSM Surprise', assigned to battle against a bigger and more powerful French war frigate. Like in 'Moby Dick', Jack becomes obsessed with the idea of capturing the enemy vessel and pushes his crew to the limit in a very long voyage in South America.""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is well produced, has a great reconstitution of the Nineteenth Century frigates and has great shots. However, the story is too long and sometimes boring, and is based on two lead characters only: Russell Crowe and the excellent Paul Bettany, in the role of Dr. Stephen Maturin, the surgeon of the 'HSM Surprise'. In accordance with the cover of the DVD, this movie received ten nominations to the Oscar, therefore it is completely overrated. 'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World' has a long title, a too long running time and is nothing more than a good adventure. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): 'Mestre dos Mares - O Lado Mais Distante do Mundo' ('Master of the Seas - The More Distant Side of the World')",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
6,lee_eisenberg,Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale of another great Peter Weir movie.,10,12 February 2006,"I've never seen a Peter Weir movie that I didn't like. ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" further backs that up. Russell Crowe plays Capt. Jack Aubrey, leading a ship around the world to chase a French frigate in 1805. He and his shipmates have many experiences, all the while sticking together and remembering their duty.It's especially interesting that this came out the same year as ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"". I guess that this combination affirms that movies about people sailing the high seas always make for something good, as ""Gilligan's Island"" long ago ensured. You're sure to like it.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
7,jboothmillard,Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,7,1 April 2008,"From BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Peter Weir (Witness, Dead Poets Society, The Truman Show) this is a film I had previously tried twice, and, somehow, got bored in the first 15 or so minutes, I'm glad I stuck it out the third try. Basically it is 1805, during the Napoleonic war, and the Royal Navy ship HMS Surprise led by Capt. Jack Aubrey (Golden Globe nominated Russell Crowe) who is under orders to sink or capture the French attack ship. The film is basically battle, chat, battle, chat, battle, last chat, a bit repetitive, but still fun to watch, for the battles anyway. Also starring BAFTA nominated Paul Bettany as Surgeon Dr. Stephen Maturin, The Lord of the Rings' Billy Boyd as Coxswain Barrett Bonden, James D'Arcy as 1st Lt. Tom Pullings, Lee Ingleby as Midshipman Hollom, George Innes as Able Seaman Joe Plaice, Mark Lewis Jones as Whaler Mr. Hogg, Chris Larkin as Royal Marines Capt. Howard, Richard McCabe as Surgeon's Mate Mr. Higgins, Robert Pugh as Master Mr. Allen, David Threlfall as Captain's Steward Preserved Killick and Max Pirkis as Midshipman Blakeney. The performances are good, the battles are all eye-catching, a good film. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Makeup, Best Sound Mixing, Best Visual Effects and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Sound and the David Lean Award for Direction, it was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects, Best Cinematography and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. It was number 46 on the 100 Greatest War Films. Very good!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
8,ccthemovieman-1,"Looks Great, Sounds Great, IS Great",10,11 January 2006,"What a magnificent adventure story, pure and simple.It's unusual in that there are only two action scenes over the 2 hour, 19-minute film, one near the beginning and one near the end. They don't go on that long, either. For a modern-day film, that's very unusual. However, that doesn't translate to infer this is too talky or boring. The film will keep your interest all the way. However, for any ladies out there looking for a bit romance in this tale, it isn't there. In that respect, unless you want to ogle at Russell Crowe, this a man's film with an all-male cast.This movie is a great demo on how to make an adventure film fascinating without blood and guts and explosions every two minutes. It's an heroic tale, right down a little boy who shows us what guts are all about.This movie won the Academy Award for both cinematography and sound and both honors were well-deserved. If you really want to appreciate this movie, see it on a nice TV and play it with 5.1 surround sound. The creaking of the ship coming out of all the surround speakers is awesome, just in itself.One negative I had on the first viewing, which I corrected on the second, was the dialog. I had trouble with some of the accents and the naval terminology but that was corrected by putting on the English subtitles.If I could sum this movie up in one word it would be ""classy.""",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
9,rmax304823,Nicely Done.,7,16 November 2004,"It opens with the most realistic sea engagement I've ever seen in a movie, helped immeasurably by the prudent use of CGIs. The performances are all pretty good -- and what a surprise to see such a straightforward adventure tale from Peter Weir, master and commander of the subliminally ominous.For my taste, which may, admittedly, be a little warped, the movie doesn't give us quite enough of the exhilaration of being at sea. I mean that zesty feeling of being windswept on a weather deck in the middle of an empty sea with bright sunshine all around. The one thing all these sailors would have in 1805 is sun tans but they look pale and sweaty. The visuals are a bit dark and gloomy, which is okay during storms when you're trying to get around the Horn but not when you're anchored in the Galapagos.Still, this is above average. Russel Crowe is neither Errol Flynn nor Captain Bligh. He's more like Horatio Hornblower but with more nearly human quirks than just clearing his throat. As the captain, Crowe plays a lively tune by Boccherini on the violin to the doctor's cello. Nice work too. And on happy occasions he gets drunk with his fellow officers and makes lousy jokes. There is one astonishing shot of Crowe and a companion perched on the tiptoptoloftical peak of the mainmast, atop the topgallants or something, a million miles in the air. How did he get there? Was Crowe digitalized in? If not, they're not paying him enough.We have the British fighting against what are traditionally called ""overwhelming odds,"" a French super frigate, the Acheron, which they finally take after a bloody battle.What a more interesting and less popular flick it would have been, had the foe of the original novel been retained, the Americans during the War of 1812. No one would have gone to see it. The French in 1805 are an admirable substitute. The enemy is not ""France"", it's ""Napoleon."" The huge American audience feels less in common with France than with the Brits. Also during Napoleon's attempt to conquer the world, there was an opponent worth fighting, not to mention Jerry Lewis and bidets. But the War of 1812 -- well. Something about the Brits impressing American seamen, wasn't it? As a casus belli, the concept is a little difficult to grasp. And it proved to be a thoroughly bad idea by President Madison.""Master and Commander"" gives us heroes we can root for. We see everything from the point of view of the British sailors aboard the Surprise, just as we would in an Errol Flynn movie, although Crowe is a far more complex character. But suppose the Acheron HAD retained its American identity? What would our response, as Americans, have been? Would we still have been cheering for the Brits as eagerly as if it had been a soccer game? Would we have been tickled to see the Acheron blown apart? Such an added layer of complexity might have prompted us to think about the nature of war. (Gosh -- it's not REALLY a football game.) It would have challenged our loyalties. It might even have caused us to think a little about the nature of human nature. Why does battle seem so tragic only when OUR side suffers? Or -- worst of all -- what is it, buried deep in my limbic system, that makes me want to shout YEAH when Crowe outwits the Frogs? Whatever the answers, they're not likely to turn out to have the same effect as bright sunshine on a windswept deck. As I say, nobody would go to see it.There are three main conflicts, all handled deftly. The faceless enemy against the British, from ""Horatio Hornblower"" and ""The Sea Hawk."" The sullen crew versus an officer, familiar to us from, oh, ""Moby Dick"" and ""Damn the Defiant"" and ""Mutiny on the Bounty""; and a more interesting conflict of interests between the intellectual doctor who wants to explore the Galapagos Islands thirty years before Darwin, and Russel Crowe's captain, who is determined to pursue and destroy the Acheron. We can see a similar disjunction between the egghead and the practical man of common sense in ""The Thing From Another World"" and ""Ball of Fire."" It's the difference between the theoretical physicist and the engineer. In the movies, the engineer often shows up in uniform and almost always wins the debate. The movie is worth catching. Lots of sea lore and tradition, almost an exercise in history. And with its innovative score and outstanding CGIs, it's a sensory feast too.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
10,Tweekums,Gripping naval drama,8,18 December 2010,"When I sat down to watch this I rather expected a somewhat old fashioned film where the gallant heroes would chase the dastardly enemy and then be victorious with out too much bloodshed or conflict within the crew I was wrong, or at least partly so. It is true that the story follows an heroic crew as they pursue their enemy but it is by no means plain sailing for them and the French are portrayed as a worthy enemy without any stereotypical scenes of them plotting, in fact we only see them during the scene of hand to hand combat near the end. Russell Crowe is excellent as Jack Aubrey; Captain of HMS Surprise. He and his crew are hunting the Acheron, a French privateer, off the coast of Brazil when they find themselves coming under attack from their superior quarry. Once repairs are made Aubrey is determined that rather than returning to Britain he will follow the Acheron even if the means rounding Cape Horn and heading deep into the Pacific.From the start where the Acheron attacks out of a fog bank there is plenty of action, as the crew must deal with both the French ship and the weather that gets worse as the head south. The weather looked real as the ship was drenched by both waves and rain frequently reminding me of something Turner might have painted, as it was so atmospheric. The battle scenes were also gripping filmed in a way that the viewer is drawn into the action. Once the battles are over the film doesn't flinch from showing the dead and wounded and the treatment they received. It isn't all foul weather and fighting though; there are a few humorous scenes and the crew do get a brief break on the Galapagos Islands where the ship's doctor, played by the excellent Paul Bettany, wishes to study the local wildlife.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

It starts in the year 1805 , when Europe has been vanquished by Napoleon, and only the British Navy stands in his way to total victory . Nearly the cost of South America, a new conflict is brewing. Captain Jack ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey (Russell Crowe) of the Royal Navy commands the HMS Surprise , he fought with Admiral Nelson on Nile and is under orders of British staff to capture the three-masted French privateer Acheron, which has sunk several vessels . Crusing the coast of Brazil on the lookout for enemies and after various weeks of uneventful sailing , the fleeter French privateer lifts off in the fog and hits first under splintering fire , all but crippling the Surprise in an engagement in which Jack realizes his enemy's frigate is nautically superior to his own . Meantime the steadfast Jack Aubrey shares confidences and discussion with his cello-partner , close friend Stephan Maturin (Paul Bettany), a Darwinesque medic aboard . Aubrey is now faced with the choice of going back to Great Britain and admitting defeat or pursue the Acheron . Later on , they stop at Islands Galapagos where discover some extraordinary surprises .This rousing adventure/war movie is packed with action , psychological studio with interesting human relations, thrills , and impressive maritime battles. The naval battle sequences are quite good , the movie is well developed because it gets to know the seamen who are locked aboard the narrow quarters of a three-masted frigate HMS and how they relationship everyday. The captain , lieutenant ,Midshipmen and sailors are well-known by the time the final battle takes place . Director Weir chose to build the yarn from an intelligent point of view , describing an enjoyable friendship among protagonists and hard conditions about naval way of life with authentic psychology of men at war . The story exudes actual naval life with military discipline, gunpowder , real battles full of heroism and tang of salt . Magnificent duo protagonist and complemented by a string of sterling players as Robert Pugh as the sailing master , James Dárcy as Lieutenant Tom , with special mention to Max Pirkis as the Midshipboy and Lee Ingleby as unfortunate officer . Wonderful cinematography by Russell Boyd reflecting magnificently the marvelous maritime exteriors and wooden interiors . Groundbreaking special effects during maritime storm with giant waves by designer William Sandell who also made the ¨ Perfect Storm¨ . Sensible score with some emotive song and including classic music by Boccerini when the starring are playing violin. The motion picture is stunningly directed by Australian director Peter Weir who achieved several hits (Witness, Gallipoli, The last wave) and some flop (Mosquito coast, The plumber). Rating : Better than average and well worth watching . This excellently mounted flick will appeal to Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany fans .",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
12,wes-connors,A Ship to Crowe About,6,6 September 2010,"In April 1805, Napoleon is the ""Master of Europe"" and only the British Navy stands before him. In oceanic waters off Brazil, English Captain Russell Crowe (as ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey) of the H.M.S. ""Sunrise"" receives his ship's battle plan - ""Intercept French Privateer 'Acheron' en route to Pacific sink, burn, or take her (as) a prize."" Captain Crowe's ship is damaged in an early scuffle, weathers a bad storm, and finally engages its enemy in the destined battle.""Master and Commander"" subtitled ""The Far Side of the World"" is a big, splashy production. With polished direction by Peter Weir, and based on the respected novels of Patrick O'Brian, it still does not convey the same level of awe found in classic seafaring pictures. When you think of Herman Melville or ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" you think of colossal allegorical conflicts, between good and evil, or man and God. Here, we have the British against the French, and some bad weather.Crowe begins by looking a little like Charles Laughton, but is soon revealed to be more Richard Burton, pontificating with best friend and ship's doctor Paul Bettany (as Stephen Maturin). The men disagree amicably, debate decisions, and play musical instruments together. The latter may explain why they like each other so much. Other crew members are interesting, due to the different sacrifices they make. The most obvious is young Max Pirkis (as William ""Will"" Blakeney), as you'll see.While the cameras spend most of their time finding the aforementioned three actors, others have memorable roles to play. Due very much to their fates, it's interesting to follow James D'Arcy (as Thomas ""Tom"" Pullings), Max Benitz (as Peter Myles Calamy), and Joseph Morgan (as William Warley). The writers' added ""Jonah"" character is nicely played by Lee Ingleby (as Hollom). Uniquely, he can see the enemy, but can't match his skills with the story; just like the movie, just out of sync.****** Master and Commander (11/14/03) Peter Weir ~ Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany, Max Pirkis, James D'Arcy",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
13,hitchcockthelegend,"For England, for home, and for the prize!",9,27 June 2010,"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is directed by Peter Weir, it stars Russell Crowe as Jack Aubrey and Paul Bettany as Stephen Maturin. It is spliced from various novels in the Aubrey–Maturin series written by Patrick O'Brian. The film takes place during 1805, during the Napoleonic Wars and finds Captain Jack Aubrey and the crew of British frigate HMS Surprise ordered to intercept, destroy or take as a prize the French privateer Acheron. But the Acheron (The Phantom as the crew of the Surprise call her) is no ordinary ship, and her Captain is smart. So Lucky Jack has his work cut out; not only in the pursuit of the Acheron, but in harmonising the crew under his command. Especially his loyal and trusting friend Stephen.It's pretty evident within the first few minutes of Master & Commander that this is no standard blockbuster naval based war movie. If you are after, or was expecting, a wave to wave Bruckheimer carnage a-like piece, well you best, or should have, stay(ed) away. For this is a Peter Weir movie, in fact this is a Peter Weir ""period"" movie, where attention to details and character dynamics are the order of the day. There's battle action here for sure, beginning and end, and terrific they are too. As first cannonballs crack and splinter its targets (note the sound work here), and later as blade meets blade; it's exhilarating stuff alright. But this is more interested in palpable tension, both on deck and on the waves. Threat is never far away, again, this is is covered by the impending duel with the Acheron and Aubrey's tactical pursuit/escape of her. While the crew give us a series of character dramas to involve us in the make up of a man-o-war's personnel. How different classes and males (there's not one female in the film) of all ages have to work together as one efficient unit in order to survive and triumph. Except for an interlude spent on the lusciously filmed Galapagos Island (Russell Boyd Best Cinematography Academy Award Winner), the film is set 99% of the time out at sea, on a cramped ship, this tells you that Weir is interested in telling a character driven story, cloaked in realism, above all else.The teaming of Weir with the highly rated O'Brian material looked a good one, and to someone like me who has never read an O'Brian novel? It is. But many of O'Brian's fans have been upset by either the stuff missing in the film, the stuff put in to fully form Weir's vision of the characters, or for Crowe not being Pugwashy enough. These complaints were inevitable since they come with practically every adaptation of novels these days. It should be noted, tho, that Weir was very much a fan of O'Brian, and in fact always felt inspired by the tight intricate detail of his writings. What of the author himself? Well he passed away three years before the film was released, but he had always envisaged Charlton Heston for the role of Aubrey. So, who in the modern era comes closest to Heston's physical presence on screen. Why Russell Crowe of course. Who not only brings that to the character, but also depth, because Aubrey comes with many traits. Strength, honour, stubbornness, leadership and loyalty are a given for a Captain on the high seas. But Aubrey is also vulnerable, self aware, playful, knows his limitations and able to laugh at himself. Crowe peels off each layer and delivers a high quality performance; from our first encounter with Crowe as Aubrey, the realism so loved by Weir is given a shot in the arm; and it stays throughout the movie.An excellent piece of casting then, as is that of Paul Bettany as ships surgeon, science and nature lover, and best pal of the Captain, Stephen Maturin. Bettany & Crowe had formed a friendship on 2001s A Beautiful Mind. Where their on screen chemistry lifted an already fine film, to an even better one. So it be here too. Stephen & Jack's relationship is the core of the piece. Two very different men yet as tight as two peas in a pod, with Stephen serving as the code breaker for the audience as sea talk and tactical intrigue weaves in and out of the story. It's there where Bettany excels, for he not only has us believing in this warm (platonic) friendship, he's also got us rooting for him since he is in essence the odd man out on this ship. Our sympathy is firmly with him, our friendly rebel if you please. Of the rest there's note worthy turns from Billy Boyd, James D'Arcy & Edward Woodall, while Lee Ingleby gives a really heartfelt and emotionally engaging turn as Hollom.The film is not without flaws, tho. The pace of the piece does slip from time to time, while the talky middle section may stretch the patience of some. And the film isn't long enough to give the main characters some back story for the audience to work off. But it's still a great movie. Ripe with intelligence and interesting characterisations: and boasting enough adrenalin, humour and upset to fill out a big budgeted 1950s historical epic. Get on board folks, this is quality film making. 9/10",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
14,jotix100,Victory at sea,8,22 November 2003,"Peter Weir is a director who selects very carefully all the projects he takes. It comes as no surprise that he was the right man to bring the Patrick Obrian's novels to the movies. He proves that he was up to the challenge with this latest venture. This is the film that keeps the essence of the texts adapted for this picture, as Mr. Weir makes a very close account of the English dominance in the high seas.The selection of Russell Crowe to play Jack Aubrey is a happy one. This actor makes the viewer believes he is the commander of his ship and that he is in full control of his vessel and his crew. Jack Aubrey is a man that has been around and served his country under Nelson. On the other hand, this hard man of the oceans shows a soft side no one would believe. He is seen as a partner of Dr. Stephen Maturin playing their favorite music, something no one would imagine him capable of doing.As the other principal on the film, Paul Bettany is a capable match to Russell Crowe. Mr. Bettany is a different kind of actor than Mr. Crowe, but his presence in the film is invaluable as his compassion for the wounded sailors and his interests in discovering many exotic things during his travels.The battle scenes are very vividly staged. At times we had to avert our eyes on certain parts where the wounded are being treated. The special effects are splendid, but the real winner is that vast expanse of water so friendly, but yet, so cruel to the men who dare sail the rough seas during a time of war.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
15,Hey_Sweden,A true masterpiece.,10,26 February 2021,"The acclaimed veteran filmmaker Peter Weir co-wrote, co-produced, and directed this excellent seagoing adventure. It takes place in 1805, during the Napoleonic Wars, when a British ship dubbed the H.M.S. Surprise is undertaking a crucial mission. It must track down the French craft the Acheron and either capture or destroy it. The Surprises' captain, Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), learns during an initial encounter with the Acheron that it's a true force to reckon with: stealthy, lethal, more densely populated, and packing more firepower. Jack realizes that in order to get the upper hand on the Acheron and its crew, he will have to do some creative thinking.One hopes that Hollywood will be able to continue producing this kind of entertainment. No expense was spared in the creation of this film; in one word, it's a VIVID experience. The viewer feels swept right up into the atmosphere of this great ship. They also feel the tension during various exciting battle scenes; Weir has the film begin quietly, but does not make the audience wait long for things to start happening.But it's not all about action. At first, it may be difficult to keep track of supporting characters, but they eventually begin to get real showcase moments. Crowe is solid as a rock as the steadfast captain, not that we'd expect any less. He and Paul Bettany, as Jacks' friend and the ships' doctor, are believable as longtime friends, and they even get to perform music during their relaxation time. They're surrounded by a wonderful bunch of unsung British actors. David Threlfall is amusing as a crusty old steward, Robert Pugh is very good as a pragmatic sailing master, Lee Ingleby is endearing as an officer who feels disrespected by the sailors, and Max Pirkis is engaging as a child who proves his worth in the thick of battle.A first-rate production in every way, this features some great production design, widescreen photography, and visual effects, and delightful, eclectic music. It's a very long but engrossing story (based on a series of novels by Patrick O'Brian) with time for vignettes such as the memorable one on The Galapagos Islands. Dr. Maturin (Bettany) has a side interest as a naturalist, and he's always eager to discover new species. One apparently flightless cormorant is particularly intriguing to him. Jack and the good doctor also have a key moment when the captains' motivations are questioned; what we learn is that the captain takes his military duty very seriously.With characters this watchable and slick filmmaking at its most professional, ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" really does make you feel like you're in a different time and place.10 out of 10.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
16,preppy-3,Dull,1,30 November 2003,"A naval war film about Napoleon vs. the British.  That's about all I got out of this.  To be fair to the movie, I had no interest in seeing this.

Purportedly it's factual and based on real people.  I did notice it was very correct in period detail right down to the smallest thing.  And I do admit most of the acting was OK--except for Russell Crowe.  What's happened to him?  He used to be a great actor but ever since that overpraised performance in ""Gladiator"" he's been lousy.  Also it was well-directed (I suppose) and there is some truly beautiful scenery.But....I couldn't follow the story; the movie really dragged most of the way; the British and Australian accents rendered most of the dialogue unintelligable and I couldn't figure out what was going on during the battle scenes.If you're a fan of nautical movies this might be great for you.

17,LeonLouisRicci,A Refreshing Poetic Diversion,8,19 January 2014,"This Beautiful Looking Film is an Adventure, a Study of Salty Sailors and not an Action Movie.

Crowe's portrayal of the doughty captain ""Aubrey"" charged with tracking down a French privateer that is raiding the vital British whaling fleet during the Napoleonic wars. Coming up against an equally courageous and skilful French captain and engaging in a lethal game of cat and mouse. The film nods to the social issues of living on a 19th Century frigate and to bravery (and cowardice) in a subtle and convincing way. Above all, it's an adventure film.

19,zardoz-13,The Napoleonic Wars At Sea with PG-13 Restrained Violence.,7,23 March 2009,"Watching the Russell Crowe Age of Sail epic ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is enough to make anybody sea-sick. In other words, you'll get sick of seeing this formulaic flotsam of clichés long before its interminable 138 minutes has washed over you. Unlike those popular Errol Flynn swashbucklers from the 1930s, Gregory Peck's ""Captain Horatio Hornblower"" (1951), or the Johnny Depp ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" epics, ""Master and Commander"" takes itself far too seriously and features a predominantly male cast, with no damsels-in-distress awaiting rescue from depicable villains. The fleeting moments when women do appear on screen seem designed to reassure any doubting spectators about the heterosexual orientation of the entire HMS Surprise crew. Worse, ""Master and Commander"" lacks a hardcore villain in either character or physical stature. This lack of villainy undercuts director Peter Weir's film and its overall dramatic impact. The earliest glimpse that we catch of the villainous French captain is after Russell Crowe and crew have stormed their adversary's ship. Oops, did you ever doubt Russell wouldn't feast on frog legs at fadeout? Nevetheless, this literate, authentic looking, tactical game of cat and mouse on the high seas set in the year 1805 between an under-gunned English vessel and a well-armed Napoleonic man-of-war excels in visual and narrative storytelling. Although writer & director Peter Weir of ""Gallipoli,"" ""The Mosquito Coast,"" and ""The Truman Show"" fame and co-scenarist former physician John Collee have written well-thought out characters with clearly delineated motivations, they have failed miserably at making any of them charismatic, much less memorable. You won't find yourself cheering on Russell Crowe here as you might have in ""Gladiator"" because his character behaves like a good-two shoes.Some will applaud the documentary verisimilitude that Aussie helmer Peter Weir brings to ""Master and Commander"" without exposing either the unsavory homoerotic or sadomasochistic undertones persasive in the British Navy during the 19th century. Weir and his collaborators must have poured considerable time and research into ""Master and Commander"" because each scene appears thoroughly credible, especially with regard to loading and firing cannon. Weir lensed this turbulent ocean-going voyage in the huge aquatic tank in Baja, Mexico, built for ""Titanic."" Meawnhile, others less enamored of historical detail may keep glancing at theircell phone clocks, chafing in eager anticipation for the inevitable comeuppance that ultimately takes too long to materialize. The battle scenes are the best that ""Master and Commander"" has to offer. Indeed, the ships appear genuine enough, whether either life-sized or miniature, and the atmospheric cinematography always provides viewers with the most interesting perspectives. Sadly, the drawn-out scenes on the Galapogos Islands amount to nothing more than malingering. Bloody without being sanguinary, Weir stages gritty action scenes, such as a broading party assault during a ship-to-ship battle, well enough. No, the violence in ""Master and Commander"" won't make you flinch like the graphic bloodshed in Mel Gibson's superior but bloody colonial epic ""The Patriot."" In a model of restraint, Weir has characters talk about the gore that occurs off screen and only shows its consequences on-screen. Okay, one guy does take a bullet between the eyes, but he doesn't stand around and talk about it. Unfortunately, if you dread closed confines, you'll find yourself sweating like a claustrophobic. Eighty per cent of ""Master and Commander"" transpires within the cramped confines fo the HMS Surprise. Meaning, time drags its sea legs between the first encounter with the French and the final showdown. No, ""Master and Commander"" dispenses with the rip-snorting escapades of the gender-bending Geena Davis swashbuckler ""Cutthroat Island"" and avoids the harsh rivalry between the skipper and subordinates of the 1962 Alec Guinness effort ""Damn the Defiant."" ""Writer & director Peter Weir and John Collee combined two of the late Patrick O'Brien's historical novels, ""Master and Commander"" and ""The Far Side of the World,"" to serve as the basis for their above-average but predictable screenplay. Set during the Napoleonic Wars, ""Master and Commander"" opens with the Acheron, a mysterious but appropriately named French battleship, sneaking up on HMS Surprise and giving Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) and his crew the surprise of their lives. Not only does the rest of the plot chart how Aubrey cleverly evades the French, but also his egoistical refusal to tuck his rudder between his sails. Half-way through the story, this phantom French ship reappears without warning and sends our heroes scurrying again, though they do cobble together a skillful ruse to mislead the enemy.Once again, the British are cast as underdogs! Eventually, 'Lucky' Jack turns to his right-hand man, the ship's surgeon Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany, Crowe's co-star in ""A Beautiful Mind"") who shows his life-long friend how the study of biology can bail him out of tough straits. The biggest problem with this sumptuously produced reenactment of early 19th century naval warfare is its PG-13 realism about life on a British warship. Weir and his scenarist appear more committed to lecturing audiences about good citizenship than depicting events with nominal realism. Torn between the needs of his crew versus the demands of command, Crowe's Captain Aubrey emerges as hopelessly sentimental. Yes, one scene features a flogging, but Weir and company bring PG-13 restraint to the fore with a little blood in sight as possible when a crew member takes his lashes.Altogether, despite its top-drawer production values, gorgeous cinematography, and inspired staging of its sea battles, ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" fall far short of those entertaining swashbucklers of yesteryear. Furthermore, its obsession with gratuitous good citizenship propaganda, its abysmal lack of a villain, and a shortage of charismatic heroes nearly sinks this ambitious yarn.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

21,Boba_Fett1138,A long sit.,6,9 December 2005,"This movie is a typical case of 'you'll either love it or hate it'. I for one certainly didn't liked this movie a whole lot but I can understand how to somebody else this movie might seem like a dream coming true, if you're a fan of sea adventures.""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" actually isn't a long movie (138 minutes) but still it feels like an 3 hour+ movie. Reason for this is the storytelling. The movie is slow and basically most of the movie is about the characters talking and having diner aboard and in between they have some battles on the sea. I didn't found to be the story terribly appealing but like I said before if you're interested in this kind of historical stuff this is simply a must see for you. I feel that don't that a movie set almost entirely on the sea is that interesting and appealing to watch. The only movie that ever has succeeded in creating a good and interesting story set almost entirely on the sea is ""Das Boot"". The movie is well crafted and has some wonderful cinematography and a suiting musical score. The atmosphere is great and wonderfully dark and realistic at times. So visually there is very little wrong with this movie.There are some good battle sequences, with good sound-effects and visual effects but those moments are not good enough to make the movie a must see, or an interesting watch.The movie would had been better for me if it had some better characters in it. I still don't exactly know who all those characters were and what drove them. The only character that are truly deepened out a bit are the characters played by Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany, on which the movie mainly focuses. The characters could had made the movie more interesting to follow but instead it remains nothing more than a missed opportunity.Paul Bettany was really superb in this movie. Yes, even better as Russell Crowe, who also was perfectly cast in the movie. The movie has a good supporting cast but their characters aren't really interesting for the story.It most certainly isn't a bad movie but it's a long sit that isn't always interesting enough to follow.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
22,view_and_review,Pride Cometh Before the Victory,4,25 February 2021,"Who said pride cometh before the fall? In an incorrigible act of pride and cocksureness, an English captain defeated a French ship that was bigger, faster, and better armed. When a wiser man would've recognized his insufficiency in the face of the odds, Lucky Jack (Russell Crowe) saw an opportunity to etch his name in the annals of history.I thought for sure this movie was going to be about the Captain Ahabs of the world who chase their Moby Dick until their own demise. When Lucky Jack and his English naval vessel was soundly beaten by a French frigate it seemed like the smartest thing to do was to go home to repair, reload, and regroup. They suffered heavy damage, a few casualties, and many injuries, and what more, they were up against a superior foe. But Lucky Jack said there would be no going home. Upon his orders they pursued the better ship though it could have meant certain death.I guess I should've known that the English were the heroes in this movie and no way were some weak Frenchmen, even in a superior ship, going to defeat the English. So, then, what was the point of this naval movie except to show grimy men braving the sea and cannons blasting holes in wooden ships?David will always slay Goliath.Thank you, now give me my $150M budget and my inflated reviews.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Paul Bettany (almost unrecognizable from his role as Crowe's ""roommate"" in ""A Beautiful Mind"") deliver fine supporting work as Crowe's friend torn between duty and science.  Newcomer Max Pirkis shows some nice work as well.  The letdown in this movie is from the script.  It tries to be ""The Art of War"" and ""Patton"", but fails.

27,SimonJack,One of the best sailing and outstanding sea action films,10,27 June 2017,"""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is one of the best, if not the best, movie ever made of sailing. Most of the very good sailing movies were made by the mid-20th century. Interest in stories set on the sea or that involved seafaring in history had mostly passed by the late 20th century. So, to have a film such as this, set almost entirely on the ocean, with ships at sea a great deal of the time, was almost novel in 2003.I first saw this film when it came out on the big screen, and I have watched and enjoyed it a couple times since then. Hundreds of others have commented by now, many providing information about the plot and film. So, my comments will focus on the source material and the movie production. This movie has some of the best sailing footage ever put on film. Although only 10 days were spent filming on board the ship at sea, the filmmakers put tremendous work into making this movie seem as real as possible. The background on the film is an interesting read. Director Peter Weir went to great lengths to give the film an aura of authenticity. He filmed a real typhoon for scenes to be used in this movie.The storm scenes around Cape Horn were filmed on another ship. The battle sounds were researched and made to sound real. The ship designs, in refiguring existing ships, were precise for the time and place. The camera work was outstanding. The movie earned two Academy Awards out of 10 nominations. Had it not been for the biggest blockbuster film of 2003, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,"" it's likely that ""Master and Commander"" would have garnered half a dozen more Oscars that year.The source material for the movie is most interesting. The 20th Century Fox team writers used events from several novels of a 20-book series written by English novelist Patrick O'Brian (1914-2000). They are referred to as the Aubrey-Maturin series, after the names of the two heroes. In the film, Russell Crowe plays Captain Jack Aubrey, and Paul Bettany plays Dr. Stephen Maturin. Both men are fictional characters, and critics have tried to determine who, if anyone, Aubrey's character is based upon.Most conclude that his character and exploits closely resemble those of Lord Thomas Cochrane who was a real naval hero of England during the Napoleonic Wars. He also was a renowned naval commander who helped countries in South America and elsewhere. Another inspiration for Aubrey's character and exploits was Captain William Woolsey. The film title comes from the combined titles of two of those novels, ""Master and Commander,"" and ""The Far Side of the World.""For all the swashbuckling films of the past I have seen, and historical seafaring movies of exploration and adventure, I don't recall any that depicted sailing as well as this one. Those interested in history, exploration, discovery, nature and species, old-time warfare on the high seas, or just plain good drama should enjoy this film. No one of any age will find it boring.This was the first feature film shot on the Galapagos Islands. There's much more interesting to the background of this film. You'll find many tidbits under the Did You Know? section (trivia, et al) here on the IMDb Web page for the movie. This is a great movie to have for any film library. It's a fine film that the whole family should enjoy.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
28,Mr-Fusion,A thrilling voyage,7,15 June 2015,"There's a beautiful shot in the closing moments of ""Master and Commander"" showing the infinite expanse of the seas as our gallant H.M.S. Surprise (once again) pursues her prey. It's just a very defining image to me, not only because it's the essence of the story (the gallant H.M.S. surprise chasing the enemy vessel through weather, battle and misfortune), but it brings home this crew's dogged determination in the face of danger. And Russell Crowe - so ideal is this casting - embodies Captain Jack Aubrey's boyish charms and steely grit as he leads his men to war. Mostly, this is just a thoroughly engaging sea movie. The battle scenes are exciting, the characters leave an impression, and the atmosphere is incredible. Between the sounds of the waters and the creaking wood of the ship, the fury of the ocean is nothing to laugh at.

31,JamesHitchcock,A Vivid Picture of Men at War,8,21 February 2004,"Possible SpoilersThe late Stanley Kubrick, capable of producing brilliantly original films quite different to anything else (`A Clockwork Orange' is a good example), was also capable of producing brilliant work within the confines of an established genre. Although `Spartacus' is in some ways a typical sword-and-sandal epic made at a time when such films were highly popular, it is so well done that it is possibly the best example of that particular genre, and quite equal in quality to anything in Kubrick's later work.
It seems to me that Peter Weir is perhaps the nearest thing we have to a Kubrick working at present. Like Kubrick, he is selective about his projects, sometimes waiting several years between one film and the next. (`Master and Commander' is his first film since `The Truman Show' in 1998). Like Kubrick, he is determined not to become stereotyped or to repeat himself, and tries to make each film different to its predecessors. And like Kubrick he can both work within established conventions and produce work which is unconventional. `Picnic at Hanging Rock' and `The Truman Show' are both, in their different ways, strange and haunting films, different to anything before or since (and two of my favourite films of all time, as is another Weir film, `Dead Poets' Society'). `Witness', on the other hand, falls firmly within the conventions of the standard crime thriller, but is also one of the best crime thrillers ever made.`Master and Commander' is another example of Weir excelling while working within an established genre, the war film. Weir has, of course, made an earlier film about war, the anti-war `Gallipoli' set in World War One. `Master and Commander' is a different type of war film- the type that follows the fortunes of a tightly knit unit of fighting men. The unit in question can be an Army platoon or an Air Force squadron, but in this case, it is a warship in the British Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. The British commander, Jack Aubrey, is under orders to intercept and stop a French warship, the Acheron, which is preying on British shipping, and pursues his orders with dogged determination, despite coming off second-best in an early clash with the French ship.Although this is a different type of film to `Gallipoli', the two films have one thing in common in that both have at their centre a friendship between two young men of contrasting characters. In `Master and Commander', the friendship is between Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, the ship's doctor. Aubrey (an excellent performance from Russell Crowe) is a man of action, patriotic and with a strong sense of duty. Maturin is the contemplative, intellectual type, fascinated by science, but with little interest in the war. (He- something of a proto-Darwin- would rather spend time on his researches into the natural history of the Galapagos Islands). Despite their contrasting natures, and occasional disagreements, the two are firm friends. Some films would have exaggerated the contrasts between them, but that temptation is here resisted. It would have been easy to portray Aubrey as an uncultured philistine, but in fact he shares Maturin's love of music and joins him in playing duets. Again, there might have been a temptation to play Maturin as a cowardly weakling, but we see that he too is capable of courage and resourcefulness when he is accidentally wounded in a shooting incident and has to give instructions for an operation on himself. I have not read Patrick O'Brian's novels on which the film is based, but I have heard them referred to as the `Aubrey-Maturin' novels, which would suggest that the two characters are given equal prominence. In the film (perhaps because Russell Crowe is a stronger actor than Paul Bettany) Aubrey seems to be the figure at the centre of the action, with Maturin playing Watson to his Holmes or Robin to his Batman.The film tries to give as vivid a view of life at sea as possible, with great attention to detail. It is visually both realistic and exciting, particularly during the battle scenes. At first, I wondered if it was giving a somewhat sanitised picture of naval life, but the darker elements became visible later. We see the rigid discipline- a sailor is flogged for insubordination- and the suffering caused by war. (A young midshipman, no more than a boy, loses an arm in battle, but bears his loss with an extraordinary stoicism, which I would have thought unrealistic, were I not aware of real-life examples of young sailors behaving with comparable heroism). We also see the peculiarly superstitious nature of naval life- one officer is ostracised and driven to suicide because he has a reputation for being a `Jonah' (one who brings bad luck). Aubrey, on the other hand, although he is a firm disciplinarian, is highly popular with the crew because they regard him as lucky.In Britain, the film has mostly been seen as a patriotic adventure story. I think, however, there is more to it than that. Although I doubt if it will do well in France, I do not think that you have to be British to appreciate the film. Like many films of this type, the audience's identification is with the men themselves rather than with their country or their cause. The exclamation `This ship is England!' can be taken as a patriotic rallying-call, but can also be seen as reflecting the fact that many sailors (and many fighting men in general) fight as much for their comrades as for their country. This is perhaps particularly true of sailors of this period, who spent many months (or even years) away from home in the hermetic environment of the ship. The natural dangers of the sea meant that they had to rely upon each other for survival even when they were not facing the enemy. It is not therefore surprising that close bonds formed between them and that comradeship and teamwork are themes running through this film. (The element of male bonding is emphasised by the almost complete lack of female characters). This may not be a classic like some of Weir's earlier films, but it is both an exciting tale of adventure and an intelligent study of men at war. 8/10.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Crowe puts on a decent enough performance, although he missed out on the Oscar. Aubrey is portrayed as a Captain Ahab type of character, with an obsessive need to find the French ship and take her. His alter ego on the voyage is the ship's doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), a naturalist at heart (really a pre-Darwin Darwinian) who would really prefer to be on the Galapagos Islands, where the Surprise weighs anchor for a while, studying the wildlife. The relationship between Aubrey and Maturin takes up much of the ""in between battles"" times of the movie, as the two try to work out the conflict involved in being good personal friends who have a strong disagreement about the pursuit while on the other hand dealing with the fact that Aubrey is Maturin's commander. Some find this relationship fascinating; I found it typical of the rest of the movie - dull.Needless to say I didn't come away as a fan. For the marvelous battle scenes alone - 4/10.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
35,paul2001sw-1,Lavish but straightforward,6,5 November 2006,"Russell Crowe plays an English naval commander in this cumbersomely-named, lavish, but fundamentally straightforward tale of the Napoleonic Wars. It's to director Peter Weir's credit that, despite it's great length, this movie rarely drags, and the detail of life at sea is painstakingly reconstructed (although the common bond of endeavour among the crew is perhaps overdone). But it doesn't really catch fire either, lacking as it does a certain moral complexity; Crowe's character is a hero lacking not only in fatal flaws, but any discernible flaws at all. The beautifully reconstructed ships compensate for the complete (but correct) absence of women in the cast.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
36,dromasca,"Well made, but so boring...",6,8 May 2004,"It seems there are quite a lot fans of naval history movies. They liked and will like this film, and I cannot but respect their right to like the genre. As I do not belong to the category, I did not enjoy it at all - on the contrary I found it just boring.Not to be mistaken, this is by no means a bad movie. I can guess that a lot of work was invested in documenting the historical period, the naval rules, life, and battles during the Napoleonic wars. All this deserves salute, but does not save the movie in my opinion. The problem with the film is that it is linear and flat, the characters are from the beginning to the end the same, the action is too thin and too easy to predict to be interesting at all. Russell Crowe plays here what wants to be another great epic character, but what a difference between the complex and memorable Maximus in 'Gladiator' and the role here, without any nuance, any evolution, any surprise. His acting is decent, good even maybe, but even he cannot save the film. Be warned, unless you are a fan of history or naval movies, and despite the money, effects, and research it took to make this film, you may regret the time spent watching it. 6/10 on my personal scale.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
37,Cineanalyst,Lost at Sea,6,16 July 2004,"There are platitudes about how great, and lucky, a naval commander Jack Aubrey is; there's chatter about the even greater Nelson (Britain's famous naval hero, who died in the Napoleonic Wars). Based on Patrick O'Brian's novels, ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is fine at romanticizing the sea, shipmen, boats and war, and there's adequate appreciation for detail. The story, however, is lacking. In the movie, the conversations between Aubrey and the ship's surgeon (played by Paul Bettany, who had even more frivolous squabbles with Crowe in ""A Beautiful Mind"") expose the men's differences and not much more. The captain wants to achieve the glory of Nelson and save Britain from Napoleon; the surgeon wants to achieve the glory of Darwin and go searching for new species in the Galápagos Islands. I don't think cinematography of water, or the lackluster battle scenes were the focus. (In the first battle, Peter Weir takes from ""Saving Private Ryan,"" with Crowe doing the deaf and shocked thing that Hanks did so well.) Overall, I think Weir failed; I wasn't captivated, thrilled, touched or left in wonder or contemplation.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

The main characters are the captain and the doctor. The other crew members just blends in the whole tale.The acting is phenomenal. Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany, and Billy Boyd did very good jobs. They were believable and they did not seem to make any mistakes.The scenery is great. I saw some nice shots of the ocean and the islands.Most people might not agree with me on this fact, but I could'not help feel somewhat bored during some scenes of the movie.

39,lesleyharris30,"Performances are Great, but it lacks Excitement and Memorability,",7,1 April 2016,"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is a good movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a stellar cast. The high octane action sequences and set pieces are enjoyable, but the movies highlight is without a doubt the performances, Russell Crowe shines in the lead role as a charismatic pirate, Paul Bettany is also stellar as the crew's doctor, the scene in which he performs an operation on himself is the best part for me. As far as the story goes, it's lackluster, their really is not anything about this screenplay that showed that this was made for any reason other than making money, there's no big surprises or genuinely thrilling moments, it all, quite literally, just floats along for two hours. The film clearly relied too much on the fact that it was the beginning of a series, because it is holding back, clearly wanting to save some great moments for sequels, which never ended up happening, and not giving enough here, they really should have just focused on this movie, taking more advantage of the potential it had. While it may not have been as good as it could have, Master and Commander boasts great action and stellar acting, worth the watch if you ever see it on television or Netflix.

40,ironhorse_iv,Come aboard on the HMS Surprise,7,20 March 2013,"The Surprise has just been ordered to pursue the French privateer Acheron at any cost during the sea battles of the Napoleonic Wars. The Acheron has been preying on Britain's whaling fleet and only Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) and his crew can stop them. The movie is based on three novels in author Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey and Maturin series. The series based on Jack Aubrey's real life career has a total of twenty novels. Most of this story plot comes from the book, Far Side of the World. However, in the film version, the action takes during the Napoleonic wars, instead of during the War of 1812. The producers wished to avoid offending American audiences. In consequence, the fictional opponent was changed from the USS Norfolk to the French privateer frigate Acheron. I find this to be very disappointing as the film is not loyal to the source material and that the fact that having a movie about the Angelo and American conflict would be so much interesting since there isn't so many of them out there rather than another Napoleonic piece. Other than that, most of the film tries to stay true to the books. Other scenes are taken out from Patrick O'Brian novel's Desolation Island and the book, Master and Commander. Great efforts were made to reproduce the authentic look and feel of life aboard an early nineteenth century man of war by director Peter Weir. Rather than sporting computer graphic illusions, the film filmed on the reproduction of the eighteen century post ship Rose. All of the actors were given a thorough grounding in the naval life of the period in order to make their performances as authentic as possible. The characters are so well developed to the point, it makes you feel you are there with them. So realistic. The script was great in its character development and direction. The acting by Russell Crowe is outstanding. The cinematography is great as I love the shots at Galapagos with Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) studying the animals and plants on the island. The music is pretty amazing. Great work by Christopher Gordon, Richard Tognetti and Iva Davies, lead singer of the Australian band Icehouse. Safe and sound at home again. Let the waters roar, Jack! Lyrics to the sea shanty, 'Don't Forget Your Old Shipmate' is one of the best things about the film. It's just nice to hear these long forgotten sea hymns. Spanish Ladies and The British Tars which was set to tune of Bonnie Ship the Diamond is also interesting to listen. The truest depiction of life aboard an eighteen century Man O' War on film since Mutiny on the Bounty. I have to admit I was slightly disappointed about the ending. It's such an annoying cliff hanger. It's made worst to the fact that there will probably not going to be a sequel to the film, any time soon. The movie can be a bit boring to some, as it had a very slow pace to it. The movie felt like a documentary movie, rather than a good historical action movie. It didn't keep me on the edge of my seat. Having a ship chasing after a superior ship could have been an Ahab hunt of the white whale type of a story that would make the story so much interesting, but the movie is lost without a sense of depth with pointless scenes at Galapagos Island. I think most people came to this film to see two battleships duke it out. If I wanted a natural geographic special. I'd have watched Jaques Cousteau or Charles Darwin instead. It was devoid of charm, humor and anything resembling amusement. Hollywood's attempt at being cerebral was just not working for me. I give it props, it was so so, but anyone with a short attention span, this movie isn't for them. Check out, HMS Defiant, a British adventure film released in 1962 if you like these types of movies. In my opinion, that movie is better than this. Still, if you watching this, just make sure you don't fall asleep on the helm.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
41,tomgillespie2002,As thoughtful as it is gripping,8,13 April 2013,"One of the best failures to launch a franchise in film history, Peter Weir's beautiful sea-faring epic, Master and Commander, was overshadowed commercially by that other ship-based film to come out the same year, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. While Gore Verbinski's box-office smash was a lot of fun and managed to re-create the sense of comedy-adventure perfected in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) (while making billions with its sequels for Disney), Master and Commander goes about its business quietly, creating tender scenes of human interaction alongside some magnificent sea-battles of its own. So the novels of Patrick O'Brian are seemingly destined to remain an untapped resource in cinema, but there is still plenty to enjoy here as a stand-alone film.During the Napoleonic wars, captain of the HMS Surprise, 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), has been given the task of pursuing French privateer Ancheron, and to 'sink, burn, or take her as a prize'. When one of the crew hears the distant sound of bells one night, the Surprise is taken unawares by the immense power of Ancheron, which is near twice the size of Surprise, and wields much more firepower. Almost fatefully damaged, Aubrey takes the Surprise and retreats into the fog to repair the damage, only to be attacked and pursued again. They reach the Galapagos Islands, where Aubrey predicts Ancheron will head to in order to attack Britain's whaling fleet, and will allow time for the ships doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) to walk the islands to gather specimens and notes on the wildlife.After the exciting opening that shows the almost complete destruction of the HMS Surprise, Weir takes us in close quarters with the various levels of the ship's hierarchy from the mates who lie packed like sardines inside the ship being fed on gruel and rum, to the spacious quarters of the captain and his lieutenants. Drinking wine and eating steaks in what looks like a grand dining room of aristocracy, Aubrey and his immediate underlings are certainly privileged. This is mirrored in the scenes of Jack and Stephen playing violin together, and while these moments are key to understanding the close friendship between the two despite them clearly being men of differing values, it also shows their upper-class backgrounds. The shipmates are less so. They are happy being rewarded for good work with double-helpings of gruel, but have an almost necessary brutish nature that becomes apparent when they begin to bully Midshipman Hollom (Lee Ingleby).As well as portraying the societal structure of Britain within the confines of a ship, the film is also about the trappings of power. Jack and Stephen's philosophical discussions about this subject when Jack's hand is forced for the survival of the ship, causes Stephen to compare Jack's behaviour to Nero. Jack argues that the men require discipline and a strong hand to follow while Stephen advises that such an attitude can lead a man to be seduced by the trappings of power. There is also the matter of Jack's pride. At what point does duty end and ego begin? The pursuit of Ancheron will surely lead to the Surprise's demise and the death of its crew, but the men will follow 'Lucky' Jack no matter what.Don't be fooled though, Master and Commander offers scenes of relentless action, with the Academy Award-winning cinematography and sound editing coming together to form scenes that are as beautiful as they are breathless. The hand-held camera gets deep into the action, as cannonball's smash through the ship, sending razor-sharp splinters into the air and taking men's limbs with them. 14-year old midshipman Blakeney (Max Pirkis) loses an arm in the opening battle, and his idolising of Jack and Stephen forms the heart of the film. Jack is strength and leadership, Stephen is calm and thoughtful, characteristics on opposite sides of the spectrum, but Blakeney wants to be both. Sometimes it can feel crammed with too many ideas, but Master and Commander is a terrific film, and, like a lot of Weir's back catalogue, manages to be as thoughtful as it is gripping.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

43,Red-125,Great sea scenes!,7,15 April 2004,"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003), directed by Peter Weir, is based on the popular novels of Patrick O'Brian.  The star of the movie is Russell Crowe as Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey.  Crowe does an outstanding job in the role of a competent, capable commander, who is also clearly a flawed human being.   Paul Bettany is adequate in the difficult role of Dr. Stephen Maturin, the ship's surgeon.  I found the dialog hard to follow, and some of the sub-plots hard to understand.  It was difficult to differentiate among the younger officers, and follow the plot threads that involved them.

To understand the film, however, its necessary to forget the book, set in a different conflict between British and Americans. The creative freedom of cinema has these things. The best of the film, however, is not the action or war scenes, but the way it accurately portrays the ""modus vivendi"" of a navy crew during this time. The historical portrait made is absolutely strict and this is something that a historian, like me, knows how to value and thank. Superstitions, war tactics, uniforms, hygiene and eating habits, relationship between military hierarchies, scientific research... all have been portrayed in a trustworthy way.Russel Crowe is the main actor and manages to perfectly embody the spirit of stubbornness and determination of an old sea lion. Beside him, the detailed and meticulous spirit of the naval surgeon Dr. Maturin is personified by Paul Bettany in a grandiose way, especially when both are together on the scene. There are other good actors, I especially liked a young man who plays a boy who, at the beginning of the film, loses an arm in combat (I didn't memorize actor's name but he did a great job). Another detail that delighted me was the soundtrack and the use of music during the film. Cinematography is excellent, particularly in combat and storm scenes.

49,ianlouisiana,"Rum,bum and concertina...............",9,17 May 2009,"Patrick O'Brian is the John le Carre of the sea story.Where the earlier acknowledged masters of the genre(C.S.Forrester always excepted)often gave life in King George's Navy a gloss of glamour it never possessed,Mr O'Brian detailed it with a cold eye for the squalor of the Lower Deck.He also invested his adventure stories with the trappings of literacy - involved plotting,character development,historical research that,combined,made him virtually sui generis. Certainly ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey and Dr Stephen Maturin are 20th century men nearly 200 years before their time. The good doctor is brave and cool - headed enough to operate on himself to remove a lead ball form his chest,passionate enough to play a Bach gigue on his cello,percipient enough to grasp the significance of the Galapagos Islands to Naturalists and stubborn enough to gainsay his Captain who,after all,has power of life and death over his crew. He is the mirror - image of Aubrey himself,who,if a slightly less complex character,shares many of his friend's qualities. Life for the crew - many of whom would have been press - ganged - was generally recognised to centre round ""Rum,bum and concertina"" and two of the three are well represented in ""Master and Commander"".The third may be read in the glances given to some of the many very young boys scampering round the gundecks. Aubrey (Mr Russell Crowe) is respected and feared by his crew.Whilst by no means a tyrant,he knows that sometimes discipline can only be maintained by taking hard action and does not hesitate to do so when faced with a potentially explosive incident caused by inaction by a weak officer. This is a long movie,but the strength of the plot and the quality of the performances and,above all,the realistic scenes aboard ship in heavy seas and in battle,the creaking ropes,the decks slippery with blood,the deafening roar of the guns and their devastating effect on wood and flesh,keep it sharp and riveting. For all his acuity,Captain Aubrey is not omnipotent,and this frailty - if it be one - makes him even more sympathetic,as the end of the movie proves.

Crowe & Bettany, as they both did in `A Beautiful Mind', deliver potent performances that were beautifully executed. Auteur Peter Weir's astonishing direction of high-seas battle sequences was the work of a skilled craftsman. However, I must admit that i was drowned with boredom with the film's screenplay, which was as long-winded as some of the sea storms shown in the film. `Master & Commander: The Far Side of the World' is unnecessary lengthy but it does not deserve for you to `wave' bye-bye in midway through its cinematic voyage. *** Average",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
51,CubsandCulture,A wonderful film and wonderful adaptation technique.,10,21 March 2021,"The popular reception of this film-a lukewarm box office in which the film either lost money or barely broke even despite the critical love-forms one of the great disappointments in my life. I don't normally care about this but this is one of the very few films I longed for a sequel upon seeing it the very first time. The film was intended to launch a franchise as the book series it is based on runs 20 complete volumes, and a 21st unfinished work. I wanted at least 1 more film in this series because I enjoy the film so much and so much of the books was left to tell. The film's technical aspects are impressive-and I will say more about them in a moment-but it is really the screenplay that makes this movie.Aubrey-Maturin series is wonderfully layered, detailed and mosaic of the British Navy c. 1800-1815. O'Brian's books are not plot driven and much of their joy is the period detail, a day in the life aspects. Aubrey and Maturin are *exceptionally* well realized characters; this portrayal of male friendship is one of the best in all of English literature. I think the any *single* novel would be hard to adapt outright-none of them fit neatly into a traditional 3 act screenplay. Weir and Collee hit upon a brilliant technique to address this. The actual story of the film is largely new and not found in any of the novels-the plot most resembles The Far Side of the World but it is the mere skeleton of that novel. Instead certain scenes or notions are stitched together from *several* of the novels-Master and Commander, HMS Surprise, The Fortune of War, The Letter of Marque, The Far Side of the World etc. to tell a new story involving these characters. Lines of dialog are lifted from about a dozen of the novels. if you know the novels well-and I do-the film plays a bit like the greatest hit of the series. (Through I wish Maturin's intelligence work and opium addiction were worked in more overtly. If you know what you are looking for it is there. Only ""problem"" with the film) But despite that the film feels complete and it forms a perfectly enjoyable introduction to this world.
The decision to keep the film almost exclusive on the Surprise solidifies the traditionalism of the film. There is a purity in the storytelling that feels like O'Brian was merely copied into cinema. This brings me to my other major point of discussion. This is one of the very films I really like that is conservative in political meaning of that term. While Maturin is often allowed to voice (forms of) liberalism this film, like the novels, is Burkean toryism defined. The respect for ordered society and hierarchy, the foolishness-weakness of individuals, God and Country being the height of identity, British practicality and empiricism is all here. I admire the purity of the expressions of these values and I enjoy the dialectic that Maturin forms with them. The characters feel caught in an endless tradition in this film and I can't help but think Burke would approval of this.Returning the film proper, the technical aspects transport the viewer into this world. The cinematography is especially painterly and some shots reminds me of Turner's naval compositions. The special effects are perfectly realized and a classic blend of models, CGI, splicing footage etc. There is a romanticism of this time period for me and the film captures it. I can't tell you how much I love to get lost in the details of the canons, sails, the grape shot, the creak of wood, the changing of the watch, the naturalist's expedition and the witticisms.
But above all it is the complex and authentic friendship between Jack and Stephen that makes me love this film. Intense, intimate relationships between men are rare to find in cinema-especially if they are intimate without being erotic. It is even rarer to have the give and take, vulnerability and acts of sacrifice depicted with ease as it is done here. Crowe and Bettany are tailored made for these characters and I simply love both of their performances. (Fun sidenote: Weir was petrified that people would think Stephen was imaginary because of A Beautiful Mind to the point that he made sure that several characters interacted with him *prior* to Jack.)",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

I liked the way the characters developed, especially the differences between Jack and Stephen, but I wanted to see an epic tale on the ocean.Partially I got what I wanted. Unfortunately there are only two main battles and with 140 minutes running time it seems to take a lot of time before they arrive. A good thing is that when the battles come they are terrific. Sometimes a little hard to follow may be, but overall it looks great. Not only the battles for that matter; the costumes, the art direction and set decoration and the cinematography are all flawless. For the looks this movie would be a masterpiece. The movie as a whole is not a masterpiece but it is still good. I just think it could have been better in some ways.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
56,truemythmedia,Bloody Brilliant,10,25 June 2019,"Overall Master and Commander is truly one of the greatest, if not the greatest story of ships at sea. The battles are big and satisfying, and ultimately rewarding, and the quiet moments are often intimate, with mystery and also exciting and humorous as we watch the crew deal with this long quest of hunting down the enemy. I really don't have enough good things to say about this instant classic, other than if you haven't seen it, watch it right away, and the same can be said if you have already seen it, watch it again.

57,RatedVforVinny,A great victory for the art of film making.,9,28 May 2020,"Peter Weir is surely a very accomplished director, who just loves to get every detail correct and proper. From building ships to selecting a capable cast that could act and learn the ropes on board a British Napoleonic Warship. The action, realism and pace is spot on, whilst the intrinsic relationships make it pretty much stand out from anything previous. This film was hard work for real but paid off a treat. As far as I understand the story was based on a fight between an American and a British ship but the former was changed to French (naturally), as it was an American backed film. Hollywood has done this many a time but it's only a small glitch. Russell Crowe on his own is enough to guarantee the quality, in both action and his unique period style acting.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
58,doomedmac,Very cool!,8,20 February 2021,Master And Commander is an extremely specific movie. It's really well-made and never boring.,Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
59,Movie-ManDan,Pirates of the WHAT!?,9,25 January 2021,"2003 was a pretty competitive year for big-budgeted action epics. The third and final instalment of the ""Lord of the Rings"" ate up all the Oscars, the first ""Kill Bill"" had that Tarantino magic, ""The Last Samurai"" was too much like other acclaimed films, and the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" sat perfectly with Disney. Where does that leave the first adaptation of Patrick O'Brian's work. The film from 2003 that this is the most like is ""Pirates"" but this is is more serious. This being more serious doesn't make it better, but it certainly is the better film.Russell Crowe was on a roll in the late 90s and early 2000s. LA Confidential, The Insider, Gladiator (his crowning work), A Beautiful Mind (what should have been his crowning work), then this. He plays the charismatic captain of the HMS Surprise, Jack Aubrey. I have never read the series of books that this is based upon, but I guarantee Crowe's portrayal was on. If not, then I am just a big sucker for deep, alive characters.Aboard the Surprise is a wide array of fleshed out and memorable characters. Other than the Captain, the main guy is Stephen Maturin who is the doctor on the ship, played with grace by Paul Bettany. He also educates those aboard. Some more characters include a boy who must get his arm amputated, but that never stops him from learning. One major strength this flick has is its sense of friendship and comradely. They are all for one and one for all (what this is alluding to is inferior to this majestic film).Master & Commander takes place during the Napoleonic Wars in the sea. The Surprise represents England and their mission is to destroy the French Acheron. Jack's mission eats away at everyone as he grows more obsessed with winning the fight. He is like Captain Ahab, but more nuanced. This shows the depth and complexity in the Jack Aubrey character and brings us deep into his mind. Although this doesn't dive quite as deep as an Ingmar Bergman film, the way the characters are developed in this are still fascinating and the way it should be for all films.The battle scenes are astonishing as can be. We get man versus man, man versus nature, and man versus self. The man versus man battle scenes with the cannons and guns are usually the first thing that people notice with this, and they are definitely as good as people say.Master & Commander is an entertaining and poignant film that is one of the year's best. How only one novel in the series of twenty got adapted to the big screen is beyond me. I say they reboot this as a series for Netflix or Crave.4/4",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
60,rosscinema,This ship is England!,8,15 November 2003,"This ranks right up there with all the great sea adventures ever filmed and I think you can make a case that this is one of the best. The script is based on the novels of Patrick O'Brian and it carefully balances the magnificent battle scenes with character development so we can understand the way these men behave during war. The story is about the men on board an English ship called the HMS Surprise and Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is the Captain in charge. Also on board is Ship Surgeon Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) who is greatly interested in biology and a good friend of Aubrey. The Surprise gets involved in a sea battle with the French warship Acheron and they are forced to flee and repair damages. Its 1805 and they're mission is to keep the French from controlling the waters off of Brazil. Aubrey heads to the Galapagos Islands and figures out where the Acheron will be going so they can try and find it. Aubrey wants to continue the chase but Maturin questions his logic and suggests that they go to the nearest port for the ships repairs but Aubrey rejects that idea. During the voyage we see the Surprise get caught in a terrible storm where Aubrey has to give the order to cut the line and leave a seaman floundering in the water. One of the Midshipman is Lord Blakeney (Max Pirkis) who is only 13 years old and after the first battle with the Acheron his arm is broken and has to be amputated. During the stay at Galapagos Aubrey gets an idea of disguising his ship as a whaler and getting close enough to initiate a battle. This exciting film is directed by the great Peter Weir and while his talents as a director are more towards character development I think thats why this film works so splendidly. The film consists of two battles with another ship and sandwiched in between is the peril of a fierce storm that endangers the ship to a point where it could sink. Weir does a great job of allowing the viewer to get to know each character intimately and in certain scenes we see that some of the seamen have been shanghaied. It reminds us how different things were during war and young boys were put in charge. Its hard to shake the indelible image of a 13 year old with one arm leading grown men into battle! The core of this film is the performance by Crowe. He's perfectly cast and its because of his incredible charisma on screen. The role of Captain Aubrey had to be cast for an actor that you would believe could lead men into battle and Crowe is that actor. Like Mel Gibson in ""Braveheart"" and Kenneth Branagh in ""Henry V"" we can envision Crowe inspiring men to go to war. Once again Crowe proves to be one of the best actors of our time. Aubrey plays the violin and we get a sense of how well rounded a person he is. Bettany is also excellent as Maturin and his friendship with Aubrey is evident. He seems to be the only one capable of matching wits with him and we sense that is one of the reasons Aubrey admires him. The battle scenes are both brutal and exhilarating. We watch as cannon balls rip into and through the sides of ships and its the type of warfare that we haven't seen very much in films, at least not filmed this great. This is a truly rousing adventure film on epic scales and its extremely exciting to watch.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
61,eric262003,Great Film But A Bit Light On the Storytelling,8,16 August 2021,"Set during the Napoleonic Wars in 1805, ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"", is a on the sea story about a British ship the HMS Surprise led by Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) as they are assigned to take down the French ship Acheron that's causing problems aross the coasts of Brazil. Under the direction of Peter Weir based loosely on the Aubrey-Maturin novels by author Patrick O'Brian, we are offered a visual masterpiece with an atmosphere that's second to none. The shots are truly a first-class A-level thing of beauty. Sadly however there are many scenes that are mundane in spite the fact that they are in the middle of a serious battle making everything abou it way too light in its premise. The execution is really good, however its concept is highly questionable.This movie is difficult to critique being that the positive things are way out in the open to fully appreciate and that the good does outweigh the bad. The failings in this movie are ubiquitous but subtle. To put it mildly though the movie is a work of fiction, the settings, props and costumes all seem to have the makings of a film based on real events and may have been inspired by real events this movie is very high in its authenticity. And though there were battle scenes that were brutal and bloody, they were few but far between. What's problematic about ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is that at times the direction where this movie is heading feels more like this movie seems for kids rather than adults.It tries to play it big and intelligent, but then as I sit through it, I don't find the necessity in its intentions. Sure the history and the knowledge is well researched and provocative, I just wish the story was given the same level as its historical accuracy. With its intentions and details given proper treatment, the lightness in its storytelling doesn't get the equal treatment it deserves, which is why this movie can't be regarded as a classic.The opening scenes are handled quite well, with a nice background of the Surprise floating along the tranquil seas, on a quiet morning. The tranquility of the open seas my look relaxing from an eye's view. However, the isolation and insufferable conditions is a sign nothing is settling about this voyage. When the battle scenes take charge, there's a sign that the ship itself isn't the only thing taking charge, but the crew behind it. When the cannon fire targets at them, the men on board prepare for heavy duty battle, not for the sake of being tough, but mostly for survival and that they can't turn away at any point.The film itself is not just based on ship battles, costume drama and what's happening behind the scenes involving the crew, but the interactions based on the friendship between the two most important authority figues on the ship. Led by Capt. Jack Aubrey (Crowe) we see a dedicated, determined leader destined to take down this rival, more advanced French ship and will take all risks necessary for his British pride. And the crew's doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), an intelligent, loyal, man of science and more critical thinker. He's also the only one in the crew who tell off Aubrey when he's wrong.Captain Aubrey's mission is to stop a French ship from entering Asia, only problem is, this rival ship is more powerful and advanced than the one he's commanding. The other crew thinks it's best to surrender and go back, but being stubborn and head-strong, he won't rest until he fulfills his mission regardless of putting himself or his crew's life in danger. The Acheron leads the Surprise all the way across the South Atlantic and into Cape Horn.Relying less on quotes and dialogue, Weir's direction truly demonstrates the isolation of being out to sea. The battle scenes are violent, but the serve a purpose and isn't just dependent on body counts and bloodshed. We feel the effects of what it's like to be on board a battleship back in the early 19th century. When we see a young boy get his arm amputated, the delivery will sadden and shock you, but will also intrigue you like the way Weir had intended. We don't get to see the amputation because the camera doesn't focus on it, which is just as well because we can still the kid's reaction when it's done. There is some fun scenes that don't take place on the ship like when Dr. Maturin and few associates explore the Galapagos Islands to explore the wildlife that inhabit the island.When it came to the script, Weir along with co-writer John Collee didn't put very thought into the story due to him never reading the Patrick O'Brian series of books. It just seems off-putting that the relationship between Captain Aubrey and Dr. Matruin seem to shift from great bond of mutual respect they have for one another to having a different perspective of this mission. It just feels schematic that director Weir saw this as an excuse for them to argue with each other. It starts to feel like the ""Star Trek"" movies where opinions clash and verbal war ensues and only stops when cooler heads prevail. It feels like a cliche that every movie has to have these kind of conflicts placed into the narrative just for the audience to choose who you root for.This conflict starts to lose concentration on the French ship and the deadly battle that comes with it. It's a great film but the script needed. More teeth to have kept us intrigued.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
62,winner55,first rate adventure film,9,15 July 2008,"The major difficulty in selling an adventure film to an audience is that it is not an action film. A good adventure film usually has two action set-pieces, one at the beginning, one at the end, but most of the rest of the film is given over to questing, suspense, drama, humor. Occasionally an adventure film does wander close to the boundary of the action film - The Wild Bunch is so violent, the fact that its structure is that of an adventure film (rather similar to that of Stevens' Gunga Din) usually gets overlooked. On the other hand, some adventure films lack a violent set-piece - The Wizard of Oz is an adventure film as well as a musical, and nobody slugs it out in a fist-fest, although of course the Cowardly Lion offers to.Master and Commander is a first-rate adventure film. Those who complain of the long chase with its complicated back-story plot-twists miss the whole point - the adventure film is all about those back-story plot-twists. The reason is clear: the adventure itself is usually a very simple problem about how to get from one point on the map to another (where some great deed is to be accomplished, etc.); all the excitements and meanings of the experience are in the complications - Gunga Din can't become the hero of his film if the British soldiers don't stumble about making mistakes. Although essentially brave, good-natured men, the soldiers oft give in to temptations to be greedy, lazy, dishonest - never Gunga Din.Although Captain Aubrey is certainly at the center of his story, we only really learn why he is 'master of the ship and commander of the men' from the events that occur around him, and from his relationships with his friend, his sailors, and, though they meet only briefly, the French captain. He knows not only how to make the hard decisions but also how to live with them, and still maintain a relative calm and generosity.The film is magnificently photographed. The historical detail is very convincing. The acting is first-rate. And after it is over, you feel as though you have experienced something new and wondrously strange - you have lived an adventure.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
63,screenman,The buckles were not particularly swashing.,5,23 April 2006,"The beginning of this movie looked promising. Watches made their way through the different decks of their vessel during the night. We saw an attempt to authentically recreate the gloomy stuffiness of life below during the great age of sail (it was almost too authentic, being little more than a series of lantern-lit tableaux).Individuals were introduced to us with very little preamble, apparently on the basis that we'd get to know them as the story unfolded. Well; I'm afraid I didn't. The story that did unfold was a cat-and-mouse chase caper that has been done more times than I've had ships biscuits and a tot of rum. For the most part it has also been done better, as in 'The Enemy Below'. Russell Crowe is competent as a hardcase with a vulnerable side, but that's a pretty easy pose, being the stock-in-trade of any number of one-dimensioners like Bruce Willis, Sly Stallone and so on. I found very little to empathise with, and so when the cannon-balls flew, I didn't much care who was in the firing-line.The battle scenes were very feisty, after the fashion of 'Saving Private Ryan'. I suppose we must take their realism on trust, nobody now being alive with first-hand experience.And then there was the sea. Sometimes it was rough, other times it was calm. Always it was big, but never magnificent. I am told that a camera was fixed to the prow of a tall-ship that was fortuitously heading for the cape at time of filming, in order to get some genuine high-seas footage. They needn't have bothered. A force-5 in The Solent would have delivered the goods.The French vessel had a mysterious way of ambushing them and laying chase - shades of 'Duel' there. And Cap'n Crowe pursued it with dogged zeal, even over-reaching his orders - shades of 'Moby Dick', now.Most of the personal conflicts and discoveries were formulaic and predictable (You just KNEW the doctor would find the French vessel on the other side of the island after good Cap'n Crowe had sacrificed the chase for his welfare). At other times it dragged like a kedge anchor, particularly during the 'musical' interludes.One interesting anomaly was the complete absence of rats. Remember; these vessels put to see for years. When rats got aboard - as they always did - they bred and bred, and having nowhere else to go: ran riot. There was no warfarin in those days. Furthermore, the crew were often in the habit of crapping in the ballast holds, giving their furry tenants an ongoing supply of offal to munch. And the stink? Well, what do you think? Likewise the cockroaches; They bred even faster. You shared your hammock with them. Perhaps Mr Crowe's starring sensibilities would not admit of such intimacy.I would like to say something positive about this movie. But apart from a profound relief when it ended, I can think of very little. If you're going to be authentic then do it right - or stick with Errol Flynn. Recently I watched an old 1950's movie called 'The Cruel Sea'. That was about hunting German subs rather than French Frigates. But in every aspect of presentation, from character to story to hardships, it was incomparably superior, and on a far more modest budget. Doubters should see them both back to back. And everyone who likes nautical movies should see the latter.As to 'Master & Commander'; for me it sank with all hands.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
64,bandw,Masterfully filmed,10,7 August 2008,"If you have ever wondered what it would be like to be on board a British Frigate circa 1805, I doubt if you will ever come any closer to that experience than by seeing this movie. Getting all the details right was clearly a labor of love - a real ship was actually constructed for the movie. The realism effected is astounding, with minimal use of GGI.James Aubrey (Russell Crowe) captains the HMS Surprise as it plays a cat and mouse game with the larger French warship Acheron. The two ships first encounter each other in battle off the coast of Brazil and continue their chase around Cape Horn to the Galapagos Islands and beyond. The scenes filmed on the Galapagos were an unexpected treat for me - I had never seen footage filmed there.Aubrey is accompanied by Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), a medical doctor, surgeon, naturalist, philosopher, and friend. Aubrey and Maturin have contrasting temperaments and I found Crowe and Bettany to be perfectly cast - Crowe the decisive man of action, very much in command of his crew, and Maturin the reflective scholar and medic. The battle scenes are great, but what makes this more than simply an action entertainment are the discussions and interactions between Aubrey and Maturin that are at the heart of the film. As much as they are in conflict each has an abiding respect for the other and each has something to teach the other - Maturin is ultimately forced into action and Aubrey learns a lesson in warfare from one of Maturin's insects. Aubrey and Maturin are bound together by music and are never in more accord than when they are playing cello and violin together. Music plays an essential role here; I know some people who remember this movie mostly for its music.Breathes there a man with soul so dead, yea even a landlubber, who is not stirred when the drums start beating and the Surprise heads out in pursuit of the Acheron?This was a staggering undertaking and fortunately all the effort paid off in producing a wonderful film.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
65,tomsview,Masterful and commanding,10,8 September 2013,"There is a scene in ""Master and Commander"" that encapsulates the spirit of this movie. It is not one of the spectacular action sequences or a scene of tension between the characters. Rather, it is when the officers of 'HMS Surprise' dine with their captain, Lucky Jack Albury, Russell Crowe's character.The men around the table range from senior officers to young midshipmen. The dinner is formal and the men are respectful of the captain's position; it is also obvious that they hold him in high regard. One of the officers asks the Captain if he would tell an anecdote about Lord Nelson. Aubrey obliges and holds his audience in the palm of his hand; the scene not only reveals the awe seamen had for Nelson during his lifetime, but it also captures a feeling for the language, the humour, and the temper of the times.Like everything else in the film it is the details, lovingly observed, that make it an exceptional experience.Cinema has produced some memorable films about life in the age of sail, but ""Master and Commander"" can stand with the best of them. In fact, the film's production team had compiled clips from about 50 of the best sailing and period movies ever made. This was done to learn what worked on the screen and what didn't.Directed by Peter Weir, the film is based on a series of books by Patrick O'Brian. These feature Captain Jack Aubrey and Doctor Stephen Maturin, played by Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany in the movie.Weir's script captures the fabric of the times and the characters involved. This is true to the philosophy of Patrick O'Brian, who felt that fabric was far more important than plot.While on patrol off Brazil, 'HMS Surprise' is ambushed by a much larger French battleship, 'Alcheron'. With his ship damaged, the captain of 'Surprise', Jack Aubrey, decides to pursue the unscathed French ship. The ship's surgeon, Dr Maturin, feels the captain is doing this out of sense of wounded pride and this places a strain on their relationship. A violent storm and tension amongst the crew adds to the drama, especially when one of the officers is thought to bring bad luck – a Jonah.Another strand of the story involves Blakeny, a young midshipman who loses his arm in the first battle. Played by Max Pirkis. Maturin recognises his thirst for knowledge and encourages his interest in botany, especially when the ship arrives in the Galapagos.Eventually, 'Surprise' finds 'Alcheron' and the scene is set for the final showdown. Sometimes, a powerful opening sequence can overwhelm subsequent events, but not here. The final battle, after the pursuit around South America, caps a movie that rarely puts a foot wrong.Russell Crowe finds just the right tone for Lucky Jack. Balancing devotion to duty, a sense of humour and a dash of obsession he emerges as a leader of men not unlike his Maximus from ""Gladiator"", but far less gloomy. The actors sound authentic – there are expressions and snatches of dialogue that transport the ear as effectively as the camera transports the eye to another time.""Master and Commander"" is one film that almost demands a sequel, but so far Peter Weir doesn't seem interested. A pity, but at least we still have this one.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
66,mjw2305,Masterful film making,8,22 January 2007,"'Lucky' Jack Aubrey's (Russell Crowe) ship is attacked by a superior foe, almost sinking it, along with the crew. In the face of defeat he sets sail again in pursuit of the enemy; stupidity, or could it be brilliance will decide the fate of a nation or destroy the brave captain and his young crew.The production of the film is top-notch, everything fits seamlessly into the period, and the talents of Crowe and Bettany are plain to see. Not to forget that massive credit has to go to the young actors that make up the crew, there is plenty of talent on show here.The movie is full of intrigue and action, and it will stir the emotions of everyone.

67,Howlin Wolf,"Crowe/Bettany partnership is undoubtedly the highlight of the film for me. Everything else: ""Eh""...",5,29 March 2004,"I found ""A Beautiful Mind"" far less interesting whenever these two weren't onscreen together, and ""Master and Commander... "" suffers from the same problem to an even greater extent.  The rapport that these two guys obviously have is a joy to watch, and no amount of epic battles can compete with such cracking chemistry.  Well-staged though they are, I found the 'confrontational' scenes rather tiresome.  I much preferred Russell getting stroppy with the good Doctor and his other crew!Crowe seems to have cornered the market in playing iconoclasts, and Aubrey is a scarcely different addition to his canon.  It was fun to see the 'driven' aspects of his method again, and to draw parallels with Moby Dick! All the rest I found a little listless, to be honest; but I will freely admit to not being cut out for the high-seas, and I knew that going in. Certified land-lubber, me!  If this sort of thing has the potential to get your blood pumping, though, I suspect you could do far worse.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
68,oneguyrambling,Just what I expected only better - and yet somehow still the same.,7,17 December 2010,"You'd think the Master & Commander part would be enough title but nope they thought more, more, more.Whether that pushed audiences away or not isn't important, I personally never bothered with this because I assumed it was merely another ""we're all in the navy let's have some ship to ship battles"" thing. And it is, it's a good one, but that's nonetheless what it is.We join the action in the second quarter of the battle between Napoleon and the Rest of the World, represented in this case by England ship the HMS Surprise. The Surprise is captained by one Jack Aubrey played by Rusty Crowe and has a crew of 200 give or take, some of them only kids. (And I mean kids, as in 12/13ish!) The year is 1805 and things haven't been going that well for the ROW team, Napoleon has basically been giving them a little bit of a flogging, and it is Rusty and co's job to track a French warship that is in the area and engage if possible.Course it's possible, this is a naval battle film! Can I just cut some corners here and say that tactically the French captain and Rusty seem to be on a par, each coming up with whiz bang ways of getting into or out of range, and each pulling some nifty tricks that are totally unexpected? (That saves me from having the explain each one, there are a lot.) The French ship is bigger, better defended and faster however, otherwise it wouldn't be that much of a movie, what with the big boy bullying the little boys around.After an early battle that doesn't go their way the men want to call it quits and head home to their toothless loved ones that eat terrible food, Rusty sez ""No"", perhaps remembering he has a bunch of kids and that scurvy is probably more tolerable, and besides sailors get regular sex... with each other. So FORWARD we go.The constant voice of reason and doubt is Paul Bettany's as the ship's doctor, he wants to rest up and take a trip to the local Galapagos Islands where he can indulge his love of animals, in the scientific sense that is, (I've already cracked the standard navy = gay jokes, seems a bit think to add beastiality). Eventually it seems that the odds are against them and some key personell are injured so Rusty calls the whole thing off.But it's never that easy.This might come off (and is) an extremely simplistic and glib review of a vast and ambitious film. In reality there is much to like about M&C etc, the ships look splendid and amazing when in full sail fanging along the open ocean, the storm scenes and sea battles are incredible, I'm not sure if they used CGI or not but in any case... incredible and there is more than enough tough decision for Rusty to make to either escape or succeed, and of course they usually have negative implications too such as the death of crew.Rusty's captain is a fierce tactician and soldier, but obviously a loyal shipmate and great leader, and Paul Bettany's ship's Doc is at once a confidante and counterpoint to the captain when he fears he is a little ahead of himself.This is very much an exercise in substance over flash and meaningless FX and as such is a triumph. I myself have seen enough examples of substance though, and maybe I might change as I get older but in my eyes even a film of terrific realism and vision is still only just worth watching as far as I am concerned right now.Final Rating - 7 / 10. Just what I thought it would be, only better. And yet still the same, (somehow). Worth a look but not a crowd pleaser.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Alot of work went into this and that kept my attention more than anything else in the film.So why did I snooze? The length? No way, I sat through very awake and with great interest JFK and Fanny and Alexander (uncut) in the theaters. The acting? Well, it was nice but in the words of a fellow poster, ""..and the point is?"". I just didn't care about these folks. And besides, there are going to be more ""visually breath taking films"" to see. Here's the rub: can you provide a story that keeps one's interest along with this? This one, for me, errr--didn't. Ya gotta surround yourself with the characters, story and situations and beyond the style, this one didn't.Yeah, its my fault. I didn't read the books, nor did I care about the characters before I walked in allowing me to develop an interest as I sat there -- but the ships and the waves and the battle were wonderful...but the lack of the men ""HEAVING""....it was a man-ly movie made for man-ly men! Sorry, I'm just not a man-ly gal.But...I cannot WAIT for this film to come out on DVD. I hope its box screen, and will look just fabulous on my Plasma TV! But a $10 movie going experience? Not for me.Honestly, it could be due to my attention span because as I watched the film I expected Fabio to come out (remember him from those covers of books like this gals?!?!)....he just seemed to have a place that was deleted from this film..on purpose I think...he didn't need to say anything but just to be there with all that style..and the wind blowing through his hair...wearing the same stuff Russell Crowe does...yes...just to add to the style of the film...and to keep me... awake.Master and Commander is one of the best of the stylish films done this year, But that's about it.

Watch this movie at the theater or Samurai.  I watched Samurai.  I'm glad I did too.  That one is emotionally charged.  And perhaps not entirely cool to watch.Master & Commander was simply a delight though.  One of the best sea faring films I've since since The Bounty.  (mind you I only saw The Bounty -the gibson version- a few months ago)  Hopefully we'll see more of these.  And I'm not talking Pirates of the Caribbean.  That one is pure entertainment, without much in way of seriousness.The action begins right off the bat , and with the occational breaks. doesn't stop.  If LOTR wasn't on the clock, either this movie or last samurai woulda made a decent showing.  (though I think I still would have been pulling for Whale Rider)I do have 3 known complaints.Camera work.  Some of the camera work is lousy.  Probably from the cramped quarters in which some of the scenes were shot.

Someone in the marketing department should be tortured, hung from the side arm and whipped.  They released this bare bones edition, without a shred  of special features in it.  I'd seen ads of a 2 disc set with that picture on the front.  So I bought it from Blockbuster. Where I found the bad news back home.  1 disc.  Having seen the other cover at dvdempire I informed Blockbuster they sold me the wrong one and I wanted the 2 disc.  They told me it doesn't exist.  After much persistence.  They said Best Buy has a 2 disc set and to buy it there.  I'd say the manager was probably so confused he didn't know his limb from limb.  Since the 2 disc is on the blockbuster webpage.  I ended up with a 3 disc set.So imagine this.Now we have the bare bones edition in widescreen and pan/scan.And now we also have the Collectors Edition in 2 disc sets and 3 disc sets.We've got 4 different versions to watch out for.

71,Richie-67-485852,Steady as She Goes,10,15 March 2018,"You get Russell Crowe so we are off to a good start in this movie that depicts life at sea most excellently. Real absorbing drama with a good story to tell awaits the viewer so look forward to this movie treat. In the movie Mutiny on the Bounty, it points out that while England and her Navy is run on laws its the Captain that gives it heart and justice. Captain Bly did not Master and command this but Captain Aubrey (Crowe) in this movie does a masterful job of encouraging, edifying and leading his crew making their hearts one and that is why the story works on the screen and in real life. It is better to get love and devotion willingly and with a gladness than to take it. There is a difference. The crew even sing songs about the Captain and nick-name him Lucky jack.

72,classicalsteve,Master and Commander Is both Masterful and Commanding: A Near-Perfect Combination of Action and Drama in a Period Piece,9,7 May 2009,"There is something about a well-done film that is often taken for granted. You sit in your seat and allow the film to take you away and for approximately 2 hours, you are taken to another world, to a group of people you don't know, to places you have never been, and into situations you could scarcely imagine. And for these two hours, you are enveloped in this world, forgetting for a moment that you are not really there, only experiencing illusory images on a screen. Good movies do this to you. But it all depends upon an outstanding script, convincing actors, realistic sets, and superb direction. If any of these pieces are weak, the cinematic experience is compromised. Luckily, Master and Commander has all of the elements in spades. Instead of watching a movie, you feel you have boarded a military naval vessel at the very beginning of the 19th century. Your ship is loyal to England. And your commander is Jack Aubrey, played with stunning realism by Russell Crowe.Based on the novel by Patrick O'Brian, Master and Commander begins right in the middle of the action. It is as if the viewer suddenly woke up on a late 18th-century naval vessel amidst the conflict between Britain and Napoleon Bonaparte. You see the workings of the crew, their tasks, and their relationships. You see the hierarchical structure, from lowly ship hand to the officers and the captain. And, most stunningly of all, you experience being out on the wide open seas just south of the Caribbean islands along the eastern coast of South America.You mostly get to know the HMS Surprise's captain, Jack Aubrey (Crowe), and his struggles between his duty to and orders from the Crown of England and his love and responsibility for his crew. He must manage these interests while trying to capture the fastest ship known to the world in service to Napoleon Bonaparte. And of course, he can't allow the French to defeat him in combat, and he can't lose his ship at the hands of the French, other foes, or the destructive power of the sea. Aubrey is like the juggler at the circus, his hands juggling his men and orders, while his ship is balanced on his nose.The film begins in 1805 with the HMS Surprise and its crew sprinting down the coast of South America. They are in hot pursuit of the French's prize possession, the Acheron, which can out-gun and outrun the English ship. Fighting erupts, momentarily crippling the Surprise. The officers suggest finding a port, but Aubrey does not want to lose sight of his prey. The story becomes episodic as it chronicles the conflict between these two titan vessels. Softening the stern objective sensibility of Aubrey is a naturalist-doctor, Stephen Maturin, who serves as both the ship's surgeon and an enlightenment-style scientist who wants to study biology off the coast of the Galapagos Islands. But not even science can stand in the way of war and military conflict. Or might it be his ally?As usual, Crowe's performance is outstanding as he finds that subtle area where he is a compassionate and yet hard-nosed commander with a touch of wit and humor. Maybe slightly ideal, but we tend to run with it. Peter Weir's direction is masterful in the sense that he purposefully avoids drawing attention to itself. His goal is to give you this story without breaking new ground in cinematic technique which could distract from the unfolding of the epic drama. He wants to tell you a story on the high seas, not comment on the skill of ""directing"". And that is the mark of a truly great director.The relationship between the script, the actors, the setting and the director appears seamless. The action and the drama both coincide in such a way as to be believable without it getting too sentimental. Everything is seen from point of view of the ship mates, which keeps the viewer honed in on a particular point of view which appears to be by design. The story wants the viewer to take on the hopes and dreams, the prejudices, the hates and the fears of the crew. Whether or not it is moral or immoral to play war with the French is not the point. Rather, the filmmakers want you to understand the conflict from the English perspective. This is the kind of film-making that succeeds upon just about every conceivable level. I think Crowe makes an excellent Captain Aubrey, and would like him to recapitulate the role and make further O'Brian stories. A high-mark of pure cinematic entertainment.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
73,gregsrants,"A good tale, if not perfect",7,7 April 2004,"I always feel embarrassed when I review a film that was based on a popular novel or series of books.  I hate to read. Even when I am at my loneliest like sitting on a stalled subway or up at a cabin that doesn't have electricity, I would rather sit back and rehash a movie I have seen in my head than pick up anything off the coffee room table.So when theatres were hit with the new Russell Crowe film, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, I knew that better more refined critics would be able to compare the film adaptation to the on-screen version.  I cannot.Not that that's a bad thing mind you. One of the bigger advantages of not caring to pick up the written word is that you accept the movie as a whole and are not constantly sitting in a theatre saying to yourself, 'It wasn't like that!' or 'He would never do such a thing!'  It's a small advantage, but it's all I got.Master and Commander is based on a series of novels by Partick O'Brian all surrounding (I suppose) Capt. Jack Aubrey (Crowe), head of the British ship the HMS Surprise during the Napoleonic Wars.  Aubrey has a daunting task in front of him and his mates as they follow and try to engage the behemoth French vessel the Acheron.  Their foe has twice the men and firepower than the Surprise, but hell, this is a story of heroes and bravery, so bring it on.  In this case, size does not matter.The movie shifts seamlessly from scene to scene with crewmembers yelling out orders while playing a cat and mouse game with the Acheron that has them twice the cat and twice the mouse.  This all leads to a final showdown where a brilliant idea inspired by an insect found on the Galapagos Islands, has the HMS Surprise trying to live up to its name and attack the unprepared Acheron.Released in the summer of 2003, Master and Commander went on to grab 10 Academy Award nominations including best picture and director.  Whether or not these awards were founded is an argument not to be had here.  However, there is no mistaking that with 10 nods (and none in the acting categories), the production values must have been top rate, and on that level it did not disappoint.There are so many elements and avenues one can take a review of M&C that it is hard to know where to start.  First and foremost, there is the direction of Peter Weir.  A four time Best Director Oscar wannabe, he has been behind the camera and calling the shots for nine critical hits in a row.  Even Speilberg can't lay claim to that feat (Hook, anyone?).  From 1981's Galipolli through Witness and The Truman Show, Weir has become one of those directors where actors cancel weddings to appear in.And, with M&C, Weir does not disappoint.  The characters are brisk and rugged and the it doesn't take him long before he has you feeling as if you are an actual crew member on the HMS Surprise awaiting your next command. Films set on the high seas have been hit and miss over the years.  For every Pirates of the Caribbean, there has been a White Squall, so the fact that Weir pulled it off so effortlessly is a testament to his abilities.Russell Crowe too, puts in another well received performance.  But what is different from his roles in Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind is that the supporting cast in M&C seem to steal scenes from him with regularity. Specifically, Paul Bettany, as the ships doctor and Max Pirkis as a young Midshipman who loses an arm in their first encounter with the Acheron, are both stellar in their portrayals as the ying to Crowes' yang and the young to Aubrey's old.But for all the hootin' and hollerin' fun this ship to ship battle ready movie embodies, it really took the DVD before I was able to understand everything that was going on.  During the opening sequence and later during a severe storm, the ships mates are yelling to each other things that I could not conclude.  Only by flipping the subtitle button did I finally understand what they were communicating.Also, in the final battle aboard the French vessel, it was cut so fast and furious, that it was hard for me to tell the two sides apart.  I couldn't tell who was winning 'cept for the rousing musical score which lead me to believe the good guys were kicking ass.  I am not suggesting that we should forgo history and have one side orange and one side blue, but maybe a steady cut of the sequence would have helped me with my bearings.
Despite these few observations, the movie as a whole was a satisfying experience.  The scenes on the Galapagos Islands (the first ever film to shoot ashore), were of great interest even though it kept us from the battle scenes we so craved.  And the two ideas of Aubrey to dupe the French were inspired.  In all, I have to give a thumbs up to Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World.  It may have had the longest title of any movie this year (move over Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines), but it didn't feel like a long sit once it got started.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
74,sjanders-86430,Peter Weir Directed and wrote from a novel.,10,27 April 2021,"Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany, and Billy Boyd head up the cast of this exciting tale on the high seas. They are trying to prevent a French ship from reaching the Pacific Ocean. The main takeaways are the stunts that were performed on the ship. I bet there were injuries. These men had to climb a mast in all kinds of weather. Some men were at the top of the mast in the lookout box when storms arose with waves and winds that could break the mast and sink the ship. There were young boys on the ship too. What fresh food with vitamin C did they eat? It is so hard to imagine such a trip with all those men fighting to survive not only the voyage but the brutal others on the ship. The battle was deadly, and the burial of the corpses all sewn up is eyeopening. Russell Crowe is the perfect choice for ship's captain. He is robust but somewhat royal. Great film.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

But everything else about this high-falutin' epic - nominated for countless awards - is thoroughly pedestrian, with few redeeming features. Crowe adds little to the heroic screen persona he cultivated in GLADIATOR (2000) and is upstaged by co-star Paul Bettany (DOGVILLE) as the ship's doctor and Voice of Conscience, while everyone else simply melts into the background.

77,rebeljenn,Good visual effects,8,21 January 2006,"'Master and Commander' takes you on a voyage where you can virtually smell the sea and feel the storms. This film is about a captain, and the film focuses on the relationship that he has with the surgeon on the ship. The two come to understand each other through their differences; at one point, they stop at an island for the surgeon to collect specimens from that island. Meanwhile, the Napoleonic wars are raging on, and there are many storms and sea battles. Although a long film, the visual effects are well worth seeing this film for, and they make this film as strong as it is. A lot of detail was put into this and put into the film in this area. The acting is also very good, and this is a film about characters more than about battles.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
78,EijnarAmadeus,A fine piece of Ocean movie,7,6 April 2004,"Russell Crowe had done LA CONFIDENTIAL before he did GLADIATOR that really kicked his career onto the top notch of Hollywood. GLADIATOR was a huge movie that captured Oscars and was simply a way too convisning, big, dramatic and epic movie to not draw itself attention, so when Russell Crowe headed for his next big movie it was a adaptation, this time; set at sea. MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD is a highly exciting drama about a Captain and a crew that's having a hard time handling a aggressive ship that keeps attacking them. Director has done a fine job but I must say that the movie's finest details is; mood, music and general scenes going threw it. The movie is very fine watching, photo is beautiful and everything is very in place, although the movie did draw it's running time a bit too long at the middle of the movie, the end is so good that it is very worthy waiting on. Russell Crowe does a fine performance after he had to live up to his Maximus character. MASTER AND COMMANDER rules a lot of the time, with big ships firing canons, swords being drawn, genially made viola / bass music, fine photo, good dialog...very much of it goes very well on, another problem is; there's not much of originality or pure entertainment, so it gets a bit ""dry"" as the movie goes threw minute after minute. The end is fine and maybe the movie's best scene. As Crowe and his crew is done nailing the French boat Crowe starts looking for the Captain, but sadly enough he finds the Captain dead with a depressed doctor claiming the fact. Crowe tells his assistant to take the French boat and that they shall meet later. It all seems finished and Crowe and the doctor is playing music together when they get on the topic of the Captain and the doctor tells Crowe that the French doctor was already dead, so Crowe understands that he has been tricked...and that the ""doctor"" was the real captain. So, they turn around and heads for another fight...although this one we don't get to see... STARS: 4/5",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Russell Crowe, in particular, plays the part of the Captain perfectly, with just the right mix of the stern mixed with a good sense of humor. Paul Bettany, one of the worlds' most underrated actors, interplays perfectly as the ships' surgeon with Crowes' Captain. I'm not much of a sailor (especially when dealing with a huge ship), but all the seamanship type work was all done very realistically. Action? You want action? PLENTY! They're chasing a French privateer during the Napoleonic wars and they end up slugging it out very realistically, with splintered wood flying everywhere.

80,artzau,Great sea epic,9,16 November 2003,"Being a fan of Naval history, I rarely miss a sea epic.  Most of them suck. They're usually very romanticized, full of inaccuracies with a thin story line that a serious sea fan and former Naval officer leaves with a feeling of disgust and disappointment.   Not here, gang.  This one is a keeper.  I recall seeing the teasers and thinking how very accurate were the little bits and pieces I was seeing.  Then, we get Crowe on the bargain.  Crowe's hamming fits well with the role of a British Naval captain who manages to hold his crew together with his charisma and Bettany is superb as the cerebral ship's surgeon.  There are some very wonderful points of this film, the point of view never strays from the ship, the distinctions of rank and differences among officers and crew are clear, and the representations of the ship and battle scenes are remarkably researched and reproduced.  The only other sea epic I can recall that even comes close is Damn the Defiant.

Yes, the movie does have some action, (mainly made up of a skirmish in the start and a large fight at the end), however the real goodness in this movie comes from how the characters interact with one another. This makes the movie, at least to me, very enjoyable to watch. ""Master and Commander: The far Side of the World"" is about friendship and how a captain keeps his men together as one over a rough sea voyage and defeat their French attackers. I liked many of the technical aspects to the film such as; the sound editing, photography, and visual effects. The work of the costume designers and set-decorators brings an 18th century to life. And the performances are flawless, particularly on Crowe's and Bettany's part. This is one of 2003's best films; however, I think it did not deserve 10 academy award nominations (winning two).

83,anselmdaniel,A grand adventure,9,14 September 2019,"This review contains spoilers.Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is a period war movie that premiered in 2003. The movie is directed by Peter Weir and is based on the book Master and Commander by Patrick O'Brian. The movie stars Russell Crowe as Captain Jack Aubrey of the HMS Surprise. The movie centers around the Napoleonic Wars conflict as the HMS Surprise must engage the Acheron a superior French vessel.Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is an excellent movie. This movie has many great qualities to it. It is both a great movie, a great historical movie, a great drama, and a great action movie. This movie has so many great components that the movie comes together in an excellent way. The movie starts with an ambush by the Acheron on the HMS Surprise from that moment, the audience knows about the strength of the Acheron compared to the HMS Surprise.The movie is an excellent historical movie. Anyone that wanted a Napoleonic Wars movie will be entertained with this movie. This movie has great attention to detail across its sets, costumes, and props. The movie is able to grab the audience and present them the Napoleonic Era. It made for an excellent experience as the movie immersed everyone in this era. The drastic change that this movie had made was changing the enemy from the United States to French. The book originally had the enemy ship be crewed by Americans. The change did not bother me but for book purists, this can be a deterrent.The action in this movie is well framed and directed by Peter Weir. The movie has a sparse amount of action scenes but this does not detract from how well the action scenes are done. The action scenes are one of the best that feature the Napoleonic Era. Everything from the cinematography to the choreography is done to a grand detail. This movie feels incredibly epic across the 138 minutes of running time.The acting by the cast is great. Every actor does an awesome job. The highlight is obviously Russell Crowe's performance as Captain Jack Aubrey. Captain Jack Aubrey is an excellent protagonist that is great for this kind of movie. The rest of the cast fill their roles magnificently. Dr. Stephen Maturin played by Paul Bettany is one of the best characters in this movie. He had great interplay with Captain Jack Aubrey as they both seek to defeat the Acheron and fulfill Stephen Maturin's desire to learn about the indigenous creatures around the Galapagos. The side plot fills a good niche in much of the movie. The rest of the cast have great scenes and it all comes together in a nice way.I highly recommend 'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World'.Grade: A",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

85,lawprof,Exciting-Definitely; Historically Accurate-Mixed; Oscar Worthy-Not Really,8,15 November 2003,"[Grievous and humiliating error in first submission corrected here. :)]Winston Churchill, wherever he is today, must recoil with horror at a quotation falsely ascribed to him about his beloved Royal Navy. Supposedly responding to an admiral's recitation of the Senior Service's history, the portly First Lord of the Admiralty purportedly responded that the navy's traditions encompassed ""rum, sodomy and the lash."" In ""Master and Commander,"" etc., director Peter Weir serves up two of the service's traditions, rum and the lash but inaccurately leaves the sweating, groping, between decks sex life out.Weir with Russell Crowe as Captain Jack Aubrey of HMS Surprise, ably both abetted and challenged by his ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin, played by Paul Brettany, draws the viewer into a powerful, gripping but somewhat sanitized world of the wooden warship at the height of its power before steam drove the old ships to wrecking yards.Based on the late Patrick O'Brian's very well received series of novels, ""Master and Commander"" places HMS Surprise in harm's way as Aubrey searches for a powerful French privateer during the Napoleonic Wars. The fate of England is at stake we are told (several times, actually). The search takes place in the deep reaches where the oceans collide at Cape Horn, in reality not where naval engagements took place during the long war.The time is half past Lord Nelson's splendid victory at the Battle of the Nile and before his crushing extinguishment of the French fleet at Trafalgar where he paid with his own life.Aubrey was a junior officer under Nelson and he regales his wardroom with stories about the one-armed, seasick-prone, philandering naval genius. Well, he leaves those details out. But no blowzy bimbo like Lady Emma Hamilton is in this captain's life. In fact there are no women in the film except for a few seconds when an undoubtedly randy captain gazes briefly at a native woman.HMS Surprise is, unfortunately, surprised at the very beginning of the film when its quarry hits the frigate with powerful broadsides, reducing the escaping-into-the-fog vessel to near helplessness. Aubrey resolves to make repairs and hunt down the French vessel, a decision that sets the pace for the rest of the film. Is he acting out of duty or from ego? A familiar war film issue.Weir cleverly never lets the viewer see much of the French enemy and attention is unremittingly focused on Aubrey, Maturin and a crew ranging from old salts to barely pubescent midshipmen carrying the weight of officers' duties. It's highly effective.And there are few scenes on land although one is vital to the story. This is a true shipboard movie. From the quarterdeck to the swinging hammocks in an impossibly crammed forecastle, with the almost palpable sweat and smell of sailors jammed in quarters so close as to deny any privacy or dignity, this is a film about men at war. Aubrey, of course, is based on Nelson in reality and Horatio Hornblower in fiction. The C.S. Forester novels about Hornblower, tracing his career from junior rank to admiral and lord, are classics and Gregory Peck did a fine job portraying the character in a much earlier film.What Crowe brings to the screen is a complex character who blends an almost gushing love for his crew with the duty to push them to extremes of endurance and towards the god of battle. Crowe could have totally dominated the film but for Paul Brettany's sensitive portrayal as a doctor and would-be naturalist serving as the skipper's only friend and confidant. His acting makes the story far more engrossing than it otherwise would have been. Aubrey, a violinist, and Maturin, a cellist, make some nice music together too.Historical accuracy? The ship's accouterments, the uniforms, the dreadful quarters for the men, the lingo: a lot of research went into ""Master and Commander."" Jack Tar was legally entitled (until not very many years ago) to a daily tot of grog, a rum-based beverage that actually served to keep him somewhat servile. Aubrey makes sure that good work is rewarded by extra tots. Great, just what a warship needs-crew members inebriated.Impressment was the main ""recruiting"" device of the Georgian navy and the men were, no pun intended, a rum lot. Speaking of his soldiers, the Duke of Wellington famously commented that he didn't know if they frightened the enemy but they definitely frightened him. That was even more so of the naval seamen of the time but the crew of Surprise are remarkably healthy, happy, compliant and devoted to their commander. Well, it IS a story.The lash: Aubrey is a humane officer in a navy where most commanders resorted to the lash often, sometimes sparking mutinies from a crew that could endure no more brutalization. But when no other alternative is present, he orders all hands aft to witness punishment. Purists will be disappointed, as I was, to see an ordinary whip used instead of the cat o'nine tails that was the inseparable friend of the Master at Arms.The least accurate portrayal is of the companionship of the captain's cabin where all the officers dine together in good fellowship, their captain tipsy if not fully three sheets to the wind. The wardroom with the commanding officer dining became a staple of the steamship navy. During the Napoleonic Wars, a ship's captain generally kept his distance from his officers and dined (dined? Look at what they're eating.) alone in his cabin at the ship's stern. But that's a minor quibble.Viewers interested in understanding what the Royal Navy of the Anglo-French war was like ought to start with an American's view, Herman Melville's ""Billy Budd"" (the Benjamin Britten opera of the same name is pretty good too).But this is an audience involving, rousing tale that shouldn't be missed. And it's NOT just for male audiences.But an Oscar contender? Not for me. It's a terrific modern depiction of a story line we've seen in many films. Russell Crowe is entertaining but there's no great depth in his character as there was when he played that tormented genius in ""A Beautiful Mind.""Wanna bet there'll be a sequel. Perhaps Aubrey, older and of higher rank, will command a squadron landing troops to sack Washington in the War of 1812.8/10",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

It's highly effective.And there are few scenes on land although one is vital to the story. This is a true shipboard movie.  From the quarterdeck to the swinging hammocks in an impossibly crammed forecastle, with the almost palpable sweat and smell of sailors jammed in quarters so close as to deny any privacy or dignity, this is a film about men at war.Aubrey, of course, is based on Nelson in reality and Horatio Hornblower in fiction.  The C.S. Forester novels about Hornblower, tracing his career from junior rank to admiral and lord, are classics and Gregory Peck did a fine job portraying the character in a much earlier film.What Crowe brings to the screen is a complex character who blends an almost gushing love for his crew with the duty to push them to extremes of endurance and towards the god of battle.  Crowe could have totally dominated the film but for Paul Brettany's sensitive portrayal as a doctor and would-be naturalist serving as the skipper's only friend and confidant. His acting makes the story far more engrossing than it otherwise would have been.  Aubrey, a violinist, and Maturin, a cellist, make some nice music together too.Historical accuracy?  The ship's accouterments, the uniforms, the dreadful quarters for the men, the lingo:  a lot of research went into ""Master and Commander.""  Jack Tar was legally entitled (until not very many years ago) to a daily tot of grog, a rum-based beverage that actually served to keep him somewhat servile.  Aubrey makes sure that good work is rewarded by extra tots.  Great, just what a warship needs-crew members inebriated.Impressment was the main ""recruiting"" device of the Georgian navy and the men were, no pun intended, a rum lot.  Speaking of his soldiers, the Duke of Marlborough famously commented that he didn't know if they frightened the enemy but they definitely  frightened him.  That was even more so of the naval seamen of the time but the crew of Surprise are remarkably healthy, happy, compliant and devoted to their commander.  Well, it IS a story.The lash:  Aubrey is a humane officer in a navy where most commanders resorted to the lash often, sometimes sparking mutinies from a crew that could endure no more brutalization.  But when no other alternative is present, he orders all hands aft to witness punishment.  Purists will be disappointed, as I was, to see an ordinary whip used instead of the cat o'nine tails that was the inseparable friend of the Master at Arms.The least accurate portrayal is of the companionship of the captain's cabin where all the officers dine together in good fellowship, their captain tipsy if not fully three sheets to the wind.  The wardroom with the commanding officer dining became a staple of the steamship navy.  During the Napoleonic Wars, a ship's captain generally kept his distance from his officers and dined (dined? Look at what they're eating.) alone in his cabin at the ship's stern.  But that's a minor quibble.Viewers interested in understanding what the Royal Navy of the Anglo-French war was like ought to start with an American's view, Herman Melville's ""Billy Budd"" (the Benjamin Britten opera of the same name is pretty good too).But this is an audience involving, rousing tale that shouldn't be missed. And it's NOT just for male audiences.But an Oscar contender?  Not for me.  It's a terrific modern depiction of a story line we've seen in many films.  Russell Crowe is entertaining but there's no great depth in his character as there was when he played that tormented genius in ""A Beautiful Mind.""Wanna bet there'll be a sequel.  Perhaps Aubrey, older and of higher rank, will command a squadron landing troops to sack Washington in the War of 1812.8/10.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
87,movieguy1021,Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World: 4/10,4,15 November 2003,"There is one main reason how you can tell that Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World was originally going to be released in the summer. Not the huge budget or the `special effects', but because of its obscenely long title. Any movie with a colon in its title seems to be big budgeted, mindless movies. Obviously, Fox, Universal, and Miramax didn't think that it was, so instead of releasing it in the summer, they decided to do so in fall, when the Academy would remember it for Oscars. As I was watching it, I was having trouble thinking what Oscars it would hope to win.It wouldn't win best visual effects. It had exactly the effects I have come to expect from Fox and Universal. Universal has always had cheesy effects that weren't believable, which was only added onto by Fox, whose gunshots are just bright yellow lights. I can't believe that Fox needed two major companies to assist with the funding. It certainly didn't show. Some of the shots of the boat on water looked very good, however, but not real in any way.It wouldn't win best cinematography. It seemed like often it was trying to go for something a little different that wouldn't really be noticeable but would have people saying, `Something was different about this movie.' However, for even the easiest of shots to shoot (that were probably even done with second unit), the camera couldn't even stay still. If what they were going for was an amateur feel to the camera work, then they succeeded. Near the end, in the obligatory huge fight scene, the fighting was barely visible. Everything was so quickly cut it was impossible to see what was happening.It wouldn't win best screenplay. Every single character, even the lead, had absolutely no development to them. When Cap'n Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is seen in the beginning, he is writing a letter to his girlfriend to show how lonely he is. However, he neither shows his loneliness nor even references his girlfriend again. People who we don't know anything about suddenly become involved, and it's impossible to tell people apart. And this could be that I'm just not that learned in the history of the British Navy during the Napoleonic era, but why would eight-year-olds be allowed to be in the navy and be allowed to kill various people?It wouldn't win best director. The way Peter Weir directs it is leisurely at some times and haphazardly at others, both at inappropriate times. At the climactic fight scene, Weir is so interested in making sure we know that the British will win, he doesn't bother on the small stuff that is actually important, like being able to tell what is happening! Who is doing what to whom? It's impossible to see. You can't even see who is British and who is French!It wouldn't win best actor. Russell Crowe does his typical shtick, trying to act well to get an Oscar, but he just doesn't work here. The only other semi-large name is Paul Bettany, who starred with Crowe in A Beautiful Mind. See my note for Crowe. All of the other actors were rather invisible; most of their dialogue was just barking orders to and fro. There wasn't really any room for acting.It wouldn't win best actress, mainly because there's only about two in the entire film and are both on screen for a total of five seconds.Lastly, it wouldn't win best picture, mainly because as much as the Academy enjoys long, boring movies, it rarely goes for action movies like Master and Commander tries to be. It had too many subplots, all mainly there for an excuse for the ending `resolution'. Most didn't go anywhere. If they had been taken out, then it could have been a more tolerable length, not this, at an overwhelming two-and-a-quarter hours.If I were to say one redeeming quality of Master and Commander, it would be to say that in the beginning it was quite good, with a good action scene right off of the bat. After that, however, it just seemed like randomly people started to fight and it soon veered off into boredom. The subsequent action scenes aren't good, because I was too bored during the rest to really be entertained by the action, or by the rest of the movie.My rating: 4/10Rated PG-13 for intense battle sequences, related images, and brief language.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
88,RossRivero99,A masterful adventure of a movie,10,23 May 2015,"Peter Weir's Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is nothing short of a masterpiece and a wonderful adventure of a movie told with so much detail that people who are watching this movie wouldn't even need to read one of Patrick O'Brian's novel series all because of Weir's and John Collee's great screenplay. The film is one of the best films of it's genre since seeing Raoul Walsh's Captain Horatio Hornblower (1951), the movie is also a detailed character study of British Naval Capt. Jack Aubrey (played by Russell Crowe) and the ship's surgeon Dr. Stephen Maturin (played by Paul Bettany)who also played Crowe's imaginary roommate in A Beautiful Mind (2001), as well as exploring their differences. Aubrey is a great strategist and tactician, and Maturin has a great interest in biology and collecting birds and beetles. Crowe gives one of the best performances of his career, and I was also impressed with Paul Bettany in this movie in a wonderful supporting role in fact to me is also his best performance. This movie has all of the things it needs that an 1800s Naval war movie is supposed to have for example excellent costume design, marvelous fight scenes, wonderful production design.

And it turns out to be even better than I thought. It is truly is flawless and probably one of the best execute film I have ever seen.Base upon two books of twenty, Master and Commander and The Far Side of the World is about friendship and the history during the Napoleon era. What I like about the movie is projecting the lives of the sailor during that time. The Script is brilliantly written, they definitely have done they homework on researching because it is accurate and very insightful. The directing is too good to describe by words. Plus, the casting and the dedication of each and every actor on the ship can be seen in the movie.Overall it is masterfully done movie, though some of the things in movie might not be up to every body liking. Like the story might be a little predictable and absolutely no female in the movie, which in the way very accurate indeed but very kind of weird cinematically. And the movie is a little slow with and the used of old English might not be easy for some viewer.Recommendation: Brilliantly Done, Look Out For Behind the Scenes  Excellent Work.Rating: 8/10 (Grade: A-) Thanks For Reading",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

94,bsinc,Enrapturing and captivating,9,19 December 2003,"In the last few months I have been in a phase where good and great movies just came pouring in from countless places and it's been a wonderful experience. But ""Master And Commander"" tops the chart! Why? Because it was the most enjoyable and powerful of them all. Because it had an impeccable cast that drove the movie all the way through.(Mr. Crowe being his usual self in the best possible way and the incredible Paul Bettany who gives the movie a Darwinistic and humane tone). Because it had an incredible enseble working on its score, cinematography, costumes, editing and especially detailed presentation of that time. Because it had dialogues that had something, no, a lot to say. And because it was just so bloody brilliant. My favorite moment: when Dr. Stephen Maturin stumbles upon his so-seeked out bird and catches the French ship closing in. With the surrounding music, camera and atmosphere it created one of the most perfect movie moments I have ever seen. The only flaw I can remember was the casting of Billy Boyd who should either had more screen time or either been replaced with an unknown actor. I more than understand people who will and have found ""Master And Commander"" tedious or perhaps arguably uneventful, because the people who will enjoy it the most are people who know a little bit about naval customs and happenings in those days and who will appreciate it especially for that. This movie is more than just a regular revival of a  seaman movie, it is an excellent documentary of days when British fleets fought with the French and it ends in such a manner. Perhaps unfinished to some, to me it was perfect. Peter Weir, kudos to your directing skills, they have proven you to be Hollywood's very own and true Master and Commander.  9/10",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
95,Flagrant-Baronessa,"Deserves more credit, praise and remembrance",8,26 July 2006,"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is one mouthful of a title, but a gloriously entertaining adventure of epic proportions, documenting a ship of the Royal British Navy and its captain during the Napoleonic Wars. Captain Aubrey (Russel Crowe) and his sailors have been ordered to sink or capture the superior French vessel and all of the sea is their battlefield. You feel the weight of such a challenging task at all times and this acts as a device to get us to really sympathize with, and pull for, our British heroes as they struggle at sea. This is a magnificent, beautifully shot and crafted war-drama and best of all, it features no love interests in its plot to distract and detract from the realism of the adventure -- but is a straightforward portrayal of events, as based on the novels by Patrick O'Brien. It is simply genius not to cast some annoying supporting actress running around in a corset and acting as a loved one. Finally, a war-drama that gets it right! In terms of action on-board the ship, this is near-perfection and what Pirates of the Caribbean should have been like; it is gritty, realistic, exciting and sprinkled with a fine dose of humour to balance its dark war themes and the hardships that one may face on a ship.Because Master and Commander is an adventure film, it is also fairly forgettable -- I hate to admit it, but it's true. There is, however, one thing that's stuck with me from the film and that is the visit to the Gallapagos Islands. These few scenes are really gripping and powerful and the bizarre setting of this island creates a strange, almost haunting effect. It acts as a pause in the otherwise fast pace on-board the ship. I truly feel that this film deserves more credit, praise and remembrance.8.5/10",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
96,Pro Jury,Two bases short of a home run,8,24 November 2003,"MASTER AND COMMANDER is not a bad movie, and sadly it is not a good movie.I was hoping MASTER & COMMANDER would be GLADIATOR on the high seas. Maximus Decimus Meridas, Commanding General of the Army of the North, now becomes the intense, focused leader of 197 souls aboard a heroic fighting ship!But all of this is missing.  The screenplay, direction, and the total lack of dramatic music torpedo this first voyage of the mighty HMS Surprise.General Maximus Decimus Meridas did not have time for fiddle concerts.  The Gladiator did not swap jokes and get drunk with the boys.  Violin playing Captain Aubrey seems overly distracted while drinking his way across the oceans.  Master & Commander lacks steady intensity.  When the subplot about natural science begins, the movie stops dead.  When the subplot about the jinxed officer begins, the movie stops dead.  When the subplot about the ship's busy-body doctor's operation begins, the movie stops dead.  The audience is left with far too much spare time.In MASTER, a swear word not allowed on TV is spoken one time.  Crusty sailors fight battles against the enemy, and fight with each other.  There is a flogging.  The older sailors yearn for pretty girls on the distant shore, etc.  The salty words spoken are clean enough for TV.  Then, the one loan swear word is uttered, and it stands out badly... ""Wait folks, here is our required PG-13 moment, @&!$@#, OK, now on with the movie.""Take a look at the GLADIATOR -- see the Roman Legions, the Praetoriae, the Felix Regiment, the Centuria -- no kids are seen in military service. Likewise, MASTER & COMMANDER should not be the adventures of Peter Pan. What is believable about the English Navy employing 10 year-olds as officers?  It is difficult to believe that hardened 30 year-old sailors would follow the orders of a little kid who is given command.  What is with all of the kids in MASTER?  Burt Lancaster had no need for little kids aboard his glorious pirate ship.  Captain Kirk was the better for not having to share command with 10 year-olds.  Finally, the most dramatic theme music ever made comes from epic sailing movies and big budget space operas.  Although there is some sparse drumming and some light classical music occasionally, Master & Commander is devoid of true theme music.

Peter Weir crafts an immensely compelling, superbly acted sea-faring epic that does an impeccable job of making the audience feel as if they are shut up in a ship in the middle of the ocean. This ongoing battle with the mysterious phantom ship is a great device for some of the best action sequences I've ever seen, but the best aspects of the film is when they aren't in battle. It's the relationships between these complex characters that create the most engaging scenes and highlight the absolutely incredible performances from the entire cast, primarily Russell Crowe and the always underrated Paul Bettany. They both deserved Oscar-nods, as far as I'm concerned. The complexity of the ships friendships, leaderships and characters is some of the most well-written work of the decade.

98,Mike_Devine,An authentic tale from the high seas,7,10 May 2021,"Sense of duty. Love of country. As seen in the epic 'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,' these are principles by which the crew of the HMS Surprise lived (and died). The film was a big budget oceanic blockbuster that debuted right around the time of the much more popular 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,' but found a much older crowd due to the subject matter.Russell Crowe was perhaps one of the better options for casting the role of Captain Jack Aubrey, as he authentically seems like someone who would wash up on the shores of the Galapagos Islands. In 'Commander,' Crowe feels right at home, leading a rag-tag British naval crew around the coast of South America. What makes the film work is the narrow focus on a specific mission rather than a long, drawn out series of tales from the high seas that would have been too much to digest. Instead, we get to know the characters fairly well, including Paul Bettany's part-time surgeon, part-time zoologist. This allows us to actually care about what happens to them over the course of their adventures.'Commander' also benefits from great special effects, with plenty of well thought out action sequences that were all the rage in the early 2000s. Films that take place at sea can be hit or miss, but the setting works well in this instance.'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World' is not the most exciting story ever told, but it's executed flawlessly and should be regarded as a master class in period action-adventure films.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

However he manages to keep the faith of his crew members alive and pursues the Acheron without giving an eye to the doctor's concern and interests. A series of unfortunate events occur and their ship suffers bad luck every now and then but that doesn't stop Jack from taking on the Acheron eventually.Some great acting by Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany makes the whole movie an adventure worth watching. The situations that they were put in certainly demanded pluck and patience which was manifested well by Jack Aubrey.This flick would make you fathom how things were really dealt with earlier.

Although not entirely accurate, this may be one of the best Naval films made (although I don't know how many naval films have been made). Taking place during the Napoleonic Wars, Capt. Jack Aubrey (Russel Crowe) is under the service of the British crown and chasing the Royal French Warship Acheron who attacked them off the coast of South America. Capt. Jack sets off on an unbelievable quest to capture the invincible Acheron which is heading for the Pacific Ocean. Along the command of Capt. Jack's men is a crew of laughter, hatred, and interest. The ships doctor, Stephen Maurin (Paul Bettany) is also a moral supervisor and a very good friend of the Captain. Along the way, Jack pushes his men too the limits from enduring a week long dry spell to ordering the death of a crew mate to save the ship. The battles are spread out enough for the drama and plot to unfold and present themselves. The ship is beautiful and was actually built for the film. Russell Crowe is magnificent and Paul Bettany holds his own along with him. The crew is fun to watch, when you don't even know their names you feel for them and feel as if you're a cabin mate with them. The film is a bit long, stretching 2 1/2 hours but is well worth it. The film is not all historically accurate but if I wanted a history lesson, I'd read a history book. The film is visually stunning and about 90% is filmed on the open ocean.

Set in 1805, the movie follows a British ship led by Captain Jack Aubry (Russell Crowe) in pursuit of one of Napoleon's fleet. Whether it was the accuracy of Patrick O'Brien's novels or Director Peter Weir's devotion to detail in his recreation of life at sea, I felt as if I were on the ship myself. I might have also felt this way because of the film's unwavering vision to its subjects rather than conventional Hollywood storytelling. For example, in a story set at sea, we would naturally be looking forward to seeing exciting naval battles. While we do get our share of exciting naval action, we mostly experience the HMS Surprise, where every minute of the movie takes place, spending their time waiting and trying to maintain their sanity so that when a battle actually does come, you realize the magnitude of it. The human element of the movie, of course, is the multi-layered relationship between Crowe and Bettany, a duo seen before in Beautiful Mind that does not disappoint",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

During the Napoleonic Wars, a British frigate, HMS Surprise, and a much larger French warship, the Acheron, with greater fire power, stalk each other off of the coast of South America. Russell Crowe brings great intensity to the role of Captain Jack Aubrey. Lucky Jack, as he is referred to by his crew, is well regarded by his men, who trust him implicitly, even after the first devastating battle and an apparent personal vendetta against the French captain. While the naval battle sequences are quite fantastic, the film is successful because director Weir chose to build the story to get to know the men who are locked aboard the tight quarters of a small ship and how they interact everyday. The officers and the mates are well-known by the time the final battle comes. This was a well done movie with great adventure and thrills! This movie won two academy awards for best cinematography and best sound editing and it was also nominated for best picture, makeup, editing, director, costume design, sound and visual effects.

What is there not to like about this film. There is not a single weak performance in the film, and there are several that stand out. Russell Crowe almost makes you want to join his crew, even under the horrific conditions that prevailed in that time period. Paul Bettany plays the part of the doctor with great sensitivity which contrasts beautifully with his role as Silas in ""The Da Vinci Code."" Especially captivating is young Max Pirkis as Lord Blakeney, the young midshipman who is obviously admired by all of the crew. And the performances go on and on. It is an adventure story, but also one that tests the boundaries between friendship and devotion to duty. The music that underscores the film is magnificent including a portion of Ralph Vaughn-Williams ""Fantasia on the theme of Thomas Tullis"" which is a quintessential piece of English composition, and one that I had wondered why had not been used in a film soundtrack before?I only regret that there has been no mention of a sequel, since the film left the door wide open for one.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
104,deanofrpps,"Wrong Revolution, Wrong Red White and Blue",8,17 December 2006,"Master and Commander brings to the screen Pat O'Brien's epic of Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey's (Russel Crowe's) hunt for the privateer Acheron. Russell Crowe renders a bravura performance in the swashbuckling role of Lucky Jack's exploits in the Napoleonic era wars. There's a Captain Kirkish charm and a star-trek tingle in Lucky Jack's adventurism but there's a serious side too. Captain Jack teaches a middling mid - shipman who constantly fails the test for Lieutenant that a leader is neither a martinet nor a friend to the crew.The movie is set against the background of the Napoleonic Wars. But it derives from a book in which the swashbuckling Captain Jack unleashes his furies on a different Red White and Blue flown by a different cast of Revolutionaries. Americans lacking Britannic objectivity might not flock to the cinema to watch their lads blasted out of the water through ruses de guerre worthy of themselves.Yet the script is so well written that there are many hints from which a keen observer can penetrate the stand - in foe.Hollywood made the French, America's ally in 1776 and co-belligerent in 1812,the feared and resourceful enemy. In 1812 the US picked the wrong moment to jump into the Napoleonic Wars on the losing side. The US tried the fast and lose tactics of the privateers, pirates hired by Congress, in the Revolution without much of the former successes. The Regular US Navy under commanders like Perry and Decatur however did make its mark.The US was nearly over-run by the British with the collapse of Napoleon's regime. Fortunately General Andy Jackson humiliated Sir Edward Pakenham at New Orleans ending the war as positively as it could. Too bad Sir Edward didn't have Lucky Jack with him. Civilisation might have been restored to North America.Britons do not live in memory of past glories when the chips are down as much as Americans do. The Hollywoodization of Patrick O'Brien's sea tale of Captain Jack Aubrey's pursuit of the privateer Acheron had to be toned down for US audiences. The movie only alludes to America as Britain's enemy; with a fresh coat of an alternative or variant Red White and Blue (Bleu, Blanche et Rouge) donates the Acheron to the cause of a different Revolution.There is a Captain Kirkish charm to Russell Crowe's performance and his relationship with the ship's surgeon approaches that of the gritting comradeship of Captain Kirk and Dr Spock.There's some swashbuckling adventure, some exploring the universe and some amateur psychology to merit the accolade 'The Star Trek on the high seas.'

Despite the lists of ""goofs"" mentioned in other reviews. The errors are extremely minor and unless you are the most perfectionist of a maritime historian they will not adveresely impact on your viewing experience. In fact, for a Hollywood movie, it is surprisingly true to life in its portrayal of the Royal Navy at that time. The film is a classic action movie in the truest tradition of Hollywood. The film is grounded in a good story. The action is intense and holds your attention. There is some violence but it is in keeping with the story and the action. The violence is neither gory or portrayed just to shock and awe. Not wishing to sound sexist this movie is fun for men of all ages. Age 5 to 105.

106,bix171,Slight But Worth A Look,6,9 June 2004,"Peter Weir's early-19th century sea drama (based on the work of beloved writer Patrick O'Brien) feels like a movie that has no real beginning or end--it's as if you've been dropped into the middle of an eight hundred page novel and that the story being told is perhaps more of a subplot. Actually, it seems surprising that there's a plot at all--the novelty in this day and age of a project about early-19th century seafaring is certainly odd enough to forego a storyline. Weir himself appears to recognize the novelty and spends a lot of his time doting on the ship's stateliness or detailing the inhabitants' everyday world (much of which seems to have been lost in the cutting room; there's a scattershot feel to the picture, as if there were too many digressions to fit). Russell Crowe plays the hero, Captain Jack Aubrey, as he chases a French vessel around the South American coast during the Napoleonic era. Crowe plays it safe here--he's on the verge of becoming the new Harrison Ford, a colorless hero who's traded his acting chops for audience adulation. This being a Weir film, there has to be some kind of class warfare and the simmering, antagonistic relationship between the ship's crew and their officers (most of whom are adolescent aristocrats) is examined, although only in fits and starts. (In one of the film's more ethereal moments, one of the young officers is actually driven to suicide.) But Weir somewhat confusingly co-opts his normally sympathetic views of the working class by making Crowe's character loved blindly by his men, a champion they pledge undying loyalty for, even though his obsessions put his crew in harm's way more often than not. Though it's difficult to shake the film's slightness and its lack of focus--it's hard to figure out what it's about, really--it's still worthwhile: in spite of its aspiration to epic greatness, it does manage to retain a sense of intimacy that allows for plenty of opportunities to take it all in and simply observe.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

He knows how to place himself in this; for those reasons I rate this in the 6-10 end (for me, that means 'watchable') of the site's rating scale.This is plainly driven by the ""Lord of the Rings"" effect of the need for a massive, massive structure that contains every bit of period minutiae of which one can conceive. And it's a bit tiresome.It's bested in every way by, for example, ""The Name of the Rose"", which in addition to period-correct detail, actually uses the visual narrative to play a game with the viewer, as opposed to merely laying out book-based imagery.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
108,Dockelektro,One of the most realistic period movies ever,8,21 December 2003,"From its outlook you could expect something good, even if a bit strange: Peter Weir running a seafaring movie, which from its trailer promised to be a gripping and exciting adventure through the seas of the early 19th century? But the trailer was lying. The movie is much more than just the adventures of Cpt. Jack Aubrey on board the HMS Suprise. This movie is made from the very same fabric it displays on screen, a fabric of sweat, salt water, heat, cold and storms. A fabric of moral and human fiber, a fabric of people's senses and feelings. The biggest suprise of this crafted and superb movie is that it sticks to the human values, and brings back that feeling of old movies, before the explosion of CGI created new worlds and destroyed many others. In fact, the computer-generated elements in this movie are so rare and detailed that you'll not notice them and even if you do, you'll forget that they are not real. This movie is realistic to every woodchip that flies under the cannon charges and every bit of cloth these characters wear. Add to it a commanding presence by Russel Crowe, decent supporting characters and a superb sound construction and you'll have one of the finest movies of the year, and a sure bet to the oscars (it's produced by Miramax, you know).",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
109,mnpollio,Tedious and forgettable,4,28 December 2006,"I have never read the series of books upon which this film is inspired, but hopefully they are infinitely more rousing than what translates to the screen in this endeavor. The film opens well enough and nicely establishes the rigors and hardships of life at sea on a British vessel during the Napoleonic Wars. Unfortunately, it does not go anywhere after that establishment. The remainder of the film is basically a drawn-out cat-and-mouse game in trying to avoid/confront an enemy vessel while navigating around South America. With the exception of three characters, all of the British seamen blend together and have no distinctive personalities. I swore the character played by Billy Boyd was killed at least three times only to pop up later unharmed making this viewer realize that it was just someone similar and equally forgettable who met their tragic end. Max Perkis stands out as young boy who loses his arm in the opening battle. Russell Crowe packed on substantial weight to take on the role of Captain Jack Aubrey, but one wonders at the effort since the role is a relatively straightforward one of a stiff-upper-lip British sea captain essayed as well, if not better, in a least a dozen superior films. Paul Bettany is exceptional as the boat's surgeon and the film really becomes interesting whenever he is on screen. His side trip to explore the indigenous life on the Galapagos Islands is a nice passage. The remainder of the crew are instantly forgettable and at large unsympathetic. A subplot where the superstitious crew hounds a young crewmen to his death because they blame him for the bad luck and weather plaguing them makes them even less appealing. The fact that the captain seems to support their stand is probably believable, but hardly inspires confidence in his abilities. Even worse, the movie seems to halfway buy into the superstitious stance, which is reprehensible. After the initial battle, the few remaining battle sequences become increasingly repetitious and boring. We learn little to nothing about the enemy vessel, and with a horde of unsympathetic seadogs on the British vessel, it is difficult to become emotionally involved in the outcome. Film is entirely too long and flaccidly paced. It actually concludes in the middle of a pursuit, but it seems unlikely anyone will care about the ultimate outcome. It incredibly received a number of Oscar nominations, but no major wins. To its credit, it does convey one major aspect of life at sea to the viewer  unending torpor.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

You truly felt as if the grit, harshness and simplicity of the era were captured in this film and it is easy to be swept away in Aubrey's determination to destroy the French ship that dared to attack him and his crew.The cast were all wonderful in their roles. Crowe was able to shrug off his brutish behaviour to depict Aubrey as a stubborn, intelligent officer and gentleman who lived for Britain. Paul Bettany was perfect as the quiet, reserved Marutin who cared for his close friend Aubrey and all the men he tended to in his duties as doctor. The supporting cast, a number of whom were newcomer British child actors, also proved themselves and gave this film depth in the way they portray their characters as a tight-knit crew who rely very much on each other and would die for their captain and country.A must-see film, especially for the British as there is never been such a film that will leave you feeling proud to be a Briton.

114,Bob Pr.,A masterpiece of historical accuracy,9,26 November 2003,"This film is destined to be regarded as a masterpiece of historical accuracy of British naval life and sailing vessels of its time -- roughly 1803.
It tells a story -- not a particularly compelling one in the sense of, say, ""The Sixth Sense.""  It's absolutely in the slice of life genre although spiced by the action of some storms and battle scenes.
So those who want a narrative to hook them, to fascinate and rivet them, are not as likely to enjoy this film.  Those who enjoy understanding what people in other times and places experienced, those with an interest in sailing and history, e.g., the British Navy, historical vessels, those familiar with Darwin's later voyage on the ""Beagle"" in the 1830s, etc., will be far more than amply rewarded. Fifty, or perhaps even one hundred years from now, I suspect this film will be still be used and viewed for its accuracy in historical depiction.I'm a long-time sailor, also interested in Darwin, evolution, the history of naval life and vessels, and a retired therapist.  I thoroughly enjoyed its impeccable accuracy in portraying the life and values of the time.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
115,harrylosborne,Unoriginal but very entertaining,7,8 May 2019,"Master and Commander is somewhat an enigma in terms of enjoyable films: whilst it is not an inherently interesting plot (a British vessel pursuing a French battleship around the coasts of South America during the Napoleonic Wars), this film is well-acted and visually strong, so is excellent viewing if you don't want to take what you're watching too seriously.Master and Commander plays somewhat on the underdog story of a weaker British crew trying to foil a superior opposition, but there are numerous subplots along the way. The steely Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is single-mindedly focused on destroying the French threat, causing a clashing of heads with his closest friend, naturalist-turned-medic Stephen Maturin (played by Paul Bettany, one of my favourite actors in the earliest role I saw him in). By convincing Maturin to engage in the pursuit (on the pretence that he will be able to conduct pioneering scientific research), the crew begin a voyage across the Earth. These two characters steal the show, and their dynamic relationship provides the drama outside of the conflicts with the French.As a period piece, the set and costume design is meticulous, paying close attention to subtleties of the era, bolstered by the entertaining naval battle scenes featured throughout. Master and Commander is exciting from start to finish, and is a low-investment film to watch whatever your mood.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

For the unsurprising story however one may look elsewhere. Russel Crowe turns out much better than feared, actually he fit quite well. The other was all quite characterless, except for the doctor who was OK, but maybe too ""reasonable"" for this voyage. I can easily understand his motivation for the ""Darwin voyage"" to the Galapagos, but he didn't go quite well as the warrior. As a pacifist, why would he enroll on a war ship? The ship was cramped and dirty, and it had a realistic atmosphere. So was the chaos during the sieges realistically shown.

Everything was just the way I imagined it, from the marines to the powder monkeys.I can't tell why seafaring stories are doing so well now, but we're certainly rediscovering classic cinema storytelling at its grandest. Russell Crowe even had a keen version of the classic matinée rugged hero about him, much like Clark Gable or Robert Mitchum or someone. He and Paul Bettany do play off each other very well, as demonstrated with the earlier A BEAUTIFUL MIND. And the up-and-coming young turks hold their own in this story as well.

There aren't much action in the movie, and the action that takes place isn't really exciting. The movie is more about telling a rather boring story of the life on board a British warship in the Napoleonic Wars. There are also a subplot in the movie that should have been cut from the movie, as it wasn't interesting at all. If you would like to see a movie/TV-series about life at sea in the Napoleonic Wars, I would really recommend the Horatio Hornblower-series starring Ioan Gruffudd instead.

Cast and characters are good, but I didn't feel anything took enough intensity to be great and I didn't feel moved or shocked or impressed at any point of the movie.
Cinematography wasn't anything special neither, and few scenes looked impressive or specially beautiful.
Story is quite simple and doesn't evolve much throughout, it actually ends like it would loop over and over again.

123,ilovedolby,It is excellent in every way!,10,16 November 2003,"Scheduled for release on June 6, studio heads at Fox, Miramax and Universal decided to wait on releasing `Master and Commander' in the fall rather than the summer to give it Oscar consideration. I would not call it the best film of 2003. However, it is an instant classic! Why? Peter Weir's direction, of course. The man knows how to take a story and play it out on the screen with excellent characterization, visual effects, acting, music and set design. When it all comes together, `Master and Commander' is made with such perfection and dignity, that it far exceeds anything in its genre. 	`Master and Commander' tells the story of British Naval Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) and his voyage during the Napoleonic Wars. Along with a crew of 197 men, including Aubrey's best friend and the ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), the crew set out to discover different species and lands in the Pacific Ocean. But that all changes when a French vessel fires upon their ship. Crippled at sea but under repair, Aubrey's ship sets out on a journey to find and destroy the French ship. Along the way, the men will battle a search for inner courage and will be forced to face odds they never dreamed possible. 	This film is made on such a grand scale, but when analyzed, there is nothing that has not been done before-except for the immense detail that no other film like it has done before. In the opening scene when Aubrey's ship is fired upon, they are floating in dense fog and can not see the enemy. When the ship emerges from the fog and they fire a second time, huge plumes of smoke can be seen emanating from the French ship's cannons. When the cannons strike the British ship, the damage is immense. We see the wood splinter, we see men get injured, we see the sails break down. The camera captures these shots in amazing clarity and furthermore, in real time.	Weir's direction is outstanding! The director of such wonderful films as `Fearless' and `The Truman Show' has gathered a cast that fits the film like a glove. Crowe is superb as the courageous and fearless Captain Aubrey. What better choice than Crowe when you consider his countenance as he appears dignified yet cordial to his men. Bettany's performance proves what an admirable actor he is. He also starred with Crowe in `A Beautiful Mind' as John Nash's imaginary friend Charles Herman. Here, his character Maturin is both a trusted friend of Aubrey's and the voice of reason when the goings get tough on the open sea. 	`Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World' is based on the novel by Patrick O'Brian. Weir, along with John Collee, have created a screenplay that details so much about the ship and the characters on board. We get to know a few of the men on board, from a gallant boy named Blakeney (Max Pirkis) to a cowardly Midshipman named Hollom (Lee Ingleby). Their character development is light enough where Weir does not waste film time on them, but satisfies the audience's interest in the characters. Also, look out for Billy Boyd as one of the ship's Coxswain named Barrett Bonden. It is hard to imagine him playing anything other than the hobbit Pippin in `Lord of the Rings.' 	In the end, one can not help but appreciate this film. It is excellent in every way. Moreover, it is not encumbered with unnecessary action sequences or absurdities. ****",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

126,MF210,The Best Epic of the Year,9,26 January 2004,"My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. Return of the King may have just won the Golden Globe for Best Picture-Drama but I find Master and Commander to be superior. ROTK may be the more visually stunning film, although Master certainly has some breathtaking visuals. However, Master and Commander is just a little better to me.
I have noticed that some people were disappointed by Master and Commander and its done poor at the box office (Made 84 million with a 150 million dollar budget). Those people were expecting another Pirates of the Carribean. I know they were disappointed because this is undoubtedly the superior film. Pirates is fun because of some of the action, while there is action in Master and Commander it is much more character-oriented. The film moves at a slower place to allow time for character development and interaction. Master and Commander was on a high budget and it shows in every scene. The visual effects are flawless. The films two big battle scenes are crafted with an undeniable skill. The typhoon is flawless looking. The ships are also flawless. Master and Commander is a stunning looking movie but the visual effects are not the film. There is a good deal of costume and make up too. The scenes at the Galapados(Spelling?) Islands are beautifully photographed.  The acting is also strong. Russell Crowe turns in a fantastic performance. Crowe has an undeniable screen presence and its more on display in this film than Gladiator. However, matching Crowe's performance is Paul Bettany. I have always noticed the actor in supporting roles and found him to be scene-stealing. But Bettany does much more acting here. His performance is not as showy as Crowe's but it equals it.  Peter Weir maintains tight control over the film. Once you strip away the visual effects, you will immediate see this is the kind of character-driven film Weir does best. However, Weir never lets the visual effects overwhelm the film. Weir has crafted the best Epic film of the year and one of the overall best films of the year.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

It was billed as an adventure/drama/thriller of a sea story and it just wasn't there. At all. Crowe, a fantastic actor, is left hanging with a plot that isn't gripping and a movie that doesn't supply enough action to keep its viewers attention. Had they added the necessary suspense into this it would have been a slam dunk. But they didn't. So it doesn't go anywhere but do laps around the ocean like the Flying Dutchman.

All the action occurs near the end and it's very good.To a large extent this movie is a character study of the captain. He is a smart man who employs a number of clever tricks in pursuit of the Acheron. He is an outstanding leader much loved by his crew and a fierce warrior.

129,kevin_crighton,A stunning and wonderful movie,10,25 June 2008,"Peter Weir is a director who has made some of the most interesting movies over the years, for example Witness, Dead Poet's Society, Fearless, Picnic At Hanging Rock. And for me, Master and Commander is not only one of his best, but also one of the best period epics from the last few years.Based on a novel written by Patrick O'Brian, it follows Captain Aburey and his ship HMS Surprise, as it does battle with a French ship in the South Pacific and the South Seas...There are many reasons why this movie works so well.The casting is spot-on. There are probably not many actors who can pull of a part like Aubrey, but Russell Crowe is one of them. Aubrey as Captain has to be a strong leader, but also an almost father figure to the young boy officers on board his ship. He certainly has to look the part when he has to fight. and in all these areas, Crowe easily convinces. I think his performance here is actually better than his Oscar-winning performance in Gladiator.But this is not totally Crowes' movie. There is a fantastic performance from Paul Bettany as the ship's doctor and Aubrey's close friend. The relationship is at the heart of the movie, despite the clashes with the French vessel, and both actors have to convince. It's to Bettany's credit that he more than holds his own against Crowe, making their relationship believable.The supporting cast, are all impressive, but special mention I think has to go to Max Pirkis as Blakely, one of the boy officers on the ship.The script by Weir and John Collee gives the actors plenty to work with. I've not read the Patrick O'Brian series of novels, but the dialogue here is fantastic and makes you really think you are on board a real ship. This of course is helped by the wonderful production design by William Sandell.The cinematography is superb, as is the music through-out the movie.The climax of the movie, a fantastic battle between and on the ships is gripping, well shot and very exciting. I've read that the way the battle is fought is also historically accurate. I can believe that.But this is Weir's movie. He directs the movie well, and despite being a long movie, it never drags or feels padded. He stages the action set-pieces brilliantly, yet also gives time for the actors to act well.Master And Commander won 2 Oscars at that years' event.

The strongest parts of this movie are in its non-battle sequences, when the interest is almost fully on the captain and his crew. To make it short: What we have here is a character-drama-blockbuster. But: As a blockbuster it may be too slow for a big part of the audience. And as a character drama, it doesn't go deep enough, it stays on the surface.

It literally comes off as a Pirates of the Caribbean spin-off set in the same extended Universe. Or maybe Pirates itself, but Sparrow's lost his whimsy and gets a slightly modified skin. We get it, it's a British period piece (wow, so uncommon, not like people've been doing this premise for centuries or anything, soooo fresh, way to give 'em something dazzling!), harumph, I say, Harumph, yes, Mr. Crow, we get it, you're not just ""the dude from Gladiator"", we're all taking you very seriously. This's the kind of video you would put on in a middle school social studies class when learning about the War of 1812. Yawn. An educational re-enactment without the wonder of learning something spectacular. This is the moving-picture version of skimming thru a few dusty Encyclopedia Britannica entries on 19th century Naval history. A tedious chore rather than stimulation. As dry as this review, but at least this review has the decency to be much shorter.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
136,FilmSnobby,A welcome avoidance of stupidity.,7,17 November 2003,"OK, so the title is terrible  (*Master and Commander:  The Far Side of the World*???), but Peter Weir's big-budget extravaganza about life on the open seas during the Napoleonic Wars is a welcome return to old-fashioned entertainment.  The many negative comments here -- ""talky"", ""boring"", ""not enough action"", etc. -- tells us more about the viewers than it does about the film, which, I assure you, has action to spare.  It's a measure of how vapidly hyperactive today's audiences have become when 5 minutes of dialogue can be described as  ""endless"".  Grow up, people.The movie is really not as  ""intellectual""  as its detractors make out (nor as intellectual as it wants to seem to be of its own accord).  Generous critics will probably make too much of the presentation of the alternately conflicting and cooperating roles that War  (personified by Russell Crowe's Jack Aubrey)  and  Science  (personified by Paul Bettany's Stephen Maturin) play in the progress of civilization.  *Master and Commander*  is not a philosophical piece.  Rather, it's a boy's adventure tale  (even featuring a largish role for a 12-year-old midshipman)  in which derring-do AND smarts win the day for our heroes.  However, the smarts are not accompanied by 21st-century-style, hip, Tarantino-esque wisecracks loaded with F-bombs, and so the movie's appeal will probably be lost on the average idiot at the multiplex.  Our main heroes, Capt. Jack Aubrey and naturalist/surgeon Stephen Maturin, are definitely men of the Old School:  Duty before pleasure; an enthusiasm for the Life of the Mind  (even macho Aubrey is not above taking battle-strategy tips from his egghead friend Maturin); a preference for classy things like Bach suites, which they saw together on violin and cello in Aubrey's quarters  (I felt the movie was pushing it a bit here, but whatever).One gets irritated after reading complaints that there's  ""no plot"", when the plot is abundantly clear:  England and France are at war; Aubrey has been commissioned to bring in a marauding French frigate -- the nicely named ""Acheron"" -- back to England as a  ""prize""; the Acheron turns out to be a Yankee-built monster that is better-gunned and better-manned, or at least more-manned, than Aubrey's ship.  Thus, Aubrey & Crew take the retreating position in the cat-and-mouse game that ensues.  One of the pleasures of the film is watching how Aubrey dodges the French ship with clever ruses like setting adrift a decoy-raft hung with lamps after nightfall:  Acheron pursues the decoy, and Aubrey escapes.  Presumably, these displays of cleverness must be the  ""boring""  parts everyone's referring to.  Well never mind.  If you're still able to enjoy the pleasures of classical storytelling in this age of pachincko-like cinema, *Master and Commander*  will be right up your alley.  *Matrix*  fans will want to avoid the movie.  One other note:  no females in the movie, except for a longing glimpse at a South Pacific girl.  I realize this will further limit the appeal of this film -- i.e., no women for the female audiences to identify with -- but, considering the setting and genre, I felt relieved to not have to endure yet another anachronistic, butt-kicking chick wreaking havoc on Napoleon's legions. Ladies, give us guys this one, OK?  We promise we'll go see  *Love Actually* in exchange.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

The (very few) action scenes are worth the price of the ticket and the special effects take you to that high-sea adventure effortlessly.The problem I found with this movie is the low entertainment value. Crowes other and better known historical epic, ""Gladiator,"" has a gripping, involving story. ""Master"" on the other hand looks like something more suitable for the History Channel or Bravo than the multiplex.This story is the second in a series of books made on the same character, and in a way, the movie feels like a sequel without being one. The characters are introduced as if we already know them and some of their intentions or problems are not really explained.Still it is a very good movie, not great, but good. It possibly needed a better balance between the action scenes and the scenes that pushed the plot development, again, like in ""Gladiator."" The action scenes in this movie are too few and far between. A shame because the climatic battle scene at the end is one, if not the best naval battle scene ever made for a movie.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Well, I supposed pace, composition, and a setting appropriate to the high seas aren't everything. Some have commented that Russell Crowe is dull.  Well, perfect control, pitch, and nuance as the Captain of the Surprise doesn't require the overacting prolific in Gladiator.  What's so, er, surprising about Master and Commander is its languid pace, which echoes the kind of life faced by the shipmates.  You got a direct feel for sailing, and kudos to Peter Weir for that cinematographic vision.  One user commented that certainly lots of sodomy would have gone on behind the bulkheads...and frankly, the whole crew seemed rather non-sexual, as though a saltpeter bomb had gone off at the film's start.  Given Russell Crowe's fine performance in The Sum of Us, I'm sure he could have improvised...but perhaps he had more important ship duties to attend to (a la Captain Kirk, who always referred to the Enterprise as ""She"").",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
140,Camoo,Absolutely underrated masterpiece,10,14 November 2014,"I've watched this film probably close to ten times now since I first saw it in the cinema for a double header that included Tom Cruise's dreadful 'The Last Samourai'. I remember the impression it made on me. I also remember feeling embarrassed as a teenager buying a ticket for a movie with such a florid title as 'Master and Commander: Far Side of the World' and Russell Crowe on the poster looking like a butch sailor with an unbuttoned uniform staring wistfully off into the future. I cringed. How wrong I was. Here is a film told with great precision and mastery by one of the great chameleon filmmakers Peter Weir; I say chameleon because he is a director who always puts his story and characters ahead of himself - his craft is efficient, with the goal being to remove all traces of there being a hand behind the wheel. Everything you need is there, in service to the film. I've never had the adventure/buccaneer/sailor fantasy growing up, but this film certainly instilled it in me. It's a tremendous adventure, with sweeping battle sequences but is also unusually smart and literate for such a large scale picture. Despite its swashbuckling pretenses, the film allows all of the characters to breathe and come to life over the course of a strangely moving and evocative narrative. Each viewing of the film brings out more details under the surface. It's a shame it didn't have a chance at a sequel, it deserved one so badly.

You don't really get too involved with the characters and i think that is too bad. My favorite character in this movie is the ship's doctor. And i you ask me why that is, i can't really give you a good reason. All i can say is that i like that actor. I also like Russel Crowe but my favorite movie with him is still L.A. Confidential. Don't get me wrong, he does a good job in this movie, but i missed getting to know the story behind the characters. Most of the reason i liked this movie is due to the fact that the waves and ocean are real. It looks amazing. You will probably enjoy this movie, but not more than that. I rate this movie 7/10",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
142,Ishallwearpurple,An old dame likes this tale----,9,6 December 2003,"---From the opening shot of the beautiful sailing vessel on the lonely sea from high above; through the first sequence of the crewman going though the hammocks of the sleeping crew to wake the next watch and them climbing, in the dark, up the masts among the sails, I was captivated.I have never read the books, nor even heard of them, until reading about this film.  The movie has a great world of the Napoleonic era to detail, and does so in great fashion.  I loved the look of the garb of the era, and the detail of all the many chores and insights into daily living on a great vessel.The cast is uniformly fine.  Russell Crowe is the commander of this vessel and he is most believable.  The young Lord Blakeley played by new-comer, Max Pirkis is a standout.  And for us gals, James D'Arcy, in a small but star-making role, is just gorgeous.This is a world of men, and the time is the early 1800's.  I, for one, am glad the filmmakers did not mess it up with romances and kept it true to the story of men at war at sea.  And that they did not put in action just for the sake of the fanboy crowd that has no attention span for the nuanced tale being told.  Wonderful film.  9/10",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
143,marxsarx,A Good Movie With One Major Weakness,7,9 May 2004,"********    SOME MILD SPOILERS  ******* Master and Commander is an adventure on the high seas.   It gives us the depiction of a cat and mouse game between the captains of two ships.  It's a good movie with one weakness.  The major weakness of this movie is that it ultimately looks at every character in an analytical way.  The result is that I admired the characters but never became attached to them.  This might not be bad news for a character study, but it isn't particularly beneficial to an adventure movie. The perspective of Master and Commander is from the captain and crew of one ship.  The captain is played by Oscar winner Russell Crowe.  There is tremendous attention to detail and the actors give marvelous portrayals of their characters.  Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany (together again from the movie A Beautiful Mind) shine as do several other actors especially the actor who played the young officer who lost his arm.  It is interesting to see what the quality life of the sailors was like in that time period.  Beautiful photography and lavish sets abound.There are numerous men aboard the ship living in tight quarters and the men from different walks of life with some being officers, one a doctor and the rest crew men on the ship.  This naturally leads to some conflict and tension.    For adventure movie lovers, Master and Commander is a good choice.  You'll probably be satisfied although not swept away (no pun intended).There is another difficulty, however, for this movie. I believe it is overshadowed by Pirates of the Caribbean which is a tough movie to compete with.  There will be inevitable comparisons, and Pirates of the Caribbean will come up the winner.I rate this movie a C.   It was better during the second viewing and I think time will be kind to this movie.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
144,themarina1,Surprisingly Great,8,17 November 2003,"I was far from excited about my trip to the movies this weekend (I didn't get to pick what I wanted to watch...) but...I was going to be a good sport and sit though this mess with minimal complaints. Boy am I glad I did. This turned out to be a fabulous movie. Excellent special effects (the storm scened in this movie make ""The Storm"" look like a joke), the cast (how many seamen were on that ship?), and the story were all enjoyable. The story was very historically accurate and full of trivia (how did they measure speed in the good ol' days before computers?). I though the acting was good though not spectacular. However, great to watch was Paul Bettany, a talented actor, who, up to this point, had been undercast.8/10 for this great sea epic",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
145,bburns,"From a simple plot, an epic film",9,16 April 2004,"The entire plot of ""Master and Commander"" can be summed up in a single sentence:  In 1805, HMS Surprise sails from the coast of Brazil to the Galapagos Islands to do battle with the French ship Acheron.  From this thin reed of a plot, Peter Weir constructs a true epic that should thrill fans of old fashioned sea-going adventures.From almost the beginning, we discover that the Acheron is a formidable foe, since it is both larger and faster than the Surprise.  The Acheron is also nearly impervious to the Surprise's ordnance thanks to the modern invention of double-hulling.Also from the beginning, we are shown that the Surprise's captain ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey (Russell Crowe filling the shoes of fellow Aussie Errol Flynn) is a wise and courageous commander who loves his men.  He does have doubts at times, however.  This is largely due to his frequent conversations with his best friend and ship's doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany).  Dr. Maturin believes in the primacy of scientific research over battle and feels that Jack can be something of a tyrant towards his conscripts.  During their free time, the doctor and captain play music together with the captain on violin and the doctor on cello.What impressed me the most about this film is the painstaking attention to detail as far as what the ship is like, how the men are trained and even who served in the Royal Navy two hundred years ago.  The men are mostly conscripted (i.e. kidnapped) by the Navy from off the streets of England. And not all of the men are men at all.  Boys who have not yet reached puberty are conscripted, and are even made officers (there is a subplot involving a young boy played by Max Perkis who loses his arm in an early battle, and who commands a battalion at the end of the movie).  Captain Aubrey treats the boys with fatherly affection, although he still expects no less of them than his adult crew.Another thing I liked was that, rather than relying solely on a through-composed score, bits of classical music from Bach, Handel, Mozart, and Vaughn-Williams are thrown in.  In deference to the Captain's duets with the doctor, the music is nothing but violins and cellos, with no brass or percussion.  And the score is such that it fits seamlessly with the classical music.I also really enjoyed the scenes of natural wonder on the Galapagos.  They are so enchanting, one forgets that they have little to do with the plot.The film truly belongs to Russell Crowe.  In a movie with no women, Crowe is the manliest of all men, and is the only contemporary actor who could have played the part.  Every other male in Hollywood is either too old (i.e. Harrison Ford), too wimpy/sensitive (i.e. Ben Affleck) or not a good enough actor (i.e. Vin Diesel).There are a few flaws.  Much of the dialog is either mumbled or drowned out by the sound effects, so it is sometimes difficult to tell what's being said.  Plus, there are a few scenes too many that have nothing to do with the main plot.  And aside from the captain, the doctor, and the kid who loses his arm, you don't really get to know anyone in the film as a distinct character.Altogether, however, this film is a rousing nautical adventure in the spirit of ""Captain Blood"", ""Treasure Island"", or ""Mutiny on the Bounty"".  I highly recommend it to anyone who has ever daydreamed about going to sea or going to war.  9 out of 10.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Totally believable adventure-drama as British warship hunts down a much larger French man of war off the South American coast in 1805.Crowe brings Captain ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey to life and fits the role perfectlt. He gets good support from his co-star Paul Bettany as the ships doctor-and naturalist Maturin . They both were good together in ""A Beautiful Mind"" and these two have a chemistry that works perfectly. Much attention is paid to historical detail and we get a good picture of what it was like to live-and fight on these wooden ships. We get to see all the details, the food, the cramped quarters, the thrill of the battles, the dangers of the sea and the monotony that existed when the ship was stuck in calm weather where not a breeze of wind was to be had. It was a tough life-and a dangerous one too and the film doesn't gloss it over.

149,CurtMan@LVCM.com,Master Film-making,9,18 November 2004,"There is much to admire about Peter Weir's adaptation of the British sea voyage novels, ""Master And Commander: The Far Side of the World"". It's absorbing, it's breathtaking, it's intelligent, it's glorious, and it's ingeniously crafted. This is such a sensational marvel of a film production that, if it hadn't been for ""The Return of the King"" stealing its thunder, ""Master and Commander"" would have certainly won many more Oscars, and perhaps even the grand prize. My only major complaint with the film is the story: at times tedious, and includes some ingratiating details (e.g. Paul Bettany befriending a junior sailor---entirely irrelevant to the plot). This is an astonishing effort that sails both on style as well as substance. The acting is, as expected, pure dynamite, with Russell Crowe delivering yet another impeccable performance as the virtuous, vivacious ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey- and plays this role with such spirit and conviction that he virtually steals the show as far as the cast is concerned. Paul Bettany plays a diffident, subdued role as Stephen Maturin, proving that he can be deftly serious and reflective to Russell Crowe's bombast and vivacity. The visuals, to say the least, are absolutely splendid- from the engaging battles of the ships, to the raging storms, to the flickering lights throughout these turmoils, one is really given a ""taste of the perilous and spectacular sea"" through some strikingly realistic effects. And speaking of being situated into the action, the sound effects are superb- the gunshots are vociferous and glaring, and it is often scary how terrifying these battles really are. The ship design is exquisite, and perhaps very exorbitant, displaying practically every detail one might expect to find in a British liner circa 1805. The costumes are fancy, genteel, and luxurious, and what else might one expect sailors from the Royal British Navy to be suited with? A far cry from the scrappy suits of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" in that respect! I will say that my favorite scene of the film was the showdown between the Brits and the French- you are literally situated right in the center of the bloody action, and you realize that this is the ultimate pinnacle and quest of the story: what an engaging thrill! Featuring some brilliant and laudable technical design, fantastic acting, yet a somewhat slow and stagnant plot, ""Master and Commander"" is, above anything else, a masterpiece in modern film-making, and truly a wonder to behold. ***1/2 out of ****",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

151,JackCerf,A Missed Opportunity,6,3 June 2011,"Russell Crowe is a very convincing Jack Aubrey. He projects Aubrey's energy, competence, pugnacity and confidence bordering on self-satisfaction (unlike Hornblower, Aubrey always knew he was good). He also credibly projects Aubrey's belief in the need for custom, tradition and authority, his acceptance of the irrational culture of the lower deck as a fact of life that must be dealt with, and his own irrational streak. Crowe's Aubrey is true to O'Brian's instinctive Tory. He is intelligent but not an intellectual, and he knows that the ignorant, superstitious masses have to be dominated from above rather than uplifted. A.O. Scott of the NY Times got it right when he wrote that this ""one of the most thoroughly and proudly conservative movies ever made,"" for which he expected to see Edmund Burke get screen credit. Scott also got it right when he described Aubrey as ""an ideal personification of modern executive authority"" and wrote ""'Master and Commander,' were it not a movie, could be a Powerpoint seminar advertised in an airline magazine: Leadership Secrets of the Royal Navy."" Maturin will be the biggest disappointment to serious O'Brianists. Bettany gives a good performance, but the part is badly written. The Maturin of the books is a scientific rationalist, but of his time and place. Much of the pleasure of the character is to see what he knows, what he doesn't know, and what he thinks he knows that we know isn't so. The Maturin of the books is also, in his peculiar way, devoted to the defeat of Napoleon and the overthrow of all the French Revolution stands for. One might think of this Irish-Catalan outsider as a neo-conservative of his day. A former Irish revolutionary, he has become a devoted supporter of the existing order out of revulsion with his personal experience of radicalism and its consequences, and he puts his considerable intellect at the service of victory.The Maturin of the movie is an anachronism, not merely outside the culture of the Navy but unsympathetic to it. He isn't merely upset that the ship's mission interferes with his naturalizing, as the Maturin of the books often is. He disputes with Aubrey the need for the mission itself and the intensity with which Aubrey pursues it. O'Brian's Maturin is a dedicated, competent and merciless secret agent for the Admiralty. Weir's Maturin isn't an intelligence agent, and I can't see how he could be or would want to be.Weir also wastes Maturin's great narrative potential as an explainee. In his 15th century text on painting, Alberti wrote that a religious or historical scene should always include an ""interlocutor"" in the foreground; a figure who draws the viewer into the picture. Since few people in Western societies have military experience any more, a good modern war movie needs an interlocutor, both to inform the audience what is going on and to be an emotional intermediary, reacting as one not hardened to war. Leutnant Werner does this job in Das Boot, Corporal Upham in Saving Private Ryan.Maturin was O'Brian's interlocutor. His peculiar inability to learn anything about seamanship gave O'Brian the chance to have members of the gunroom explain things to him repeatedly, as well as some low comedy when Maturin tried passing this knowledge on to those even more ignorant than he. With very minor exceptions, Weir doesn't use Maturin this way. He limits Maturin's interactions pretty much to Aubrey and Blakeny, leaving out the kind of easy social intercourse with the other officers through which O'Brian fed the reader technical information. His Maturin is also too emotionally distant from the struggle in which he is involved; he sulks and almost sneers, but he does not seem moved.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Moreover, both characters share a responsibility for the survival of the crew, albeit on different planes of authority.  I found that the pairing worked quite well, and wonder if we'll see it again.  Both did solid acting jobs, but neither role was a far stretch from previous roles - Crowe in Gladiator and Bettany in a Knight's Tale.The feel of the movie was phenomenal.  I cannot recall any movie with at sea scenes remotely close to this movie, except The Perfect Storm.  Combine that with the brutal combat details of the Patriot and you'll have a good feel for what war on the high seas was like.  One of the major differences though is the presence of young children and teenagers, usually orphans, on ships that as often as the adults find themselves the casualties of sea warfare - this is a fact most people tend to forget.This visually masterful depiction of life at sea, showed all facets of sea-faring life.  The ship itself is amazing - how it was transformed from a place to live to a place for war in a matter of minutes.  How while some live stock was kept on board, much foraging still needed to occur the longer the journey, or when the ship was stuck dead in the water because their was no wind, or how they ran low on fresh water because it hadn't rained in days.  Based upon what I have read, in and out of school, these were many of the realities of sailing at sea.You will find yourself drawn to all the supporting characters who's names and faces become familiar to you over the course of this movie, and be amazed at the vivid scenery that plays a backdrop to the brutality of life and war at sea.

Crowe's acting was understated brilliance and I will be lumping him with the likes of Anthony Hopkins for mastery of the subtle nuance. Some have called it a slow film. On the contrary, the time is definitely compressed. Life on a ship at this time was long periods of nothing. In this film something was always going on even if it was just character development.

The production values are outstanding as is just about everything else. It's obviously a work of love.On the other hand, if you've read the O'Brian novels, you might miss some of the finer points of the Aubrey/Maturin relationship. Personally, I read the books after, so it wasn't an issue. I must have watched this ten times by now, and I still marvel at some of the detail. My only caveat is that it is not your standard Hollywood production which has been written trying to appeal to every demographic. It is what it is, so you'll need to be interested in the subject matter. If you even remotely are, you should find it a very rewarding viewing.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Actually, the ads were pretty accurate, Russell Crowe, scenery, and battle sequences, that's all there is.  It is hard to feel sympathy for characters whom are barely defined or even introduced.  The only exception is Paul Bettany as the ships doctor. Otherwise the film barely has a soul and is merely an exercise in filmmaking on the part of the normally excellent Peter Weir.  In other words, the film is boring, but not for lack of action.  I could blame a weak script, but Weir co-wrote that too.  The cinematography had to have been the ONLY reason this film was nominated for Best Picture over several more deserving films.

158,JesNollie,An exciting effects film.,8,17 November 2003,"More than most of Weir or Crowe's previous films, this one relies as much on effects and scenery as on the individual performances of the cast.  Make no mistake, many of the performances are excellent, but this is an action/adventure film.  Unlike many Hollywood action films, the action is pretty realistic, rather than simply graphic.  Having seen several films and read several books set during this war, I found the story fairly formulaic, and therefore predictable.  But that did not lessen my enjoyment of the film.  It was a rollicking high-seas adventure that I found very exciting.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

161,FilmLabRat,good but not fabulous,6,25 December 2003,"A good story with developing characters, nice acting and interesting interactions...  But only of special interest to those who like constant battle content, seafaring talk, weather changes and guts and gore of extreme medical care(and very unrealistic I might add - I worked with surgeons for 7 years and most of the outcomes are ridiculous).  Overall, there is not much in the way of clever turns of plot or much to keep the viewer engaged.  The most suspenseful and interesting parts are (1) when Aubrey decides to disguise the ship as a whaler and (2) how they discovered and studied the Galapagos Islands, famous for the origin of Darwin's ""Origin of Species"" theory.  The lessons they learned are important and inspiring but not earth-shattering or especially new or deep.

That being said, I find this movie one of the best I have ever seen and I do not make that judgment lightly.

It was a narrative of world events and people from the years 1815 to 1830.  I was reminded of that novel when I was watching ""Master and Commander"".  I appreciated the film maker's decision to set it during a period that's rarely done in film history.  Europe has just begun to extend it's grip around the whole globe with England about to reach pre-eminence. The scientific method was taking hold among European academia.The main plot has a British warship pursuing and being pursued by a French warship.  Among the men, and boys, on the ship is its doctor, who is a naturalist as well.

Films that take you to a place completely different from the world that you and I live in and allow you to experience life as others might have lived it in the past.  It really makes history come alive for me.Russell Crowe gives another great performance.  With A BEAUTIFUL MIND, THE INSIDER, and LA CONFIDENTIAL, Russell Crowe proves himself to be among the greatest actors working today.  He is completely focused in every shot.  I kept looking into his eyes and I didn't see a movie star.  I saw a sea captain.This is also a triumph for director Peter Weir.  I've been a fan of Weir's work for a long time now, but I never would have predicted that he could pull off a film like this.  This is probably his largest film in scope and he proves that he is more than up to the challenge.My rating:9 out of 10",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

166,paul-nemecek,Masterful,9,6 July 2018,"If there is a connecting thread in the work of director Peter Weir it is to be found in his great theme, the clash of cultures. Sometimes the clash of cultures is in the foreground (Witness, Mosquito Coast, The Year of Living Dangerously, Picnic at Hanging Rock); in some of his works it is more subtle (Dead Poets Society, Gallipoli, The Truman Show). In Master and Commander it is revealed in the tension between the values and worldview of the warrior-leader and the healer/man of science.The master and commander is Jack Aubrey, very capably portrayed by Russell Crowe, one of the best actors working today. His good friend, the doctor and naturalist is played by Paul Bettany (who played the imagined roommate opposite Crowe in A Beautiful Mind). It is easy to view this as simply a standard swashbuckler, and to be sure there is plenty of swash to be buckled (whatever that means) but the strength of the film lies in its juxtaposition of the larger conflict and the battle scenes, and the interpersonal conflicts between the two friends.If the film were just about the larger conflicts, the spectacular battle scenes, and the pursuit, it would be too easy to dismiss the film as a remake-Gladiator Goes Sailing-in the same way that I dismissed Waterworld as Mad Max goes sailing. In the macro-story, the quest for the elusive ship, the story is reminiscent of many other sailing films. There are elements of Moby Dick, Mutiny on the Bounty, The Caine Mutiny. The thread that connects these films is obsessive leadership that walks the line between duty and prideful ambition. The most engaging part of the film, as is always the case in Weir's films, is the clash of cultures. In this case, the cultures are represented by the values of the two friends. The tensions created by the conflicting values of the warrior and the healer. These represent conflicting values, dialectical tensions, in all cultures and perhaps in all people. It is this storyline that redeems the film from being just another run-of-the-mill seafaring adventure.Having said that, I should add that the seafaring adventure story is particularly well told, and is wonderfully supported by superior cinematography. Cinematographer Russell Boyd is an Australian (as are Weir and Crowe) and Boyd has worked with Weir on a number of films from the beginning of Weir's career in the mid 70's. The cinematography is superb in this film. In the battle scenes we feel the claustrophobia, in the storm scenes sheer terror. When Boyd shows us the vast oceans or the Galapagos Islands we are awed by the sheer beauty of the scene. When the Academy Awards are announced, the Master and Commander may not be able to defeat the Lord of the Rings but you can count on it to be in the running. This one is definitely worth a look.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
167,ks4,"Good movie, but SOMETHING was missing, but what!",7,22 February 2004,"Having just watched the movie i am kinda confused, i actually thought it was a good movie, but why does it feel like there is something missing, and i can't quite figure out what i feel is missing, lets dig it.First of all what drives this movie is that it is a well directed movie, and it has stunning cinematography, that was one thing i really loved about it, absolutely beautiful scenery and settings.First of all one of the losses in this movie is that all the persons except the doctor and the captain feels kinda distant, it feels like they are there becuase they have to be there, many of them are just faces you recognize but you don't get to know any of them very personally, which is why you later on won't feel much sorrow when some of them dies. More intensity to the personalities of each main character would have made a better movie i think.Also one of the things that struck is that the movie spends most of the time building the background for the initial fight with the french ship, and then after the end fight is over, you're left, wondering why it wasn't a great fight as you had hoped and expected for, that's sad becuase the start out small fights are so well made, and then the end one is just a big dissapointment, that kinda let the movie down.The last thing i felt wrong was the twist made very late in the movie about the doctor about the other ship, someone please tell Peter Weir not to include a twist in the movie if he does not wish to explain the outcome of it, that totally ruined the ending in my book.So overall i thought it was a good movie, but there are some things, some major things, that i thought was either missing or wrongly done, but you can't take away from the movie that it has some fantastic breathtaking scenes at times, and some pretty solid action. And it is entertaining after all, just has a few flaws hehe.7/10",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
168,Juni78ukr,In any year without Return of the King this one should be a big winner,10,4 December 2003,"I went to this movie with my parents and don't expect anything more than a usual light sea adventure movie but I was mistaken. Master and Commander without a doubt is a best sea war/adventure movie in recent years and one of very best of all-time. It's a story of a British war frigate in thousands miles far away from home, a story of duty and courage of people united by one goal, a story of the strong characters who struggle with power of nature. The script is well-written, solid and consistent all the way. The screenwriters one more time proved that such a movie can exist without a usual weak Hollywood's love story in the background. Just unexplored boundless ocean, people on the certain ship and that's it.Peter Weir is a director who has made lots of very good but different from each other movies (worth to mention among them Dead Poets Society, The Witness, and The Truman Show). His directing in Master and Commander is outstanding. He has brought a balance into the movie; he united into one masterpiece excellent acting with magnificent special effects and that's the most important all these visuals are in the right place. Nothing here looks fake, all seems perfectly real, from a squall sea to beautiful Galapagos Islands. But the real glory of the movie is naval battles, the best such scenes I have ever seen. The excellent cinematography with well selected scenery makes this terrific piece of film-making an unforgettable experience for all people who prefer high-quality work to shallow summer blockbusters. Finally the acting. As all previously mentioned it's excellent. Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany created here two Oscar-worthy performances of their well developed characters. Mr. Crowe was incredibly powerful as captain Jack Obrey, the strong leader but at the same time not a heartless person. He definitely deserved the fourth Oscar nomination in last six years for this terrific performance, but for some reason he was robbed of it. Paul Bettany perfectly plays here his best friend and at the same a subordinate under his command. All the supporting casts are good (including an excellent performance of young newcomer Max Pirkis as midshipman Blakeney) in their parts, they have created an amazingly real picture of a war ship and its crew. The movie's soundtrack is in opinion the best original score of this year and very suitable. All the way Master and Commander is an Oscar-worthy work of art that deserves the highest appreciation and praise. I know there is no a perfect movie in our world and with some patience you can find flaws in this Peter Weir's work but when you see such a movie you forget about all that and finally applause to all people involved in making of such a masterpiece.10 out of 10",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
169,realfandangoforever,Come for the Action and Popcorn,7,14 July 2018,"Epic budget, no doubt, but not epic impact. Great time period, plenty of action and characters to care about but I came out just feeling a little flat. The word anti-climatic comes to mind. If ship battles in the early 1800s were like this, it must have been a harsh time. Black powder and big calibres make for a lot of destruction, if not accuracy. Fun, and worth seeing, for this reason alone.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
170,Alan-40,"Excellent, but not to be compared to the book",10,25 February 2004,"It is hard to say enough good things about this movie -- you just couldn't get a better presentation than Russell Crowe does.  When he growls a line like, ""he's done this to me two times, there won't be a third"" you can feel the determination and authority that O'Brian's Jack Aubrey is.Of course there is so much that are in the novels that isn't even touched in the movie.  The character Jack Aubrey is certainly a genius when it comes to anything nautical; in almost any other venue he is almost a complete buffoon.  This is very important to the character.  The best the screenplay can do to show this is show him spitting food over his table in a clowning act; it just doesn't work very well.  The Stephen Maturin character is similarly short-changed.  He becomes a backdrop character instead of a second protagonist, even though they wrote in a crucial role for him in the plot.Most of this sacrifice is to give you stunning sea footage and up-close-and-personal battle scenes.  I'll tell you the guys who did that in real life were crazy. So the real star of the show is the ship and the water around it.  That at least is where the movie version has real value over what any book can provide.Enjoy the movie, but don't equate it with the books.

Consider this, though: the French killing the English and the English killing the French on the ocean in BIG ships? That is not a plot.  That's the background in which a story can be told.

173,Targe,Overall a Masterpiece,8,13 September 2010,"The attention to detail in this movie is one thing that really impresses me, particularly in the actor's wonderful job of studying and speaking 18th century British Naval lingo and accents flawlessly. You feel immersed in the belly of this tiny British Frigate (at 28 guns, it was indeed a tiny warship for the time and barely worthy of the title Frigate) which brings me to the first of many minor complaints.We are shown a very skillful and apparently distinguished commander, who apparently served with the immortal Nelson himself, yet this man, at the apex of his career, is commanding what might today be called a patrol boat. He should be commanding a massive 74 gunner ship of the line by this time in his career, and we are offered no explanation as to why this is not so.The reason of course is because of production values. No 74 gunner exists any more in the world and would have to have been re-created completely digitally. That they managed to do this with the 'French' Constitution class heavy frigate is proof it could have been done though.Apparently they originally had the British against the Americans. This would have made a far more enjoyable movie for me, since the American Constitution class 44 gun frigate, (armed with 24 inch main guns, btw, not 18 as stated in the movie) was never loaned to the French.Secondly, such a boat would have eaten the lowly British frigate for breakfast on the first engagement, fog bank or no fog bank. The inequality between these two ships is so massive as to nearly beg impossibility of any good outcome for the Brit boat. The passage of such a unique ship would have been known, and the British would have dispatched at least 2 (more like 4 for good measure) 36 gun frigates in pursuit.But technical errors aside, where this movie shines is in the acting, and in the costumes, set and the passion the actors threw into it to get the mood right. Wonderful job, I suspect the director sent them all off on a tall ship sailing adventure cruise to get their heads into it before the movie began.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

175,Vishal_s_kumar,"Stunning visuals, solid acting and rousing story",10,23 February 2010,"Since Errol Flynn graced the screen in Captain Blood, the genre of swashbuckling, seafaring films have enjoyed great notariety. Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is a period piece with modern execution. From the standpoint of the story and cast, Russell Crowe as Captain Jack Aubrey is the ultimate star of Master and Commander. He conveys an authenticity and charisma that few actors currently possess, which allows him to pull off the Aubrey role so authoritatively. But there is an even more impressive star of the film--a star you will not see. Richard King was brought on board by director Peter Weir as ""sound designer"". His passion and technical expertise in audio engineering make the film a powerhouse cinematic experience, transporting viewers from their seats to a place onboard the British Navy ship, Surprise, off the coast of South America almost 200 years ago. More than any other aspect of the film, the realism and immersive quality of the audio puts the audience in the middle of the action. King won the Academy Award of Merit for Best Sound Editing for his work on Master and Commander. It was very well deserved.Based on Patrick O'Brian's novels about Aubrey's adventures, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World follows the Surprise, as it battles the Acheron, a superior U.S.-made ship in Napoleon's navy. After a surprise attack by the Acheron during the film's opening scene, in which the British ship takes nearly insurmountable damage and barely slips away in the cover of fog, Captain ""Lucky"" Jack decides to go after the faster, stronger ship instead of returning to England. At first, the decision seems foolhearty, as the Acheron again surprises Aubrey. This time, he escapes under cover of darkness. But the story is more than a series of chase and battle scenes, entertaining as those prove to be. Several aspects of naval and ship service are explored.Part of the story touches on concepts like religion and science in the prism of 19th century thought. The latter part of the film takes place in the Galápagos Islands where the ship's Irish doctor and naturalist, Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) convinces Aubrey to let him explore and collect specimens in a pre-Darwinian subplot. Unfortunately for Maturin, he makes an unexpected discovery that leads him to cut short his tour of the Galápagos. One of his specimens, an insect that looks like a twig, gives Aubrey the idea to disguise the Surprise, leading to the film's climax, an intense battle, featuring an extended sequence of intense hand-to-hand combat. It is worth asking if Master and Commander would have received more attention if it arrived in theaters at a different time than the much more successful Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl. Both feature ""Captain Jack"" characters, swashbuckling adventures on the open seas, and impressive battle scenes. Both films were very well executed, and it makes sense that a movie appealing to younger audiences would gross significantly more at the box office. The reality, though, is that audiences chose the equivalent of a theme park ride over an excellent series of books that easily could have spawned even better sequels to Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World. The biggest disappointment of the film is that there would be no follow-up Master and Commander to follow Lucky Jack's exploits in the service of England's navy. Instead, we got two insipid sequels to the Pirates film, neither of which rose to the level of the first. Too bad. I would much prefer a trilogy of Master and Commander films, but it was not to be.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
176,eyal philippsborn,Not a masterpiece but still another gem from the Ausies,8,13 April 2004,"I have a question: How come Hollywood still approves ambitious projects for sea-oriented motion pictures? This is a big question, in my view, because there are so many pirate movies and movies with extensive shooting on the ocean that their costs bloated like a highway project. Those films (apart from the shrewdly marketed ""Titanic"") ended up losing great deal of money (Cut throat island, Water world and list sails on and on). But still, when veteran and an extremely talented director Peter Weir came up with an idea to film the story of Ocean battles (who were shot in a location near Mexico, exactly where ""Titanic"" was filmed) during the 19th century clashes with Napoleon, the studios handed a carte blanche (French for: 150 million dollars) to turn the didactic story to a very convincing epic film that, unfortunately for all parties involved, sunk.The plot, in essence, is about Jack Aubry a.k.a Lucky Jack (Russel Crowe) who is the captain of a war vessel with contagious zeal and charisma which enable to conceal his impulsive, ego motivated and fickle philosophy (what we refer today as ""Politician""). The quest, seemingly after a French super modern  vessel becomes a feast of strength for Jack and his followers who include a young trainee who turns out (naturally) as a brave and resourceful youngster, A first lieutenant that can't garner respect from the ship members and, finally, the Doctor/zoologist/ Voice of reason on the ship. Before I elaborate further, I must stress out that every sea-oriented motion picture has to include its fair share of adventure. This movie, is no exception and it provides with very compelling (although sometimes, to elaborate to be coherent) battle scenes that portray vividly the confrontation of two war vessels back in the days where attackers saw what or who they were attacking.There are two schools regarding Russel Crowe acting, some say he's one of the best working actors today but others claim he's overrated (no man in his right mind will refer to Crowe's acting as bad). I belong to the former and I think that although the cast in this movie (especially D'arcy, the Doctor) is great in general, Crowe's performance as the skilled sailor and secretly sensitive captain, makes the movie a real treat. What denies the movie of the Masterpiece title is the lack of added value of the movie, a trait that many other Weir's films have in abundance (Dead poets society, Fearless, The Truman show and so many others, all of which I strongly recommend).Summing up, the movie is well written, acted, directed, shot and paced and if you're not in an overly pensive mood, this film, although not Weir's finest work, is yet another evidence of its skill in the 7th art. Unfortunately, the fact that the movie didn't do very well at the box office means that future ""location is the ocean"" pictures will be either a thing of the past or a fluffy adventure flick (like the curse of the Caribbeans).8.5 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter.P.S. Just in case you were wondering, ""Ausies"" is a nickname for Australians which is where Weir was born and where Crowe lives. Cheers, mates!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Stars Russel Crowe and Paul Bettany as they try to take down a french vessel called the Acheron, whose captain seems to get the best of Lucky Jack. The movie mainly focuses on the relationship between Maturin and Aubrey, though screen time is given to the crew and how sea life was back then. The dialogue throughout the movie is laced with nautical terms and slang that adds to the authentic feel of the movie. Action sequences are top notch and the graphical shots hard to spot. Directing is excellent, as is to be expected from Peter Weir. The problem with the movie is that we don;t connect enough with any of the characters to really care about what happens to them. The only two individuals i cared about were midshipmen Blakeney and Hollom, while the rest of the cast seemed caricatured. Another problem is that the hero Aubrey is not as charismatic as a fellow character in the same vein by the name of Hornblower. PErharps this is due to the numerous films in that series compared to only one here but we feel every emotion with Hornblower, while with Aubrey, we relate to his as we would relate to our remote, he is just a label (captain)doing his job (leading).

Russel Crowe plays Captain Jack, an old fashioned, hard boiled British captain who gets obsessed with the idea of bringing a French ship down. In the meantime, dozens of misadventures are lived and blood spilled.Sometimes it might feel the movie tries to append many many subplots within the main plot, but I did not find them distracting at all, and they all added dramatism and depth to the characters in the ship. It is weird to see an all male movie though, I can't remember when was the last time I saw one.After I saw the film, I have been trying to persuade my friends and family to see it, but no one seems to believe me this is a great, fun, and exciting movie with adventures from beginning to end and great acting from all people involved.

181,Whythorne,"Beautiful, lovingly crafted film is a visual and audio treat",10,19 May 2008,"""Master and Commander"" was well worthy of its 10 Academy Award nominations. It is rare these days to come across a film that is this intelligently scripted and directed. It is wonderfully subtle, sensitive and powerfully moving at times, occasionally humorous, and yet tense and gripping at other times. The attention to visual and audio detail is incredibly rich and makes owning on DVD well worthwhile. Every time I have watched this I have discovered new details previously unnoticed.I saw this film before I had read any of the Patrick O'Brian books upon which it is based, and I have to give Peter Weir and his crew even more credit after having become familiar with the novels. While the film borrows snippets from several of the books, and is only loosely based on ""The Far Side of the World"", I am extremely impressed with and appreciative of the attention that was paid to the characters' personas and relationships to each other. This film was obviously put together by people who greatly admired and respected O'Brian's creations.Some naysayers here have accused this film of lacking plot, and I have to wonder if they understand what the word means. In addition to the main plot involving the tense and fascinating cat-and-mouse chase between the Surprise and the French privateer, there are various sub-plots involving the relationships between Captain Aubrey and Doctor Maturin as well as the other officers, midshipmen, and rest of the crew. There is something gripping going on in almost every scene, providing plenty of pace to the film.The acting is excellent and the always charismatic Russell Crowe makes a perfect Aubrey in my opinion. The Maturin of the novels is a bit darker character than what is presented in the film, but Paul Bettany does such a wonderful job with the role that that is not even worth a criticism.An excellent soundtrack employing lush, classical music adds to the enjoyment of the film.My only regret is that they don't make nearly enough films of this kind any more...one of my top favorites in our DVD library.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
182,Jose Guilherme,Could have been so much more...,7,2 February 2004,"The film had everything epics need... great scenery... brave leaders... some fighting and a big budget. Still somehow the film fails to deliver. Scenes where you should feel suspense and/or tension... are a bit slow and a bit boring. The action scenes are few and far between.
    I liked the movie... but I gave it a 7 in 10. I know a bit about Naval Warfare and History and so my interest was bigger than the average male moviegoer.     Good points ? Beautiful ships. Really nice work there. Crowe seems a bit awkward as a british captain at first... but convinces us as the movie rolls on. Some of the secondary characters are neat too. The story has its good points... the acting is medium mostly. The battle scenes are a treat too.    With a bit better pacing, acting and story this would have been a great movie. All the right ingredients... but a bit overcooked perhaps ?",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
183,matjusm,Somewhat weak,6,11 February 2005,"During the Napoleonic wars a British warship commanded by Russel Crowe's character is mysteriously attacked by a French warship. The captain who had no idea that this was coming takes it as a blow to his ego and despite the ship and the morale of his men being damaged, decides to go after his newfound nemesis.Seems fun? Not really. The film moves along at a very slow pace and doesn't really manage to truly grab your attention. The characters, though decently acted, are weak with Crowe definitely not giving one of his better performances. He just doesn't have enough things to work with to make himself interesting. Well maybe I can ignore that but what really got on my nerves is that Peter Weir has simply made the whole 138 minute movie into one long stream. The tension, which could have given a lot to the movie is virtually non existent. It makes it seem like being attacked by the most powerful warship in the French navy is no different than having a cup of tea.As for more technical things, it really annoyed me that there was so little music. That too could have added suspense and more life into this dull picture. The cinematography was pretty good, though somewhat difficult to comprehend at times. The ships and costumes of course were excellent and filled with detail. The battle scenes, or what little there was of them were pretty well done but yet again, as seems to be the case with most Hollywood films, confusing and a bit too shaky at parts for one to understand what is going on.All in all not that bad of a film but if you are looking for something along the lines of excitement like Pirates of the Carribbean then this is not your picture.6/10",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
184,ubercommando,It's the detail that counts,9,29 November 2003,"OK, forget what the film leaves out from the book.  O'Brian wrote a 20 novel long saga and the movie takes bits from a few to make this.  O'Brian was never that interested in the plot, but more the human side and the emotional drama and that is what Weir has given us.  I was worried this movie would dumb down the book and leave us with a meat-headed action-fest, but it captures the flavour of O'Brian's canon so well.  The music of Jack and Stephen, the conflict between the warrior and the scientist, but still with the friendship that underpins it.  What also makes this film excellent is the human side to the HMS Surprise:  it's not the ship or the mission that is important, it's the crew...we see the men bond, whether below decks or in the wardroom with the good natured officers.  So many Hollywood movies portray the British as pompous, tea drinking stuffed shirts obsessed with class.  In M&C, they are not mere national stereotypes but men with feelings who show joy, playfulness, devotion to duty, superstition, bravery and deep sadness and remorse.  When characters are killed, we feel their loss and share it with the survivors.  And that's the wonderful subtext to Weir's movie; the human element of a bygone age.  I feel he truly understands O'Brian's work not as nautical potboilers, but as a character study of the men who fought in the age of fighting sail.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
185,JoshSharpe,A slow sea epic,8,30 January 2013,"The idea of life on the sea, living our adventure after adventure, has always fascinated me. This is the first real movie of that nature that I have seen (save ""Pirates of the Caribbean""). The story is of a crew during the Napoleonic Wars that are on a mission to take down another ship. Of course, the other ship has the same orders, resulting in several scenes of cannons damaging said ships. The lead stars, Russell Crowe as the captain and Paul Bettany as the doctor, are a great pair whom you may remember from ""A Beautiful Mind"". The film is well done and realistic. The only downfall is that it is a bit difficult to follow and it is somewhat slow on top of that.

I think it was the tiniest fraction away from becoming one of the greatly regarded movies of our day. It had everything: great cast, superb direction, marvelous action, believable sets, and incredible cinematography. I believe one thing alone held it back, and that was the choice of music.Throughout the movie we have the recurring theme of Crowe's and Bellamy's characters playing stringed duets. Wonderful tho they may be, they are less then stirring, and detract, more then contribute, to the overall atmosphere of the the picture. Had this movie had an original epic musical score to match the epic proportions of the rest of the production, people would still be talking about this movie as one of the greatest of all time.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

189,im_veritas_photo,True to Patrick O'Brian's books,9,29 July 2006,"""Master and Commander"" is Patrick O'Brian's first published seafaring novel featuring the early-1800's characters ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey, a British Navy careerist, and Stephen Maturin, a true Renaissance Man born four centuries too late. There followed nineteen more novels in the series featuring this odd but endearing pair, until O'Brian died in his 86th year.Patrick O'Brian has been described as one of the truly great story-telling writers of modern times. His books certainly bear out that characterization. Read them and you'll see why!The movie is taken from material of several of the early books, but it stitches all that stuff together into a great story standing on its own merit, which rings true to the spirit of the O'Brian sea novels.And the movie has fine casting and acting, and really top-rate cinematography. View it, and you'll see why!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
190,johnfos,Another Masterpiece from Australian Director Peter Weir,9,3 July 2005,"I put this DVD into the player simply looking for some light afternoon entertainment, but instead found a really good movie...The scene for this movie is set rather quickly, as a British frigate (HMS Surprise) captained by ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) is stalked by a larger and faster French warship, in the treacherous seas off South America. The year is 1805.After setting the scene, director Peter Weir concentrates on character development and we get to know Captain Aubrey and some of his crew, and become aware of the friendship (and at times conflict) between the captain and the ship's doctor (Paul Bettany). The other central character is Blakeney (Max Pirkis), a young and likable Midshipman.The story traces the voyage of the HMS Surprise as it sails down the coast of South America, via the picturesque Galapagos Islands, and tension steadily mounts as the movie reaches a climax with the final sea battle.Other excellent movies directed by Australian Peter Weir include Dead Poets Society and The Truman Show.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Why?I saw it with great expectations after reading such raving reviews.Yes, the sea battles are very well executed. Yes, the sound is deserving of an Oscar nomination. And yes, there are some cool scenes in with ships in the fog.BUT, the bottom line is this movie was boring! The story was completely unoriginal. The characters were nothing we haven't seen before. And worse is how they crammed so much completely irrelevant ""fluff"" into the film just to stretch out it's length. (What was the point of the whole Jonah side story?)Russel Crowe is a fine actor, but he was completely wasted in this. The role was absolutely nothing special.I was so bored I almost left the theater!I gave it 4 out of 10, only for some nice visuals and sound.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
192,theguys1,the worst movie of the year!,1,20 July 2005,"There are many things wrong with this movie. First of all, a good story should take into the plot before the first hour rushes by, and there has to be a meaning in a movie that will keep the audience begging for more; not falling asleep in their chairs and snoring louder than the sound of a bullet being shot from a gun. And the bottom line pretty much is that SOMETHING HAS TO HAPPEN IN THE FRICKIN MOVIE!!!!!!!! There is not even 30 seconds of action one minute, and then it's just singing folk songs on the ship and eating slop while celebrating. And worst of all, they make jokes that aren't even funny! I'm sorry to say that to the people that worked 3 years on this movie that it completely sucks and it was a complete waste of their valuable time. I'm not much of a war movie fan, but I know a bad movie when I see one, no matter what genre.

193,mjensen-3,"""One Of The Best Films Of 2003""",9,12 August 2004,"This film reminds me an era when Director's and Producers wanted to make an epic, didn't matter what the cost was, they just wanted to make a good film that both excites you and makes you think. Russell Crowe gives his most daring performance in years, fans of the O'Brien books thought he couldn't do a real man's performance, he was known as dreamy Russell before now. Crowe is not only being compared to Tom Hanks , but compared to the greatest actors of our time, like Tom Cruise and Sean Penn, and now he's being placed in the category of Marlon Brando and Peter O' Toole.  He not only brought back the sandle movies, but now he's bringing back the swash bucklers, wow.THE PLOTThe film is about CPT. Jack Aubrey(known as lucky jack), and his sidekick the doctor(Paul Bettany). They embark on a journey to hunt down an enemy ship, but this isn't the test, this is a journey of finding one's self and coming together to conquer their fears.""Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World"" is an incredible film that will entrance you into the ocean and put you into the minds of the men and CPT. Jack Aubrey. But something is missing, Paul Bettany, he's great in this film but he doesn't have the same intensity that he had in ""A Beautiful Mind"", or maybe he's not sopose to. Even with that flaw, this is still an acheivement, and nothing can stop in the way of the new rein of actors, and I hope to see more of this cast including Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany.I give this film ****(out of 4 stars).",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

You feel for all these people as they deal with the situation and events they find themselves in.What was really amazing is that the enemy is essentially faceless, not given time to be a character, it's all about the crew we're following and their perspective on the battle.This is one if Russell Crowes best performances, and a real surprise from Peter Weir as a director.Highly recommend!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
195,JohnBoyRoy,"Evocative, atmospheric, brilliant...",8,12 April 2004,"This is a film all about atmosphere, authenticity and emotion.In a film climate where audiences are encouraged to view film that have big twists, turns, action sequences or emotional revelation, it is testament to the quality of Master and Commander that it was a box office sucess, despite being all about the essence of being at sea.I admit that I was a sucker for this movie from the very start: my favourite filmic location is probably a boat at night (and there is quite a bit of that in 'Commander) but that was not to say I expected to love the film - I was sceptical about it, in truth.After viewing I was thoroughly convinced of the atmosphere on board a Napoleonic wars battle ship.  I could believe in the actions of the well rounded characters and the brilliant performances from the charistmatic Crowe, and gifted sidekick Paul Bettany.Equally impressive was the way in which Peter Weir crafted the supporting roles of the stereotypical crew members (old sea dog, grumpy cook, true master at arms etc.) without ever being cheesy or false.The cinematography was stunning, with the action scenes cut to perfection. The fact that these scenes are at the unconventional places of beggining and end means the film may be boring to thrill seekers, but lovers of literary film will be well pleased by this; the heightened tension, and the feeling of adventure gained is perfect.The inclusion of the anthropological aspects provides the motivation for the discovery of the French and final battle; a great touch showing that coincidence in life, and the unexpected, is often mutually beneficial once selfishness is discarded - you'll understand when you watch.8/10 A class act.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

I genuinely cannot think of one flaw in this movie. Every scene is perfectly shot. No shot is wasted. Every shot helps tell the story. The score is fantastic, and so are the scenes of Jack and Stephen making music together. The dialogue is some of the best I have heard in a movie, everything someone says is believable, especially for it's time period. The acting is out-of-this-world. Every single actor, no matter how old or young, or important or unimportant to this story, brings their A-game. You really learn to love these characters and share in their triumphs and mourn with them in their losses. You genuinely feel their emotions along with them. The fight scenes are absolutely amazing. Every single character, even the extras have choreographed fights to be doing, so there's never a time in the background where you see two extras doing nothing more than just poking a sword at each other, instead they're fighting just as hard and as much as the main characters, so it truly actually feels as if you are in a battle. Even better, battles have weight. Anyone can actually die, so you are holding your breath to see which of your favorite characters die next. Anyway, seriously, please see this movie. I don't like rewarding movies with perfect scores unless I believe that they genuinely deserve it. This one does. It's as close to perfect as humanely possible.

Jack Aubrey. But will he win another statuette? I don't think it is a lock.The movie is solid in every way, and true to the spirit of Patrick O'Brian's novels, but I don't think it has enough ""mass market"" appeal to be considered a classic over time.I'll compare ""Master and Commander"" to ""Chariots of Fire,"" which won Best Picture without being a true Hollywood blockbuster.What is the film lacking? There is no love interest, let alone sex, even though Aubrey has a clandestine on-land relationship with the wife of a superior officer in O'Brian's first novel. Now that would have spiced things up!And there is no real development of the friendship between Aubrey and Dr. Maturin -- in the book, Aubrey ""discovers"" Maturin and their friendship grows. In the film, you don't get a sense of how these polar-opposite men find their relationship.I'm not trying to be critical -- I had very high hopes for this film -- but I didn't walk out of the theater amazed, just satisfied.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

His partner in this ""theft"" is ship surgeon and naturalist Dr. Stephen Maturin, played by Paul Bettany.  I thought this role would over reach Mr. Bettany's range but I was surprised and really glad to see him reach and show he is truly a dramatic actor of merit.  He and young Perkis are a one two punch that carry the load of a very large and expensive show.The editing is seamless and the special effects are dazzling.

If too many things go wrong they believe they are cursed, or that one person is cursed which is the cause of all their troubles.This is a movie I like to watch every few years. It's just that good.

204,mulhollandman,I can taste the salt water and smell the sea air.,9,25 August 2006,"When Peter Weir took on the mammoth task of adapting two of Patrick O'Brain's novel to make this film, he encountered the same expectations as any writer, producer and director would, especially when the film is guaranteed to be scrutinized by a well established fan base across the world. Not only had the film had it's bedrock fan base it also had the fans of it's two main star attractions. These were Peter Weir and Russell Crowe. The expectation of both of them were huge.Peter Weir had made his name for himself in the mid 1970's and early 1980's by directing some of Australia's finest films such as Picnic at Hanging Rock and Galipoli. He along with Jane Campion, Mel Gibson and Geoffrey Rush be came known as the Australian New Wave. His career in Hollywood blossomed resulting in a C.V. littered with great films amongst them, Witness, Mosquito Coast and Dead Poets Society. His reputation was built on strong, moving story lines of men re-examining their existence through a events out of their control. Master and Commander: The Far side of the World has these very themes running through them. With a career already based on thorough examination of themes Peter Weir was the best person to adapt the novels and produce them for the big screen. Therefore his very best was expected with his film.Russell Crowe's ascension from American B-movies and Australian Independents to Hollywood blockbuster had been nothing short of magnificent. Not only had he the success but in the wake he had left 4 memorable characterizations and three academy Award nominations and one win. But his arrogance and temper proceeded him and lost out on a second Academy Award through an incident at the BAFTA awards. Master and Commander: The Far side of the World was to be his follow up movie to this incident and every one wanted to see if this self proclaimed great actor was in fact a good as he said or would he fall flat on his face. On top of this there was the building pressure to nail the vision Captain Lucky Jack Aubury that the fans of the book had and of course the concept that the Late Patrick O'Brain had personally envisioned.Master and Commander: The Far side of the world tells the story of Captain "" Lucky "" Jack Aubruy, Captain of the H.M.S Surprise and one of the finest naval officers of his times. Assisted by a loyal crew of officers and able seamen, he patrols the seas of the British empire and protecting the Kings ships from Napoleonic attackers. On the Admirals orders Captain Jack must track down The Acheron, a French privateer ship, which is looting British ships. Captain Jack pursues relentlessly pushing his crew to the limit against the advice of ships surgeon and best friend Stephen Maturin. Due to his persistence Aubury runs the risk of losing his crews respect and his friendship with Stephen Maturin. As the intensity builds Captain Jack Aubury must face the prospect of losing for the first time.Weir and Crowe do not disappoint with this film. I found it to be a thoroughly enjoyable film. Weirs direction is flawless and as every bullet flies and cannonballs fly you can believe that you are on the deck with Captain Jack Aubury. He mixes the action with drama with precision and although the action sequences are spread out you never really see them as essential to the storyline until they actually happen. What is great about the storyline is as the chase goes on and the stakes become higher our anxiety grows with the ships crew. This is helped by the cinematography of Russell Boyd his camera work creates a claustophic look at 19th century naval life. His handling of the battle scenes is amazing and the result is that he won an academy award for his trouble.Weir also handles his supporting cast very well there are a few fine performances from the younger crew members, but the under rated performance of Lee Ingleby as the doomed Midshipman Hollom whose ship life existence and fate brings a dark sinister tone to the film. Paul Bettany is also very effective in the role of Stephen Maturin. His character his the voice of reasoning in Jack's ear and his skill as a surgeon amplifies the patience he needs when dealing with Captain Jack Aubury.Russell Crowe is fantastic as Captain Jack Aubury. He captures the essence of Aubury in all his magnificent glory. Underneath the decorated clothes of a celebrated Naval Officer lies a man institutionalized by the navy. Aubury is the Master and Commander of his ship. He knows every plank of wood and every nought in the HMS Surprise. His discussions with Maturin reveal he is a man that has never faced the prospect of failing and in his mind that is not an option and it never will be. He is conservative and very superstitious. All this is down the lifestyle he has chosen to lead. He is not an easy man to reason with as Maturin finds out. Crowe is very subtle in his characterization of Aubury, his manner is pleasant yet he speaks with a firm tone. He is very believable in the role and although it is forgotten about due to the amount a negative press Crowe had received at the time I think in years to come it will be fondly remembered.All in all this film is quality viewing, the worst thing I could say about it is that it can drag at times but other than that it really is worth the watch. 9 out of 10.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

You feel that you are on board The Surprise.  You are a member of the crew.  Paul Bettany as Stephen Maturin and Russell Crowe as Jack Aubrey both play their parts to the hilt.  You know that they are friends.  There are moments of extraordinary tenderness, when after a young midshipman has lost his arm, Jack gives him a biography of Nelson, who had lost his arm also.  You know that Jack feels sorry for the boy but is not maudlin.  There are scenes of brutality, but this is war.  I think Patrick O'Brian would have approved and I hope people will read his novels.

I was in awe of its historical accuracy, and thoroughly captivated by Russell Crowe's performance.Those who carp about the story should probably carp about the book instead. To those who carp about its accuracy, however, I can only infer that they have not served in the Navy and know little of naval history. It is obvious Peter Weir does.The first words uttered by Crowe when he comes on deck in the movie are, ""Where away?"" Those were some of the first words I heard in my young naval service 40 years ago, when I made the mistake of telling the Captain merely that we had a ship on the horizon. ""Where away?"" he fired at me; I looked perplexed. ""Do you allude, Captain, to the transitive verb meaning 'to erode?'"" I smartly replied. He did not find this amusing, and made me ask everyone on the ship what it meant. Fortunately there was an old Chief Signalman who had been around since before Pearl Harbor, who smiled and said, ""I haven't heard that in years,"" and then explained it meant ""What is the relative bearing and range?"" Peter Weir has got it exactly right. And yes, Midshipmen might well be on board a ship at 14-15 years old in those days (17-18 today on a summer cruise between school years), and if it went to ""General Quarters"" as we do today or ""drummed to battle"" as they did then, well, the Middie was just in the thick of it.This is just a wonderful tale, well told, with a nice surprise ending that gives the pleasurable prospect of an equally glorious sequel.

207,MountainMan,"Finally, a movie with a great plot!! The Crowe rules!",10,24 April 2004,"I imagine this is as how an English crew in the early 1800's might really have been.  I really have to congratulate the director and screenplay people for doing a superb job in recreating this fictional account of an English-French sea chase.  The use of really young boys as midshipmen was realistic, since these boys were usually 13 year old and over sons of well-to-do British.  The attention to detail was noticeable.  Not only that, but having a clear knowledge of where the movie was leading to was refreshing.  In the back of your mind you search the horizon, along with the crew of the ship, looking for that elusive ghost French frigate.  It really keeps you interested.  It seems that a lot of movies make the plots too interwoven and abstract.  This one keeps you in suspense right up to the end.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
208,Vash2001,Good but not great,7,1 February 2004,"I can see why this movie got nominated for Best Picture. It is very well made. I read somewhere that they actually built that ship for this movie. The scenary is spectacular and the silences are well placed.  I liked the way Russell Crowe portrayed Jack Aubrey, although I don't think this was a strong enough performance for a best actor nomination.Having said that, I found the movie to be boring in the middle part.  I could feel for the characters- they were very real- but the story itself does not captivate the audience (at least it did not do it for me). The part I liked the most was when the captain ordered the ship to the land, and the doctor and the boy were doing nature research.  Overall it is a very well made movie; I just did not feel it was a great movie.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
209,politicon2003,This Movie is at Sea,2,23 February 2007,"This movie does not seem to really know where it's going. Is it an account of the excruciating naval surgery available on board one of His Majesty's warships in the early nineteenth century, or about pre-Darwin natural history buffs or one man's obsession? The story line is confused and very thin.In the midst of the Napoleonic Wars a Royal Navy commander (Russell Crowe) is ordered by the admiralty to pursue and capture a French naval vessel. Surely the movie might have been more interesting had it focused more on the crew and the motives of the enemy ship as much as was done successfully in both World War II films of ""Sink the Bismarck"" and ""The Battle of the River Plate"". It is a pity with such a good cast that the movie's great potential wasn't realised.Honourable mention should be given to Mike Pirkis ( he was only 14 when the film was made) As Midshipman Blakeney (Pirkis also performed well in the recent HBO TV series ""Rome"" where he had the role of young Gaius Octavius, the future Caesar Augustus. Credit is also due to the stick insect which the Commander mistakes for a twig and the Galapagos beetle not to mention that duck that can't fly. But the two weevils are best forgotten.

It has great sequences that leave you on the edge of your seat, without forgetting the beauty, strategy and photography that reigned in the early 1800's.It is an entertaining period story, where it shows us the maneuvers of a brave and skilled captain of a military ship hunting a rival on the high seas.It has what is always expected of an adventure and heroism film: action sequences, suspense and the perfect amount of humor and drama. Very good special effects, which make you experience a naval battle from two centuries ago. It is a movie made with detail and care in almost every aspect.Making my criticism from the perspective of the spectator who has not read the original saga, it is an excellent film and highly recommended.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

215,dominik96,Discovery Channel as it best,7,4 December 2003,"I expected more of this movie.The script is obvious,hunt down an enemy ship,with no surprises, so they had to put some scenes with Paul Bettany in. Who fullfils the same task as in Beautiful Mind,so Russell`s character can reflect at him. And once again Bettany`s role as Dr.Stephen Maturin is a pain in the ass. He is a talented actor, but his role...... Than we have a brutal scene with the amputation of the little boy`s arm, that we will not forget so fast. Like the scene in AMERICAN HISTORY X, you certainly remember. But for my surprise this is the first and only bloody picture in this movie. I expected a Braveheartlike bloodshed, but they failed on this particular aspect. The rest of the movie is soberseen obvious and would be boring, but the lack of constant nice action and a surprising plot, they make up with a lesson in history. Actually i would say that this movie is a superb documentation of the life on such a ship in this period of time. Discovery Channel couldn`t done it better. So overall i give it a 7,thanks to the history lesson,but the plot is rather a 6 than a 7.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
216,Pickwick12,A Masterful Film,9,20 November 2003,"This may be one of the only times in my life when I say this, but in the case of Master and Commander, the movie is far more engaging than the books. Because I am a nerdy sort, I felt a certain compulsion to at least take a stab at Patrick O'Brian before seeing the film, so I attempted to slog through The Far Side of the World.  It was a harrowing experience!  Anyway, I went ahead to the movie before I finished the book and was pleasantly surprised to find that such a tedious, though well-written, book translated into an entertaining, watchable film. Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany worked well together again, and the characters of Aubrey and Maturin seemed to fit them like a well-tailored coat.  Crowe brought Aubrey to vibrant, intense life, and his performance will not soon be forgotten.  I have heard various complaints about Maturin's inaccuracy to the book.  Granted, I am not a die-hard O'Brian fan, but from what I have read, I feel that Bettany was true to the spirit of the character, if not to the letter.  There is an argument to be made for the fact that certain things on paper may not translate well to film, anyway. In addition, Billy Boyd gets lots of screen time, which only adds to the fun. One of my favorite things about the movie was the authentic portrayal of life on a ship, with its filth, lack of privacy, and genuine camaraderie.  I also enjoyed the all-maleness of the story and the fact that the bonds between the characters were strong though not overly emotionalized. I found this movie to be highly suspenseful and very exciting.  I have heard a lot of complaints about it being boring, though.  I would simply say that it is not for everyone.  The more literary a person is, the more likely he or she will be to enjoy it.  I will definitely see Master and Commander again and savor its cinematic beauty, exciting story, and superb acting. See it.  I dare you!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
217,bobsteimle,Great acting and a wonderful script,10,8 July 2005,"When they are first attacked in the beginning of the movie, I thought I was really under attack. I had never seen such great special effects in a real movie. I've come to expect great explosions in science fiction films, where we don't really know what it would actually look like, but this was real. I saw cannonballs ripping the ship into slivers right in front of me. And the people who were hurt were real people, not some gory monsters from a horror film. What I'm saying is that real people, saying things that they would really say, can make the special effects even more stunning.But this movie is not about effects. It's about a captain's quest for revenge and a scientist's quest for knowledge, and the beauty of the relationship between them. There are virtually no women in this movie, and only one joke. But the movie is enthralling. The emotion is real and raw, and the dialog is fantastic. The suspension of my disbelief was complete in this film. The acting is perfect. The people are so real that I felt I actually knew them, and cared about them very much. I feel almost as though I was in the movie. How great is that? I thought it was the best movie of the year.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
218,stephen7272,Finally a historical war movie with no Americans in it,9,4 January 2016,"I laughed my socks off at some of the negative reviews of this film but I can understand why a fan of say Pirates Of The Caribbean might find this a bit dull in comparison.This is the Royal Navy old chap, stiff upper lip with understated British emotion, other than when Frenchie is off the port bow.I think I really enjoyed this film purely for the fact that so few movies are made these days about the British Empire and the Royal Navy. Those that have included them usually show them in a negative light as either the baddies or incompetent such as in The Patriot. This movie returns to the tradition of movies like Zulu, showing the British serviceman as a gallant fellow fighting for what they believe in. Okay it's not perfect, the editing is too choppy for me, but as an Englishman and with so few movies made of this genre these days its hard not to embrace it.For those who don't understand the historical relevance, there's clearly a tie in with Paul Bettany's character and the trip made by Darwin on the Beagle to the Galapagos islands to fine tune his book the Origins Of Species. Without that information the viewer might wonder why the obsession with visiting those islands in the movie.A sequel would have been wonderful but alas probably won't happen. A modern version of Sink The Bismark would be wonderful but alas, once again, probably won't happen. Shame. I suppose we'll just have to make do with movies about fantasy pirates and over the top military escapades with the US Navy such as Battleship.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

I found this movie to be above the standard old sea battle period piece...in fact, I found this movie to be outstanding at presenting life aboard an HMS at the turn of the 19th Century. I found the sea battles extraordinary in their accuracy and the storyline of Lucky Jack to be very interesting telling, indeed. This movie will play on the small screen as well as the theater..but I recommend catching it in the theaters if you can to get the grand scope.

222,vinnieboards,"History, explosions, Vaughan Williams - what more do you want?",10,17 September 2010,"As a Brit with an interest in History, this film had instant appeal to me and I looked forward to it. I'm not a big fan of Russell Crowe the person but as an actor, he is without doubt one of the best of his generation.And so it proved. The attention to historical detail is captivating. Some people may not understand the plot about the Officer who commits suicide because the crew thinks he has evoked a curse on the ship. But during the Napolenic Wars, naval crews gave much attention to folklore and superstition and were constantly looking for symbolic events that dictated positive change. Likewise crews were always on the lookout for someone or something to blame when the tide or winds were against.The claustrophobic and squalid nature of life below deck compared with the relative luxury and decadence of the Captains cabin is very accurate. But what takes the film to another level is the relationship between Crowe and Bettany - one a dynamic leader with total focus on the task in hand, the other, an academic with a humanitarian heart. Socially and intellectually they are poles apart and yet are best friends. Crowe has to wrestle with his own conscience when his friend has a near death experience. An historical epic and buddy movie rolled into one.The cat and mouse chase across the Southern Atlantic and round the Cape is fabulous. The battle scenes are brutal and exhilarating. But for me, the soundtrack was the clincher. Using Fantasia from a Theme of Thomas Tallis by Ralph Vaughan Williams provides one of the greatest movie soundtracks in living memory. How fitting that a classical music masterpiece is used in an historical masterpiece.Brilliant stuff!!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
223,Reviewer746,Perhaps the Most Beautiful Film of the 2000's,10,13 August 2015,It is a travesty that this film isn't at least 8 stars on IMDb. Master and Commander is an incredible adventure story and arguably the most beautiful movie filmed in the first decade of the 21st century.The cinematography is beyond exceptional and the score is simply inspired. This is hands down the best movie every made without a single female actress (barring a 3 second scene off the coast of Brazil).Obviously the novels provide more backstory and much more nautical detail (so much to the point of being tedious) but the film approaches the tale from a completely different perspective. This is a work of art. This is what CGI should be used for in modern films.,Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
224,rumbleinthejungle,Good lord..... can Peter Weir ever direct!,9,20 February 2010,"Incredible. I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen and it was a great experience that I'll always treasure. Unfortunately, it was released at the same time as Return of the King and inevitably that film stole the limelight and steered the critics attention away somewhat. As an adaptation - this film is brilliant. You might be forgiven for thinking that, this being a period epic, there will be lots of talking and little action. On the contrary. Weir throws the viewer straight into the deep end with an early confrontation between the Surprise and the Acheron. The wide shots are simply incredible to behold - an early one of both ships firing broadsides just looks amazing. Crowe is in top form here as the proud Captain Jack Aubrey - a man who is in danger of letting his pursuit of the French Man O War Acheron become an intensely personal vendetta and steering his crew through ever perilous waters. Paul Bettany is his intellectual foil as the Irish doctor Stephen Maturin - a great role for Bettany and the chemistry between the two is palpable. The music and script are great and the casting is just top notch; the scenes of the Officer's eating in the great cabin are some of the most memorable ones in the film. As others have mentioned, the attention that Weir has given to period correct detail is amazing. The film is a piece of art as much as it is a boys own naval adventure.Highly recommended.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
225,wrudd,"Good, not great",8,15 November 2003,"I have read all 20 of the books more than once and so was very much looking forward to this film.  Over all it is good, but it's not an action movie and if you go expecting that you could be disappointed.  It's more about the way of life aboard a British warship in 1805. I think it does help if you have read the books. The actors did a good job, great camera work. It's got so much packed into it it's the type of movie you have to see more than once to catch everything and understand who is who.  Overall I do recommend it.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
226,superscal23,Huge Disappointment,4,23 December 2004,"Peter Weir is a fantastic director. Russell Crowe is a wonderful actor. Paul Bettany is on his way to being one. Master and Commander is a useless and pointless movie.My thoughts about this film going into it were that I'd get to see two hours of action and adventure on the high seas. Well, unfortunately I was right. That's all this movie is. Nothing happens for two hours.Yes, they fight some battles. Yes, some important characters have dramatic deaths. Yes, there are some quiet scenes between the Captain and his friend talking about what it all means. The problem is, I didn't care about any of these things. Even though the cinematography is wonderful, the movie does a terrible job of engaging the viewer as part of the story. We are watching dull Englishmen duke it out with unseen Frenchmen. I find it interesting that, in the current political climate, a movie that celebrates thousands of Frenchmen being murdered simply for being French was so well received.Crowe's performance is not even in the same galaxy, or solar system, or whatever, as his performance in Gladiator. There's not much character to Captain Aubrey. His mean both fear and respect him...wow, that's interesting. He plays the violin...even better. His best friend is the ship's doctor, and they confide in each other....are you trembling with excitement yet? Me neither.Paul Bettany's performance is good, I guess, but how interesting is a doctor who is more interested in bugs than he is in his patients? Seriously..his character spends the whole movie worrying about bugs. That is, when he's not getting accidentally shot, in what is the movies' strangest and silliest moment.As I mentioned, the climax of the film involves a battle with a French ship. If you're waiting for the wily hard working Captain to come up with one last heart felt plan to save his ship and defeat his El Guapo, you're watching the wrong film. His idea is to not act like a British Naval Ship. He actually tells his men that. They don't put up their flag. That's Aubrey's big idea. Without a flag to distinguish themselves as British, the French ship is not prepared for an attack. Apparently, the French thought these guys were just coming to hang out for awhile. After all, they don't have a flag.There are countless films that are entertaining enough to stand on their own in spite of any problems there may be with the plot. I never thought that a best picture nominee starring Russell Crowe and directed by Peter Weir would NOT be one of those films.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Then Peter Weir appears out of nowhere! -In his best film since Dead Poets Society. But what worries me is that Master and Commander is yet another film based on earlier books, like Dead Poets Society. Could it be possible that Weir gets his hands on a real script that hasn't been a book, it is then we may discover the further talent he may have. Without books, The Truman show was an exceptional movieMaster and Commander, Pirates of the Car( what ever) Is the `pirate' genre back?Probably, but what do I know I'm just typing to my self. I'm not going to outline the storyline for you, coz imdb has it all. Crowe plays the captain of the ship, who is often referred to by his first name Jack Aubrey by his crew. We can see by this that the crew are closely bonded lads, but tragedy will strike For these men on the sea, only one thing is worth more to them than grog, women  The film mixes a few jokes on the matter. All though Russell Crowe said in `A Beautiful Mind' he wasn't going to shoot anyone, he sure does in the final battle sequence of MaC. The movie has excellent battle scenes, short, but correctly done. This isn't a Non stop Naval battle movie with pointless action sequences, the film lets you bond with your crew before they die in battle, successfully making you be a part of the movie.8/10",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
228,rdambroso,Not bad..Crowe did a good job,7,26 September 2005,"I had fairly low expectations for this movie. Russel Crowe seems to be trying hard to join the weirdo Hollywood film star clique these days. This movie was surprisingly good though. I never had the emotional attachment to it that I got with gladiator, but it was well acted. The story was a little choppy in spots, but overall it flowed good. I don't consider this a spoiler..if you are into sailing, and sailboats, this is a very interesting movie from a technical standpoint. If you've ever considered sailing off into the sunset for adventure, this movie will feed that part of your psyche. Really not a bad job at all.

Do they all have to look like Ethan Hawke?  In a way, it kind of figures.  Director Weir directed Dead Poets' Society.I have to say, though, that Russell Crowe made a better ship's captain than Robin Williams would have.Seriously, did anyone on this side of the pond understand the dialogue?  I watched at home and played and re-played certain scenes so I could make some sense of the dialogue.  At times, I thought I was watching Darby O'Gill and the Little People.  I expected Little Max to exclaim, ""I am King Brian of Knocknasheega!""  Even so, it was a good movie, and it accurately depicted two-thirds rum and the lash) of what life in the Royal Navy was like (omitting, happily, the other third:  sodomy).  The cinematography is superb.  The attention to detail, especially the uniforms and weaponry, is likewise superb.  I thought there was fairly good character development between the Captain and the Surgeon, but it isn't clear why the cultivated midshipmen aren't back at Rugby enjoying a scrum.It's pointless to nitpick.

230,conono,Cure for Insomnia,2,22 November 2003,"As a big fan of Peter Weir since ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"", I was shocked to discover that the creators of ""Master and Commander"" had neglected to give us a story or even characters to care about.  This is one of the most boring films ever made.  I went because of the effusive praise in the Washington and New York papers, and learned my lesson.  My friends wanted to walk out but I made them stay until well into the second hour, when I finally gave in.  Technically, the film is well-made.  But that's it.  You've been warned!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
231,sinomatictool,A jolly-good time,10,14 November 2003,"A fascinating film that would only bore(the common critics complaint) if you went seeking the typical Hollywood swashbuckler. This film is much more rooted in reality and true history. It is full of a light-hearted humor and eloquent fiddle music. Russel Crowe has again brought to the table all he has to offer and it shows. He leads the strong cast(which contains a surprising strong link in a child) with his sea-toughened charm and leadership. Bettany also shined with easily his best performance of his career. An admirable job. I think that the reason this film could be considered boring is that the reviewer went into it under the wrong impression. It is a very scantly plotted film. There is not much to it. It is really just a series of events, cause and effect. The plot, if there is even such a literal thing, would be Aubrey, a British captain in 1808, is on chase with a french ship which recently attacked it aided by the element of surprise. But the film does end up much more then that and as I said its the series of events that dictate this. The battle scenes on the sea are unparralled. The effects blend wonderfully in with reality. This all creates arousing battles which hold the attention and excite the heart. Master and Commander is highly reccommended as a contemplative yet occasionally thrilling nautical adventure.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
232,tipplerunkus,A masterpiece of adventure filmmaking.,10,7 April 2004,"While Peter Weir's adaptation of Patrick O'Bian's superb novels strays from the source material, combining multiple novels into one, along with some material of it's own invention, it brillaintly captures the spirit of the books. Let's remember that there are 17 Aubrey/Maturin novels - Filming al of them ala Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" would have been absurdly impractical, if not downright impossible. I believe this film gives you a better sense of the overall series than simply doing a straightoforward adaptation of ""Master and Commander"" (the first novel) would have, and simply doing a completely straightfoward adaptation of ""The Far Side of the World"" (the tenth novel) may have been too confusing to audiences.Crowe and Bettany are excellent in their respective roles. Crowe IS the Captain Jack Aubrey of O'Brian's novels come to life, in every respect. Bettany may not look like O'Brian's description of Stephen Maturin, but I can't imagine another actor capturing the soul of the character so well.Weir's direction is flawless - who knew we was as good with action as with characters?Patrick O'Brian wrote some of the greatest adventure novels ever put on paper, and Peter Weir turned them into one of the greatest adventure movies ever put on film.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
233,sdillon-1,An absolute must for history and navy buffs,8,1 December 2003,"Peter Weir is the most underrated director working today. He has shown consistent brilliance from such early masterpieces as Picnic at Hanging Rock and Gallipoli to later works like The Mosquito Coast and Fearless. Weir has managed to coax several career best turns from his lead actors, such as Harrison Ford, Robin Williams, and Jim Carrey. He should have won an Oscar by now (criminally overlooked for Witness, Dead Poets Society and The Truman Show). The recurrent theme in his work is isolation, whether on an Amish farm, in a repressive boys preparatory school, in a reality TV show, or, in the case of his latest film, in the early nineteenth century Royal Navy.
Master and Commander: The Far side of the world is based on a series of Hornbloweresque novels. I've never read them, but the film is a remarkable work. Despite not being an expert on naval warfare, I understand this to be the most accurate depiction of life at sea circa 1805 ever put on screen. The crew, led by the wildly heroic Jack Aubery (Russell Crowe) act, dress and speak exactly as they would have done, to often incomprehensible effect on a modern audience. The most shocking aspect of this accuracy is how many of the crew are young boys, and some of them officers having to face harrowing and bloody naval battles.  By contrast, the enemy isn't depicted at all, one of the great strengths of the film. The action stays entirely with the protagonists on their ship increasing the claustrophobia and tension of the plot.
French vessel Acheron ambushes HMS Surprise in the opening scenes (showing, again with great accuracy, how difficult it is to actually sink a ship). Aubery and his crew narrowly escape. After fixing up the ship, instead of returning to port, Aubrey decides to pursue the Acheron around Cape Horn and go on the offensive. This puts strain on his friendship with ships surgeon Dr Steven Maturin (Paul Bettany) who believes he is pursuing the French vessel out of pride, putting the crew at unnecessary risk.
But this is no Mutiny on the Bounty. Although the relationship between Aubrey and Maturin at first seems to have William Bligh/Fletcher Christian overtones, this later proves false. This is a far more intelligent and clever film than it first appears, with unusual complexity in its depiction of heroism, what makes a great leader and the human cost of war. Aubrey is not a tyrant, but neither is he entirely rational. He is heroic but flawed. By contrast, Maturin is warm and kind, simmering with righteous indignation, but not always the voice of reason he likes to think he is.
Towards the middle, the film bogs down somewhat under the weight of its many subplots, particularly in the sequences around the Galapagos islands. However, the film returns to form for a splendid and exciting finish, which I won't spoil here. 
The cast are excellent, with Crowe never better. Paul Bettany is also very good. The cinematography is absolutely stunning (this film has to be seen on a big screen). The opening alone is worthy of admission price as Aubrey stares into the fog and sees the silent red glow from the cannons of the French ship in hiding. He yells for the crew to get down as cannon balls whizz overhead and strike the Surprise to terrifying effect. Special effects, music and sound are all very good too.
All in all this is highly recommended to anyone with a serious interest in cinema, and an absolute must for history and navy buffs. Another to add to the list of the years ten best films and almost certain to be Oscar nominated.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
234,xaggurat,I wish they'd make a dozen of sequels,10,19 May 2005,"Peter Weir has directed a bunch of will-be-Oscar-nominated movies. For me, this is not a merit for a filmmaker, since Oscar-dramas are usually 95% of entertainment, which by itself isn't interesting. His style is very compromising and clean, you are not surprised by originality, but you can enjoy the professional touch he has in his work.Another Australian, Russell Crowe is also a professional, but has some weak points in his acting, mainly caused by certain machismo he desperately tries to maintain in all his characters.Rest of the cast was unfamiliar to me and I had not read any Patrick O'Brian books. But the sea itself, tall ships and the Napoleonic Wars are of course great elements to base the story on, especially for a amateur war historian and summertime sailor like me.I was surprised, how truly good Master and Commander was. A true adventure! I enjoyed the whole film and could not find anything I wouldn't like. Things were different in back then and Master and Commander presents its version of the Napoleonic Era. It looks very rich and detailed. Undoubtedly O'Brian novels form a fine background for the excellent screenplay. Soundtrack is very well done too, and musical scenes with Aubrey and Maturin playing duet with violin and cello ties their friendship. One of the best things in Master and Commander is the heartwarming friendship between these two characters.It's like Weir and Crowe were born and trained to do this movie. And obviously I have born to watch it, since I've seen it five times so far. A perfect jewel of its kind. Oh, how I wish they'd make a dozen of sequels, especially since the end was sort of open and had a sense of continuation. If I had watched this movie when I was 12 I probably would have had a career in the navy...",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
235,hotfrederick,"Peter Weir is a terrific director, but this is nowhere as deep as his usual films",4,5 May 2009,"I am writing this while i am still watching the movie, which, I guess, explains enough what I think about it.Peter Weir is one of the best directors I have ever seen. His movies are almost always profound. He is an incredible thinker. I wish I could meet the guy one day and have a good chat over coffee.I see his detail in M&C, but not the story. His story telling is not to the level I anticipate from him. I can only blame the script. Still, I know that life on the ocean is tough, and God knows how humans handled it then. It's a very hard life, and we have a lot to respect such people for. Perhaps this is Peter Weir's point. Given a different source, and perhaps some freedom, I am sure he would have done much better. It does help when scripts are not very obvious.For the record, ocean sailing is not easy. To think what we carry in vessels is nothing to what they dealt with. Mini cities.The ocean is a very alien space for people. When it's peaceful, it's a amazing, and when she's wild, batten down, stay on deck, and hang on.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Everything about this film is first class..... acting, storyline, music, sound, special effects, visual beauty, etc. etc. but what really makes this film by far and away the best seafaring film (maybe the best film) ever is 'AUTHENTICITY'. Brian Lavery, Curator of Naval History at the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich was the Naval Adviser for this work of art, and it shows. You only have to read Lavery's ""Nelson's Fleet at Trafalgar"" published by the National Maritime Museum, to see how realistic this movie is, and how well a film can be made. I cannot think of one fault, neither can I think of any way it could have been improved. This is Film making at it's best!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

It has incredible hand to hand, canon to canon battle scenes, set in 1805. The raw violence is juxtapositioned with the English Captain (Crowe) maneuvering his ship like a chess piece to outfox his rarely seen French opponent, while he and doctor spend their evenings playing the violin and cello music of Mozart and J.S. Bach.Master was filmed with full scale replicas. It was nominated for Best: Art Direction-Set Decoration, Costume Design, Director, Editing, Makeup, Picture, Sound Mixing and Visual Effects. It won Oscars for Best Cinematography and Sound Editing. Crowe did most of the violin playing on camera, but the cello playing is Yo Yo Ma's work. The soundtrack is available from Decca (ASIN: B0000DG07D).Bettany is best known as the sick Silas in The Da Vinci Code and the charming Chaucer, with Heath Ledger in A Knight's Tale.Master was directed by Petter Weir, who has remarkable writing and directing credits: The Truman Show, Dead Poets Society, Witness, The Year of Living Dangerously and Gallipoli (another great war movie).",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

If only every big budget historical spectacle could have half of this movie wit and intelligence.One of the best things about Master and Commander is that the action scenes, while spectacular, are the least interesting parts of the movie. It's the conversations between the characters that hold my interest the most. I found myself wanting less action and more of Russel Crowe and Paul Bettany sitting there talking. The characters are truly the main point, not the epic sweep.

241,Axel-9,"Highly recommended viewing, both gripping and educating",9,29 November 2003,"There is a line in Master and Commander, uttered by Russell Crowe's Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey, to his friend and Ship's doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) who is setting off an an expedition of the Galapagos Islands (the movie's one sojourn on land), where he asks for a plant to be named after himself, ""one that is prickly and difficult to eradicate"". It's a nice exchange between the two men, and seems apt, in that it sums up Aubrey . This is a ship's captain after all who has taken his men on a voyage across to the far side of the world, chasing what seems to be his own Moby Dick, a French frigate the Acheron, which he has been assigned to stop from taking the war across the world. The film opens with Aubrey's ship HMS Surprise taking a pummelling from the French, but having managed to evade this attack he sets of in pursuit for the rest of the film.This is absolutely cracking stuff. The aforementioned opening salvo is so realistic I thought I was there, each cannon blast ear shatteringly authentic. Proceedings settle down thereafter, with time given for characters to come to life. As well as Aubrey and Maturin, there is the second in command Tom Pullings and the midshipmen Callamy, Hollum and the excellent Max Pirkis as Blakeney, as well as numerous sea dogs (including Hobbit Billy Boyd as the coxswain), too numerous though I'm afraid for me to remember them all. We are treated to a feel of what life on board must've been like, with all concerned interacting wonderfully with each other. Aubrey is always in command though, and Crowe portrays him as strong and at times authoritarian, a man who doesn't lie down and say no. His relationship with Maturin is crucial, and Bettany provides a perfect foil. A smart man of science, who is our view into this hard world. The first scene of the two of them playing their violin and cello together, is almost ironic. One of the movie's best scenes has the two of them discussing whether or not they should be continuing the chase, and it's well played by both men.This is genuinely classy stuff. It's inevitable that comparisons will be made to the other sea-faring movie of the year, Pirates of the Caribbean, but it's not vaguely in the same class, and face it, if the pirates had been up against Aubrey he'd have sunk them in the first five minutes of the movie. I don't like to compare when they are so different though, but if it's authenticity you seek, and the feel of what it was like to be in the British Navy circa 1805, Master and Commander is the film for you.Hmmm, lemme see, I'd give it 9/10.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
242,BodyDoubleFilms,Good History,6,1 December 2003,"Some of this film was done very well, particularly the opening 15 - 20 mins. I was hoping for a Das Boot gripper, but after the opening, it didn't really deliver, except as an education into life in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic wars. Maybe readers of Patrick O'Brian will say that's exactly what the books are so we shouldn't expect anything else. I don't know. Considering the story made a point of the hardships a 18th-19th century sailer had to suffer at sea, I expected the men to be tough and gritty, no nonsense types. But unfortunately they were no more than the old stereotypes we are used to seeing in any movie made about sailors of wooden ships made in the last 100 years. The end came as a bit of anti-climax, as it all ended so quickly and easily. This movie is essentially about one ship chasing another ship, but the motivation for the chase lacked weight. There didn't seem to be any great reason for them to be after this ship, apart from the captain saying they had to. The film would have benefited going deeper into the psychology of the captain as he becomes obsessed with defeating the French ship, creating more conflict with his fellow sailors as he risks their lives for his own personal desire to win. What we get here is a cardboard cutout of a heroic captain from some kind of 1950s comic book. But maybe that's what Patrick O'Brian's books are like.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
243,humpback,very much worth it,10,29 November 2003,"To start off - thanks, Peter Weir ! Thanks -  first and foremost for not turning this masterpiece into yet another inane action slugfest for the 'attention deficit disordered' crowds. Thanks for sticking to detail, flavour and authenticity, a considered pace, smart dialogue and a glance at a world when the ""far side"" of the globe really was half a world (and months of travel) away !'nuff said As for the movie, this is _not_ another action slugfest with wild explosions, high-paced chases (the ""chase""  here takes place at a leisurely 12 knots, app 20km/h or 14mph ), wire Kung-fu melees (cutlass, axes and pikes anyone ? ) and skipping over the (sometimes high) price of victories won. If you want slick battles and heroic antics, look elsewhere. With a grand 150 minutes running time both the actors and the setting have enough time to establish themselves in telling the deceptively simple story (guess what - it is not, but many of the turns and twists are happening within the narrow confines and among the crew of a man-o-war) of the frigate ""HMS Surprise""s stubborn chase of a much larger French privateer around Cape Horn and far out into the great pacific ocean - transmitting a very accurate feel of the ""why""s ""how""s and ""where""s of the story, with a plethora of subplots, plenty of nods to the ""Aubrey/Maturin"" series by Patick O'Brian ( who, I guess will not rotate utterly disgusted in his grave, even though they really hashed up his series' original plot - which was to be expected), scenes to make you flinch (19th century onboard surgery makes one truly thankful for modern painkillers) and a lot of very british humour - at times bawdy and old fashioned, but great fun nevertheless.Of course - the more history you know, the funnier and engrossing this movie gets, and I suspect readers of O'Brians novels of having a clear advantage - yet my ""not-so-book-wormish female companion"" had an excellent time and enjoyed herself immensely - at least she suggested seeing the movie again a few days hence ( This might have been due to Mr Crowe, though ). So I guess the story-telling is engrossing and concise enough - at least if you can stand five minutes screentime without yet another blazing gun-fight or massive explosions. And when the battles occur, they hit you full force - no punches pulled, just utter mayhem, violence and destruction. As for the precise, detailed and authentic outfitting, the ships themselves, the depiction of storms, damages and high seas and the long slow passages of sailing - breathtaking.The acting is solid to exceptional - Russel Crowe is the perfect choice for beefy, large bodied and physical Jack Aubrey, and Paul Bettany does wonders as his academic (read - frustrated naturalist and philosopher ) friend, conversational foil and resident genius ship's surgeon, Stephen Maturin.The same holds true for the supporting cast who bring the sailors and officers of the ""Surprise"" to vivid life, especially James D'Arcy ( Tom Pullings), George Innes ( Plaice), David Threllfall (Killick ) and Max Pirkis (Lord Blakenley ), often by subtle acting in the background or with short comments. Kudos must go to Director Peter Weir for pulling this of - especially as the crew is clad in drab, tattered naval uniformity - and gets few distinctive lines besides ""yessir"". To judge just how hard this can be, go watch ""Blackhawk Down""..... you live with them, you suffer with them, you know their habits and faults. No higher praise could be expected. The camerawork is good, with some great, moody shots and the soundtrack is acceptable, softly underscoring the events, but nothing very distinct, the movies only serious shortcoming, IMHO. The short interludes of classical music being played by the actors do not distract or grate either - lucky us.Certainly one of the top three movies this year - miss at your own displeasure !nine out of ten salvoes from me",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Well it ain't so, and these are the ones for whom the sacrifice of a life lived for country, and the timeless truths of virtue under fire, friendship born of suffering, and something bigger than yourself - are not real.

246,shinymc_shine,Well Worth The Wait For Weir,8,20 January 2004,"Peter Weir's ""Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World"" is a great adventure epic, beautifully photographed with a fine eye for period detail.The film follows Captain ""Lucky"" Jack and his crew who have been sent to capture a French Superfrigate during the Napoleonic Wars.Russell Crowe is perfectly cast in the lead as an arrogant but likeable leader who's both warrior and thinker. Even though Crowe won the Academy Award for Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"", in the coming years this performance will be known as his signature piece. Paul Bettany, unrecognizable as always, is Crowe's opposite in a quite, never showy but strong performance. The other cast are as great as the leads especially the younger actors.Everything about this film looks authentic. It has a documentary feel as though you were watching real people in real situations during those times. There are moments of great humour throughout which helps the film to be more accessible to a modern audience. The cinematography is strikingly beautiful and never at any point can you say for sure what is a model and what is a computer generated visual effect. The scenes filmed at the Galapagos Islands is a little disappointing visually but interesting in a nature special kind of way.This is an all out man's film filled to the brim with testosterone but it also has a gentle side to it. A man's film does not necessarily mean its just fighting and bloodshed. There are themes of loyalty, honour, comradeship and unfortunately fear. Phobias and superstitions thrived during these times and as shown in the film they sometimes have dire consequences.Weir should be commended for bringing this story to the screen. It's an old fashioned film with cutting edge visual effects that never overshadows the brilliant cast. It's not yet known whether this will be the first of many to come as this film is based on a series of novels. Personally I would like to see more of these characters and if they're done with the same enthusiasm and perfectionism as this one, then I would whole heartedly stand in line for the next one.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
247,Mengedegna,"Best sea yarn since ""Das Boot""",7,13 January 2004,"Weir's finest work since `Gallipoli' twenty-odd years ago.  The great virtue of the screenplay (for which Weir is co-credited) is to eschew open perspectives and broad canvasses (à la Mutinies on the Bounty or even the Hollyowoodian `Moby Dick') and to focus on the hermetic world of the ship and its crew.  In this, the cinematic model is self-evidently Wolfgang Peterson's `Das Boot' (which appeared, like `Gallipoli' in 1981, making it a good year for lucid war movies): throw a group of boys and men more or less willingly into a closed world, put a charismatic (but not insensitive) alpha male in charge, and turn them loose to kill or be killed within the most technically demanding, unforgiving framework, where your captain's brilliance and good luck may allow you to live another day and have the thrill of sinking (or seizing) another enemy, but where the ultimate outcome must always be the same.  Davie Jones rules.The film lacks the unflinching rigor of ""Das Boot"" - there are some ponderous (and not always intelligible) prophetical mutterings about Jonah among the crew, we make a stop in the Galapagos, there to be treated to some insipid proto-Darwinian  reflections (with Bach on the soundtrack, to add gravitas), and all the rule-Britannia jingoism (and gratuitous anti-French digs: the enemy, an American privateer in O'Brian's original, becomes effete and Bonapartist just in time for the 2004 Oscars) gets to be a bit much (though it's probably authentic enough: `This ship is England!').  Weir and his fellow Aussie Russell Crowe can hardly have gone through all that without shoving their tongues well into their cheeks (or at least biting them badly): `Gallipoli' was, of course, precisely about just how mindlessly deadly such jingoism can be.   Also, the substance and subtlety of the Aubrey/Maturin friendship, so central to O'Brian's fiction, somehow eludes Weir's and his actors' efforts, however sincere.  But the evocation of shipboard life in the grand epoch of the Royal Navy is as convincing as you can get, and the power of that evocation carries all quibbles before it, like a warship surging ahead under full sail.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
248,MovieMan1975,Aargh Matey! Ahoy and swab the poop deck!!,10,9 March 2005,"A fantastic piece of film-making. Authentic, exciting, well-acted, with incredible production values. Definitely one of the internationally top 300 films of all time.I have seen the last 9 Peter Weir films and all of them have not been less than impressive achievements in cinema. He proves himself with every film and this once certainly ranks amongst his best. He has shown to be one of the best ""well-rounded"" directors ever - no particular style or genre recognition, but a mastery of the essentials: character, story, scene, sound, and picture. In essence, flawless film-making.Master and Commander is an astoundingly well cast film. Russell Crowe as the stoic, heroic, staid, foxy Capt Lucky Jack. He fits the role like a glove and chews through the role like Brando in The Bounty or George C Scott in Patton. Chris Rock at the 2005 Oscar made a profound statement (in the form of chicanery of course) when he said that historic epics should not be cast without Crowe in the lead role. How absolutely true that is. Even though his tour-de-force performance was in Michael Mann's stylized chamber drama The Insider, Russell Crowe is on the straight path to be being forever typecast as the ""gladiator-like hero"". He fits that role perfectly - the role of a character that has been the favourite of movie viewers for generations - the historic hero. From Chuck Heston in Ben-Hur and El Cid to Brando in Julius Caesar to Richard Burton in Becket to Kirk Douglas in Spartacus to John Wayne in The Alamo to Ben Kingsley in Gandhi to Denzel Washington in Glory to Mel Gibson in Braveheart to Crowe in Gladiator; and so it will continue for as long as cinema exists. And at this phase, Russell Crowe seems destined to take that role to the peak, he was born to be this type of movie star. The rest of the cast is equally well-cast, with the exception of Paul Bettany as the ship's doctor, who sometimes cannot hold his own in scenes with Crowe and allows himself to be overshadowed. The smaller supporting roles of the ship's crew is also cast with actors who seemed to truly have come from a ship - weathered and grimy and full o' pee and vinegar. Of particular note is the characters of the midshipmen, the youngest of the crew. These children belong to aristocracy and are sent on the ship as part of an education experience. The young actors chosen are simply amazing. Child actors are very risky, with great potential of being the all too evil ""precocious"" or ""cute"". These kids managed to play kids, yet show amazing maturity, ability for insight, leadership and at the climax - heroism. I was quite impressed. Nothing cheezy or corny here..As far as the production goes, rarely is this much attention to detail displayed in cinema. You can almost smell the hemp of the ropes as they squeak, or feel the ship sway in the ocean. Peter Weir has given us a wonderful action filled historic aqua-epic.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

250,parsleylion,reasonableish oldie worldie sailing flick,7,15 April 2004,"I gave this 7 out of 10. Good on far side of the world poor on master and commander. It's got great production and looks well. The characters are interesting if a little jumbled up and sometimes too slightly drawn. The music is good and the theme, Napoleonic era sea chase from south Atlantic to Pacific Ocean of underdog English ship verses French super-frigate is attention grabbing. Where it lacked a little in strength was the central character of Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe's character) who as a master and commander I did not believe, the portrayal beats stiff upper lip but I never got the sense that Aubrey would have you keyhauled if you sneezed out of place which is the mark of a true master of discipline. I found Paul Bettany's character, Stephen Maturin, (very Irish name that) as the Irish doctor with a hobby of natural history and cello playing more realistic, also his role proped up Aubrey rather than merely supporting. The script was a bit weak on the captains character but strong on event and happening and it keeps ones interest. I found the incident of the midshipman Hollom badly handled and unrealistic. The crew were all too clean, pale skinned, soft and pudgy to be early nineteenth century sailors and with all their pearly white teeth and educated english stank of poor realism which is what the Captain needed to offset his rather relaxed approach to running a ship crewed by the unfortunate, pressganged and criminal. Pardon the pun, there was some hardship, but the abscence of scurvy and deaths from disease and so on gave the impression of a bunch of actors on an adventure holiday, I just couldn't take it seriously. Might impress the 12 year olds its aimed at but my advice to them is to read books if you want to become a proper master and commander. Better movies are from the 1930's and so on like Gregory Peck as Captain Ahab in 1956 Moby Dick or Charles Lawton as Captain Bligh and Clarke Gable his alter-ego in Fletcher Christian,in Mutiny on the Bounty in 1935. Gregory Peck in Captain Horatio Hornblower, 1951, Burt Lancaster as the Crimson Pirate 1952 and many more all better harsher and stronger, more master and commmander characters",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Amazing that the rocking and the leaning during the heaviest of storms could have that effect on me when I'm only watching it, but it did. That is what I call film making at its best. I wondered, while watching this boat rocking back and forth, and knowing full well that it was not a real boat they were on, if the actors themselves got seasick? They must have! I don't see how they could miss, if they were at all prone to it.Anyway... this was a very heart wrenching movie about Captain Jack Aubrey of fictional fame. Such a story! I felt Captain Jack's pride... his hopes and his expectations. His refusal to let his beloved ship HMS Sophie be taken by the Acheron. His sweet violin music enchanted me. His integrity and honor impressed me. But he was not the only actor in this movie that won my heart!I adored the Doctor Maturin almost as much! What a loyal fellow... and such dreams! You had to want him to find those places that would show him the secrets he yearned for all his life! I felt every bit of this movie, and with few exceptions (I felt the wiggling whatever it was on the table was rather UGH!) thought it was beautiful and brilliant! If you want to see a rugged sea captain at his best, and like Russell Crowe, I recommend this movie highly.Just in case... better keep Dramamine handy. I am certain there will be a sequel.

I am not particularly a fan of him (nor a detractor), but in this role he towers as a great captain, man, and actor.This will be a favorite of mine for years, and is destined to become one of the classics of all time. You just don't see movies like this made -- you're lucky if you get one every two to three years.It ought to be re-released every ten years or so on the big screen.

Too bad the story isn't more interesting.  It was somewhat like watching a documentary on the subject.  Interesting from a historical point of view, but it just didn't grab me as a story.  Also it was difficult to really identify with the characters.  Why were they any better than the French who they were fighting?  And so, I found myself not particularly rooting for either side. But again, the action scenes although extremely well done, were not very exciting.  There was no real tension in the movie.

*-Watch it on Tv **-Worth a Rental ***-Buy Used DVD ****-Worthy of a Blind BuyWith that being said, I would like to share my thoughts on the 2003 Peter Weir film Master and Commander: The Far Side of The World. Like Matchstick Men, I didn't find myself interested by the trailer for this film. I rented it because of it's Best Picture nomination and after seeing it I do not know why it was nominated. I was not impressed by this movie and did not see what I assume many others saw. I found myself disinterested throughout the first hour of it and after a few events in the film I gained a slight bit more interested. However, I was still not impressed. The action was surprisingly minimal. There are, I think, a total of 3 battle scenes and I found myself a little bored by them. The performances were all very good, Russel Crowe and Paul Bettany were both in top form. The scenes with Crowe and Bettany were the high point of the film. These two actors play well off of eachother, as they did in A Beautiful Mind. You really get the feeling while watching this that the two characters are good friends.
I admit, I have not read any of Patrick O'Brian's novels so therefore I cannot compare the movie to it's source. Overall I was disappointed. As I said before, I do not see why it was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. I do not believe it was worthy enough for a nomination, however it certainly earned it's oscar for Best Cinematography. I would have to give Master and Commander **. It is worth a rental but will not be joining the rest of my collection of DVDs.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
257,sackleywhistle,"A near perfect cinematic experience, for those ready to embrace it",10,16 December 2003,"Peter Weir is one of those directors whose films are well-known, yet the man behind them doesn't seem to garner the recognition he deserves. Over the last thirty years, he has made some of the very best films of their respective years, traversing different categoric genres, but always focussing on the human story behind each story - no matter how big or small. Picnic at Hanging Rock. Witness. Fearless. The Truman Show. And now, his largest film by far, yet also a deeply personal one, arguably his greatest achievement in a career filled with triumphs of popular cinema.As the scope of his films gets bigger, the characters become more defined and human, a rare accomplishment indeed. For me, although I love The Truman Show deeply, and feel it is at least in part responsible for a growth in more intelligent, popular movies in recent years, Master and Commander is his best film, a close-to-perfect film for its kind. The story is very simple. ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey's ship and crew are hit by a surprise attack from Napoleon's battle ship, the Acheron - the nemesis of the tale. Having weighed up the damage and taken care of the casualties, they retaliate with a seemingly impossible counter-attack by pursuing the stronger, faster ship that outmans and outguns them. They tail them across the vast ocean, through freezing cold, sweltering heat and life-threatening storm.It is the technique that is astonishing. The detail of the life, the crew and the protocol of war at sea two hundred years ago is all accounted for, without ever becoming tedious. This is a long film that feels long, but never less than gripping, crammed with events, but not necessarily overly complex story. The characters drive it. It is they who are the most interesting aspect of the film and by resting the dramatic weight of the film on the actors shoulders rather than the effects - which are seamless, by the way - the payoff to each individual dynamic is all the more satisfying when it comes. Tempers fray, loyalties are questioned, motives and pride and duty are put under the microscope, making for a tense atmosphere, far more dramatic in classical terms than anything the Wachowskis' fx wizkids can cook up. It is the attention to detail that makes this film.Every screw and splint of wood of the HMS Surprise is on display, making the ship as much of a character - the omnipresent sidekick to each individual - as any of the crew. With judicious, unshowy yet acute use of both cinematography and sound design, the viewer is put aboard the Surprise. When it leaks, you feel it. When it is damaged, you are scared. And when the crew hurt, you are saddened. This is the best sounding film you will see (or hear) in a cinema all year. Other films bombard you more, sure, but this one immerses you into its world. There is a real feel for what life on board must have been like, but Weir never takes the easy way out by shoving something front and centre, as if to say, ""Look how hard life was back then"". Rather, it becomes an integral part of the story and the lives of the characters. Crew members get sick and their treatment must be swift and sometimes crude if they are to survive for months away from dry land. The opponents' ship and crew, the French Achelon, is rarely seen any closer than through a telescope, never offering the God's eye view of an alternative experience to that of the Surprise. We know as much or as little about the enemy as Lucky Jack does.To top all of Weir's technical acheivements, there are two or three outstanding and spectacular battle scenes. The opening twenty minutes are as good as anything in Laurence of Arabia or Pirates of the Caribbean, combining classic set-piece orientation with state of the art model and effects work. You are never taken out of the scene by a ""money shot"", rather the drama and danger are heightened by a genuinely invisible use of action technique. And when the final skirmish takes place, all of the character building both of the filmmaker and of the crew's Captain, comes into play, making for a terrifying, tense and exciting climax. Along the way, there are exceptional performances from the sometimes overly showy Crowe, here as good as he has ever been, displaying a real control of his craft (no pun intended), a leader trying to balance what is best for his men with his sense of duty, whilst living up to his impeccable military record. Paul Bettany is the yang to Crowe's yin. You feel the history and the brewing difference in priority between a Captain and his Physician, two old friends trying to keep their career and their relationship in check, brought together by their love of and skill in music. The scenes these two share are the most touching, as their loyalty to each other, the ship and the crew are well intentioned, but coming from different standpoints, simultaneously trying to remain honest to one another and do what is right. Billy Boyd makes an impression (even if his accent wavers slightly from time to time) as the helmsman who has the respect of the officers and the friendship of the crew. And the two young officers (I do not know their names, but they are both very young) are superb in roles that are usually carried off appallingly in films like these. As little more than boys, their sense of awe and respect for the older officers and their need to prove their bravery and worth to them comes across beautifully, and their scenes with Bettany and Crowe and incredibly touching, without being sentimental.That is the skill of the film. It fulfills all the requirements of entertainment - drama, performance, action, spectacle, beauty and humour - without ever overdoing it and spoiling any given moment by going too far. It is also wittily and intelligently written, one of the strongest scripts of its size to be seen this year. The ""Weevil"" scene is a truly wonderful scene, because it enhances the relationships of all the characters involved, makes a point about life and duty, is very natural and human and is surprisingly funny. The film is filled with such moments and while the ending may not be as long an action scene as some may have come to expect, it carries true weight by rounding off nicely. A completely satisfying film, almost impossible to fault as long as you dont expect a huge action extravaganza. If you have ever watched Mutiny on the Bounty or The Sea Hawk or any such sea-faring, swashbuckling adventure and wanted a glimpse of life in those circumstances, given an historical background and exciting story, then this is mana from Heaven. And when it is over, you wouldn't mind a sequel continuing the story where it left off, not an implausibility given the wealth of source material in Patrick O' Brien's many Jack Aubrey novels. That is a rare feeling, but make sure Peter Weir is at the helm...""Pull for Lucky Jack""",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
258,roset60,"Tiring, same old stuff",2,14 November 2003,"I forget how many times I have seen or read this type of story. It just gets tiring - it would be good to have a different take on it. Crowe plays his part as well as one would expect.  I didn't care who lived or died in the battles, and I wish at the very end the news about the French doctor had come when the Brits were too far away to do anything about it.  The British ship was cast as the underdog, but you knew that wasn't the case - have you ever seen a movie like this where someone of a different nationality wins the day?  I got tricked into seeing it by a newspaper review which talked about the realism and historic accuracy of the costuming and ship.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
259,Silent_Cal,A Surprise,10,9 June 2018,"Peter Weir is an underrated director, one whose name never seems to come up in lists of great filmmakers. Perhaps it's because he's never made a truly ""great"" movie, the kind that both impresses critics and seduces huge audiences, though most of his films, like ""Witness"" and ""Dead Poets' Society"", have become classics. Or perhaps it's because Weir's movies tend to be quiet and subtle, and avoid easy categorization.Take ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"", ostensibly the first entry in a series inspired by the novels of Patrick O'Brian. It's an historical adventure set in 1805, but it's neither an escapist blockbuster like the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films, nor an epic romance like ""Titanic"". Though nearly two and a half hours long, most of its action takes place aboard the HMS Surprise, a tiny British frigate sailing alone across the vast oceans. The drama is bookended by sharp, suspenseful battle scenes, but between those scenes the story focuses on its characters and their life aboard the ship.The protagonists, played by Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany, are old friends, both brilliant in their own ways: Crowe is the charismatic captain, leading his crew on a chase around the world; Bettany is the ship's surgeon, counselling his companion and offering insights into the natural world around them. Their differing philosophies lead to some arguments, but ultimately both men see the wisdom in compromise.Contrary to the prevailing fashion of the time, ""Master and Commander"" is filmed in a warm, almost naturalistic style that eschews displays of digital grandeur in favor of immersive verisimilitude. You can feel the ship rocking on the waves and hear the creak of its masts and the rustle of wind in the sails; you settle into the rhythm of shipboard life and naval traditions, the grog and clubbed hair, the songs and toasts at the dinner table. When the action arrives the camera puts you in the midst of it, with the rumble of the cannons and the heavy clouds of black powder smoke.The most remarkable scene in the whole film is a detour to the Galapagos Islands, set to the sound of Bach's first Suite for Unaccompanied Cello. The scene is a respite from the man-made conflict, a moment for everyone to catch their breath. It's simple, timeless, and quite beautiful in its quiet appreciation for the wonders of nature.It's this scene that makes the film more than a seafaring adventure: despite its historical setting, it grounds the story in the present, reminding us that the world is greater than nations or individuals, or the wars we contrive.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
260,hoopoe,Russell Crowe perfectly cast!,8,15 November 2003,"After seeing Russell Crowe miscast, in my opinion, in ""A Beautiful Mind"", I am now a fan again.  Also Paul Bettany as the doctor and a pre-Darwin naturalist has won me over. Some scenes, out of necessity, were so dark that it was hard to tell who was who.  Great action and wonderful scenes of the Galapagos Islands!  All in all, well done!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
261,shedmcnee,Best Film EVER,10,18 February 2009,"This is one of the best films I have ever seen and after buying the DVD, I watch it often. I cannot fault it. It's perfect. Russell Crowe is absolutely excellent as Jack Aubrey and the rest of the cast act brilliantly. I hope they make some follow on movies from this one as Patrick O'Brian wrote loads of books on Jack Aubrey's exploits. It would be a shame to just do a one off. The music is fantastic throughout and the battles between ships very realistic. Paul Betthany is great as Maturin, the doctor. Although in the book I think he's meant to be short and fat but hey... we don't worry about things like that! lol. Russell Crowe is an excellent actor and perfect for this role. His accent is really good. I would recommend this film to anyone.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
262,floridanate,Russel Crowe's Magic Violin,6,16 November 2003,"Well, this movie was good, and worth seeing I'd say.

The plot of this movie is epic, magical and touching.Wish I had more to say, but this movie is good at everything it does.

265,cthulhu-23,"Good Movie, Nothing Great",8,16 November 2003,"This movie does an excellent job of making the viewer feel he is on a sailing ship.  It constantly reminded me of ""Das Boot"" one of the best film ever made, IMO, in that regard.  It was suspenseful, the action scenes were powerful, Crowe's acting was top notch, and you got a feel for the mind of the sailor of the times.  That said, it is not a movie that you will reflect on after the closing credits roll, which to me is a sign of a great film.Spoilers belowI could have done with a lot less of the doctor.  It almost felt like I was sitting in an evolution class.  Yes, he made a compassionate character, but...we get it.  He's enlightened for his time, and he would have put Charles Darwin out of business before Darwin was even born if he had been able to save his specimens.  But...so what?

The preview I saw showed lots of action and too me looked like a great movie filled with action and an interesting story. You know set in the times of Napolean, setting on a boat. I love movies that revolve around the ocean. So i went and saw it and by the end of the first hour I was completely disinterested. The only action in the movie was in the preview. The rest was just drawn out diolouge between Crowe and the rest of his shipmates. I rated this film 6 out of 10 because I know a good technical film when I see it and this one is one of them but the boring story is what kept it from getting any higher. Crowe had no emotion in this movie whatso ever and hope to god the academy does not nominate him for this. The only actor that i think should be nominated is Paul Bettany. His character was really the only one that interested me and kept me from falling asleep. Yes I do understand that the Academy likes these types of movies and probably will give this film a boatload of nominations (pardon the pun) but the only ones it deserves are technical ones and and perhaps Paul Bettany for supporting actor.In Conclusion if you haven't seen this movie... wait till it comes out on video...",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

269,alex-216,Great start to a series?,9,23 December 2003,"As a great admirer of the Patrick O'Brian books I was in two minds about seeing this film, but I need not have worried.  It doesn't attempt to follow the book, which is just as well, but the spirit is there. The visuals are stunning - I sat enthralled through the battle and storm sequences, all very well realised.  The ship herself is the star, of course, and gives a better idea of what a ship of the period and its crew were really like than other similar period films I have seen such as the various attempts to film the Hornblower novels or Mutiny on the Bounty.There has been some discussion about whether women would enjoy this all-male film - well, I certainly did!  Such a relief not to have the pointless and emotion-free sex scenes that most films seem to find essential.  Also very nice to have a cast of fairly unfamiliar faces (apart from Russell Crowe himself of course), and to have English characters with English accents, and not the Americans saving the world again. A sequel seems to be built in to all films these days, and with Aubrey and Maturin you have 20 books to go at, so no shortage of material.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
270,JimShine,Huzzah! This isn't the movie I feared it would be,9,6 December 2003,"As a fan of the O'Brian books, I was worried by the trailer I saw: almost no Maturin, an apparently pivotal moment when a young boy takes command of the ship... oh dear, I thought; maybe it will be a great film but it won't be anything like those wonderful books.  Fortunately (for book fans, at least), the marketers were lying!  Pretty much everything you could want from an adaptation is here, which of course explains why a lot of people don't seem to like it:  it has an episodic nature, the humour is embedded in character, the attention to detail is almost obsessive, and (I think this is the crucial one), it makes little concession to readers/viewers who don't know the environment. Few ""mainstream"" films of recent years have chosen to assume that the audience is this knowledgable and intelligent, for which Peter Weir must be roundly applauded. You have to bring your brain in with you for this one. For any book fans with lingering doubts: The weevil joke is perfectly done; and rest assured, Killick is perfect too.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
271,sannyex,Good cinematographic telling of a naval duel.,7,25 November 2003,"In my 10-point scoring system, I give this Peter Weir picture a ""7"" - meaning, good enough to spend time & money for. It is a coherent depiction of a naval episode of the time. The battle scenes are reminiscent of swashbucklers ""The Sea Hawk"", ""Captain Blood"" and the like. Difference is, the latter have better ""setups"" than Master and Commander. It always helps if the protagonists can be identified with in the movie not outside. This pushes the rising action and an eventual resolution.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
272,swanningaround,Not memorable and quite boring,2,8 October 2005,"This film moves very slowly and is not historically very accurate. The battles scenes are really done on the cheap. It relies on a certain amount of creativity to cover this up, like the flash from the French ship coming out of the mist. I could see much action. A tsunami might have helped. Also Russell Crowe seems to have a Kiwi accent, not the cut glass one expected of a Royal Navy Commander. As usual, the French are depicted as posh idiots or as cowards.The film tries to copy the Horatio Hornblower books, but in slow motion. If you want to see good battle scenes from the Napoleonic era, watch ""Waterloo"". If you want to see a film depicting a good cat and mouse game, with warships, watch ""Battle of the River Plate"".",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
273,stavka,Certainly Not the Lesser of Two Weevils,9,17 November 2003,"Peter Weir's Master and Commander is a wonderful movie to behold and participate in. Having not read either of the books this movie is based on, I approached the film as a young mid-shipman might, full of anxiety, excitement and fear. Which Russell Crowe would be at the helm? The over the top Maximus? The head thumping Bud White/Hando? The little man in lifts wearing his father's Victoria Cross out on the town for Oscar night? I'm pleased to say it was none of them  but instead a fresh face and true Master and Commander of His Majesty's Royal Navy, a genuine man's man. Hat's off for Crowe's turn, he's definitely found his sea legs. And where has Paul Bettany been hiding?  What a performance!Strong supporting cast, script, effects, and pacing makes this a true epic film that somehow manages to maintain a sense of intimacy known only by a small group a of people trapped for months at a time enduring great common struggle with humor, faith, courage, setbacks and triumph.
Score was a bit wanting and repetitive, but not distractingly so, and it's highlights outweighed its low points.9/10",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
274,bpolhemus,What a wasted opportunity,8,29 January 2021,"As a passionate fan of Patrick O'Brien's ""Aubrey/Maturin"" series of books, this film, well-made as it is, is such a brief sweet taste of what could have been a fabulous series of films covering at least the high-points of the series that it leaves a bitter aftertaste, realizing the companion films were never made.I recall watching ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" after reading the book from which it came and realizing that without that background so much of the story would have been opaque. I feel the same about this film.The major series characters are there: Aubrey and Matirin of course, but also Barret Bonden, Tom Pullings, Killick, Padeen, Mowatt, and many others. And the interactions are faithful to the book series, but without the background of those novels much of the story is confusing.I watched this with my wife who's never read the books, and she was mystified by much of the action. I was able to explain, but only because it was all so familiar to me.Russell Crowe and Paul Bethany played the main characters extremely well, and the personalities presented were faithful to the books.But what I mourn to realize is that the multi-film series this should have been part of, with these same actors and director, never happened. What a pity.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
275,gino_monaco,Star Trek in the 19th century,8,12 July 2012,"While watching this excellent film, i couldn't help but compare this with Star trek. Star trek always involves providing solutions in impossible situations, with a tight nit group that has the fullest respect for their captain. But that respect and trust was gained through three years that the original series of Star trek was on. These men that starred in this gritty, realistic version of deep sea war fare, managed to capture that sense of trust and loyalty in two and a half hours. You can tell how much labor of work that was done to make this film happen. And what i loved most of all, is that if any CGI was used, i couldn't tell. The director Peter Weir is a true talent, and captures every aspect of this beautifully filmed movie flawlessly. Russel Crowe is completely believable as the ship's captain, and made me feel like if i was ever out on the big sea, in search of a battle with a ship that is exceptionally capable of certain death, i'd want to serve under him. The supporting cast, was fantastic as the ship mates. They definitely made sure to keep the authenticity of the situation expressed on their faces. Overall, a very good film that certainly deserved every Oscar nomination it got.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
276,jbitt,Masterly!,9,17 November 2003,"Having read all twenty books in Patrick O'Brian's beloved series, I was both anxious to see this movie and dreading what it might do wreck the books' well-deserved reputation. I was greatly relieved by what I saw. It is a great effort to portray both the characters and the action. Good casting and acting are combined with superior effects to make the viewer believe every second of the story.It is my understanding that Russell Crowe was responsible for having ""Far Side of the World"" (the 10th book in the series) selected as the one to do. To avoid offending American audiences, they moved the story from 1812 to 1805 and made the French the only enemies that the British crew faced (we, of course, were fighting the British in 1812). ""Master & Commander"" was actually the title of the first book in the series.The only character from the books that come across a little differently that what I would expect is Dr. Maturin. I envisioned more of a younger Anthony Hopkins in the part, but that's not to say that the chosen actor doesn't work just fine in the film. Dr. Maturin, besides being a surgeon and a naturalist, is also a British spy in the books. If more episodes in the ""Master & Commander"" series are ever made, I would like to see that aspect of the Doctor portrayed.As for the lack of women in this film, I certainly don't accept that as a valid criticism. There are plenty of women in the books, but they were seldom on board ship during long voyages.My expectation is that more films about Lucky Jack Aubrey and his crew are unlikely because of high cost and lack of a massive American audience for British historical dramas of high quality. I'm just glad that we got a great effort on this one.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
277,bill-688,Great adaptation of O'Brian's work,9,15 May 2012,"This film gives the viewer a tantalizing hint at the scope and depth of O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series. There are, I believe, some 19 of them. I have read 15 and hunger for more. The characters in the film are straight out of the books and as a reader, you get to know them. The series is really one continuous story that takes Aubrey, Matuarin and the rest of the crew to the four corners of the earth where they do battle with the bad guys--usually the French but sometmes the Americans--which battles O'Brian describes in graphic detail. This film is one you can watch over again without the onset of boredom. My only complaint at this time is that other Aubrey-Maturin stories have not been filmed.

You can clearly see they put a lot of effort into recreating authentic ships to create the background against which the story is set. The cinematography is dark and gloomy, and fits the story. Russel Crow in his role of captain does a good job. The interaction between 'the doctor' and 'the captain' forms the core of this movie, but unfortunately goes not very deeply. I really enjoyed to two playing music together at several times in the movie. The movie has one long major theme, right from the start, which I will not tell to prevent any spoilers. In the beginning this is quite entertaining, but towards the end it becomes more boring. Before I saw this movie, I saw the series of Hornblower movies. Although those are lesser known, and did not receive as much media attention, in my opinion those movies -- in exactly the same genre -- are much more interesting, much better done, have a much better story, and are much more exciting.

285,pathaniav,Very Satisfying,9,15 November 2003,I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Weir almost perfectly captures life on a frigate in the early 19th century; he has an astonishing eye for accurate details. The story has echoes of Moby Dick; and the game of cat and mouse with the French ship draws you in.

Really a pretty standard tale of the god-like leader providing inspiration for his followers through difficult times (think every wagon train movie ever made).  What does set it apart is the cinematography and the expert use of models and miniatures, which do give the picture a beautiful look.All the stuff about the ship's surgeon trying to be Darwin could have been left out and the story would not have suffered.

The ears hurt as everyone mumbles naval dialogue unintelligible even under the best circumstances. (The audience I saw it with was audibly complaining about the difficulties in following the plot.)  The few action scenes are not only confusing but also drown in an overwhelming and uninteresting sea of silly side plots. ""Overstuffed"" is right - there's too much irrelevant detail in the middle leading to a tremendously disappointing finale.  I don't know how they blew it but thar she blows.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
289,jansen-aui,"A rousing, entertaining, technical marvel.",8,27 June 2006,"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World  the big-budget (requiring three studios to finance) blockbuster of an action-adventure picture adapted from two of the celebrated novels authored by Patrick O'Brian  is as a whole, a resounding success. While it may not be the most faithful page-to-screen adaptation, it is a rousing, extensively detailed epic of high-seas battle in the times of Napoleonic War, and it's supremely entertaining.Russell Crowe stars as Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey, commander of the English HMS Surprise who, in 1805, has orders to intercept the French privateer Acheron. When, out of the fog, Acheron finds the Surprise before the reverse can occur and makes a devastating attack on our heroes, Captain Aubrey must retreat and carefully strategise the best way to overcome the bigger, better and faster French ship. Bookended by two magnificent, immersive battle sequences between the two ships, the middle act of Master and Commander explores the lives of the men  and in some cases, the children  onboard the HMS Surprise. Director Weir carefully develops the keen sense of camaraderie that binds the crew of over a hundred, and in particular explores the relationship between Jack and the ship's doctor, Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany)  good friends who nevertheless have conflicting ideals. There are several subplots in the picture, which play out and resolve themselves completely within the film's second act (ie the bits in-between the breathtaking battles). These are largely uninteresting and a little cliché, and drag the pace of the picture just enough to keep this good film from becoming a great one.Master and Commander is, as its massive budget (over $120 million) suggests, a technical marvel. Nature's wrath, which takes the form of several raging storms while out at sea, is realistic and believable, and the computer animation involved in the picture is well done enough to never distract. The sound design, which it deservedly won the Oscar for, is enveloping down to the creaking of the rocking ship, but where it really shines is in the battle sequences  so absorbing, and a real treat of a cinematic experience. Amidst the technical triumphs come convincing performances, specifically from the two leads  Bettany as the doctor whose steady surgical hand is as assured as his desire to discover new species in the Galapagos Islands, and Crowe as the charismatic, good natured captain who's put enough of his own blood into the HMS Surprise that it could qualify as a relative. He's as inspirational and dignified as the character as penned, and his Jack Aubrey is a testament to the actor's diversity.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
290,MilB12,Good. Long and didn't have to be.,8,30 November 2003,"I just got back from seing this film, and I really liked it.  Visually it is a beautiful film, the locations are breathtaking and the camerawork excellent.  The characters are good and develop, which is difficult to do when you have so many of them.  The action is great and the story was very good.  The only problem was the length, I don't mind long films, but when they don't have to be long is when I get mad.  There were so many scenes in this film that really didn't do anything for the story, they were just there.  A scene that should only take 30 seconds drags on for 2 minutes. This movie could have been just as good and over in 90-100 instead of the rear-end numbing 138 minutes.  Don't let the length keep you from seeing this film, and do see it in the theatres so you get the full effect of the special effects.  What has surprised me the most about this film are the great reviews it has recieved, from the type of critics who usually only rave about sensative dramas like The Hours or any other Julianne Moore film, and usually bash anything with good action in it.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
291,farne,Good but not great,7,18 December 2004,"After the rave reviews and good word of mouth I was looking forward to seeing Master and Commander. It had a big budget with a respected director and a reasonable leading man, a convincing recreation of an interesting historical era, and word of mouth that suggested it was more than just a knockabout action film.However, the story is really quite a simple one, and doesn't offer many surprises. A British warship, HMS Surprise, runs into a superior French ship, the Acheron, and narrowly escapes. The Captain (Russell Crowe) then spends the rest of the film pursuing and attempting to defeat the French ship. Meanwhile his confidante, the ship's surgeon (Paul Bettany), questions his stubborn decision to continue the pursuit.There's no doubt that Master and Commander is a handsome film (beautifully photographed by Russell Boyd) and a great deal of effort has gone into faithfully recreating 19th century shipboard life. It also recreates ship-to-ship battles, storms and various other hazards with some style, and it's technical Oscar wins were obviously well-deserved.Many people have suggested that this faithful recreation of the period is Master and Commander's real strength. However, if like me you've already seen the excellent British TV series Hornblower, none of this will seem all that new to you at all. In fact, a lot of it will be very familiar. With the exception of the occasional gory operation scene, Master and Commander doesn't really offer much that British television viewers won't have already seen relatively recently.This is why I felt some disappointment in seeing the film, because without the novelty of experiencing an unfamiliar historical environment, Master and Commander doesn't have that much more to offer. The characters aren't particularly well-drawn or developed, and the plot is pretty basic stuff. The two leads are both capable actors but Crowe in particular isn't really given much to work with, and has to be content to play the strong, silent, heroic type. Paul Bettany meanwhile, in this film looking and sounding eerily like Patrick Malahide, has the more interesting part, and makes a decent stab at it. There are a few other British character actors in the cast, including David Threlfall, James d'Arcy and Billy Boyd, and I was pleased to see Robert Pugh (excellent in the little-known film The Tichborne Claimant) among the ships crew as well. But Master and Commander doesn't really deliver enough that's new. The plot is a little too predictable, the characters a bit too underdeveloped, and the action scenes (although satisfyingly noisy), a bit too confusing and uninvolving. More than once I lost track of which Frenchie was being bayoneted or shot by which Englishman. I certainly wouldn't write-off Master & Commander, as it's a pretty decent, if unsurprising film. It's well-made and is certainly better than a lot of the dross that's produced these days. However, if you do enjoy it, and find the subject matter interesting I would urge you to seek out the Hornblower TV series.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
292,daeris,Felt like reading a good book when watching it. Movie of the year!,10,11 December 2003,"Well I have just got back from the cinema and I can not stop to think about this awesome movie. It brings back the faith that they can actually make an action historical movie in Hollywood that is neither dumb nor sensless and you can watch it as if you were reading a good book. I am an admirer of good books (especially historical for the historical reenactment is my hobby) but also big fan of action in the movies. So in cinema I rather choose to watch big productions with a lot of action and good F/X'es. Unfortunatelly I do not like the situations when producers of the movie just think of me as about an amoeba when my inteligence is to be consider :-).  After this season in cinema I nearly forgot that one actually can make a movie containing lots of good action and also containing a scenario! I mean scenario with a good plot, good, ""non paper"" characters etc. As I mentioned before when you watch this movie it is like you were reading a very good book.

293,farez,An authentic seafaring' yarn with a human touch,8,3 May 2006,"I found this film quite refreshing in this day of over the top action and in your face dazzle. This a timeless film that will appeal to broad audiences of all ages and it will not be subject to fads or popular notions. It could have been released 50 years ago and we would still accept it today as it will be tomorrow.There were no sex scenes, no memorable special effects, no surprise plot twists, and no unrealisticly choreographed fight scenes. This is a film that holds its own by pulling you into its atmosphere with masterfully developed characters, beautiful photography, fantastic ship battles, good score, and surprisingly fine acting. You'll really feel like your with the crew, and you'll really care about what happens to them. Crowe does an admirable job in portraying his qualities as a leader of men; true to his duty, courageous and tough, but not without weakness, humor or feelings. His on board friend the naturalist doctor is his excellent opposite, intellectual, bookish, and with an obvious impatience for unquestioned authority or the crown's less than humanitarian methods of punishment. His influence has a deep effect on our determined captain who comes to question his own ambitions verses his duty in protecting his men from undue danger.The danger is the sea, the weather, and the mysterious French frigate which is playing a cat and mouse game with our British mates. The enemy is never shown clearly, but we know they are clever, have more men, more guns, a thicker hull, and a captain who is possibly of the same determination as our hero captain. I found the relationship between the men, some of which are young lads barely in their teens quite convincing. Good camaraderie and a cemented loyalty under duress, but still fallible as all of us are. All in all a good solid seafaring story with authentic details and likable characters. The audio effects are sensational. By all means pump up the surround sound on this one lads!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

The acting was great, I really believed that the cast was out at sea a long time ago on these huge ships propelled by the wind. Russel Crowe was great and there was a real conflict that was depicted. I have talked to friends that really like this movie. For me it was very slow and boring. I was in the Navy for 10 years and let me tell you watching sailors at sea is not very enjoyable or interesting to watch. Like I said the movie was done well and the acting was great. If history is your thing and you are into boating or Naval history then check it out. For the rest of us, skip it. I was begging my wife to leave, she wanted to see the end.

A secondary character, the ship's doctor--a naturalist--had more to  work with. In one scene he finds and has to abandon creatures heretofore unknown.  Leaving, he orders his aide to release them from the crates, a sensitive decision on his  part.

296,karlito5,Jack Aubrey is skillfully brought to the screen,9,1 March 2007,"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (TFSOFW), is based on the novel The Far Side of the World by Patrck O'Brian and here I must stress the word 'based'. Essentially this film takes the fully developed characters from O'Brian's later Aubrey-Maturin novels and parachutes them into a story that loosely resemebles the plot of the book TFSOTW - this suggests that it is characters that the director, Peter Weir, is interested in and as such we can hope to see a faithful representation of Jack Aubrey's, Steven Maturin's and the rest of the book's major characters up on the screen - Weir does not disappoint either and nor do the actors especially those in the lead roles.The film takes place in 1805 and opens with Jack Aubrey's ship HMS Surprise being surprised (get it?) by the French ship Acheron - whom Jack was ordered to sink, burn or take a-prize - crippled the Surprise takes refuge in a fog bank. The crew expect this to be it for their mission. Jack though knows he cannot allow the Acheron attack British whalers and bring the war to South American waters, he orders the crew to refit the Surprise at sea after which he continues to pursue the Acheron south towards Cape Horn. However the Acheron once again gets the better of the Surprise and obtains the 'Weather Gage' (a term used to describe who has control of the engagement), at night and through the use of a decoy Jack is able to turn the tables and gain the Weather Gage himself. After the mizzen mast is damaged rounding the Horn crew members begin to believe that the 'devil' is at work and that Jack Aubrey is no longer 'Lucky Jack' because of this their aminosity is turned toward Midshipman Hollom who, unable to cope, commits suicide. After rounding the Horn the Captain of the Marines accidentally shoots Dr Maturin, forcing Jack to put ashore at the Gallapagos Islands so that the bullet can be removed from Steven. Whilst touring island on his recovery Steven sights the Acheron he informs Jack who sets off disguised as a whaler to confront the Acheron and end the French threat in the South Atlantic and Pacific oceans.In my opinion Russel Crowe puts in his career best performance as Captain Jack Aubrey and it is a credit to Crowe that after seeing this film I could not imagine anyone else in the role, a similar complement can be bestowed on Paul Bettany although to a slightly lesser degree. I think that Crowe and Bettany along with Peter Weir have brought Jack Aubrey and Steven Maturin to the screen with a level of perfection that has been seen only a few times before. Both have the right look, the right accent and most importantly the right attitude.Character wise TFSOFW is perfect. However it does wall down a little as the story is not as strong as it could have been. In my opinion it should have been based perhaps on The Mauritous Command where Aubrey is in command of a squadron of frigates and has to deal with not only the French but also the other captains in his squadron something which I feel would have given the story a lot more depth whilst the capture of the Mauritous, La Reunion and Ile de Bourbon would have given something more tangible for the audience at the end.That though is only a minor complaint. It should be noted that Peter Weir brought the fragility of a ship at sea and the intensity of an action between two ships to the screen with the same brilliance of Patrick O'Brian in the novels. I think that this is why Peter Weir chose to adapt TFSOTW as adapting a more expansive book like The Mauritous Command might have led to a need to use CGI extensively which may have taken away from the incredibly authentic feel of the film which is perhaps what, along with the characterisation, Peter Weir wanted to portray the most.With a more involving story I might have given TFSOTW 10/10 and who knows, it might even have one best picture. (I hope Peter Weir wins best director soon too as he's made better and more innovative films than Scorsese yet he still hasn't been honoured at the Oscars)",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

If you are new to this period then this film is so good a teacher could us it in class. Yes its true the attention to detail is that good.The film is very realistic in its pursuit to portray an old British ship in pursuit of a modern French warship. What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said, the attention to detail excellent, the length of the film gives the director more than enough time to develop his characters. Its hard to believe some of the cast members were just 12 years old when they made this film. The performance by the lead actors Crowe and Bettany is equal to that of the production values.

298,Aldaron,Disappointing after all the hype...,5,1 May 2004,"***SPOILER WARNING - THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***
This film, while technically excellent, was a big disappointment to me. Acting, directing, cinematography, sets - all were flawless. The look and feel of the film was senational, and the interplay between the Captain and the Doctor, and the surreptitious ""struggle"" for the ""soul"" of the young Midshipman (warrior or scholar?) was terrific and engaging.My biggest complaint was the ending. Without giving too much away (for anyone who missed my spoiler warning above), what on Earth happened? I was expecting another half an hour of story, at least, as the chase began...and the credits started rolling.Perhaps it's that I've not read any of the novels, but I would expect a film to either tie up its loose ends, or be overtly part of a series of films (such as with the Lord of the Rings trilogy - Fellowship of the Ring ended in media res but it was *expected* to do so because we knew it was part 1 or 3).I can only give ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" 3 out of 5, despite its technical brilliance.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
299,Dark Hellion,Tried to do too much,6,7 December 2003,"I wish I could say I loved this film.As it is, the scenes on board the ship are second-to-none. The sense of historical accuracy is always there, and the absolutely fascinating glimpse of how a ship in Nelson's fleet might have operated two centuries ago is just breathtaking. And the performances are top-notch, from Crowe to Billy Boyd (go Pippin!) to the young Max Pirkis, who I'll definitely be keeping an eye open for in the future.But it's just so *boring*!To be fair, I haven't read the books, and I really would like to now, just to compare them to the film and to see what's been included and what's been left out. But there is so much extraneous crap in this film.Being an aspiring author, I once received two valuable pieces of advice. I think they apply equally to any form of fiction, whether book, film, or something else entirely:Firstly, every word should earn its place on the page. Gramatically, thematically, and otherwise.Secondly, every scene shall accomplish at least two things, and one of those shall be to advance the plot. The other may be characterisation, worldbuilding, thematics, whatever. But there shall be no scenes that fail to pull their weight--if there are, that's where the reader's attention is going to wander.**MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD**In that case, why on earth are we forced to sit through the interminable drudgery of Hollom's story? Hollom is a young officer who has lost the respect and goodwill of his men. He struggles to control the men, and struggles to be the man he ought to be if he is to serve in His Majesty's Navy. Captain Aubrey too, has his own struggle about the man he ought to be: the captain of his ship and a man of the Navy, or a friend to the ship's surgeon Steven Maturin with whom he shares a long history of friendship.
There is a definite resonance between Hollom and Aubrey and the decisions they make. Hollom's presence on the ship and his actions do dictate large chunks of the story. However, Hollom, his story, and all the characters who relied upon him for depth could so easily have been cut.
Hollom, in the film, is nothing more than a distraction from the real meat of the film--chasing a ship that has you outgunned and outpaced thousands of miles and trying to hold a crew together while you're doing it. The nautical challenges would have been enough without Aubrey having to deal with Hollom and his effects on the crew.Alternatively, Weir could have chosen to actually strengthen the connection between Aubrey and Hollom, and actually foreshadow it from earlier in the film, in order for Hollom to actually have an impact on Aubrey's decisions and the plot of the film. As it is, the film's resolution is reduced to a hackneyed series of events that only occur thanks to sheer chance that could be seen coming from a (nautical) mile off.Not to mention the auctorial choice of resolution to the Hollom situation, in my eyes, left much to be desired.Or Weir could have placed the focus much more squarely on Blakeney's journey and created more parallels between his character and Aubrey's.

Having accepted the reality that no 2 hour film could have everything, or even a 10th of the information that's in the books, I was hoping for something that would give the feeling, the experience...the thrill one gets sitting in one's arm chair.  Weir, Crowe and Bettany, and all the behind the scenes artists have certainly done that and more.  From the crowded quarters, the friendships, the dangerous daily routines, the ear pounding canon fire to the Naval traditions, its all there with heart and thought.  Casting is uniformly excellent, with special mention going to the actors portraying Tom Pullings and Lord Blakeney.  I knew Crowe and Bettany would be wonderful....  the young actors, James D'Arcy and Max Pirkis, new to me, were a wonderful surprise.Simply spectacular to see, I wish the movie had been longer...  and how often do you say that?!Huzzah, Huzzah, Huzzah and an extra round of grog to all!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Both the acting of these two thespians, and the sweeping vistas deliver as promised. 
The problem that I have with this film is that it spends a great deal of time introducing and developing the characters of Capt. Aubrey and Dr. Maturin, but next to no time is spent developing the supporting characters. We learn very little about them, and really don't grow to care for these characters.  this makes it difficult to feel any deep level of sadness at the deaths of several of them in the Final battle scene, beyond the normal feelings of ""oh they died, that is too bad"".  The scene where the sailors are laid out in preparation for burial at sea draws very little emotional response, had we been allowed to get to know these characters a little more this could have been a deeply moving scene.If pressed I would give this movie a reluctant thumbs up, based on the performances of Crowe and Bettany, and the amazing visuals, but I would not place this movie any where near the top 50 movies I have seen in the last 5 years, and if pressed for a one word description of this film, I would be forced to use the word overrated.** 1/2 out of ****",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
303,saffell,"Phenomenal Effects, Great Acting, Wonderful Film!",8,2 December 2003,"*~* May contain spoilers *~*Seeing this movie in England definitely added a little bit of an edge to the film since I'm an American and knew very little of the history behind it. Apparently, Patrick O'Brian spent a lot of time meticulously researching his novels so that they, in addition to being wonderful fiction, are also technically accurate. I feel that the movie did a wonderful job of portraying the wooden world of the 19th century British naval vessel. The sense of realism I was able to maintain throughout the movie was a huge factor in my enjoyment of the film. Russell Crowe acted wonderfully as I have always thought of his acting. This film is most like some of his most recent ones where he actually exhibits some real human emotions unlike the stiff stoicism in ""Gladiator"" or repressed rage in ""L.A. Confidential."" Bravo.My only qualm with this movie was the unnecessary history lessons. This seems to be a new trend in movie-making that I don't particularly like. Now, I haven't yet read the books and I don't know if the Jack Aubrey character does stop at the Galapagos Islands or not, but whether or not it happened in the book it didn't need to be so very harped on in the movie. As much as I wasn't a fan, I don't think that it detracted from the movie one bit, especially since it seemed crucial for the chance sighting of the 'Acheron' during one scene. Still, there was a bit too much of an obnoxious pedagogical emphasis on the naturalist portion of the film in my book. It seemed like whenever I saw the ship's doctor, it was like the director was nudging me in the arm and saying, ""See! See! Just like Darwin would discover in a few years! Right! Right?!?""However, my complaints are so very minor that I still felt compelled to rate this movie at a ten, which I reserve only for excellent movies. It seems like one of those films I can watch again and again for the appreciation of human ingenuity in the actions of the characters as well as just good, well scripted, well-shot with great special effects, action scenes. Like I say, knowing some of the history made it easier to understand as well. For instance, when Midshipman Blakeney (Max Pirkis) loses his arm and is given by Aubrey a book on Lord Nelson, that has significance in that Nelson (one of Britain's greatest admirals) also was missing an arm for most of his naval career. It was just nice to have issues clarified that I may not have understood otherwise.The effects were very cool and I liked the various scenes during storms, ship-to-ship fighting, and the realism portrayed of what it might have been like to be a career navy man in the early 19th century. The acting was magnificent and Crowe portrays the smart, but prideful, captain quite well. Paul Bettany does well as the voice of reason slash doctor who controls how much master and how much commander Crowe is supposed to exhibit. All the other characters were of a caliber as to be interesting and contribute well to the movie without robbing anything from that captain-versus-captain battle I was looking forward to. In this way the movie set itself up well for a sequel and also could easily call it quits here and now. What happens next remains to be seen for what it's worth.So, in summary, I felt that this movie was wonderfully entertaining and a fantastic way to spend an afternoon or evening. If you haven't seen it, get out and see it. If you have seen it, I recommend buying it for those rainy afternoons with nothing to do and nothing to read.

304,ronnietg,Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,8,9 July 2017,"The outstanding screenplay element of this story is the Story World. Unlike real life, the Story World is a reflection of the Hero's flaws. His pride gets the better of his good judgment, as he pursues the ""phantom ship"" that is bent on destroying his ship - The phantom ship is a French ship- We are told in the very beginning that England vs. France is the historical epic story element of Master and Commander. The phantom ship is the ""Opponent,"" which should be a human, with flaws and abilities to obstruct or block the Hero's Desire Line. It is the Opponent or lack thereof in this story that weakens the Drive. The compensation of weak Drive is the never ending weather as part of the Story World that acts in opposition to the Hero. But again, the weather is not a human opponent. The problems inherent with the ship and the weather and the ""phantom opponent"" are that there is a Narrative Drive problem in the script. Even with the incredible Story World, which includes detailed land, material made structures, and tools that describe for the audience a time that is unique to 21st century audiences - even with the rich Story World as compensation, the story still lags and lacks the punch-counter-punch of an action genre. Adventure is a sub-genre of Action - This better describes the genre for this story. Drama, whereby opponents are intimate, does not fit believably here. Again, with no strong human opponent, the Drama genre is therefore weakened. A strong moral argument is part of the Drama genre - And the Captain/Hero's decision to honor his friend/ally/point of view character- provides a twist to the otherwise difficult to swallow Drama genre elements in this story. Had these elements been dealt with, a good script could have been a superb script. I still would highly recommend seeing this film.

Master and Commander is both masterful and commanding for its portrayal of the ""Senior Service"" as an organisation where man management took place on a personal basis, everyone was committed to a common cause and people of all ranks looked out for themselves. While this utopia is no doubt idealised, and we are given an idea in the film of the fate of those who don't ""fit in"", it is nonetheless such an an uplifting and encouraging view of the world that I now watch it at least half an hour every day. Bravado aside, the screenplay is deliciously witty and inventive, taking us into the territory of Darwin and the origin of the species (I trust that's not a spoiler). Seeing Crowe and Bettany again on such symbiotic top form after ""A Beautiful Mind"" is just the icing on the cake.

Lots of loud cannon fire, crashing waves, etc. kept me awake.  Didn't find anything compelling about the characters or plot.  The Doctor was the most interesting character.  I liked his self-surgery using a mirror.  No idea why it got such rave reviews.  At least I don't feel watching it was a waste of time.  I enjoy seeing  the movies that are nominated for awards.  Not sure why this one did, but my head itched anyways.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
309,jymcgr,A great Adventure,10,14 November 2003,"I just came from the theatre after watching ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World."" This is a good movie. When I first saw the press about it was not overly enthusiastic, but a show on the History channel about the movie's accuracy peaked my interest. Russell Crowe was perfect as Capt. Aubrey and the plot is a good, old-fashioned chase on the high seas. Peter Weir's direction was flawless (Of course) and the supporting cast was impeccable. I highly recommend a trip to the theatre for this one, DVD just won't do.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
310,Richie4236,Surprisingly original,8,7 December 2003,"I went to this movie half expecting it to be nothing more than Gladiator in a boat, but was proved quite profoundly wrong.  Master and Commander tells the story of Jack Aubrey's captaincy of HMS Surprise and his task to prevent a French privateer from entering the Pacific war.  The film is set in 1805, at the height of the Napoleonic campaign and around the time of the battle of Trafalgar.Unlike many historical movies made recently the underlying history has not in any way been subverted to offer us a US-centric tale.  This story is strictly an English-French thing.  Nor does the story hang on special effects and is very much like Gladiator in this respect.  A huge amount of CGI must have gone into making this story, but it's never obtrusive and your attention is never drawn away from the central story of a bunch men braving appalling hardship to follow their leader.Paul Bettany's surgeon character is very believable as he frequently disagrees with the course of action Crowe decides to follow and Max Pirkis is outstanding as the young Lord Blakeney.  All the characters seem to act as I would expect the crew of a nineteenth century navy warship to behave, and while I'm no expert I didn't spot anything in the film which looked inaccurate to me.I found the film surprising in three main areas.It doesn't find a contrived mechanism for the film to end in a fight between the two captains as I had expected it would.There is no unnecessary love interest introduced as I would also have expected.The final battle lasts no more than 5 minutes.  It feels just right and not protracted like some other films.
I suppose if I had one criticism then it would be a very vague feeling of unease about the ending.  I suppose I've become used to clear-cut finality at the closing credits and hold a cynical view of any film which doesn't offer this, expecting its merely been left that way for a sequel.  It's a small criticism of an otherwise outstanding tale.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
311,sixstud-9-376449,Could not possibly like this film more if i tried,10,23 July 2019,"I think I first saw this film about a year after it was released, I was on a cruise in the Caribbean and it was playing on the tv in my cabin, and I'll be honest, I did not pay it too much attention. It was a while after that I actually sat down and immersed myself fully in this extravagant film about life on seas in the Royal Navy in the 1800s, when Britain was still a master of the oceans.I found it to be an incredible film, it placed you in the shoes of any man who served at that time, whether you were an officer or merely a sailor. All the experiences, the rankings, the food, the weather, the superstitions, all are accounted for.I also felt the actors played exceptional roles, including a favourite of mine, Paul Bettany. He was masterful in his role as the ships surgeon, and his role was one of many played both believably and nobly, and the rest of the crew was extremely well cast and played as well.The set itself played an incredible role as well, the ships were meticulous in both design and set. I cannot for the life of me find one complaint I would have besides the rather long length of the film, but that is also part of what makes it such a great film, in that you cannot possibly tear yourself away from the screen at any time.Watch it for yourself and decide. Thanks for reading!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
312,ElizabethCoral,Wonderful film!,10,12 April 2004,"Master and Commander is a magnificent achievement by Peter Weir and all the cast. It is a film that undoubtedly improves with each viewing. Russell Crowe delivers, IMO, his best performance since his Oscar-winning turn as Maximus in Gladiator. His under-stated performance as Captain Jack Aubrey is a total contrast to his showy John Nash in A Beautiful Mind. Why did Russell Crowe not get an Oscar nomination for this?Paul Bettany is a revelation in Master and Commander. I liked him in A Beautiful Mind but he is wonderful here as surgeon and would-be naturalist Dr Stephen Maturin. His scenes with Aubrey are a centrepiece of the film...some of the scenes with Aubrey and Maturin made me laugh out loud. That he did not get a Best Supporting Oscar nomination for this role is a travesty!The supporting actors are all magnificent...especially Max Pirkis, who plays a 13-year-old Midshipman who loses his arm early on and who develops a close bond with Maturin, due to their shared love of the natural world. Max Benitz is also very good as the cute and winsome Midshipman Calamy. Richard McCabe provides plenty of light relief as the hapless surgeon's mate, Higgins (the surgery scene was too funny for words), and likewise David Threlfall is excellent as steward Killick...his character is just as I imagined he would be from the books.This film will not, I don't think, appeal to fans of no-brainer action movies. What this is is an intelligent look at life aboard a ship in early 19th-century England. Russell Boyd's cinematography Oscar was so well-deserved, and the special effects are wonderful. All the scenes come off as completely authentic...it is almost as if you have stepped back in time to 1805, with no anachronistic scenes or dialogue. The film is true to the spirit of Patrick O'Brian's books...I really do think that he would be very proud indeed of the film. I didn't mind the lack of women in the film...thank goodness there was no regulation ""plucky"" heroine to be rescued by the dashing Captain Jack...I'm glad to say that Master and Commander was a welcome cliche-free zone.I highly recommend Master and Commander. I found the film exciting and moving...several scenes had tears springing up in my eyes (especially the funeral scene at the end). I am very thankful that they still make movies like this in Hollywood. And I never thought I would say this, but...I want to see more of Captain Jack and his crew. Bring on the sequel!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
313,Tazmanhomie,Meticulous and engaging,8,4 February 2005,"Weir's meticulous recreation of life on a warship is an absolute pleasure to experience. The actors, who built up their characters as much as possible by establishing a hierarchy akin to that of the movie, do a marvellous job of recreating feel-good mateship amidst the rough work and seas they endured. Particularly noteworthy were the immaculate performances of Crowe and Bettany; their characters - a warm and friendly captain with a streak of arrogance, and his close, occasionally nervous but firm friend - and the friendship between the two are so flawlessly portrayed that each scene in which they feature is entertaining - the pinnacle of this is their duet musical scenes, with musical styles somewhat curiously but certainly effectively juxtaposed with the scenes that preceded them. The plot of Master and Commander: the Far Side of the World is actually fairly bland - upon reflection, there doesn't seem to be any way that such a plot could flesh out to a 138 minute picture; thus it is so that the interaction between the men on the ship, and the refreshing absence of female romantic interests, is what makes the movie truly engaging. All this aside, the realism and visual effects of the film, while comparatively infrequent and certainly less brutal or destruction-centred than those in standard action releases of the time, are very realistic, exciting, and have a touch of unpredictability about them. The end result is a movie which is not for everyone - younger age groups are certainly turned away, and I vividly remember being twenty years younger than anyone else in the cinema when I saw it - but those who will enjoy it will find it difficult to fault.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
314,KvMauB,What Film-making Should Be,10,21 November 2004,"One of my criteria for great art on film is being able to see spectacle that one would normally not be able to see. I love films that carry me away to another time and another place, to see remarkable things. Master and Commander reminded me of classic adventure films from the last century, done with impeccable modern and seamless special effects and authenticity. Like, you could not obviously see CG in use, or notice scaled down models. I think it is a remarkable film on all counts, acting, cinematography and visuals, story, costumes, music, and detailed authenticity. Even the editing is noticeably superior, because action sequences are fast paced, yet easy to follow (unlike other contemporary actioners using the ultra-close, blurred and jumbled mish-mosh that is in vogue). Acknowledging that there were many other great films in Oscar contention this year (2003), I believe Master and Commander was the BEST PICTURE (but unfortunately released the same year as the conclusion of a great trilogy, which had to finally receive a collective Oscar recognition). I especially loved that the naval strategies made some sense. Both the hero and his adversary were wily, smart fighters and strong leaders, and you could understand why the crew wanted to follow them. The characters were all likable and all of them were superbly acted. My favorites were Captain Aubery, the Doctor/Naturalist (played by Paul Bettany), and the young Midshipman, Mr. Blakeney, whose characters were wonderfully developed. It is somewhat violent, but I highly recommend Master and Commander for everyone. I love this film.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
315,LadyCardinalJenny,Absolutely fantastic!,8,3 May 2021,"Absolutely fantastic. The set design, story, cinematography, performances, and overall film is striking from beginning to end.

This is definitely a film worth investing your time in.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
316,jmartinsson,Flawless Storytelling,8,30 December 2003,"Master & Commander is flawlessly helmed by Peter Weir, who once again proves he is one of the most important filmmakers working today. His direction is masterful, creating an atmosphere in which the audience becomes fully emerged in the story. The film is aided tremendously by Bettany, who after only seeing previously in a Beautiful Mind (also starring Crowe), gives a surprisingly strong and memorable performance. Crowe is perfectly cast.A wonderfully memorable sea adventure, and one of the year's best films.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
317,Kilrogg,An Epic Sea Adventure,9,14 November 2003,"Definately one of the best Warship movies i've ever seen.  Peter Weir captivates us into this Epic 19th Century Sea Battle which includes great action and drama.  Russell Crowe is Captain ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey, a profound admirable leader to his shipmates. Together they go through an extraordinary sea adventure. Russell Crowe plays yet another brilliant and indepth character like in all of his movies. He definately captures the ideal leader to his ""country"" or ship; the kind of commander we all long to have and admire. Hands down this has to be one of the best movies i've seen so far this year.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
318,svensson-2,Interesting environment,7,16 December 2003,"I enjoyed this film because I recently read about Darwin and captain FitzRoy on board of the Beagle (some decades later).

319,gordsracing,"A Beginning, A Middle, Well what about",6,4 September 2004,"To supply more than what has already been stated would be simple repetition. The cinematography and scene direction superb.The battle scenes were really well done. Russell Crowe brought a good sense of what Lucky Jack Aubrey was. He really tried. To Crowe's credit, he really does that well.Albeit after working on the water, Crowe's version would come across as a bit of a milquetoast. Yet at the end of the day, I still feel someone else could have been cast in the role. If one doesn't think so, then compare Jürgen Prochnow's portrayal of Capt.-Lt. Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock in Das Boot. Then sit back and compare the two movies.Master and Commander also suffered from plot disjointness which made no naval sense. Any good French privateer wanting real prizes, would be heading for Madasgar, or the Seychelles. Even Tahiti made no real sense in naval terms.Knocking off whalers at the Galapagos with your top ship of the line makes absolutely no strategic sense to begin with. Suppose these whalers shipped out of Portsmouth, well it would make more sense to stick the bow on station outside Portsmouth. Further the Galapagos is one fifth of the earth's circumference away from the Horn. Heck of a journey for a ship of that period.There was nothing there for a top ship of the line. A schooner could have done the same thing against whalers more efficiently. And any admiral would have given such orders.And there are tons of places to lay in wait such as the Falklands if your into whaling, Jamaica or Trinidad if your into money. Or off the coast of North America in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.So I didn't buy the premise of the movie. Further at the end, it sucked. I cannot believe for a minute that a Captain, any Captain, would break escort when two ships having undergone pitched battle. So the ending dropped the ball so to speak.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

No, I am not being mean to anyone with ADHD, my point is you need to slow your life down to more than just a few sound bytes from MTV. This is a take your time and smell the roses kind of movie. Watch it with a good bottle of wine and I swear you can almost smell the salt air.This kind of movie only comes along once in a while.

Can tell that it comes from a [book] series since this movie starts and stops rather than begins and ends. Consists of a series of seafaring scenarios told while the overarching storyline keeps the movie moving towards a stopping point. Different supporting roles rotate into the limelight and are dealt with dramatically. While this might not sound great, it works well here. This movie is directed by Peter Weir, afterall. Lots of seafaring action, some of which actually makes sense! Much of the dialogue is muffled, but it, nevertheless, has its own compass and logical direction. Crowe will get a nomination out of this.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
324,tdarugar,Enjoyably mediocre,7,21 March 2004,"Mr. Gladiator plays a British captain hunting a better, faster, younger ship.Some interesting things in there. I didn't realize kids so young were in the Navy. It was also fun seeing battles with older, limited technology, where each maneuver might take a day or two, instead of the high-speed heat seeking death-at-the-push-of-a-button we're used to today.Still, the movies was absolutely mediocre. I can't really point out huge flaws, but I can't recall anything that grabbed me either. Actually, the twist at the very end had promise as I worried about the young captain on his own, but that didn't end up going anywhere as the movie immediately ended.Someone had highly recommended this movie to me, while another had spewed bile all over it. My advice is, if you've got nothing else to do, go ahead and watch it, but if you have anything at all to do, you won't miss much skipping it.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
325,Mark1988,A Truly Incredible Adventure Film,10,6 April 2007,"After many of my friends labeled this movie as the ""most boring thing they'd ever seen"" I felt very uneasy. What's gone wrong? Could Peter Weir be capable of producing a ""bad"" film? After hiring and watching this film I was astounded. M&C is one of the most compelling pieces of cinema I've ever seen. Absolutely absorbing in every respect it affirms Peter Wier as one of the best story-tellers working in Hollywood today.M&C follows the story of an English Navy vessel as it pursues a far superior French vessel down the South American coast during the Napoleonic wars. But it is not the plot itself that makes this film superb, it's the way in which it is presented.The film's strength comes from it's blending of adventure, setting and character development. Weir doesn't focus on 'goody ship chases baddie ship' but gives great attention to how the characters react when put under such straining circumstances. Also evident is a genuine sense of atmosphere and setting. The production design, screenplay and acting lend themselves to the period in which the film is set. Consequently, the film strips away much of the more sensational aspects of an adventure flick, making the reality on screen appear entirely credible and engaging.Every acting performance is spot on. Each minor character is distinctive and stereotypes are completely absent from the film. Russel Crowe is fantastic as ""Lucky Jack"", superbly presenting the captain's charisma as well as the internal conflict between his ego and sense of duty. However, it is Paul Bettany who shines as Jack's confidant and intimate friend. The best performance of his career.Praise must also go the cinematography. Russel Boyd's visuals are superb. The film never resorts to extravagant special effects, instead focusing on a realistic and gritty portrayal of life on a navy vessel even during action sequences. The first time a cannonball flies over the bow I felt as though the projectile was about to crash through the screen and into my lounge room. Thank god, the annoying 'hand-held' camera technique is absent. Regardless of this, the sound and visuals are quite evocative.To appreciate any film, you must appreciate it for what it is, not against a set of preconceptions you have about what it 'should' be like. If like my friends you want mindless action steer well clear. If you are after a compelling, atmospheric and dramatic adventure film, Master and Commander shines above any other.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
326,kandy5001,Not Too Bad Since I Like Both MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY's,6,26 December 2003,"I noticed in MASTER AND COMMANDER that a lot of camera shots and angles resembled ones from MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY 1935 and 1962.  Consequently, I worked myself right into enjoying the film completely.Russell Crowe keeps convincing me that he can play any role put in front of him.  After LA CONFIDENTIAL, GLADIATOR, and A BEAUTIFUL MIND, I believe that he can even tackle the ultimate macho role: 007 (Move over, Pierce).The most pleasant surpise that I found throughout the film occurred within the reunion between Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany (Dr. Stephen Maturin) as they played the two main characters.  The chemistry that they displayed in A BEAUTIFUL MIND created a genuine friendship between them that spilled over seemlessly into this movie; they really care about each other in it.I can't wait for the next one...and I plan to read a few of Patrick O'Brien's books to see what everyone keeps praising so much within them.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
327,LittleMunchkin,The best movie that sailed the seven seas,10,1 September 2004,"Although only winning two out of the ten academy awards nominated for the movie, ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" is my absolute favorite. The determination, the battles, the locations, and the entire ship itself is pure perfection. Leading the ship ""Surprise"" is post-captain Jack Aubrey, a fierce, determined captain set out to follow the French  privateer ""Acheron"" to either destroy it, or take it as a prize. Aubrey is accompanied by his best friend, Dr. Stephen Maturin, a man who is opposite Jack. He is resourceful and philosophical compared to Jack's need to get the ship. Fondly called Lucky Jack by his crew, he engages the Acheron at the beginning of the movie, which includes the loosing of his rudder and the need to pull his oat into the heavy fog. The rest of the movie is the determination of Jack to get this ship and take it back to England as a prize. Peter Weir masterfully directs the movie on the boat, and on location in the Galapagos. My new favorite movie, as it will be for the next few years. 5 stars from over here!!!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
328,nszponar,For those in peril on the sea,8,27 August 2016,"I am working my way through the Jack Aubrey/Patrick O'Brian series of historical novels and thought it would b a good idea to see the film of Master and Commander. I was a bit apprehensive about the castings and in some cases they definitely did not work. However, thinking that Russell Crowe was not right for Jack Aubrey, having seen the movie, all I can say is I can't see anyone else doing a better job. In the books, this is a man with a zest for life, courageous and maybe a bit reckless - Russell Crowe captures this very well. Still not sure about the Maturin casting because he is definitely a man who is not what he seems and that does not come across. Boden - also not quite right. However, this is a proper rendition of the period and the spirit of the books. I can only say I wish they had made more - the books do have quite a few love interests in them so this would have been good to see. Of course, it must have been expensive to film but this is what film is made for - beautiful cinematography, great set pieces, a good story and really sound acting - much better than all the action hero stuff that is out there.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
329,relars1,"Intelligent, Heroic and Inspirational",10,15 September 2013,"I am taking the plunge, and giving this movie my first ""10"" rating.In the mid-18th century, Russell Crowe, a Commander of a British Man Of War ship, faithfully discharges his duties to the Royal Navy and the King, pursuing a troublesome French warship which is larger, more heavily armed, and of a higher class than his own. He must use all his skills and leadership abilities to overcome his superior foe.Excellent acting all around in this movie. Life aboard a British warship in the 1700s was quite rough, with most crews being treated by their officers as little more than prisoners. However, Russell Crowe has all the military education of old-school Royal Navy, without any meanness or narcissism. He is a firm leader of his men, who brooks no nonsense, but refuses to be unnecessarily cruel. He displays a high degree of personal integrity, and treats everyone, regardless of rank or station in life, with respect. As a result, his crew has complete faith in his leadership - their loyalty is unswerving, and this plays a very crucial part in what is to come.Encounters with the French warship are unsuccessful at first; Crowe is forced to retreat, to avoid destruction, but does so with a cleverness that amuses his men, and their morale does not suffer from the defeat. In their extensive travels, the Brits enjoy some interesting diversions, including exploration of the Galapagos Islands. There are casualties, including the Captain (Crowe) himself, and an intriguing sequence where the ship's surgeon is accidentally shot through the abdomen, and must operate on himself, with an assistant holding a mirror. The youngest officer on board is gravely wounded in battle, his arm smashed by a musket ball, and must undergo an amputation, without anesthesia. Barely a teenager, he not only endures, but impresses all with his courage and strength, fully recovering (except for the loss of his arm) without complaint. This boy-officer even plays a key role in a pitched battle with the Frensh warship, boarding the enemy ship and fighting hand-to-hand with the enemy. The sailors he commands - all much older men than himself - are literally spellbound by his performance in battle. The crew, impressed by their Captain's leadership and humanity, draws strength from him, as he does from them.It is a story of bravery, intelligence, coolness under adversity, and true leadership ability. The Captain is far above the norm in this regard, and his performance is inspirational - not only for his crew, but for the audience watching this movie. All of us wish that we had leaders like this man in our lives and workplaces.Of course, I will not reveal the ending lol. You must watch this movie, but I highly recommend it. It's a ""10"". It's a ""must see, don't miss"".",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
330,jeremy-dent-627-314416,An absolute masterpiece,10,20 September 2018,"The film captures the essence of the Patrick O'Brien novels as well as being the most authentic piece of 19th century ship warfare action ever seen. The characterisation, storyline and pace are as good as cinema gets. The script explores leadership issues, relationships and duty in subtle ways, fitting in to the main theme of hunting down a French frigate more powerful and with much greater firepower. Zoology, entomology and baroque music are all featured, as well as surgery and philosophy. The scenes of rounding Cape Horn were filmed on a vessel doing just that that and bring home the everyday hazards that all seamen faced in the early 1800s. All rounded off with some memorable music, some of it actually played by Russell Crowe who learned the violin for the part.

Especially Truman Show and Fearless.The movie starts off in the heart of the sea. Weir does a great job of establishing the surroundings. The movie is basically a cat and mouse movie. It goes nowhere and it's very talkative.The huge problem with the movie is that it is incredibly slow paced, the characters aren't interesting, and it never really gets past the first act. The goals seem unimportant and the plot is really uninteresting. The dialogue is bad at times and tries too hard other times.Besides some nice special effects, this has to be one of the slowest movies of the year. I really hope this movie doesn't get any Academy Award nominations besides visual effects.On a scale of 1-4, I would give Master and Commander a 1. I don't know what movie critics saw.

The acting was really good. But, the plot and dialouge wasn't that strong. There were lots of parts that had nothing to do with the plot, and useually that is to build character for you to like or dislike the characters but I really didn't care if anybody died or not. But that isn't the acting that was bad, just a weak weak script.

However, I was overwhelmed with joy. In addition to be an adventurous and thrilling movie, it is full of humour and personality, and it also seems quite authentic historically. The tension and special relationship among the crew mid-sea in wartime in the early 1800s is very charmingly described. I think Crowe and Bettany play excellently together. Crowe has the authority, the sympathy as well as the doubt that one would expect of a convincing captain Aubrey - my only complaint is that he does not seem convincingly British. I am really happy that the project was laid in Peter Weir's hands, he never disappoints. Quite a relief also that this was not made into a simple, superficial Hollywood drama by adding unnecessary love stories or such, which is always my worst fear about ""masculine"" movies. Oh no, this movie is full of manhood and in my opinion it does not at all suffer from not including any female characters. I can't say much about the degree of being true to the original story as I haven't read Peter O'Brian books yet, but at least this movie has surely made me want to read them - and I expect them to be even better (the books usually are)!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
338,kwozziegirl,"""Aubrey, may I trouble you for the salt?""",10,25 June 2005,"From start to finish, this movie had me feeling every emotion, except hate. I found the brotherhood outstanding, the witty dialog at times near on side splitting, for e.g. When Aubrey suckered Maturin into the Weevil analysis. Maturin's response was equally as funny, but then Bettany has the ability to rise to the occasion in practically every role I have seen him in. Crowie, once again, Brings a fictional Character to life, and if you didn't know any better, you would think the story was based off a real life account. Killick, he kills me, "" Killick"" yells Aubrey for the Albermarle, "" I'm already ere in-nit I "" I have watched this flick now about 10 times, and I just don't tire of it, because each time something else catches my eye. I wish I could just climb aboard that vessel and experience the sea-dog life, as I am a sailor from way back. All the Actors in this movie, collaborate to make it a memorable epic. Weir When are you doing another? If you do, get Crowie and Bettany back, and Killick please. Loved it.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

But over two hours of watching Russell Crowe and his band of merry men chase down another sailing ship on the high seas was a bit much.  The plot was pretty thin, and after a while, it felt like I was watching the same movie a second time.

Peter Weir is one Master Director that has not been seduced by the MTV-video-fast-paced-no story- no characters-movies and still respects his audience, giving us a truly masterpiece that probably won't be at the reach of the common viewer.

The final (actually the only battle not counting some cannon shots here and there had to wait the whole length of the movie for it) battle was confusing I could not figure out who are the Brits and who are the French.  Besides the main characters in action, you only people in plain clothes fighting each other and got blown away.

343,cadwallon1969,A perfect distillation of the Aubrey/Maturin Novels,10,29 April 2019,"As a fan of the books, this movie perfectly distils the essence of the O'Brians works. The life aboard a man o'war during the Napoleonic Wars was hard and often brutal, and the battle scenes are violent and life often short.However it is in the relationships aboard the ship - where women are a vague, lusted for concept - where this movie shines. The very different characters in Aubrey (Crowe) and Maturin (Bettany) are the best of friends, and it is their relationship that provides the balance in the books and movie. The friendships and yes, passion that the men have for each other in the face of war and weather is so well teased out without being overt of maudlin. The acting is perfect and the cast well suited to their various roles.Soundtrack and cinematography are sublime and create the world that seems so similar to ours, but worked on very different ideas.One my favourite movies of all time. Long may the HMS Surprise sail.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
344,drjimmy11,very very average,5,23 November 2003,"There is just not much of interest happening here. Yet another in a series of recent movies that goes over the 2 hour mark for no appreciable reason- the business of the plot could have been taken care of in 40 minutes. The rest is filled in with observing beetles and a flogging scene which doesn't serve much purpose except maybe they felt the movie was running low on homoeroticism (besides repeated use of the word ""seaman"" of course)Don't be fooled- this is absolutely nothing like ""Gladiator."" They both contain combat and R. Crowe- that's about it. The script is episodic, lazily put together- maybe this worked as a book but little effort has been made to structure this into something the audience can care about.
Kind of typical of adaptations of novels- they jump through so many hoops, like changing the villains from American in the book to French for the benefit of the historically uninformed in the audience (that'll teach 'em to help us achieve independance and give us the Statue of Liberty!)- but at the end of the day they would've been better off writing a story from scratch that works on the big screen. ""Gladiator"" is a great original screenplay, this is a half-hearted, half-assed adaptation that goes way too many directions at once and never builds any tension whatsoever.I was fidgeting in my seat throughout. I kept hoping it would break into unintentional comedy but that never quite happens either- it just sort of meanders along, there's a big battle, and it ends.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
345,Mentat327,"Not an action movie, really a humanistic movie",7,22 November 2003,"The trailers for this movie were deceiving, but so are most. Its sad trailers have to put in almost every action scene they have just to get people's attention, but in this case action played very little in Master and Commander.There are some very well done action scenes, but this was really a movie about life on a navy battleship in the early 1800's. It was interesting seeing, for what maybe was the first time, all the children who lived on the boat with the men (scary thought), and brought home the origin of the term, son-of-a-gun. (Look up the origin, it's interesting.) Even some of the officers were just teenagers.But even as a human drama and a ""this is how they used to live back then"", the movie still came up short at time. This movie had greatly done cinematography, but the story itself was poorly told and dragged many times. (The excuse that that was how life was on ships sometimes is no excuse; you don't have to show 15 minutes of nothing happening to give people an idea that nothing is happening.) Another shortcoming was that the director wasn't able to convey a sense of time lapse. One scene would cut to the next, and then they casually mention 3 weeks have gone by, but you never get a sense of that. But the arguments between the captain and the ship's doctor were good, most of the actors did a great job, and again there was very good camera work and the action sequences were done well.I'd rate it a 7/10, but again, don't think this is an action movie.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
346,d-cappella,"Not only good action, but good history; plus outstanding novel adaptation",10,18 January 2010,"Master and Commander is one of my favorite action movies set in real history. The characters and plot of the movie borrow from Patrick O'Brian's famous series with a real attention to the spirit of his writing. O'Brian is well known for his attention to detail and his ease in creating a fictional world so believable and real, it is almost like stepping into a time machine. I believe Master and Commander is one of the few movies in which I can honestly say IS as good as the book, and I am an avid fan of Patrick O'Brian.Aubrey and Maturin are presented in all there literary appeal (although a small chunk of Maturin's character is missing in the person of his espionage capabilities). Aubrey is the practical, patriotic British leader, who relies on discipline, smarts, and tenacity to win his battles. And Maturin is his counterpart, the intellectual idealist who understands the costs of war from the vantage point of a surgeon below the decks. The two's differences often lead to clashes, but are easily reconciled by the two's friendship and love of music.It is also refreshing to see a movie which doesn't rely on the spectacular for its dramatic moments, but instead the subtle yet important shifts in the plot - which is closer to real life. The movie doesn't have any dominant female roles, nor does it need it. The British Man of war is a male paradigm, a ship run by men with really no place for women until it nears shore. Indeed, it seems HMS Surprise seems to be the only real female role in the movie; a character as enduring to Aubrey as his own wife. But a character with her own personality quirks, faults, and strengths.The only complaint I have of the movie is purely as an O'Brian fan: the Barrett Bonden character isn't quite right. I probably wouldn't mention it except that all the other minor characters flawlessly match their character descriptions in the books - Pullings, Mowett, Killick (Man I love that guy), Allen,Howard, Calamy are all instantly recognizable to the point that those who've read the books need not even be told their names to recognize them. But Bonden's wrong, I'm sorry but he just is...its just a little distracting to me, so I thought I'd mention it. It really doesn't affect the quality of the movie in the least.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
347,dave8436,Surprise - Surprise,8,18 November 2003,"Surprise, of course, is the name of the British ship and I had been forewarned this was a marine version of Gladiator.  I was pleasantly surpised that this was not so.  The plot was a pretty straight forward telling of an epic naval sea chase and battle in the early 19th century with exceptional attention to detail of life on a three masted warship of the time. (I swear I felt a little seasick during the storm scenes).  There were a couple of holes in the story:  medical miracles from on-deck brain surgery, all-to-quick-healing gunshot and sword wounds, and the seemingly instantaneous shipboard repairs after the battles.  A realistic timeline was probably 6 months or more but it seemed more like six weeks in the movie.All-in-all, excellent entertainment value for the price of admission and most will not be disappointed.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

It gave a lot of insight into the often cruel world at sea that shaped our history. Breathtaking scenery. Beautiful score and a few well placed surprises I didn't see coming. There was a depth to the characters that shone through. Russell Crow, Paul Bettany and all the crew were so into their parts. The weevil joke was so unexpected and funny! One profoundly moving film. The 2 disc DVD has so much intriguing and exciting features it made the whole experience even better. If you missed this at the cinema shame on you, you missed a real treat. Well worth buying on DVD for the extras alone. I sure hope they make another one as its based on a long series of books and begs for a sequel.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
350,amritanand888,Its OK...,7,9 December 2013,"I saw master and commander, the far side of the world yesterday. Well I didn't like it that much. The movie depicts the fight between a French ship, Acheron and an English ship, HMS Surprise in the period of Napoleon Bonaparte's quest to conquer England. The English ship under the command of Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), fight back hard against the powerful and big French ship. The movie depicts the journey of ship through the sea, the hardship faced by him and his crew and the victory achieved at last over Acheron.Let me be honest while writing this review. There are some sequences which I liked about the movie. The first sequence of escape from the more powerful French ship, Acheron, was witty. The last sequence was also nicely shown. However, the movie passes through a phase of dullness where nothing really happens and it can lead you to boredom. The movie offers a lot about the history where battles were fought in sea and with ships. The cruel lives of the seamen were also nicely depicted but the movie itself failed to keep the momentum going throughout its run time.I wouldn't say its a bad movie, but the storytelling was weak and loose in some parts of the movie, while it was spectacular in others.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

The sailors can't save him and must watch helplessly as he drowns.The background music does not, as one might expect, attempt to match the crashing waves and tearing winds of the storm.Instead it's Vaughan Williams 'Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis' - arguably the most heart-wrenchingly beautiful piece of music ever written. It perfectly matches the sadness and agony each man feels at that moment.Simply wonderful!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
352,babygeniusesvseightcrazynights,Masterful (and Commanderful),10,28 December 2004,"Interestingly, Russell Crowe helps rather than hinders the picture. It's hard to believe that he's such a jerk when out of character, because his acting as the captain is totally believable. His character is great because he's smart, very stern, but very caring of his crew. While they fear him, they look up to and idolize him too.The presumably accurate historical details really piqued my interest, from the little 12 and 13-year-old kids on the crew (and taking part in battle--viciously!), to the intricate chain of command, to the sheer power of the battle scenes. Splintering wood shrapnel, how often have we seen that in movies? Some of my favorite scenes are when Crowe is playing his cello in his quarters. His roomI never would have guessed a ship like that would have such a nice and fancy décor hidden within it. I mean the captain's room resembled a room out of ""Clue"" (The Study? The Library? I cannot say) Anyway, the visual details are great. Lots of money was spent on this movie and it was spent on things that really mattered, like recreating interiors and antiques. The guns and cannons look like artifacts to the modern viewer, but they're also well-kept and shiny.The dialog is fantastic, tooI can't remember exact quotes, but when Crowe gave some of his powerful, rallying speeches to the crew, I was ready to climb the mast myself.This movie is an incredible addition to the action/adventure/historical genre. It's also very much a man's movie. I'm not sure there's a chick in the whole thing.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

The realism and detail(s) of the vessel(s) is spectacular and noteworthy. Crowe owns the role as Captain and is well served by several supporting cast members (crew) Bettany (doctor) and youthful mid shipmen who are mature beyond their years, competent and likable. The hard life of the sailor during the period is portrayed as well as the glory of battle. Set design and costuming are damn near flawless. The story unfolds with enough twists, turns and suspense to keep things interesting. Violin quartet scenes are tastefully memorable (spoiler).

Well perhaps it should have been cut out of this one.  That, along with the lizards swimming off the island and a ridiculous request for the ""brisk walk"" only stopping ""for the really key parts of the island.""  I especially liked the awful drinking songs, only to have them followed up by some lovely string duets?How many ridiculous ways can you make a 90 minute movie 120 minutes - watch this for some good ideas if you don't have your own.

The director and actors are praised to the skies, yet there is not a moment of real drama or tension, of surprise, indeed of anything other than a reworking of visual and verbal clichés old as the hills. Nor was the realism so praised by other reviewers there at all except for a few moments. For yes, there were a few, but few and far between. The film is a clever contrivance. No doubt someone with inside knowledge will tell me they spent a fortune and a great deal of time on photographing these scenes. Maybe they did, but the editing is such that one would never know, so much must have been thrown away it looks as though it was done on a shoe-string; from the point of view of film-making it was unenthralling in the extreme, with clips of scenes that never once pulled back to show the wider scene or zoomed in, or panned to give the drama of reality. It is as awful as the film of Mamma Mia and for many of the same reasons. There is a total lack of visual atmosphere and place for which an endless attempt to substitute by background sound does not not succeed. If David Lean or Stanley Kubrick or Alfred Hitchcock or Fred Zinneman or any of the great directors had ever turned out a product like this their career would have ended on the spot. Where it is not awful, it is pretentious. Of course it does not help being shot in the wide-screen aspect ratio which diminishes every film now made when it attempts to work with both large (cinema, for which it was designed) and smaller screens. Now that we are in the digital age and the cost of film is not an issue, could we not return to nearer the 3x4 ratio which is the one that makes dramatic, visual sense in every circumstance?

The cinemagraphy could have been better considering the ship's been to one of the most beautiful islands in the world, the music score was not complimenting, and Russell Crowe didn't stretch in terms of acting. He just acted himself. The conversation was loaded with nautical terms and neither intelligent nor humorous.

Leaving away any unnecessary and lengthy introduction, the plot is immediately introduced by putting you amidst a gripping sea battle. All battle scenes are very well-done, exciting, realistic, and they lack any artificial flavour (the very limited use of CGI effects does pay off).BUT, battle scenes alone don't make up a good movie, and it seems the producers had the same opinion here. However, instead of coming up with one single and thorough storyline, they decided to beef up the movie's very thin core story (one ship chasing another, battling each other from time to time) with a number of completely pointless side-tracks. Like: an otherwise unimportant officer driven into suicide by his weak leadership capabilities. Like: endless discussions as to whether the ship's doctor may investigate wildlife on the Galapagos islands or not. Like: numerous endless surgical scenes. And. So. On.There are so many side-tracks that the movie runs over two hours, even though there's only a very weak core story. In other words: it is boring. The end is foreseeable, and the film ends in exactly the same way it starts.Summary: 5/10 points.

This is Russell Crowe's best performance since the Gladiator. Also has performances from Russell Crowe's, ""A Beautiful Mind"" costar Paul Bettany, ""The Lord of the Rings"" star Billy Boyd, British actor James D'Arcy, and new, but talented young actors.

Recommended viewing,7,2 December 2004,"Director: Peter Weir; Screenplay: Peter Weir; Cast: Russel Crowe, Paul Bettany, James D'Arcy, Edward Woodall, Chris Larkin, Max PirkisPlot Synopsis: Audacious Captain Jack Aubrey (Russel Crowe) and his crew of Brits aboard the HMS 'Surprise' obsessively pursues a French privateer across the high seas.In this noteworthy naval epic set during the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century, we see director Peter Weir deliver some of the most impressive special effects in recent memory. In fact, I would go as far as saying the proliferation of home-theatre is down to films like Master and Commander. The art direction and the cinematography are also spot on, capturing the feel of what it would be like sailing the high seas in 1805 (I have even heard reports of patrons coming out of theaters suffering from sea-sickness!)Russel Crowe once again delivers an impressive performance, rightly justifying his place as one of the premier actors of our time. As the brash Captain Jack Aubrey, Crowe exudes bravado and charisma and creates a well-rounded protagonist that is very convincing as the obsessed Brit hunting for French blood. Generally, the cast as a whole delivers a strong team performance, especially Max Pirkis as the young midshipman, however even mighty Captain Jack must play second fiddle (pardon the pun) to Weir's set designs and explosions.Perhaps the only gripe I have with the film is the inconsistency in the pacing, in that there are a few slow points that interrupt the overall flow of the picture. However, at 133 minutes, the running time is more than acceptable for a film of this type.Overall, Master and Commander is a very satisfying experience that successfully captures the look and feel of naval warfare and should appeal to anyone who enjoys a good cat and mouse chase across the high seas.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
367,bonzerdad,Best historical drama about small unit leadership since ZULU,10,31 August 2013,"2 major battle scenes, brilliant acting, historical realism on a scale seldom seen. An intelligent script which requires that the audience actually remember things said over an hour ago. This may qualify as a spoiler, maybe not: One critic missed the point completely, when he thought--what a wonderfully convenient thing that the enemy the captain (Crowe) was supposed to be searching for, just happened to show up while he dawdled allowing his best-friend and ship's doctor (Betany), to recover from serious injury on an island. Had the critic paid just a little attention to the fact that the island Captain Aubrey had chosen for the surgery and recovery also happened to have the only source for drinking water in god knows how many miles, he might have put two and two together and realized Aubrey was making the best of two problems : his ships need for a doctor (along with his personal need to keep his friend alive) and choosing the only spot where his French opponent sooner or later would need to drop anchor for water. Consequently his waiting there while Steven recovers could not reasonably be criticized as dilatory. As for boring-- that is in the brain of the beholder. I first saw it at a Sunday matinée in Phoenix with an audience largely male but primarily 10-twenty something and NOBODY got raucous or seemed restless, laughed when they should have and heard generally favorable comments walking out. I think a large number of the unbelievably low scores of one star out of ten it gets when when you search lowest scores to highest here at IMDb result from expectations of a swash-buckler a la Pirates of the Caribbean. It is a high- adventure movie AND a serious drama about duty and friendship which makes it a rare bird these days. Not really a date move, but a surprising number of women I know have enjoyed it. Not as many as loved Gladiator enough to see it twice in its theatrical run, but quite a few; none I have talked to thought of it as a typical male-bonding flick. Well worth more than one look if you are looking for entertainment that doesn't insult your intelligence.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
368,redvers,Superb depiction of 18th/19th century warfare.,10,7 April 2005,"Okay I wasn't around in 1805 and never served on a man'o'war so it would be fallacious of me to say that this is an accurate depiction of what it must have been like on an warship in that period. However, Patrick O'Brian's novels have been based on actual events and records from the period and Peter Weir has transferred this to the screen with an obvious love of the novels and with great attention to detail. I'm an avid reader of history from this era and it comes pretty damn close to how I imagined it must have been. Weir conjures up the claustrophobic feeling of life on board ship but also the great camaraderie that must have existed for crews to function effectively and after living together for month on end. Some people might complain about the lack of action - but life at sea would have consisted of long periods of routine with brief elements of extreme violence from either the elements or the enemy. It also creates the space to build up the characters so that we care for them. Rather than the gung-ho approach of many other films. When we do get the action it's sudden and jaw droppingly explosive. The cinematography is stunning with some of the battle scenes looking like period paintings. Again, it's good to see a film depicting naval warfare in the age of sail where the ships look ""right"". All of the actors play their roles really well with standout performances from Paul Bettany and a young Max Pirkis. If I have couple of minor gripes (which certainly didn't detract from an excellent film) firstly, the not so graphic depiction of how violent boarding another ship must have been - with people literally butchering each other with cutlasses, spikes and hooks etc (in the historic battle between the Shannon and the Chesapeake, the Shannon's boatswain had his arm hacked off with repeated strokes of a cutlass whilst attempting to grapple the enemy ship) but I suppose that would have affected the classification of the film. Less forgivable is the changing of the enemy in the source novel from American to French. It seems that it's not acceptable to depict Americans being defeated - even in fiction. Anyway, these are tiny gripes and if you like your historical films to be accurate with characters you can identify with and stunning action or you have the least interest in this period then I cannot recommend this film highly enough.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

370,ponda_baba1,Better than 'Gladiator',8,17 October 2005,"I give this an 8.5 which rounds down to an 8 because i'm American, I gave 'The Patriot' an 8. There should be some sort of intelligence filter on this board. I particularly loved 'BabyGenius' who thought Russel played a cello in the film, which is a hard instrument to play like a violin (his actual instrument in the movie).Peter Weir feels a bit out of his element in this one, being more accustomed to soul-searching drama, (the classic 'Dead Poet's Society') than courageous naval warfare. This is however a rare film, and Russel's Crowe's best, but he's more convincing as a gladiator. 'theTeague' from the UK alikened him to Richard Burton, although Russel does not have the polished presence of Burton or the flair of Erol Flynn. Much praise for correctly portraying the Cromwellian nature of the time period, with all it's puritan 'taboos' and Christian ethic.So the question ' How did the English take over the world ?' is mostly answered here. Magnificent cast, plot, cinematography, and attention to historical detail. Bettany is a fresh breathe of acting air, brilliant and flattering, however Darwin didn't plop out until 1809 and the biology is out of place and turns into a Herman Melville novel. Also The almost monotone color palettes, bleck, this was the height of warfare for the last 2000 years and the next 600 to come ! ! ! ! liven it up ! ! !

371,webviking6,A very well crafted film....,9,5 September 2006,"This is a fantastic movie about the HMS Surprise, commanded by Captain Jack Aubrey, stalking the French vessel Acheron to the ""far side of the world"" during the Napoleanic era. The film is intricately detailed, and while I am no sailor, most of the details strike true. I do know that the British Navy by the time of this story absolutely revered Lord Nelson, and that reverence is played out in this movie when several younger officers ask the Captain for impressions of Nelson during one of his two meeting with the Admiral. The cannons have names, the bells number the hours of the shipboard day. A knotted rope line is played out to measure the ship's speed in knots. A sounding is taken to read the depth of the sea, and sextant lessons are given to measure true noon. In fact the level of detail is overwhelming, but the story is just as good.The Acheron is the superior ship, and at first it seems the Captain is also superior. He surprises the Surprise twice, once coming out of the fog at the beginning of the movie and once by hiding in an inlet and letting the Surprise chase on by. Captain Aubry only barely manages to escape into the fog the first time, and into the night the second.Russell Crowe's performance as Captain Jack Aubry is spectacular. I was also immensely impressed with Mix Ppirkis's portrayal of young Mr. Blakeny. The photography and camera work were absolutely first rate, as well as the tremendous attention to detail.This is a really great movie on so many levels. I highly recommend it.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Others linger in your mind, sometimes even subconsciously, growing, so that by the time you see the film again it's something more than it was the first time.  Master and Commander is deceptively simple.  You could sum the story up in a single sentence.  But the levels of nuance and texture go beyond almost anything seen on American screens in years.  It manages to be exciting, bloody, adventurous stuff without ever becoming inhumane.  And it's subtle, human, and beautiful without ever stagnating.  Not a single performance bears a false note. The world of the film is so rigorously invented that one can't help but fall into it; it's completely absorbing.  But on reflection, it's an amazing high-wire act.  It stands as single, overpowering proof that a film with the best visual effects of the year can also be the most clever and intelligent.

376,tay1972,Worth the Price of Admission,7,16 November 2003,"After seeing this film I realized 2 things:1) With the exception of a couple of Brazilian natives, there are NO women in this film.2) Russell Crowe is so riveting on screen that I would probably buy a ticket to watch him do laundry.Though the overwhelming action sequences are sometimes so loud that I couldn't understand a word being said on screen, I still found it to be an enjoyable and watchable flick. That I couldn't hear what was being said was sometimes of no moment. This is not a film that spends a lot of time explaining itself. There was enough inexplicable nautical terminology tossed about that eventually gave up trying to understand what the hell they were talking about and went on faith that I would be able to figure out the pertinent details of the story.The story was not a particularly strong one, but the movie was well executed. Both Crowe and Paul Bettany did excellent jobs, although there were a few moments when I wanted to smack Bettany's rather effete doctor around and tell him to catch a clue...We're at war and you want to stop to check out the scenery? Still, he makes a good on screen ""conscience"" for Crowe and his behavior sets the stage for the moments when we get to see a more human side of Crowe's character.When I left the theatre I didn't feel as though I'd wasted my $8.00...and that's something in this day and age.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

378,jrwilmott,Superb film making,8,10 April 2005,"This is an intelligent film, not packed with clichés to make a point we have already assumed. It credits its audience with intelligence, as it does it characters. It gives them depth and lightness, learning and introspection. No two dimensional characters here, and for my mind an adventure movie far better than the Indianna Jones series.Russell Crowe shows himself to be an actor who is willing to take real risks with his career, a man who could have made a comfortable living playing tough guys, but has succeeded in playing as diverse a range of characters as Sean Penn, and probably has made better career choices than Mr Penn. The results have not always been happy, a 'Brilliant Mind' although well acted was let down by the sentimentality of the movie, he looked at odds with the result, I think his performance had more truth than the film. Here he is in full command, a confident performance, as was Paul Bettany's performance as the surgeon, both difficult parts calling on a wide range of emotions.The screenplay was a delight, witty and crackling stuff, it avoided the obvious trap of creating a pastiche of the period, just well written English.An underrated movie on the IMDb in my opinion",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
379,sabine-33,Wonderful movie,9,15 November 2003,"**** Mild Spoilers Maybe *****Usually, I don't like Peter Weir movies that much. But this time I was pleasantly surprised. I hope many people either don't watch the trailer for this movie or don't let themselves be influenced by it. The trailer doesn't give any spoilers but it gives a different impression of the movie. This movie is a great epic with heroic, yet very human (and humane) and attractive men of all ages. There is no cheesy, distracting love story, but there's a lot of display of emotion. I'd recommend this movie to men who silently dream of sailing away and exploring things, and to women who want more substance in dialog and more interesting male characters than the usual ""chick"" movies have. 9/10",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
380,ericjake,"Richly detailed, genuinely interesting historical fun",8,23 November 2003,"I saw ""Master and Commander"" last night with a friend, his cousin, and his cousin's friend. I thought M&C was very good, my friend thought it was the worst movie ever (oh, come on now...) and the other two guys thought it was ""pretty good"". That being said, it really is a genuinely good film, definitely one of the best mainstream flicks of 2003.M&C is based on the Patrick O'Brien novels of the British Navy during the Napoleanic War. I'm told the novels focus more on the ship's doctor than Captain Aubrey, but I don't think that should disuade anyone from seeing the film. Lovingly crafted with lots of great details of the state of shipbuilding, sailing, and naval life in 1805. Think guys with bad teeth who are sorely in need of a bath. The officers of the ship seem to live pretty good though.It was good to see Russell Crowe portraying a character with an accent somewhat similar to his native New Zealander. My only previous encounter with him is in the very good ""L.A. Confidential"" in which he plays an LA cop. His American accent in that film is pretty much limited to ""rmrmrrrmm mrrmrgrm mrgmlm"" the entire movie.Anyways, although M&C did stretch a bit too long (Weir could have shaved 20 or 30 minutes off) it's one of the more intellegent, better made movies of recent years.

383,ixzer,Sails away from the majority of mediocre films in 2003,8,16 November 2003,"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World has a very rich look on the screen.  The reported $135 million budget shows as you watch the 138 minute Peter Weir feature, which makes the price of admission worth it alone. However, not only does this film have a very artistic aura surrounding it from beginning to end, it also incorporates other fine aspects of technical film-making.  The editing, the original musical score, the cinematography, the visual effects, and the sound effects all coupled professionally together by director Peter Weir and the strong, memorable acting performances by Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany.  I have never read the novels written by author Patrick O' Brain, so I cannot make an assessment on the screenplay adaptation from novel to film, but I can make the judgment that the novel must of have been a very engaging one, as this film itself was exciting and gripping at the same time. Therefore, I can only make the positive assumption that both screen writers Peter Weir and John Collee followed the original source faithfully, because both writers believed that what they had read was destined to be brought to the silver screen in its original form. 	The opening action sequence and the final battle sequence reminded me of the classic opening and ending of Saving Private Ryan. Master and Commander resonated a very gritty and realistic feel of the life on a ship and the battles that these sailors had to endure upon in the heat of an attack. There are some slow points in the film, however they are essential nonetheless (The Galapagos Island scenes felt out of place but when they ended, they made sense and it just took some time to get there). This film is not simply about one small ship chasing another bigger ship across the globe, but rather about discovering the mysteries of the new world that was awaiting to be discovered and about friendship that was to be trusted  and leadership that was to be earned during a desperate era of war between two powerful nations. So it was necessary to spend time within the film to explore these themes.  By learning the trial and tribulations that these men had to bare through, we start to care more about their hunt for the French ship. 	I enjoyed this picture a lot as it sails away from the majority of the mediocre movies that plagued the sea of theaters in 2003. 8/10",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
384,sneakygreenalien,A superb movie about Navy vessels and their crewmen in 1805,10,23 November 2003,After seeing Master and Commander I was totally blown away. The way daily life on these ships were depicted was spot on. How the different characters and their tasks were clearly demonstrated. The locations such as Brazil and the Galapagos Islands were a nice touch. Ship to ship battles were top notch as were the close combat scenes.Anyone interested in Navy life in the 1800's need to see this movie.

386,rivendal,Absolutely positive,10,15 December 2003,"I vote 10. At first, movie is technical brilliant. I had an impression of personal presence in almost all the scenes, which means that the cameras positions, light, sound, the other effects and the rest of the technical tools are well composed, coherent to each other, ""catching"" the right moments to be as close to the reality, as possible (or necessary). Furthermore, Peter Weir`s choice of actors is excellent. O`Brien`s novel needs such an actors, who can realized their roles with the faces, movements and characteristics, they already have by their own. Relationships, between captain (Russell Crowe), his doctor friend (Paul Bettany), than the young boys and their elder colleagues, finally the sailors back to their captain - all the circle is description of possible human community, which can be comparable with any other human union, even the state. Russell Crowe as Jack Aubrey represents classic leader, an archetype of ""strict, but righteous king"" (captain), so his role justify the title of the movie. On the other side, Paul Bettany`s character is a typical one who represents other human spheres, such as mind, sense, hunger for knowledge and scientific researches. This polarity, between human lack (Dr. Stephen Maturin) and captain`s (Jack Aubrey) personal wishes, covered with ""hold on tight"" of state (British Empire) priorities, P. Weir alleviates in the scenes where the fear of loss of a close person waking up a hidden love and care (R. Crowe character). That point makes this movie more lyrical, than the epic male war drama. No matter the scenes of battles are enough rude, as they have to be, the lyrical sense is the clew trough the entire movie. Except the parts at the Galapagos islands, everything is on the ship, but the feeling of claustrophobic, introvert atmosphere is absolutely absent. Also, the end without end (final issue) makes the movie and protagonists a bit like a shadow, which can emerge any time, somewhere at the oceans. Very good end. I saw many of characters Russell Crowe acting, but as Jack Aubrey, I found him the best (for now). Knowing well Australian and New Zealand film production, directors and actors, Crowe is so Australian in this role (no matter Aubrey is British) - a specific and recognizable acting (like people can always recognize the Hollywood or European actors and acting styles, which are specific in their own way).

I thought Russell Crowe does such a great job and the rest of the cast follows him like well-trained soldiers. The movie needed to pick up some speed during the first half, but the movie does deliver towards the second, and what a fine second half it is.

Russell Crowe is a force of nature, and all the other actors from Paul Bettany to Billy Boyd give wonderful performances. I especially enjoyed the details of life at sea, though most would call them boring.

389,BubblyHoopla9,"So confusing, and boring, not worth anyone's time",1,22 May 2004,"This movie was so confusing. You would only understand it if you were a sailor in that century, which no one is. There were too many characters for you to know their names, the director expected you to catch their names when they said them, they didn't have anyone say ""Sir this is Cpt.Jack Aubrey"" or anything like that. You had to give everyone nicknames, like the little boy with one arm or his friend or Pippin! When the guy on top of the sail thing died, I thought they killed off Billy Boyd because I didn't know his name. The worst performance in this movie would have to be Russel Crowe's. His voice is too deep and soft for you to understand. Plus, what makes a good movie is if it has at least one joke. The funniest part in this movie was the ""lesser of two weavles"" and that wasn't even all that funny. I just don't see how people compared this terrible movie to the great ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"". ""Pirates"" was great, this was just plain pathetic. Pirates had a great introduction of characters with the whole ""What's your name?/Will Turner"" also ""Well, well, well, Jack Sparrow isn't it?/Actually, it's Captain Jack Sparrow"" and it actually had a plot! I never want to hear Master and Commander again! Another terrible thing about the movie was, gore. I know they didn't have good medicine back then, but did they really have to show the pain on the poor boys face when he got his arm cut off?! There was too much implied gore for a PG-13 movie. Again, Pirates was great with that, they only showed the people's feet, this showed people getting stabbed and shot. Plus, it was so unbelievable when the doctor operated on HIMSELF! Thank god, I saw Shrek 2 the same day I saw this piece of garbage. THERE WERE ONLY A FEW GIRLS WHO HAD NO LINES!!! I give this crap a 0/1,000",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
390,nell_ward,Deserved Oscar!,9,12 March 2012,"Nearly all of the film takes place aboard the HMS Surprise, under the command of Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe). The captain's orders: to intercept and disable the French privateer Acheron, which is troubling British vessels off the coast of South America. The two ships clash early on, and the Surprise is thoroughly routed--the Acheron is larger, faster, and more modern. But Aubrey, with a determination that might not entirely be due to his sense of duty, is not one to give up, and the Surprise chases the Acheron--and/or vice versa--down the Brazilian coast, around Cape Horn, and to the Gallapagos Islands.That's the action part. The intimate part involves Aubrey's relationship with the ship's surgeon, Stephan Marutin (Paul Bettany). Stephan is a quiet intellectual and devout naturallist, whose train of thought is foraying into the territory that would make Darwin a household name later in the century. He's also the only one among the crew who's either willing or able to call Aubrey's decisions into question. He provides a grounding force for the captain, and the friendship between these two dissimilar men is the emotional heart of the story.I've yet to read any of the Patrick O'Brian series upon which ""Master and Commander"" is based, but the movie shows every evidence of being derived from a painstakingly and meticulously detailed work, one which has gone to great lengths to re-create the world and environment of these men. The details on screen are wonderful, depicting the sort of harsh conditions that make the contestants on those ""reality"" series look like the overglorified wimps they are. The crew of the Surprise (many of them not older than twenty) lives in claustrophobic and none-too-clean quarters--at times it seems as if every inch of the screen is crammed full--and sleep in hammocks that may very well end up serving as their shrouds. Battles are chaotic, with cannon fire ripping huge holes in the ship and sending shrapnel in every direction. The weather seems to exist only in extremes: still heat, raging tempests, even snow as they drift down near the Antarctic circle. Good service is rewarded with extra rations of grog and brandy, insubordination is punished by the whip. It's a place where both close friendships and deep resentments can grow, and the tension in the air at times feels like a living presence.Crowe dominates the production, once again proving himself one of the best leading men working in movies. In his hands, Jack Aubrey is a natural leader of men: clever, courageous, determined, and capable of what nowadays is called ""thinking outside the box."" He is frequently confronted with difficult choices, but takes his responsibilities and the consequences of his actions unflinchingly. Bettany turns in an equally good performance as Aubrey's emotional and ideological opposite; the two men play wonderfully off of each other. Most of the rest of the crew tends to blur together (the exceptions include a young officer who's right arm gets amputated early on, and later takes command of the ship), but ""Lord of the Rings"" fans will be amused to notice Billy Boyd among the ranks.The combination of action and introspection in ""Master and Commander"" at times seems like an odd mix, but the film succeeds on both levels.

For those interested in English history/naval history, Patrick O'Brian novels, or just beautiful cinematography, music, and fine acting, this film never disappoints. The star, Russell Crowe, is wonderful as Captain ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey, though there are truly fine performances all round. Max Pirkin shines as the sweet-tempered midshipman, Lord Blakeney, and David Threlfall is fun as the grumpy but attentive Steward, ""Preserved"" Killick. The beautiful close shot of young Max Benitz (2nd Lt. Peter Calamy) at (the ""weevil"") dinner, bathed in candlelight, was reminiscent of a miniature oil portrait. Complex and layered, it's one of very few movies I can watch again and again; disappointed, as many people were, that no sequels were made.

The Doctor/naturalist character was, I felt , a little out of time and seemed a touch too modern in outlook.

393,warthenj,"Thrillingly, touchingly right",10,16 November 2003,"Having not read an O'Brian in a couple of years, I hadn't anticipated the lovely buzz of recognition watching MASTER AND COMMANDER afforded.  The theater was mostly empty, so I presume this will be the only Aubrey/Maturin episode we will see onscreen.  But this one is a fitting bookend to the majestic series-- a stand-in for the final-episode I have presumed O'Brian left his executors to publish posthumously (presumably, one in which Aubrey and probably Maturin go down with one ship or another).  Weir and company didn't get in the humor of the books (film-goers won't know how fitting was one O'Brian fan's online confession that his dream-Aubrey was Bill Clinton). They couldn't shoehorn-in Maturin's espionage or the other sides of his fascinating, impossible book-being.  And those watching the film won't know the aesthetic of O'Brian's relegating battle-scenes to secondary importance (he even vaults-over a few, stunningly).  They will see his archival relish, his fascination with hierarchy and order maintained under claustrophobic conditions, and his curator's interest in absolutely every aspect of naval subsistence.  In a couple of respects, the film even improves on the books: the line of streamlined eloquence Weir affords Jack may conventionalize his appeal to his men, but it stood-in for the charisma of Aubrey's reputation, amassed over so many volumes (Crowe understates artfully); the film manifests tangy mortal presences for the ensemble of sailors who, in the books, flicker by as names-only.  In fact, Weir's only error seemed to me the inflation of Hallam's collapse into a set-piece of cued poignancy, a narrative stutter. Spectacular film-making-- I am sure Spielberg, Scorsese and P. Jackson appreciate the ingenuity and clarity of what Weir managed.  Jack Aubrey would know what to do with the churls who have recorded indifferent comments in this register.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

I read all the Horatio Hornblower books, and I love stories of the King's Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. There may be a few inconsistencies here and there, but hey, we're all human. Needless to say, I was quite impressed. The movie is touching, tough, and lyrical. The music is exquisite -- I have purchased the soundtrack, and the casting brilliant. I have now been through two of the Aubrey-Maturin novels, after seeing the movie, and I don't see what people found so disturbing about Russell Crowe's casting as Jack Aubrey. Though Aubrey is younger in the books, Crowe played him magnificently. And I love Paul Bettany; always have, since his Chaucer days. He does the character of Maturin a great service. As I have read these books, I've found that the screenwriters took good care to include some dialog from the books word-for-word. I like that in a movie made from a book -- or more than one, in this case. I can't wait to read the rest of the books and compare them to one of my favorite movies, one I've watched so many times, I can ""watch"" it with my eyes closed!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
396,Christiancruz33,A huge fan of the books,10,16 November 2021,I love this movie. Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany do an amazing job of bringing the characters to life. The story is captivating and the movie has a lot of beautiful visuals.I definitely recommend reading the books if you liked the movie.,Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
397,EleanorD,Outstanding,9,3 January 2004,"This film is two things:1. A highly superior action movie. It's exciting, emotional, beautiful and honest. The sound design is particularly good and I suggest choosing a cinema with a better than average sound system if you possibly can. They are very successful at creating the life of the warship, this little floating world, travelling around our world, but not in it, with its own independent, isolated life, subject to the awesome power of the weather and the sea. The actions, with cannonballs crashing about your ears, and the seas off Cape Horn, are awe-inspiring. The heat, the cold, the possibility of running out of water, of accidents, disease, the isolation, the responsibilities, being 'stuck' with your shipmates, the resilience and sensation of living only in the present - all this is superbly conveyed, and that's before you even mention the enemy.2. A pretty good Patrick O'Brian pastiche. It's not like the real thing, but it's a very worthy tribute. Crowe and Bettany may not be Aubrey and Maturin, but they're about as good a try as you could possibly hope for. If you have read the books, just relax and don't worry about the plot of either of the books this is based on - there isn't room for that kind of plot in the time. Treat this as a new sea story. You should recognise some dialogue, which is all to the good as O'Brian's brilliant dialogue is one of the best things about the novels. What they've really gone for here is physical historical accuracy and great acting. If you haven't read the books, but seeing the film has made you want to, just start with ""Master and Commander"".Age range: I think anyone of 10 upwards would be fine, but parents should use their discretion in taking a younger child. Although the violence is not especially graphic, it is realistic. There are some emotional scenes of characters being injured, killed, or buried at sea which might upset an imaginative child. On the other hand, there are also scenes of very young characters showing great courage and responsibility.Some people have found it difficult to follow. I see that one reviewer simply couldn't understand the British accents, which probably does make it tricky, and two seperate people on the message board have mistaken the brief glimpse of a cricket match for baseball. (Both of them enjoyed the film, though.) If you don't need subtitles, why not give it a go? If you do, you might have to wait for the DVD, which is a pity as this is a big-screen flick.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
398,Rip-4,A fabulous movie,10,15 November 2003,"A thoughtful, masterful evocation of the age of sail, and a quietly gripping story.  Performances are wonderful.  Weir does not resort to audience manipulation through music score or bloodshed - he expects the audience to pay attention and keep up.  It may be too much to ask of American audiences today, but I hope not.  Crowe, Bettany and the rest are wonderful, and this movie fully realizes the spirit, if not the letter, of Patrick O'Brian's novels.  A wonderful movie for the ages - but it's not a video game.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
399,bigfishjuan,Appropriately paced,9,12 March 2004,"Many with a short attention span, which seems all too common these days, may feel that this movie drags.  But those with patience for a good thing will recognize that Peter Weir did an excellent job of giving a realistic portrayal of life on a battleship from this time-period.  Those amongst us with A.D.D. would have been happier if the whole two hours were filled with nothing but battle scenes.  Those amongst us with an appreciation for good films are grateful to the filmmakers for this wonderful accomplishment that not only entertains us, but also succeeds in illustrating history for a generation centuries removed from experiencing it for ourselves.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
400,kahfay,Surprised,8,9 December 2003,"My husband and I use IMDB to see what real viewers think of films. We never go see anything with lower than a 7 rating. I was not really looking forward to Master and Commander but the majority of those who had seen it liked it so off we went. I am glad I did. I am not a big Russell Crowe fan but sometimes he surprises me. He did an excellent job. He played the role of Lucky Jack with the reserved emotion as needed. I knew nothing about what the film covered. My husband briefed me quickly about the war and I was set. The film was beautifully done. The acting, costuming, and story telling were all great(expect to see Oscar with this one). The attention to detail was amazing. I left feeling that I had been on ship and in the time period. When you see this film take your mind and let it absorb all that is the Master and Commander.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
401,arget_aiedail,A high seas ramble with great attention to detail,3,30 October 2008,"After hearing so much about this being a great movie, I decided to rent it and see for myself. The only good thing I can say is that now I've seen it, but I should have saved the five bucks. I loved how accurate everything was, but Here is the plot: A warship (the H.M.S. ""Surprise"") captained by ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey does battle with the ""Acheron"" and then chases her around...and around, and around. We see brief glimpses of the men's lives, but not ever enough to care about them or see their struggles. (Yes, Hollom struggles with being an outsider, and other men struggle with losing their friends at sea, but there is never enough of any one person's struggles to make it interesting.) They keep *almost* catching the ""Acheron,"" but never quite do. At the end, they take her, but Jack assumes the ""doctor"" (actually the disguised French captain) is telling the truth and the ""Acheron"" and her captain get away. So Jack and Stephen sit down and play a lovely piece by Bocherinni (the best part of the movie, I thought) to pass the time. All of this is accompanied by a strange selection of classical music by Bach, Mozart, Vaughan Williams, and Corelli that does NOT go with the moods portrayed on screen.I was impressed that Russel Crowe learned to play the violin for the movie, but that did not make up for a two-hour ramble on the high seas.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
402,venusrising,Better than most,8,15 November 2003,"This film was far better than most of the large-scale action/dramas that come out this time of year.  It was engaging, but it was somewhat inconsistent and its flow was at times diverted and came to a near standstill.  Russell Crowe's performance was excellent, certainly one of his best.  The story was well-executed.  However, something was ultimately lacking in the film, attention to a larger purpose or goal, that made the sailors' sacrifices worthwhile and would have given them greater significance.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
403,David_Hart,Probably one of the best sea movies of all time,10,15 November 2003,"Napoleon Bonaparte, on being told the virtues of a new general - the man's heroism, bravery, skill in battle and so on - waved his hand impatiently. ""That's all very well,"" he said, ""but is he lucky?""In a world where competency is the rule and deviations from prescribed orders bring instant termination we are transported back to Napoleonic naval wars and the world of Captain Jack Aubry. Aubry is multi-faceted playing the violin, fascinated by natural science, loving women (though only a glimpse is shown of this in this movie), wanting the money from the enemy ships that he seizes but at the same time courageous, patriotic and most of all lucky.I know some may disagree with me but I think this may be one of the best sea movies of all time. The movie captures perfectly life among an English frigate during the Napoleonic wars, yet works as an action movie and also as a buddy picture (the Doctor Maturin and Captain Aubry). Dialog is great, picking up much of the language of the books without feeling the need for endless exposition for the definitions. Performances are excellent throughout and Russel Crowe will certainly be put in Oscar contention for his role as Aubry.I think some may criticize some of the pacing of the movie but I think it captures the fact that life on a ship like this was sometimes boring, fun and very dangerous for short periods of time.If I only have a one criticisms of the movie the are for the lack of exposition on Dr. Maturin. People may seem mystified by Capt. Aubry's soft gloves approach to Dr. Maturin (even though we know they are friends). This is because Aubry knows that while the crew follows Aubry because he is lucky, they know a competent surgeon is a rarity on a frigate the size of theirs. Three major reasons that Maturin is on board are his friendship to Aubry, his desire to see foreign lands as a naturalist and his desire to be as far away from England as possible since he was somewhat involved in a recent Irish rebellion. It probably would have been a good idea for 1st Lt. Pullings or Capt. Howard to ask in an aside why he tolerates comments from Maturin that he wouldn't tolerate from anyone else on board. Aubry could have given a short speech on how a Captain has to balance the needs for discipline, individual motivation and loyalty of the crew in all decisions that he makes.Still in all a great film.10 out of 10.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
404,Jonathan-Puntervold,Captivating,8,28 November 2003,"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is just about one of the finest and most see-worthy films of the year. Russell Crowe is at it again in the clothes of a natural hero, this time a certain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey, and with director Peter Weir we are taken on a journey of revenge that goes to the very far sides of the world.  What is perhaps most to admire of the film is its excellent realism. The very first 15 minutes are perhaps the finest, most exciting and dazzling 15 minutes of the year. Jack Aubrey and his crew of seamen are attacked by French fregate Acheron, and the battle is downright intense. Saving Private Ryan redone in the early 19th century, well, I'm very amazed. Also, Paul Bettanys character, Stephen Maturin, adds an excellent supporting character which helps us take interest on the happenings on the ship, the HMS Surprise.  What came most unexpected (to me, anyway) was the fact that in this movie, we get to delve into our characters in a way not yet seen in huge blockbusters. This risk was worth taking, as this drama keeps the crew alive and believable.  Even if we might drive into some slow parts at times, I can't help to be fascinated by the authentic portrayal of the wars at sea, and even if it is a little slow at times, the beautiful shots, interesting characters, and spectacular battle scenes create one of the best films of the year, which is highly recommended.  9/10",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
405,octahog-1,Am I missing something?,6,22 November 2003,"I really do not understand why this film is getting such great reviews. I will say the battle scenes are great, but that's about it. Russell Crowe is a great actor but not here. For me this film was almost a joke in the acting department. It was predictable and dull. I really don't believe people would be as calm and cracking jokes while there being blown to bit's. How critics have reacted to this film is exactly what is wrong in Hollywood. It really doesn't take much to make them happy anymore. What was the purpose of this film? The Dr. friend needed to get thrown overboard along with most of the rest of the cast. Sorry this is just another bloated Hollywood waste of time. Oh, and please do not compare this film to Lawrence of Arabia that film IS a classic!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
406,gifeglove,Fun but a bit long.,7,27 November 2003,"Fine but way too long epic that is very good in general but a bit over stays it's welcome towards the end. Russell Crowe is great as usual, and he is supported by a fine ensemble of actors that gives him something to work with.  The battles at sea are far and the away the best of its nature, and the period is well represented. If they only could only cut about a half-hour from the film, them it would have been a much better movie.
All and all a great time at the movies.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
407,iawen_of_lorien,Excellent!,10,6 April 2004,"This movie is excellent.  One of the few historical fiction movies that can't be criticized for historical inaccuracy.  It shows how sailors of the British navy lived at the time of the Napoleonic Wars.  Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany were perfect in their roles as Jack and Stephen; they both had their characters down great, and they excellently captured the friendship between Jack and Stephen from the books.  I highly recommend seeing this movie, and then reading the books.  Don't watch this movie as an epic, watch it for the characters, or else you'll miss what makes this movie so great!

408,Dan_323,Favorite Film Ever,10,27 December 2013,"One of my favorite movies if not my very favorite movie ever. Extremely engaging and exciting plot with the right amount of action-packed violent battle scenes at the right times. Perfect movie for military warfare and history buffs like me and for men and boys. I love period war films. ^^ Also what made this film a most enjoyable experience for me, as an avid classical music listener and violinist, is the use of classical music in the soundtrack. I especially loved that very poignant scene - with Corelli's Adagio from his Concerto Grosso in G Minor playing - of the injured Maturin being carried into the scenic Galapagos Islands and also that scene when they reached the Islands themselves with Bach's Cello Suite Number 1 Prelude playing. I also liked the fact that Aubrey and Maturin were apparently not just excellent at their respective professions - let alone Maturin's naturalist hobby - they just so also happened to be an excellent violin-cello duo! This film was truly the best of both worlds for me. In reality though, the adeptness of this pair at so many skills would seem most improbable and make me extremely jealous, but in fiction, well - it's just awesome! xD Although I would have preferred Russell Crowe could have at least have not held the violin so clumsily though. He could have done with several more violin lessons! :P Still, amazing how these film technicians can somewhat simulate the actual fingerings for those pieces into the actor's hands. Not exactly a perfect simulation though as any cellist or violinist, or any musician for that matter, can still tell it's being faked, but very cool nonetheless!Gave this a perfect ten. Even after the fourth time or so watching this yesterday, I couldn't help smiling and laughing like a giddy boy at the excellently played-out battle scenes and especially at that ""lesser of two weevils"" joke. xD Russell Crowe also really played his character like he truly was Captain Jack Aubrey and I could not help but feel extremely moved and inspired by him whenever he rallied his men during his speeches - as if I was right there among his men, listening to him. This film, unlike most, gives its characters the kind of depth you often only find in book characters; you become attached to them. Like how this film explores Aubrey's struggle to compromise his conviction toward his duty and his men, sometimes having to ""choose the lesser of two weevils"". :P One may think they are one and the same, but the film shows he often had to choose between one or the other - whether to head back to land to save his best friend's life or chase down the Acheron, to save the life of a man overboard or risk the lives of his whole crew and ship during a storm. The film expounds on themes of fellowship, friendship and duty in a time of war when they become tested. Although I haven't yet read the books yet, I feel confident in saying that this film does justice to portraying the books. I've downloaded the whole collection to the book series just because of this movie and I will get to reading them eventually. I have a feeling that the books will prove equally or more exciting. Here's to hoping that they'll make a whole film series eventually! This is much more deserving of its own series than that superficial Pirates of the Caribbean crap. It would be incredibly disappointing if Hollywood would leave this largely untapped cultural treasure to waste.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
409,dmc42c,"Bettany, Crowe, and considerable atmosphere ALMOST keep M&C afloat",2,19 April 2004,"First of all, you should know where I'm coming from.  My favorite genre is historical epic, and I am in general a great admirer of Crowe and his films. In this case, though, the few redeeming qualities of Master and Commander, in which Crowe's performance is included, simply do not add up to an end result that is worthwhile. The only reasons I can imagine to see this movie would be if you were researching for an essay about Russell Crowe, find visual effects to be paramount in a film's overall value, or are unqualified in your interest in all things related to British naval history. Aside from these purposes, I can not imagine how a viewer could leave this film satisfied.  While there may actually be a plot, it is certainly hard to discern.  At best, it is disjointed and decentralized. All that being said, this film is still a credit to the acting talents of Crowe and Bettany, and to the abilities of those responsible for its technical merits, of which there are many. Sadly, though, these efforts are wasted on a film that is truly worthless otherwise.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

If you've read the series of books, Master and Commander, you were left frustrated that they left out so much. Again, its a two-plus hour movie, so I understand. I went with some friends that did not read the books and they were very confused about a lot of things. All in all, it was great to see it as a film and considering how many films-from-books get slammed about the differences, this was no John Grisham, The Firm - type let down.  Russell Crowe did an amazing job and it's unfortunate he was overlooked by the Academy this year, but I guess Sean Penn has been due for some time now - I'm just glad he was there to get his Oscar.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Weir was a nationalist in Australia, a proper left winger yet we see him here in M&C praising England/Britain for their fine seamanship and esprit De corps...I wonder why he would do this; the ageing process made him see sense perhaps? :P9 9 99 9 99 9",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
414,sublunari,Not just a historical movie--The Historical Movie,10,9 October 2005,"This is a beautiful movie, an intellectual movie, and an action movie. Flashing fog shoots cannonballs; the moon paints shadows of ropes and climbing crewmen upon the sails; lizards, birds, and insects flee from a pile of opened traps. Military strategy, history, evolution, superstition, friendship, and leadership are all philosophical subjects discussed in the picture. The movie is really about two warships--and their captains--trying to destroy one another, with several minor adventures mixed into the story. The realism is such that never for a moment do you doubt that these people are from the turn of the 19th century, that they are on a ship fighting during the height of the British Empire. This movie is the Das Boot of the 1800s. Although I'd recommend this movie to anyone, if you're really into films with a lot of fast CG cars, CG tentacles, idiotic teenagers, or idiotic teenagers falling in love, you probably won't enjoy Master and Commander as much as I did. If, on the other hand, you're tired of boring historical movies or vacuous blockbusters like The Patriot, this is a film that will restore your faith in the belief that good movies can be made once in awhile, even in this day and age.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

The story is so fluid it is almost impossible to predict what could happen, yet there's a sense of security knowing that no matter what happens it will undoubtedly pay dividends to the plot. Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany's partnership is truly existential but they make it feel so obtainable. The film relates ""strength, respect, and discipline"" and truly that is what the film personifies. From the leading role to main antagonist, there's a feeling of respect as well as ingenuity that the story magnifies. It's truly a shame that this franchise did not get to take off, because this storyline has endless potential.

Plenty of action, but linked with some of the (movized) reality of what life on an extended sea voyage in a crowded man-o-war must have been like.Russell Crowe is pretty obnoxious and arrogant in real life and a lot of times that comes across in his movies in my opinion, but not this one. Besides, a number of scenes are stolen by his supporting cast especially the young boys and Paul Bettany who I thought was marvelous as Geoffrey Chaucer in 'A Knights Tale'I particularly enjoyed the string instruments and Russel Crowe's violin technique. In an interview he noted the hardest part of his role was to learn to look convincing playing the violin. He did a reasonable job of it (save his lack of vibrato action to match the music over - but it takes a while to get that far with a fiddle!).An entertaining flick.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

418,basementbanter,Maximus with Guns? Master and Commander,8,11 May 2017,"Read More: http://basementbanter.com/530-2/Have you ever wondered what would happen if you gave Maximus from Gladiator a gun, a cannon and a frigate? Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World answers that question in glorious, bloody fashion. Master and Commander is an epic naval Napoleonic war movie where Britain and France fought for control of the seas. With maybe the most badass character ever put to screen in Russel Crowe's Captain 'Lucky' Jack Aubrey, and more epic shots than any movie out there, I cannot praise this movie enough. Showcasing more charisma, machismo, and intelligence than any other of his roles; other than maybe Maximus, Crowe becomes the bold and cunning naval captain of the HMS Surprise. Captain Aubrey goes on a daring mission to the far side of the world, chasing a French Ship.Featuring a fantastic cast with several people you sort of recognize like Vision, from the Avengers movies, either Mary or Pippin I can never tell them apart, and some bloke from Agent Carter. Crowe and Paul Bettany (Vision) have excellent chemistry together as they play best friends and trusted confidants. Bettany shines as Dr. Maturin, the surgeon and head doctor on the ship. Dr. Maturin has little nautical experience, so most of the many laughs of the film come from him. His dead pan delivery expressing his confusion about what is going on with the ship creates much needed comedic relief. The rest of the cast are mostly unprofessional actors who have experience on the sea, making the movie feel all the more authentic as you travel back in history to a time of adventure.After his ship is nearly destroyed Captain Jack Aubrey pursues the French ship, The Acheron. It is a new breed of ship that the British have not seen before. The crew of the Surprise go south, around South America and back north towards the Galapagos Islands. The journey pushes Jack Aubrey, and his crew, to their physical and mental limits, testing his leadership and skills as a Captain. From the beginning to the end there is action a plenty, cannons blowing peoples arms off, excellent sword fights, clever problem solving, a man doing surgery on himself (fucking insane), and the best ship to ship combat ever put to film.As will soon become evident, many, many of the movies I love came from my Father making me watch them, this was one of the first ones he made me watch. I watched this when I was 12, and I immediately fell in love with the ocean, and the time period. This movie perfectly blends the swashbuckling adventures of an Indiana Jones or Pirates of the Caribbean movie with the somber and serious take on war and its hardships from Saving Private Ryan or The Hurt Locker.The movie flows between awesome badassery, somber slow moments, and back to action. You will care about all the characters and wince every time someone gets hurt. Every shot that Crowe is in, he improves through his amazing, and complicated performance. All in one he is a bad ass soldier, loving father figure, caring best friend, trying musician, and stern leader. I cannot heap enough praise on him. This is one of my top 20 favorite movies of all time, and I could watch it again and again. I highly recommend this movie, and encourage you to check out other movies by the great Peter Weir. This movie does not get enough attention and while it did get many Oscar nominations, not enough people saw it. I implore you to go see it, all things considered I can almost guarantee you will enjoy it.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

I wasn't prepared for this one, you see! I very rarely respond emotionally to the characters in a movie but this is one exception! I don't know what it was -- maybe the restraint present in each role, particularly that of the anguished midshipman Hollom. When painful things happened to the characters, I couldn't dismiss the characters as overacted or unrealistic -- they are real people and you care about them.I was surprised to read some comments on the film suggesting that the film lacks humour -- I really have to question these critics' definition of humour! Although the film does not contain many deliberately ""comic"" moments (save the lovely weevil joke!), a gentle sense of humour is present throughout -- you couldn't put this variety of different characters together on one ship and not get humorous situations! Another very strong point of M&C is the music, which combines classical music with modern compositions and complements the settings perfectly.This is a truly beautiful, wonderfully acted film. It can't really be classed as an action movie, which will put some people off, but if you're in a thoughtful mood, I can't think of any more rewarding film.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Peter Weir is a master of detail.The characters are real, from Lucky Jack to Cousin Joe. Their dialects are authentic early 1800's, lower class Britain. The cinematography is spectacular, the ship is beautiful in its woodwork and rigging detail and the sounds of creaking masts against the wind are ubiquitous. The roar of the cannons and the chain and bar shot as it rips through the audience is electrifying.The only sense that could not be stimulated by this movie was that of smell.

Big Ships, Big Battles, sword-fights and all. This raised especially after the success of Pirates, the expectation for Master and Commander to be alike. Yet, what the film really showed, was human relationships at sea, drama, with suspense elements some action and a battle here and there aboard an 18th century ship.That's why people's expectations were disappointed and in terms of Box Office revenue it dropped of so quickly from week 1 to week 2 but not to week 3.

422,tegg96,"Superb, amazingly real and emotional.",10,7 December 2003,"This film has prompted me to put some comments here at IMDB, which is a rarity. A movie that takes you by the neck and never looses its grip for the entire journey. For me the thing that made it was its believability. I was there on the ship in the first few moments in the calmness of the fog, then, a distant flash, and all hell breaks loose as the HMS Surprise is pulverised by enemy cannons. Never has an action scene appeared as forcefully and emotional as the first ten minutes of this film.Over the past few years I have failed to `get into' hardly any new action-adventure movies. The Star Wars prequels, Matrix sequels, have all disappointed because of the low believability factor for me. But here is a movie that makes you believe again in the `movies' and there ability to take you to another time and place and feel for the people involved.
Not once did I think I was looking at any computer generated scenes or looking at a ship in a `big tank', so the effects were perfect, that is, they didn't look like effects, they were seamless.So here we have action, drama, adventure on a grand scale. And no BS love connection to annoy the hell out us and the progress of the HMS Surprise.This is a 10 out 10 movie for me.Here is some of my other favourites in no order or significanceTerminator 1, Terminator 3, Titanic, Minority ReportSome movies I didn't likePearl Harbour, Attack of the Clones, Fast and Furious",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

They bought one ship and made a second one from scratch to make this movie! Weir the director stated his intent to make the movie achieve the above Summarized goal. For my money he succeeded. Ten out of Ten for this one. The use of early music played by the Captain and the Doctor to bring in the civilized nature of both men was brilliant, and Mr Crowe studied the violin enough to be able to accurately act the playing, and the above clips include some of his actual playing. He had never touched the instrument before, likewise his co-star on the cello. There are only a few movies in this category, perhaps A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS is comparable, and I viewed it twice on successive nights. It has so much truly authentic detail and depth of action that it could be profitably viewed monthly for a year. UNMISSABLE. And I had never heard of it before late 2009.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
424,Captainzoupy,Greatest naval war film ever made and that's saying something,10,16 July 2006,Master and Comander The far side of the world is without doubt one of the most spectacular and riveting movies on naval war ever made. The film starts in the south Atlantic ocean where a battle begins between the British HMS Surprise and the French Acheron. Jack Aubrey (Crowe) commander of the surprise is both himself and his crew surprised and out gunned by the larger Acheron. After he narrowly escapes defeat he goes on the hunt in a cat and mouse game with the french Acheron it 's witty captain who Jack Aubrey knows nearly nothing about. This film is bound to leave even the most anti English fan howling for more. Both the story and the action make this film a masterpiece that will certainly command any screen.,Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

This also means that nothing other than my enjoyment was at stake.The movie itself moves quickly and truly gives you a feeling for the life that these people led at sea. Russel Crowe and the rest of the supporting cast are wonderfully convincing, making one forget at times that you are watching a movie. Invested in all the characters I really felt for them as they lived their daily lives in a small wooden ship, at the whim of whatever Nature and Napolean could throw at them.*Caution* This May Spoil It for some people.The plot for the movie is deceptively simple compared to what you see on film. Jack Aubrey has orders to defend the Brazilian cost. When the H.M.S Surprise is attacked he takes these orders into his own hands and chases the attacking ship for all it's worth. But that isn't what the Director seems to be interested in. Peter Wier gives us the chase, but he shows so much more as well.If you're not into realistic battle scenes and the hard, rather dirty, and very cramped life of the professional sailor this movie is not for you. If you are, and you want to see as close as a filmmaker can get to the real thing, the film is definitely a must see.7 out of 10.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

I'm still trying to figure out how I was supposed to care about anyone else in this movie. I wanted Crowe to lose a limb or at least fall overboard or something.Plus, even though Paul Bettany saved the film from total failure, he was playing a thinly disguised Charles Darwin, who is reality a) made his voyage on the HMS Beagle in the 1840s (way later than the movie) and b) did his studies on ecological adaptations of the beaks of finches, not flightless cormorants.The big flaws are too many story lines, too much Crowe, not enough Bettany, lots of actors that can't enunciate, and lack of character development for Crowe's character or the secondary surgeon (Higgins?) or the ""Jonah"" of the ship. Maybe if the writers/director/actors had made me care, i wouldn't have spent the last hour and a half of the movie hoping for Moby Dick, Jaws, or a combination.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

I thought the characters weren't deep enough and there was just too much seemlingly meaningless dialogue.  I think the movie could have been 45 minutes shorter and just as effective.  The movie's trailers lead you to believe it's more of an action film, but that is certainly not the case at all.  Expect to spend 45 minutes after the first 15 minutes watching slow and tedious dialogue.Still, the good parts were pretty good.

431,sylviaspence,NOT JUST GLADIATOR ON WATER,8,15 November 2003,"I implore you to give this film a fair chance if you are smart.  I went into the theater with high hopes, being a Russell Crowe faithful follower. This is a big different from what I have seen of director- Peter Weir.  Of his filmography, I have seen early Mel Gibson in Gallipoli, early Harrison Ford in Witness, the always go-to Dead Poets' Society, the though provoking and Oscar begging Truman Show, and now Master and Commander. From what I have seen, this is a very different feel from Mr. Weir. The film was not as epic as I expected, but the storyline was well written and easily held my interest.  I've heard talk of Russell Crowe and best actor, which would be an amazing three nominations under his belt.  It was nice to see another performance from Russell Crowe's buddy, Paul Bettany, non-existent roommate to a beautiful mind.   His performance grips you at quite painful times, in which you really feel his character's pain.Filmed on the same waters as Titanic, I must say that this film is much more deserving of academy recognition.  I don't know if I can quite say best picture, but I hope to see a not to Mr.  Crowe, soon-to-be-new-father.  I would love to see a best picture nomination, but it seems my vote will probably be going to Return of the King.

432,gschrive87,Just awful,1,15 June 2004,"I hate those movies that you watch for an hour and still have no clue what's going on. Such was the case with this movie. The dialogue was so soft that it was little over mumbling much of the time. The plot twisted and turned so much that I couldn't make heads or tails of what was going on. After an hour, I turned the movie off in frustration. Other than them being a British ship fighting the French, I never understood anything more of the movie. Perhaps more narration would have helped. As it was, I was too frustrated to watch the movie further. The movie ""Dune"" is still my #1 worst movie I've ever watched, but ""Master and Commander"" is a very close #2.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
433,danny_jackie,Dull would be a little harsh but not far off the truth,3,16 April 2004,"There are some nice points...The Attention to detail and the sense of place... The film however is without soul, feeling or any emotive drive whatsoever. RC plays yet again his stock New Zealand actors role (what happened to the guy we saw could act in A Beautiful Mind).. The film is messy you simply dont care one iota for any of the characters.. At one point rounding the Horn A sailor has to be sacrificed, the scene is so lacking in any power or feeling .. You would be hard pressed to even know which character has been lost.. The Galley scenes are pathetic with no narrative or plot drive and come over like some weak soap opera. The Surgeon is well potrayed but only works when hes on his own, when hes with RC even the blocking of the scene is embarrasing to watch as they fumble with there musical instruments..(NOTE to directors things that work in books dont always work on film)...One puzzling aspect to the film is why there is a lack of cohesive thematic scoring..this would at least give you some clues as to where the drive of the film is because you would be hard pressed to catch it in the performances.. Instead we have to put up with inserted excerpts of Classical Music which are all totally inaproppiate (what the hell is Vaughen Williams fantasy on Thomas Tallis doing in there)..Absolute waste of time...It resembles a film where so much time was spent on second unit work that the director failed to realise he didnt have enough coverage to actually put a story together before it was to late...",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

A movie that will make you cry and laugh with joy is what Weir has brought to the screen.Crowe who plays the infamous 'Lucky Jack' in another role that bloody well suits him makes you want to hate him. He has to much pride in him that could kill his whole crew and his best friend Steve tells him that. But still he goes with what his head says not his heart until his friend gets shot.But you got to love a guy, who plays a violin so well and can make a crew smile even in a middle of a crisis. The crew themselves work together like glue to paper. The child actors act more older than the adult actors in some instances and they prove themselves.Master and Commander: The Far Side of The World, with a nine word title does drag and it cannot be helped when a peep of the watch is done.

Russell Crowe was very good in the role in demonstrating true leadership. Supporting performances were adequate but what this film lacked was any love interest or background of any of the crew including Aubry the commander.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
437,mcandy,No nonsense,9,3 December 2003,"On leaving the cinema last night, two women in front of me complained that the film was boring, and that they should have stayed in and watched Eastenders. How foolish. This is a fantastic film on a number of levels. Firstly for those of you who are proud of your heritage and have had enough of Hollywood constantly denigrating the British, then fear not, because this portrays us in a positive light. Secondly what a wonderful picture is painted of life in the early 19th century Royal Navy- the songs, the food, even sleeping, or how the decks were converted before action occurring. It shows the grim realities of war at sea, and just how difficult it was to sail these magnificant looking ships.The game of cat and mouse between the French privateer and HMS Surprise is broken up by these interesting sequences. The doctor is well placed, because he can play devils advocate without incurring the penalties of mutiny etc. The climatic fight scene is as good as anything I've seen in a cinema. Russell Crowe is as ever on imperious form, as is Paul Bettany. However the young midshipmen- unlike their ship- are not wooden, with some fine performances, certainly talent is there for the future. James D'Arcy comes of age with a well crafted performance showing an array of emotions.Splendid effort all round. Bravo. What a way to return to the naval genre!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

It doesn't follow the traditional progression of movies with typical villians and heros, typical plot twists and typical pacing.  This is simply the time in the life of British sailors.Bad things happen, and some good arises from it.  It all progresses as a real adventure.  This movie is almost a documentary.  A documentary that is incredibly entertaining and spellbinding.Russell Crowe gives a wonderfully subdued performance.  Whereas other actors may have gone over the top with cliche sailor acting, he has a subtlety that speaks bounds more than any cliche dialogue.Everyone else aboard the ship gave their part just as they should have. Nobody was out of place.Definitely a contender for Best Picture.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
441,meshosh,This could have been a great film.,5,26 February 2004,"This film is very interesting if you like looking for what went wrong. It has a great cast, director, a beautiful enviroment, and awesome special FX... But there is something missing. I am not sure what it is, but something is not right about this film. I have some ideas, though. first: the characters.. there is no sense of depth in any of the characters. they don´t tell anything about then, like where did they came from, and what they want. This fact can explain my other thought on this film: it looks like a chapter of a much longer story, like it started from the middle and did not come to an end. That may be why this film looks so long, without any strong characters and goals, its never clear where the story might end. this could be a good thing, but not in this case.. it just makes the film a somewhat unpredictable, but also uninteresting. To sum up, I would say that this film is not worth it, I would rate it as a 5/10, just because of Russel Crowe and his great performance (as usual) and some of the action sequences.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

I'm sure that the historical accuracy was most likely right on the money, I just wanted more.  I felt that this film lacked enough conflict, internally or externally.  One word about the plot, there was none.  The film makers spent so much time trying to get so much in the film, the story itself was lost.  You'd do better to watch the Pirates of the Carribean, or even the ride at Disney Land would be more enjoyable than this film.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

444,audission,Disjointed,3,1 November 2005,"Having seen this film touted as Oscar material, and being something of a fan of Russell Crowe and Peter Weir, I bought this DVD on spec. Sorry to say, I was disappointed.Although supposedly based on a true story (it was written in the early 70s as part of a series, and loosely based on a real captain in the Napolenic Wars.) In short then, it is not supposed to accurately reflect a historical event.Which left me wondering why not simply tell the story of Nelson at Trafalgar, since we're asked to believe Captain Aubrey was a friend of his anyway? Instead of being a strong naval figure who can inspire his men like Captain Bligh or Hornblower, in M&C he comes across as a rather bland older brother. We find out he is intent on pursuing a french warship whatever the cost, but why, is never explained? At no point is he particularly wronged, and at no point did I ever really feel the HMS Surprise was in any danger.Likewise the relationship with the ship's doctor is supposedly full of humour, and double-act of sorts (according to the publisher of the books.) However on the screen the relationship came across as bizarre - a slanging match between the captain and the doctor over whether to go and collect animal specimens or fight the French??? Who exactly IS in command here?And as before, since the doctor is essentially a fictionalised Charles Darwin, why not make ""The Voyage of the Beagle"" - the movie - instead of this pulpy serial?In short I found it wholly lacking in character development, I didn't really believe many of the characters, and those that I did I still couldn't care whether they lived or died.A shame.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
445,molemonty,A beautiful film that rewards repeat viewings.,9,23 February 2005,"I must have watched this movie a dozen times, without tiring of it. The performances are excellent, and having read all of the Aubrey-Maturin canon as a result of seeing the film I can testify to the sheer faithfulness to character and period detail. Very unlucky not to win the Best Picture Oscar, this is such an immersive experience you can practically smell the sea air and feel the canvas.Plotwise, this is very much a composite of the books as no doubt many viewers have pointed out. For me the only drawback about this is that it rules out the possibility of a sequel. Probably Paul Bettany's finest performance to date, and he's a year younger than me, the talented so-and-so.Just watch it; this is the closest any of us will get to the Napoleonic War and 19th Century medicine. Unless we get treatment on the UK National Health Service of course.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

I'm not a big fan of Russel Crowe, but he is certainly one of the best actors of our time. After seeing this movie a few more times on TV since, I've now come to really enjoy it. It's just so well done. It's a credit to the masterful Peter Weir who kicked butt on the Truman Show as well. He is an intelligent director who doesn't have to have a neatly wrapped Hollywood happy ending with his films. Master and Commander is strangely satisfying, exciting, touching, and suspenseful all at the same time. Russell Crowe really wears this role well. Paul Bettany is a fantastic actor as well, and takes on the doctor role here with skill I thought. It's definitely worth the price of admission.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
447,JohnOhka,Impressively authentic,8,7 June 2005,"It's amazing for me to think of warfare conducted at the whim of the wind, yet these sailors would almost drift alongside on another and fire at point blank range. I enjoyed the first battle were cannon balls from Acheron can seen flying through the air towards HMS Surprise - considering the low velocity of those guns - you possibly could have see a shot coming and ducked for cover! I found Russel Crowe thoroughly engaging - even more so in M&C than in Beautiful Mind. The scene in which he helps the doctor in surgery on the island is fascinating. One gets a wonderful feeling of the cramped spaces with men moving about in crouching positions due to the low decks. Having visited some of these ancient fighting ships in maritime museums, I realized that they were quite small and flimsy by modern warship standards. Continuity: I agree with comments about the ship making 5 kts with her sails limp. Is it my error or does Lord Blackney's arm grow back? He seems to have two hands on his sextant when their second encounter with Acheron gets underway.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
448,kellernail,A Genre Defining Masterpiece,9,13 February 2021,"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is an engrossing and deeply fascinating film that offers a detailed look into naval warfare in the early 1800s. It faithfully adapts the works of Patrick O'Brian by telling the story of the British warship, the HMS Surprise, and her crew's mission to seek and destroy a French privateer during the early phases of the Napoleonic Wars. The story highlights the hardships and brutality of the conflict, exemplifying the myriad dangers and perils that sailors faced before, during, and after battle.The story is centered around the film's protagonist, Captain Aubrey (played by Russel Crow), and much of the plot revolves around the cat and mouse hunt between the two ships that are set upon each other's destruction. Several intense naval battle scenes punctuate long stretches of tension and subsequent character development as this time is used to demonstrate the juxtaposition of both the fierce camaraderie and the growing resentment and unease between sailors at war. While the pacing could be seen as slow and perhaps plodding at times, the strong performances and painstaking attention to detail make for a thoroughly enjoyable viewing experience. How much the viewer enjoys him or herself however, is really dependent on how he or she enjoys either history or maritime adventures, so take my fervent recommendation of the movie with a grain of salt. The score of the film is also worth mentioning as it is one of the best examples of atmospheric ambiance in a manner that is simultaneously accurate to the period portrayed and effective at establishing tone in various types of scenes throughout the film.All in all, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is one of the foremost examples of a movie about naval warfare and is an absolute must see for enthusiasts of the genre or anyone with even a passing interest in the subject of maritime history.Score: 9 out of 10",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

It's true that the action is transferred from the Angl-American war of 1812-1815 to the Napoleonic Wars in order to appease American sensibilities but it's still a fascinating insight into how the Royal Navy of the day operated. I won't bother mentioning the main points of the plot seeing as plenty of reviewers have done so already but I will offer a word of advice - if you're unlikely to appreciate this movie's finer points then stick to watching Rambo I, II, XXVII etc. Those are the movies you're more likely to respond to - you redneck morons :0) .",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

If like me however you are not such a glutton for authentic early 19th century naval warfare then you may find this movie a tad dull. Yes the production values are excellent, yes the movie is well shot but as for the quality of the script I have no idea. Not because I wasn't paying attention, but because I basically couldn't hear a word of dialogue. Russell Crowe is a great actor (should have beaten Denzel to the best actor Oscar for a Beautiful Mind) but for some reason his acting in this film consists entirely of talking gruffly under his breath. Jack Aubrey may have been the most inspirational character to grace the screen in the past 50 years, but all I could think was 'speak up you mumbling idiot!' Not for the hard of hearing.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
451,DrNo,Excellent,10,17 November 2003,"Certainly one of the best movies of the year. Rare is it that you find a Hollywood release so true to the novels from which it was developed.
Although it is a fictional account, it is very accurate in its portrayal of the time, as well as life on board a British ship of war.
From what I've read of other comments, those who had cause for disent based it on relatively minor points, whether inconsequential or in keeping with a particular historical detail.If the battle scenes seemed loud and confusing, that's an accurate portrayal of how they were (and are).If there were times when the movie moved along sluggishly, that's because life onboard a ship in those days was even slower and largely more mundane, punctuated by brief moments of brutal fighting.Most of the negative comments I've read seem to reflect a lack of understanding of both the novels and historiocity behind them. On the other hand, those familiar with both, even if they haven't read the books, will immediately appreciate the attention to detail down to the smallest levels.
As another commentor said, and I agree, I think those who walk away disappointed do so because they were expecting a modern car chase at sea with lots of bright flashing explosions, all moving at a rapid pace they're more accustomed towards.Without a doubt, this movie is destined to become a classic not only in its particular genre, but on its own merits, as well.Once in a while, Hollywood surprises me and gets it right.

This film has everything:  flawless casting (Crowe will be up for an Oscar again), incredible cinematography totally done on location and bone-tickling sound.

The relationship between Aubrey and Maturin.  This relationship is central to the novels, but almost background to the film.  Furthermore, the film is ABOUT Aubrey, not the two of them, and Aubrey is shown to be a man without apparent weakness (far from the case in the books).  Perhaps this was intentional -- it certainly streamlines the film, and removes some pesky complexities which one could argue are easier to sustain in a literary form.

The characters were not arranged well. There is no challenge among captain and others who oppose going further after the first battle. I have to add that there was no sympathy toward the characters. In fact, its normal to feel that invaders deserve to be defeated. So you don't feel compassion toward the English guys who attack the French ship and ultimately were killed. I was really disappointed from this movie. The only good part of it is character of Doctor and nothing more.He has some points to make, but the captain is too stubborn to change his mind. On the whole, no challenging characters, no surprise and no new idea in this movie. I would score 3 out of 10 to this movie.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
460,macduggles,A really good adventure movie,9,27 November 2003,This is a movie for the boys who always imagined what it would be like on a sailing ship back in the days of sailing. For over two hours you are literally on that ship with the crew scrubbing and fighting; in the end I was very glad to get off that ship.,Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
461,gabycrow,"A Masterpiece, no matter what you folks say!",10,15 February 2004,"I can understand people not liking this movie.  They have just seen Pirates of the Caribbean and The Return of the King.  They were expecting blood, and thrilling action from the beginning to the end.  And what did Mr. Weir gave them?  A long, detailed tale of how life was on a war ship, those who look so beautiful from the outside, but were nothing like a vacation to live in for months and even years.  And that is awfully hard to do!  It merely proves how great a director Mr. Weir is, and how good actors Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany are.  This is a movie for those who can go a little deeper into every situation that's shown to them, and this is a movie for those who can understand how hard it is to move cameras in such little space.  I think this is a magnificent movie, that from now on will be considered the reference for all age of sail movies.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
462,rbpriv,"Real and well performed, a must see.",9,2 January 2004,"Even if the plot is not so dense of facts, to tell the truth everything starts from and goes on - from the beginning up to the closing titles - with the seek for the Acheron to the point that, at first sight, the spectator will come to think that every other scene has been added in order to make the movie a little bit longer, this is one of the movies that won't delude you. It's superbly shot (probably the director will receive a nomination to the Oscars, in case he won't we will know that critics are blind) and well balanced. Although the plot is centered on a battle, in fact, we have more by this movie: we can enjoy the true meaning of friendship, a relationship that endures despite opinion divergences and that eventually overcomes even navy orders, we will be light up by our commander firm authority just as his crew and finally we will win the fight against Acheron.Involving and real as never seen in movies of this genre, this is not a film everyone can look at: scenes like the surgeon's self operation are not tolerated by someone, so if your neighbour puts his hands on his own eyes you'll now why he acts like that!About the cast there's nothing to say except congratulations. Everyone has played his character in the finest way. Russel Crowe could really have been a frigate commander, even if sometimes he smiles too much for an authoritative Jack the Lucky. Anyway he should gain another Oscar nomination for his skill in playing such characters. We've yet seen him in ""The Gladiator"" and here he's not changed too much, impressive. Paul Bettany is the perfect companion for Crowe and as he did in ""A Beautiful Mind"" even here he is perfect. The surgeon isn't of easy interpretation since it's a double faced character. He cannot understand why his captain can be so wayward in following his orders so that he cannot forgive his friend to have broken his promise, but he is able to recognize the true friendship that links them when he finds himself on the Caymans shot and near to death. He cannot share the same views of his friend but he doesn't hesitate to set aside his interests when needed. These opposites find an unique harmony in his performance and this makes the surgeon so fascinating.Photography is enchanting and gloomy as needed in such a realistic sailing movie. Every shot is orchestrated so that the spectator feels part of the crew, struggling with them to obtain another victory for their commander and master of life Jack the Lucky.No one can say, after Master and Commander, it was easy to be on a frigate but everyone would love to have been on it, at least one time, at least as a spectator.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

I was very surprised that there was only 1 woman..and Russel Crowe looked at her for about 1 minute, and that was it. The plot is very interesting, sad, but joyful and fills you with excitement. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Some of the jokes lean toward adults, but the action and advneture of the film would be appreciated by all ages.

Although it's a little confusing in the beginning, it pulls you in. You never leave the area of in and around the boat, so its a little hard to get a grasp on world events and the motivations of the captain/crew, but overall this was great! Not too much gore, the filmmakers used camera shake very well during the battle scenes to help stay with the PG-13 rating, so this is a Crowe movie (unlike Gladiator) that the younger ones might be able to watch also.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
465,drsalem72,Such a great actor,9,13 November 2003,"Russell Crowe delivers a stunning performance yet again in what is definitely an Oscar worthy role. Crowe stars as Captain Jack Aubrey, a British ship captain in 1805 who is given orders to disable a French ship and help stop the dominance of Napoleon.The film starts with a near miss as the two ships do battle, then follows Aubrey and his crew in their quest to outdo the bigger and better equipped Acheron. It gives an interesting viewpoint of what life at sea was like during this period.Master & Commander also marks the return of director Peter Weir (The Truman Show, Dead Poets Society, Witness). He is also equally as worthy of an Oscar for his work, provided they haven't already etched Peter Jackson's name on the statuette.Visually stunning and masterfully acted, I believe this is one of the best movies of the year.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
466,whindbagg1,Pretty Good Time Machine,9,15 November 2003,"I will review this movie on three levels. First, regarding the writing: Very good. the plot touches on the expected themes of duty, honor, and loyalty with some interesting asides, although I found Crowe's Aubrey to come uncomfortably close to the stock ""commander"" figure: wise, modest, dutiful, firm but compassionate. Having said that, however, we see Aubrey's sense of duty really tested against personal loyalty. We also see, no matter how elevated the rank and ""enlightened"" the personality, superstition still is part of the fabric of the day to day life aboard a ship of the nineteenth century. There is also an intriguing attempt to ""pace"" the film by repeatedly cutting to shots of the ship's hour glass being turned over and the ship's bell being rung to mark the watches. We also see the conflict between the two ships as something of a very drawn out duel: the antagonist, though unseen, takes on a personality. In the quieter moments we see the French captain given his due by Aubrey without fanfare.On a technical level, I regarded this film as being almost flawless. I don't think I've ever seen a better rendition of ""Wooden Ships and Iron Men on a Bounding Mane""...the miniatures are flawless, the water effects first-rate, motion control superb. I've noted that in other movies of ships at sea CG has a very hard time rendering the boundary between a hull and the water, as well as the wake. From what I could see this movie neatly sidestepped most of this problem by using low angles that obscured the waterline by hiding it behind a swell. It isn't pronounced and felt quite natural. The last level I want to mention is historical authenticity. Clearly this movie was well researched and comes pretty close to accurately portraying ship-board life at the time. When I saw how well the film transported me to 1805 I found my expectations raised to the point that I felt a few elements got short shrift. Firstly, we see no effort to impress sailors, a common practice at the time. Also, I felt we didn't see an accurate portrayal of shipboard discipline: whippings and beatings were a lot more common, even aboard ships with so called ""benevolent"" captains. Also, it was a common practice to spread sawdust on the decks prior to battle so that the crew could keep their feet when the decks became slippery with blood. This was barely touched on. Can you imagine the sense of foreboding this element would have added, especially in the second battle scene after, say, we had been treated to a view of decks literally running with blood? I believe including those two elements would have helped enormously. Also, in one scene we see an attempt to disable a ship using solid shot against masts rather than other ordnance that targeted the rigging. These are however, minor quibbles from a maritime enthusiast looking for a flawless time machine. My only real annoyance with the movie are the scenes where we see the captain and his surgeon ""jamming"" on violin and cello. It is the most inept mismatch I've ever seen between what we are seeing and what we are hearing. Crowe is totally unconvincing in his depiction of a musician. We might as well be seeing him playing ""air violin"". We hear at one point a trio and there are only two instruments. We see a cello playing but hear a viola. After all the fidelity given to other elements in the story the effect was quite jarring. That said, however, I'm certain for the majority of the movie-going public it'll be quite adequate. I believe this'll have a long run in the theaters. Huzzahs for Peter Weir, Universal, Miramax, 20th Century Fox, and Samuel Goldwyn Films. I give this film a nine out of ten.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

I liked the story, the execution of the story by the actors and the director. Russel Crowe really depicted the Captain well and I thought that the supporting cast were superb. The photography really enhanced the scope of the story, and I must take my hat off to the photographic skills of the photographic director.One tends to forget that this story is not a high speed chase film with lots of blood and gore however it does have its share, although, the speed of the story is greatly paralleled by the speed at which a sea chase would have happened 200 years ago.It is great to watch a movie that really gets to the heart of the emotions of the crew of a Man-Of-War vessel, not just making the crew look like the hardest SOB's around.And to that I take my hat off to the Cast and Crew, as well as the writers and the director and producers of this production.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Russell Crowe uses his genuine charm and humour to create a character who is not simply heroic but complex. The remaining cast are perfect in every nuance of authentic shipboard life in 1805.

475,beerfarmer,"the joy of imagination, the age of discovery, and advice for those handicapped by short attention spans.",8,20 November 2003,"having never read any of the novels in the series of the same name, i can make no comment as to the accuracy or quality of this film in respect to its adaptation from book.  what drew me to view this film, something which i was very excited to do as soon as i learned of its debut, was not its cast nor its director, but the interest i have in anything related to the sea, sailing and the lost age of great sailing ships.  i went with the hope that this film could get that right.  while there are many minor details which i can easily take objection to, i walked away very satisfied with the recreation of life aboard sea which this film portrays.
this film accurately portrays the life that would be confronted at sea in so many details.  the great dichotomy between the lives of officers and the lives of deckhands, rightfully portrayed by differing foods served to the crew and officers, their respective living quarters, even the quality and quantity of conversation which these two, often adversarial sectors of the ship would enjoy is seemingly true to form.  the long, post-dinner conversations amongst the officers over glasses of port punctuated with humor and marked by a literate and skillful ability to speak, share stories and entertain in a manner which predates television and our hurried society is starkly contrast by the ""old salt"", a cinematic cliche perhaps, below-decks as he warns of the bad luck experienced by all crew each time an unpopular and inept officer holds watch on deck.  these crew would most certainly have been illiterate, uneducated and from the poor classes of england and would have been very susceptible to the superstitions and paranoia that long periods at sea could induce.moments of intense experience are strikingly contrast with long periods of little event: a man lost overboard and the effects of broken rigging trailing in the sea abaft are successfully portrayed (even though one must acknowledge that any verbal hailing to the overboard crew would have been inaudible and that his honest chances of getting back on board were nil in those sea conditions), as are the long, tiring and dismally hot days (sometimes experienced for weeks) that would most definitely have been encountered in the doldrums near the equator.  the immediate elation experienced by crew during the strong  rains which followed such a sweltering and monotonous episode is well done; one feels good for those on film as they dance happily on deck.while there are so many other great and subtle moments in this film, and admittedly some aspects to the plot and character development which fall short (one must ""suspend their disbelief"" during a few occasions), the film is excellent overall.ultimately, and i have read many other's reviews of this film, what any viewer needs is realistic expectations.  this film is not set in our cell-phone frenzied, sound-byte age but unfolds in a time when time itself was experienced very differently.  when new worlds (such as the galapagos) were first seen in the flesh and not on television or on-line while booking a flight.  can we imagine what this experience would have been like?  are you interested?  if yes, then please see this film: you will greatly enjoy it while overlooking the minor shortcomings which it does possess. however, if you've never engaged your imagination upon what has come before and how it may have been, if you have no curiosity about life at sea during the great age of sail, no passion for exploring new worlds and can sense no mystery beyond the horizon as you lay upon a summer beach, headphones concealing the sound of the breaking waves, then i do have strong advice for you: stay at home and watch football, i guarantee you will enjoy those three hours so much more.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
476,tannhauser_fi,Old time sea adventure updated (a few spoilers),9,28 January 2004,"Every 20 years, Hollywood remembers a genre that needs a good update, and this year's genre's been sea adventures. First, one of the best movies of the summer, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" (congratulations to Johnny Depp for his nomination) and then, now, one of the year's best movies (with permission of ""The Return of the King"", probably the best).
""Master and Commander, The Far Side of the World"" Is more than a ""ships movie"". A wonderful story, full of the details that give depth and feeling to a movie. Script, Characters, Landscapes, Music and Stages are first quality, as all the cast. You know when cast & crew believe in what they are doing, and this time it's obvious. Peter Weir, First-class director and writer, builds a majestic movie around a majestic story, where every FX serves to the scene, without overloading it. His sense of narration is great, and a long and not-full-of-action movie elapses in an eyeblink, leaving you crying for more.One of the things I liked most was the relation between Capt. Aubrey (Russel Crowe) and Dr. Maturin (Paul Bettany). Both, strong and experienced men, share an educated, artistic mind that comes in conflict when Aubrey, a Soldier, must choose between carrying out his orders, or make Maturin's dream of become the first scientist in the galapagos come true.To sum up, a deep and intense movie, very real and realistic, that deserves the 10 nominations that has received.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

478,martingrahamwatson,A wonderful tale worthy of legend.,10,22 April 2004,"Master and Commander is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It portrays life at sea during the era of the wooden warship wonderfully. There are those that have commented that the characters are not explored emotionally. Of course they weren't! Those where the days of wooden ships and iron men. On top of that they were serving in the Royal Navy, the English Royal Navy that is. Emotion was not a thing one indulged in during that time period on His Majesty's ships! I thought the movie portrayed very well the ""life"", it did not show the downtime, fair enough, but who wants to watch a movie about a bunch of sailors doing nothing for weeks on end? The downtime was implied, you had to look for it...Now for the things Master and Commander brought to the screen (and the public awareness about that era).The ship: beautiful! A wonderful recreation of the beautiful sailing and fighting vessels of the time. What a time that must have been when men sailed the world and every new port was a discovery mission of a kind, when they had to rely on their wits and skills to get through every day.
Lucky Jack: I have only one question about Lucky Jack. Who did he p*** off to end up with a 28 gunner? In 1805 the British ships of the line (the wooden walls of England) where a little more capable than the 28 gun probably a ""6 rater"" that Jack commanded. At the time Vice Admiral Lord Nelson was sailing the Victory, she was a 104 gun ""1st rater"" and there weren't too many ships in service that were too much smaller than her.Other than that I loved Russell's character, who couldn't? Tough but fair, a man of Honor, a born leader of men, and a good Friend to his best Friend (the doctor). Someone mentioned earlier that he was the Captain Kirk of the high seas. Well did anyone else notice that Jack's best Friend was the doctor? Kinda like Kirk and McCoy... Is it any wonder that Star Trek turned out that way given the source? Gene Roddenberry was a WWII B-17 pilot. He knew a little about the relationships that men build during ""trying"" times. I think that the writers of Master and Commander understood this too. That is why Jack is who he is and he chooses his close Friends wisely and he holds that friendship above all else. Captain Jack is a wise, interesting, multifaceted character. Maybe a little too perfect, but there must have been men like him somewhere in the service in those days, so why weave a yarn about a lesser man? I still wonder who he p***ed off to only command a 28 gunner! ;-)The Life: Well done! The hardships of a life at sea are well documented in this movie. The grisly account of medicine 100 (or so) years before another Englishman discovered Penicillin. The bug infested food (the lesser of two weevils). The food in the sailors quarters. The mess becoming the sick bay in times of battle. The Captains cabin being assembled and disassembled depending on the situation and time of day. The age of the young Officers and the powder monkeys. All brutally but honestly truisms of the time not portrayed well in most other period pieces that have been committed to film.The Directing/Writing: Better than par... I loved the fact that you did not get to ""see"" the battles from the perspective of the French. That was masterfully done. You only got the perspective of the English crew and because of that you lived their lives. You had the feeling of being one of them, you felt the way that men in that situation would have felt. If they filmed both sides of the battles it would have been as if you were an observer from the ""10,000 foot view"" and not a member of the crew. Besides, you didn't know what was going to happen in the end. If Quentin Tarantino had written and directed this movie both ships would have gone down with all hands... ;-)As a ""fan"" of the era of the Royal Navy's fighting wooden ships (which covers about 400 years) I was greatly impressed with Master and Commander. It was a triumph of modern cinema to bring to life a time we can only dream and wonder about. Sure Jack was a little too perfect and some of the crew were a little too brave but that is the stuff of tall tales. Tall tales of the sea, after that film I wish I had the oppotunity to join Jack and his crew on every voyage. That is what movies are all about.

I was surprised by some of the actors abilities in the movies, such as Crow and the good doctor. So different roles from their previous movies. Its a fairly long movie but well worth the rental. It was a movie that kept both mine and my husbands attention and that sometimes is very hard to do, as we have different tastes in movies for the most part.

Lot's of new faces such as James D'Arcy, Edward Woodall, Robert Pugh, Chris Larkin and so on. The Midshipman in the movie are very promising young actors, Max Pirkis, Max Benitz, Jack Randall, Richard Pates are very good young actors, Lee Ingleby also plays a Midshipman. The story is well set, Russell Crowe plays Jack Aubrey, the captain of the Surprise, Paul Bettany plays the ship's doctor. Hunting the French ship the Acheron in the pacific, makes a good movie. 95% of the movie takes place on the Surprise, a stop is made on the Galapgos islands is very beautiful. The acting is superb, beware, this movie does contain some very sad deaths, one of a young kid. Very exciting, wonderful music, great cast, including Billy Boyd, Pippin from Lord of the Rings. Contains some language, nothing to bad,a lot of Lord of the rings type violence, a boy's arm gets amputated early in the film(the camera is focused on the boys face.), the doctor has to do surgery on himself(a bit graphic might want to cover the little ones eyes or have them and weak stomachs out of the room), there are dead bodies seen at the end, this might be very sad for all of us, especially young children. i recommend that 11 years and up for kids.

481,alleahna-1,It gets 10 out of 10 for cinematography and 4 out of 4 for story,4,4 June 2005,"If you have never read the books I would imagine this is quite a sweeping adventure and Russell Crowe has the charisma to carry it along. Peter Weir was painstaking (but not quite enough) in his recreation of the British Royal Navy at sea during the Napoleonic era. Paul Bettany did a creditable job as Steven Maturin. Lee Ingleby stole the movie as Hollom - that is one self-possessed kid and a damn good actor.Now, for those who have read the books (which I have) this movie stank. It is a beautifully filmed Discovery Channel special that had me squirming in my theater seat wondering what it would end. Peter Weir and John Collee rewrote The Far Side of the World into an unrecognizable mess with one plot and no subplots. Get the French ship. (That's your plan? Get her?). What he did, essentially, was rewrite the plot into Desolation Island, stripped of a) the intrigue, b) the espionage, c) the Dutch, d) the on-board epidemic... I could go on. I like my movies a little more meaty, please, especially when they're based on some very fine novels.There is no depth to the characters or the plot. By the time the action of this entry in the series takes place, Maturin and Aubrey have been friends for years but you get no sense of that from the actors. During the action sequences you are never given any reason to care about what happens to the characters (except for Hollom and that was solely Mr. Ingleby's efforts) never, ever made to hang on the edge of your seat. Mr. Weir is notoriously bad at creating nail biting moments for all that he's made several films that included tense action moments - he simply has no sense for creating them.Overall, this was quite disappointing for the amount of talent and money that were combined for this movie. In the hands of a director like Ridley Scott this would have been a masterpiece of both acting and action.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
482,Nettybumppo,The Best sea tale I have seen to date,10,28 September 2005,"Me being a seaman in the US Navy for four years and spent a few years in the merchants serving on board cruise and cargo ships in both oceans Atlantic and Pacific. I honestly think director Weir has put together his best Maritine sea saga yet. The crew looked like a crew on an 18th century sailing vessel. the costumes were authentic looking. There was a scene near the end where Crowe was up on the poop deck standing on the starboard side , the cameras was panning away from him, To me that was a classic pose.Everything about that picture was done well. Since the first time i saw this film i must of watched it about a dozen times more . My hat goes off to all who were involved in the making of this fine motion picture.I also understand that originally the french ship was to be an American one , but was changed for the American audience.One other post script There was a scene of a few crew members on there hands and knees scrubbing the wooden deck with a cobble stone what they were doing for the land lubbers out there is called holy stoning the deck.

483,mjeccles76,Hold Fast...,10,26 January 2013,"Just to be fair a couple of factors are going to influence my review:I was a devoted fan of the P O'Brian Aubrey / Maturin novels before seeing the film. Of lesser importance but still relevant, I served in the RN for 6 years (enjoyed it but don't regret leaving either..).In summary, I had more than a passing interest in (and affection for) the subject matter before seeing the film.It's difficult for me to judge the movie as a stand alone entity: for me it'll always be a companion piece to the books. Like many other viewers, I sat down to watch it with a sense of curiosity and some apprehension: will it do the books justice? Which characters will they include? etc. etc.To quote Emily Wilson in the Guardian: ""People love the books for different reasons. Sailing buffs adore O'Brian's remarkable attention to accuracy and detail when it comes to life on board a ship of war in the early 1800s. (By about book six, one feels one could confidently captain a ship-of-the -line to India and back, or perhaps throw together a jury rudder, without too much loss of face.) Naturalists adore the bugs, birds and wombats dear Maturin lugs aboard at every port - he's a keen collector, as well as an excellent and adventurous ship's surgeon. Spy buffs adore his secret life as a top intelligence officer - when he's not sawing someone's skull off in a force nine gale, or filling the captain's cabin with bees, he is generally to be found ashore on some perilous mission against the evil French/Spanish/Americans.""Other reasons are the deftly handled comedy running throughout the books - more of which later - and the visceral, heart pounding sea battles, often the crescendos to expertly ramped up passages of tension. You can almost smell the slow match burning, feel the anticipation as the ship finally clears for action and the gun crews run 'em out.I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed. I was completely immersed from the opening minutes of the film, when the Acheron's broadside came thundering out of the fog and swept the Surprise's deck. I thought the pacing and structure of the film was perfect: the temptation or potential studio pressure to 'over Hollywood' the thing, to cram in battle after artificial battle sequence, was resisted. The result is much more authentic for me.The attention to detail was spot on but, to be honest, it should be with the amount and quality of source material: anything less would have been criminal from the producers. It's more a tribute to Patrick O'Brian's research on the subject than anything.One observation rather than criticism concerns the two main protagonists: Aubrey's character came across to me as less flawed, less comical than in the books: his often hilarious ineptitude in most areas of life other than fighting his ship was missing, but then there wasn't much opportunity to show his being 'all at sea on land'. I also thought this coloured the on screen relationship between him and Maturin and that the balance wasn't quite right: Maturin's character sometimes comes across as slightly weak in comparison overall. Then there's the near complete lack of plot relating to Maturin being an eminent intelligence agent, bar one brief hint. But then there wasn't really the opportunity to show this true depth either.This perhaps curtailed (did you smoke it...) on-screen portrayal of the two principal characters (versus the wonderful depth in the novels) is potentially the main issue for some viewers, particularly in Maturin's case. I can understand it but ultimately it didn't bother me too much. I accepted it as part of an inevitable loss in adapting such detailed source material into a 2 hour screen play.Special mention goes to David Threlfall's Twice Preserved Killick, a real joy to watch. I agree Billy Boyd was slightly miscast as Bonden but in the grand scheme it wasn't a problem for me.I think the movie's greatest achievement is that its simultaneously a great screen adaption of the novels and a great stand alone movie in it's own right (though as I said the latter is harder for me to judge).I'm not sure about a sequel: it'll be hard to improve on this. Perhaps in hindsight the ideal scenario would have been to make a trilogy, with each movie roughly drawing from the corresponding third of books, so that the first film would have been set before this one. Maybe they should make a prequel - Cacafuego anyone?",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
484,platycryptus,Could have been much better,7,1 August 2004,"There was a lot of attention to detail in the production of this film, but the use of tree-dwelling green (common) iguanas from South or Central America to represent Galapagos iguanas was a major error that impacted the credibility of the film. Related animal shots as seen through the telescope from the ship were also hokey, and one shot of a swimming marine iguana actually appeared twice in this film (same footage!).Many people have noticed the fact that the relationship between the ship's commander and the ship's doctor could not carry the film. In fact, this relationship goes nowhere. The commander behaves inconsistently, letting a man die to continue his pursuit but then suddenly going back to the Galapagos when the ship's doctor is injured. It just didn't make sense.The best things about this film are related to the realism of many of the action scenes at sea, which happen quickly. Key areas that should have been improved substantially to make this a great film are: 1) Total lack of development of the character of the French adversary (huge lost opportunity here), 2) Lack of developed or adequate sense of time and place during a very long ocean journey (quick transition between tropical latitudes and the southern ocean), 3) Lack of clear explanation to the audience (or to sailors in the audience) of positioning relative to the prevailing winds during each combat sequence, and 4) Lack of depth in the main character. It was also hard to understand how the French could miss the gun ports and overall structure of the vessel when it pretended to be a whaler. Would British officers really be this young, or is this based on an adventure story for young boys?Some of these weaknesses may have been due to limitations in the works of fiction from which it was based (I have not read these). The shooting the albatross scene and the becalmed at sea scenes were right out of the Ryme of the Ancient Mariner. The Galapagos material was reminiscent of the Voyage of the Beagle by Charles Darwin, including Darwin's interest in beetles. Nonetheless, as a whole, it was a very good action film, just not a great one.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Sweeps you away to 1805.,10,25 December 2004,"A very complete tale, interwoven with beautiful cinematography, powerful performances (Russel Crowe, especially), masterful score (Bach, Motzart...to name two),and a truly believable storyline with many twists. At the heart of which is the conflict inside Capt. ""Lucky"" Jack Aubry (Russel Crowe) who balances his duty to the British Empire and his personal relationships with friends and crew members on board the HMS Surprise. All this while playing cat and mouse with a french enemy vessel that is twice his ship's size and double her strength. The conclusion is a great blending of commonality of human cause and duty.

Decent movie, not a lot of action but overall fine. Now, a decade and a bit older, I've seen it again and rated it a 9. It's - in my humble opinion - one of the best historic movies ever made. It really depics how crude life on a warship could be (not that I've been on one, but I've read some books about it). I love the themes this movie covers: Choosing the lesser of two (we)evils, leadership and patriotism. I just love this movie and I recomment you to watch it too.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
487,danzwales,Very Good Film!!,10,1 November 2004,At first I didn't think it would be up to much but I was mistaken. My mate persuaded me to watch it and i thought it was brilliant. Russel Crowe did the part credit and Paul Bettany supported him superbly. The story line was also a BIG plus for the film. I enjoy films and programmes based in that period so maybe thats why i enjoyed it as much as i did. But people who aren't big fans of these types of films still enjoy it. People may claim 'how could Crowe do what he did when the French had a superior ship and superior man power ?'...well he did and they could've ruined it concerning this fact but they didn't. They made this film brilliantly and considered all details. If that wasn't enough what a good ending to keep you guessing and improve it that little bit more!,Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
488,kloader,Action of Captain,7,15 May 2005,"This is an extremely good movie, successfully recreating the atmosphere of the era. The special effects depicting battle scenes and adverse weather conditions are especially good. So, too, are the costumes and make-up.I have, however, one criticism to make. Captain Jack Aubrey (Crowe) is shown on more than one occasion aloft in the rigging while the ship is sailing along. I am pretty confident that no Royal Navy captain would adopt this pose. The concept of sailing along in the rigging is more reminiscent of Kevin Costner in ""Waterworld""! Apart from this one small breach of etiquette, a thoroughly enjoyable film.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
489,thekansan726,Overall A Good Movie,8,26 December 2014,"This film at first seemed like it was going to be drawn out. It does start off with a pretty good action scene, then it slows down a bit. I also thought the film would primarily be only based on the ship (which it does for most of the time except towards the end when the crew decide to land on the Galapagos islands for a bit). However the down time in the movie became really fun to watch. The film displayed the crews individuality and tells the story about them and how they lived on the ship for weeks of not seeing family back home. Also it is interesting to watch how rank is treated on the ship. Russel Crowe does an amazing job in the film and so does Paul Bettany in his role as well. I enjoyed how the two actors characters developed over time in the film and how they both seemed to care for each other. Overall the film is fun to watch, it does have a rocky start and seems to start off slowly, but it makes up for it with a good story and some great action scenes.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
490,rhymer88,Great movie - but?,10,30 September 2005,"OK I just saw Master and Commander for the first time and loved it! But as I have not seen this mentioned anywhere else, could someone please explain why that guy was sitting bare butted in the snow on the side of the ship when they were sailing low around the Horn? Punishment or Piles perhaps. I am not a big fan of Crowe because of his off stage antics, but you can not deny that he is a great actor and this is by far his best yet. I was wondering why a French ship of this period would have been built in Boston, but I see from this site that it was an American vessel in the novel. I wonder how our take on this film would have been altered it they had left it as a War of 1812 battle instead of the Napoleonic Wars?",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
491,may79,Surprise Is On Our Side!,10,29 June 2006,"This past weekend, I toured the HMS Surprise, the ship that was used in M & C and I was reminded of how much I adore this movie. That this film was not awarded Oscars for Best Picture and Director has to be one of the hugest errors ever made by the ""esteemed"" Academy. M & C is something of an anomaly. Here's a movie about the glory of Old England that was financed by Hollywood studios, filmed primarily in Mexico, directed by and starring Aussies! The villains are the French, which struck me as sort of funny. And this movie is a celebration of values that seem so alien to us today; in M & C, patriotism is a virtue. It almost makes you want to shout ""Hurrah for British Imperialism!"" Almost. Now I'm no historian, so I can't comment on the authenticity of the battle scenes, but the important thing is that this movie is gripping and feels realistic. There's a nice balance between the battle scenes and the portrayal of daily life on board the frigate. It's all so beautifully done, with my favorite part being the crew's first glimpses of the Galapagos islands. I'm a big Russell Crowe fan (is there any actor who is more likable on screen?), and this is my favorite movie of his. My favorite character, though, is the brilliant doctor, brilliantly played by the underrated Paul Bettany. The doctor is a fascinating character, a sort of proto-Darwin, and makes a nice counterpoint to the captain. If you haven't seen this movie because you were put off by the trailer, know that the trailer did not do the movie justice. The brilliance of this movie is that even if you don't care about the Napoleonic War or British naval history, you will still be entertained and even touched by M & C.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

I got bored and I saw Russell just acting too hard.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
495,b1ggesmalz,Enjoy the ride,10,2 December 2004,"Master and Commander succeeds not so much in the fact that it has an exceptional plot, but in the fact that it carries the viewer along on its voyage exceptionally. It follows the voyage of Captain ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey sailing for the English empire while being chased by a French vessel during the Napoleonic Wars. It's not an entirely innovative or original plot, but it's the experience rather than the plot that drives this movie. The chemistry between the characters and strong performances by all is what make it an exceptional movie. Rather than casting good-looking Hollywood types as crew members, Peter Weir went after people who look like believable seamen who are also great actors in their own right. The cast even had a sort of boot camp training so that everyone knew how to make the ship function. It is this attention to detail that make the movie so believable and enjoyable. Rather than indulging itself in melodrama and Hollywood type moral-based clichés, this film pulls no punches about how it perceives the workings of a British Naval ship to function in the early 19th century. It simply bleeds authenticity at every corner. Excellent performances by Crowe and his doctor right-hand-man played by Paul Bettany only add to the thrill.The film also has a great original and non-original score which makes it flow perfectly. The interaction between the ship members is what makes it a success. Though 2+hours may seem like a long time to spend with an all-male cast inside a ship, I was never once bored. Instead, you truly feel like you are in the ship with them and at the end you feel like you would want to follow Russel Crowe's ""Captain Jack"" virtually anywhere he would lead.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
496,cksos1,An intelligent action movie!,9,29 January 2004,"Finally an action movie that doesn't use or need the common parlour tricks to try and get us to care about the characters and the action.  You got to experiance the whole adventure without any overdone foreshadowing or music to tell you to ""care about this because it will be important later"" or ""Lets make sure you know just how well these guys get along or don't get along with a couple of unnecessary shots of overdone emotion"".  This movie assumes you can think and will watch and pay attention.  For paying into that, you don't get let down.  The action sequences are incredible and the story is handled in a way that is so rare in Hollywood today that I'd almost forgoten what it was like to enjoy a movie from the ground up.  It's ending is wonderful in that it doesn't fall into a forced package that Hollywood feels every big movie must have.

497,ElginFilmGuy,Set a course for L.A. Oscars here we come!,7,14 November 2003,"Master and Commander is a visually impressive movie that takes you on a journey into the lives of a Napoleonic-era war ship.  Crowe is the captain, and you, as the viewer, become a member of his crew.  The battle scenes were really cool, and the symbolism runs deep.I certainly could not help thinking that the movie was dripping with Oscar politics.  You could almost hear Crowe yelling out in the movie, ""I WANT ANOTHER OSCAR!""  As a matter of fact, you could tell which clip they will show if he is nominated as it appears in the film. It was very clear that this was an Oscar vehicle for both Fox and Peter Wier.  That, however, didnt stop me from liking it.  I dont know if they can actually bring home the gold in March or not, but I think they deserve the nominations that they get.Overall, it was a good ""ship movie.""

I was unfamiliar with the source material (Patrick O'Brian's novels) but it didn't matter much. This is a movie that takes you back to the days of Captain Blood or the Sea Hawk. Finely made in every way (10 Oscar nominations), Russel Crowe is terrific in the part of Capt. Jack Aubrey and Paul Bettany is great as his friend and alter ego Dr. Stephen Maturin. Kudos especially go to Max Pirkis in the role of the very young midshipman Blakeney. This is not a movie with a message but one made for entertainment's sake and it does that on a grand level. Highly recommended!!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
499,x000591,Good but not great enough to make another,6,22 May 2009,"I saw and enjoyed this film when it was released before I had read any of the Aubrey/Maturin novels. I've just watched it again on DVD after having read and (even better) listened to Simon Vance or Patrick Tull give the characters human voice in the audiobooks and I like the film far less now.They are called Aubrey/Maturin novels for a reason...Stephen Maturin is a complex and mentally (and sometimes physically) tortured character that either Mr. Bettany could not portray -- I doubt that, he seems like a good enough actor, mad monks withstanding -- or the character's heart was removed in editing the final release. I also think it was a mistake not to have included more romance. We have to do more than toast 'wives and sweethearts' to feel the risks of sudden death are above contrivance. My wife taught me that the best way to think of Aubrey/Maturin stories is as complements to the novels of Jane Austen. Jack and Stephen are the men that those heroines are waiting to come home. I venture to say that the movie would have had a better box office if it had found time to portray Sophie and Diana in the flesh.Ultimately, the movie makers try to stuff too much of a twenty book series into the first of what was obviously meant to be a multi-picture franchise. Does anyone remember getting the DVD preview of M&C:TFSOTW in their Sunday paper before it was released? Felt to me like the film had tested badly and the producers were doing anything they could to find an audience. Peter Weir is too competent a director to have crafted this whole thing with no central story -- so I blame the mishmash that ends up on the screen on studio meddling.Too bad...Mr. O'Brian's books deserved better handling than this. That said, I would probably have spent money to see the next film. Especially, once I had heard that Heath Ledger was to replace Mr. Crowe in a prequel. Now whom could they cast as Maturin to give that character more fire? Shorter in stature - Stephen is supposed to be half Jack's size - less of a pacifist and deadly when required - a Napoleonic Dr. James Bond. Tim Roth would suit if he were younger.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

I found much of the movie to be boring and have no bearing on the plot, such as the endless minutes they spend showing the ship sailing through a storm.  In addition the movie focuses so much on the side of the British that you don't really understand the plot, or the perspective of the French in the movie. The battle scene between the two was terrible as far as cinematography, with the battle lines being impossible to discern.

Superb acting and the great chemistry from Crowe and Bettany that we saw in A Beautiful Mind, also one of my favourite films. It has the perfect blend of action and dialogue, moving from battle scenes and action to some very witty lines and also the tense and powerful scenes between Crowe and Bettany when conflict arises.The music score is brilliant in this film, including things like Bach, plenty of cello and violin music as both these instruments are what Aubry (CRowe) and Stephen (Bettany) ply in the film and wonderful directing from the amazing director who brought us 'The Truman Show'. The atmosphere in this film is great, realistically true to what it would've been like at the time and the plot is simplistic yet clever.

503,u-80708,Master and Commander Film Review,9,23 January 2020,"If you enjoy gripping historical dramas this film will blow your socks off. Master and Commander is definitely a success because is achieves excellency in many of the different facets of filmmaking. In this film the HMS Surprise pursues and eventually after many hardships captures the French privateer the Acheron. One of the many facets successfully mastered in this film is photography or cinematography. The way that this film is shot makes the viewer feel that he or she is on the ship. The use of different angles such as looking out of the gun ports at a battle or through a telescope are very impressive and immersive. I think that the cinematography was very effective and that it blended well with the other components. Cinematography feeds into editing and this film was also very well edited. The editing did help me discover and understand the theme as well as other components of the film, however the film felt a little jumpy at times. This makes sense because it is difficult to portray even a full day on a warship of this time period without getting boring. The setting, costumes and makeup were totally authentic, period appropriate, and accurate. They created the perfect atmosphere for the film and helped the viewer understand and even empathize with the characters better. They did this by vividly showing the effects of battle, hardships, and daily life aboard the HMS Surprise which allowed the viewer to momentarily step into the shoes of one of the sailors and experience naval life first hand. The setting the HMS Surprise was built as a replica for the film and was very well done. The actual ship replica was used during the filming and they fired with real gunpowder (obviously not with cannonballs) and the ship replica actually sailed. The costumes were also quite accurate the typical sailor cloths and big wool jackets during storms as well as the uniforms. There was a distinct difference between the officers blue uniforms and the marines red uniforms. The makeup was great as well. It showed slightly graphic wounds, blood on the skin and stains. One negative aspect of the makeup is the flogging scene. When a sailor named Joseph Nagel was flogged 12 times for disobedience the wounds did not resemble those of actual flogging, the skin was barely ripped off. This lacking depiction of accurate flogging is most likely due to the pg-13 rating that restricts the amount of explicit gore in a film. Another aspect of filmmaking which was mastered was sound. I am a colonial and naval history nut, but through all of the documentaries and videos I have watched, I have never heard a more realistic interpretation of an18 pound lead cannonball flying through the air. The sound in this film was totally effective and completely immersive. The sound not only accurately captured the terror of battle but the other sounds only found on a ship on the open ocean. Such as the crashing of the waves against the ships hull, or the swaying and creaking of the men in the bunks as they sleep, and the sound of the sails unfurling and filling with wind. This film does a better job of capturing the naval environment that does 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. In that film the ship felt like it only became important when it was destroyed by the Nautilus smashing into its hull. And the battle scenes were much more accurate in Master and Commander than they were in 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. In conclusion Master and Commander was a very successful film in the aspects of sound, setting, cinematography and editing with a few minor criticisms. It was the best most accurate depiction of naval life and warfare in that time period of any other movies out there in my opinion.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
504,jpnachtwey,Very very boring,1,29 April 2005,"The acting of Russel Crowe is boring! He is unable to show more than two different faces. All the time he's smiling smart even if he lost a crewman or got shot down. I wanted to see a dramatic sea-movie like ""The Bounty"" with Anthony Hopkins and Mel Gibson but there was nothing like this. It was just a modern action movie. Russel Crowe is unable to act any emotions. He got the chance to act as a captain between hate and desperation, but he doesn't.

Expansion is painful. Exploration is painful. But with those initial pains, comes healing. And when that healing comes, its sometimes the scars that bear the greatest fruit.To say such a thing from the seat of what might be called ""White Privilege"" could be construed as highly insulting.But: with the British Empire came Medicine. Technology. Systems. Order.At a time when the world was all too often in chaos, order, good or bad, was brought to bear.To me, nothing embodies this more than the Royal Navy from this period.To have people embark on leaking wooden ships, fed from spoiled and salted food, and fueled by ever present cane rum, and succeed? This is proof of miracles.Russel Crowe's portrayal of leadership in adversity, and his adept handling of a tenuous balancing act was absolutely brilliant to me.This film, to me, was THE example of the British Spirit in its ""good"".Strength, courage and honour under adversity.Always.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

513,talktozoe,"The absolute best of it's genre, bar none.",10,6 June 2007,"If you enjoy some reality in your swashbucklers you will be somewhat astounded. They have never made one any better. If what you want is a cartoon and a good laugh try Pirates of the Caribbean. While it has nothing at all to do with reality 'Pirates' is still plenty of fun.This one is a movie best suited to those who understand something of sailing and/or naval tradition but it is also of interest to those who want more from a character than just blood and more from a movie than just an endless and mindless series of fight scenes. While there is brutality in the movie, much of it is implied, with very little of the explicit gore that is used to draw in the mindless masses. Most of the sickening reality is kept just off screen. You get the idea, and that's what's really important, with just enough 'blood and guts' so you are aware of it.There are no real weak spots in this film. There are plenty of strengths. Sound is amazing. Acting is superb, although it's not a movie that lends itself to an acting Oscar. Like a ship that requires all the crew to 'pull together as one' the movie takes an almost ensemble approach with a host of character actors each contributing to the complete picture.It's very realistic in it's portrayal of life at sea and the interaction between crew members, including the need for discipline and mutual respect, the necessary pecking orders that must be maintained, and the brutal realities. Each of these people, regardless of rank, cannot survive without the knowledge and teamwork of their fellow crew members, from the lowliest on up. If you've ever been aboard 'HMS Rose' or USS Constitution, as I have, you have basically been aboard HMS Surprise and the French privateer Acheron. Acheron is based on the USS Constitution class of 'super frigates' and HMS Surprise, while somewhat based on the historical HMS Surprise, is actually ""HMS"" Rose; a replica British Frigate you will find at most tall ship events throughout the world.My only complaint with this picture is the ending. A sequel is implied, which would justify the ending as it is. Without a sequel it just doesn't have the necessary finish.One more thing...and this is very important at this time. You can view this movie many, many times with nearly the same level of enjoyment. In a time when people are trying to build libraries of movies and getting stuck with too many movies that just don't have any legs beyond the first viewing this is one for the library.

I was hesitant to see Master and Commander for fear that Mr. Crowe's performance in Gladiator might have been a fluke. Master and Commander proves, beyond question that Mr. Crowe's talents are exceptional, his capability limitless, and his films of a remarkable caliber, and quality rarely witnessed by this movie viewer. And these qualities are consistent in both performances.I have found Mr. Crowe's films to be much like a good novel; difficult to stop before they end, and much enjoyed with repeated viewings.I have discovered one negative quality about Mr. Crowe's films: when I've finished watching all I have, there is little else that proves sufficiently, or equally as entertaining to watch.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Forrester fan - Hornblower Series - before that), I awaited this production with mixed emotions.  I am pleased to report that given the marketing-driven changes of years of the action and the adversary, the Producer, Director, Actors, and Production Company (all) did a remarkable job of capturing my visions of O'Brian's oh-so-precisely written words, 'just so,' and 'with not a moment to lose.' To an O'Brian purist, they faced a very difficult challenge and achieved a most satisfying result.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
516,shield22,"Same character names, completely different intent.",2,13 September 2004,"As a long-term, die-hard fan of Peter Weir's films I find it hard toimagine how he could possibly have written this screenplay. Afterfinishing the final book (number 20) of the acclaimed Patrick O'Brian""seafaring tales"" starring the honorable, bold and eminently sea- capable Captain Jack Aubrey and his lifelong friend and companion thesecretive, brilliant Stephen Maturin, and having watched the filmtwice, I can't help but wonder how such a miscalculation could haveoccurred. Weir's use of political commentary (such as has appeared inthe past with his films Gallipoli and The Year of Living Dangerously)is plain. In this case, he decided to make his primary focus theBritish Empire's naval ambitions in the 19th century. Unfortunately, neither Weir nor his lead actor Russell Crowe seemed tohave comprehended the greater intent of the series in the slightest.The Aubrey of this film seems to be a domineering, ignorant captain,painted with a thin veneer of civilization. The character of Maturin issomewhat more believable, though radically one-sided; his status as anagent for Britain completely overlooked in lieu of his hobby -naturalist - which ends up making much less sense in terms of theoverall story. Further, Weir's decision to use elements from a numberof the novels (from the first, Master and Commander to at least the10th, The Far Side Of The World) ends up diluting a consistentstoryline in order, seemingly, to provide more more sea battles.I challenge anyone who has read the series to enjoy this film, and anyfan of the film to not cry ""foul!"" upon reading the series. While it israrely if ever fair to compare a book to its filmic counterpart, thisinjustice to Patrick O'Brian, who the Chicago Tribune proclaimed to be""the best author in the world"" cannot be overstated. The true magic ofthe series lies in its detailed treatment of its characters and thereality of life during the Napoleonic War, its subtle but pervasivehumor and its dedication to higher values such as honor and duty. Whatwe're left with after distillation of so much material is a domineeringcaptain who appears mostly annoyed at his surgeon, a surgeon whoconstantly complains about the Naval service and a plot which seems torevolve mostly around ship battles. Whatever the movie is, it bearslittle substantive resemblance to the stories and characters portrayedin the novels.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
517,discoskull,Meh,5,26 July 2008,"I just finished watching this flick.The story, in and of itself, was solid - however, at times it was needlessly slow paced, a bit like wading through old pudding. I know the movie was based on two books (which I admittedly have not read), and I have gathered that it sticks quite close to these books - but, as far as pacing goes, there are things that work in literature, that just don't work in movies - unless you have the characters and the acting and the dialogue to back it up. And even then...Now, about the characters...I'll get the positive stuff out of the way first. Max Pirkis, as the Blond Boy Who Looses His Arm, was the most accessible, sympathetic, and memorable character in the entire movie. The ship's doctor comes in a solid second - I think his bland lines/ direction had more to do with it than his acting/ screen presence, which were pretty solid. Then comes Russel Crowe's character, which was suitably boring, predictable, and bland (the same character has been seen in countless movies/ stories since...ever). The ship's crotchety cook was quite entertaining - actually, I found him more entertaining than Crowe's character, so we'll just bump the cook up to slot 3. After them...nope, no one. The rest of the characters may as well have been cardboard boxes with English accents and bad teeth. The movie attempted to make you care about the entire swollen roster of characters...or, at least, I think it did. Rather lame attempt, in actuality. Before the Jonas subplot played out (which I'll mention in a moment), I found them all to be quite boring and indiscernible - which was fine, and to be expected, given the movie they were inhabiting. Then came one of the (pointless) subplots, in which the entire crew, hit with many runs of bad luck, blames a young man for it. They then drive him to kill himself through psychological torment and social ostracization. All this because of irrational superstition and the ramblings of an old man with a head injury. Now, I know that this is perfectly believable, as is the fact that the captain seems to feel the same as the crew. But then the movie tries to make me agree with the jerks. It did not have the intended effect...I found that to be just as disgusting as the act portrayed. From that point on, I was kind of hoping that 40% of the crew would meet a violent end. When the final battle with the French vessel finally rolled around, the only thing I cared about was seeing a couple choice s.o.b's die. And they did. Aside from Max Pirkis's acting, that was the only tangible entertainment I got from the entire movie. Oh yeah, other characters died as well, but pfft. However you cut it, the viewer should care about the characters he/she is following, should care whether they live or die. In this flick, whenever they showed a character's death, or the other characters crying over it, I was checking my watch. What, another cardboard box got stepped on? Whooptie-tit, recycle.Now, the movie had some good scenes. The battle scenes (all two of them) were suitably exciting, the two main surgery scenes (kid - arm, doc-on-self) were excellent, in both acting and direction...can't remember any of the others... It had some great shots, and some great costume design. It was pretty. But even then - being a sailor in the Royal Navy back then was far from pretty. The whole movie was too clean. Too shallow.All in all, I found this movie to be 35% enjoyable, 85% predictable, 90% visually appealing, and 100% ""meh.""",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

I don't think there was an extra scene, not a useless line, everything about the film is perfect. The end though, no spoilers really, was ... well I sprang up out of my seat and hollered at the screen, slapped my leg and wish the movie would never end. The more I thought about the film, the more I read into it, the better it became. It is more than a war film or a sea film, it portrays the old world, and the new together.

521,cbrown1687,One of my all time favorites,10,6 September 2009,"This is one of my favorite films, and in my opinion, one of the most well crafted movies I have ever seen. I love movies that really put you into the time and place that they depict, particularly with historical films, and this will leave you feeling as if you were there for every second of it. If you ever wondered what it may have been like to sail with the British Navy during the Napoleonic Wars...well, this is the closest you'll ever get.The performances, particularly by Crowe and Paul Bettany are flawless. The screenplay is brilliantly written, the cinematography is exquisite, and the direction by the masterful Peter Weir is perfect in every way. The film could have taken the easy way out and focused mostly on battle scenes, but those come second to the story and well crafted characters. And trust me, when you actually care about the characters, any battle scenes that happen will be 100 times more intense than any of the bland, underdeveloped action films Hollywood churns out.That being said, the battle scenes are incredible, and will leave you on the edge of your seat. The film really leaves me with no doubt that this is what naval battles of this type, during this time period, would have been like. There is also an incredible scene during a storm that has to be seen to be believed. It is so realistic, that I cannot fathom how it was done.So, in a word, BRILLIANT. If you are a film fan who appreciates good writing, directing, acting, and cinematography, see this immediately. You will be utterly captivated from first frame to last. I would love to see more books in this series turned into films, with Peter Weir at the helm.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
522,guigui169,The far side of nonsenses?,2,22 June 2009,"Although filled with amazing sets and remarkable maritime atmosphere, one word comes through my mind when I think about this movie: propaganda. I won't elaborate here about the stylistic aspects of Master and Commander, but try to underline its strong and shameful political allusions: with M & C, Hollywood has offered the American audience a movie filled with good old Francophobe stereotypes. Tasty clichés in the political context of the movie's release: American's Francophobia (and boycott campaigning) reaches its peak with the French refusal to enter the Iraq War in 2003. What? The coward frogs won't go to war? Then let's eat ""freedom fries"", tax their wine and kick their bottoms on the big screen! The replacement of O'Brian's American villains by French ones was not done only to avoid American anger. This was also convenient. Let's study a bit our frog pirates.As I was watching the movie, I kept wondering ""why the hell those French villains appear so few times?"" Other viewers were also obviously frustrated by this absence of two-side perspective. Actually, the answer is clear: the American ""war on terrorism"" is just transposed on 1800's sea battlefields, with the French as Taliban. Look at the first battle scene (a great one by the way): an invisible enemy hiding in some demoniac smoke, striking cowardly with a stab-in-the-back technique and disappearing again as magic. What does this remind you of? Fundamentalist human bomb Muslims of course! And their bloody bombing attacks. It expresses the American frustration for a new type of war which they are not accustomed to. Namely, having to fight invisible terrorists, instead of well clearly organized adversaries (like the soviets were). The French privateer's aggressive cowardly tricks are just countless: hiding in a creek then falling upon a poor unarmed British boat, hiding in a destroyed piano to ambush Capt. Aubrey (final battle scene). Without mentioning the French captain's final trick,pretending to be the vessel's surgeon, to avoid martial punishment. Really those French privateers are incapable of any face-to-face confrontation! (Interesting detail: Aubrey's trick to have the French privateer chasing a fake ship was an idea of Surcouf, an 18th-19th century's French privateer) After 138 minutes of this kind of brainwashing, the hidden meaning appear as clear as light for the average American viewer: the French don't want war, consequently they are accomplices of S. Hussein's regime and the Taliban. Adding to this their cowardly military history, which seems quite similar to Taliban's terrorist methods, here is the point to get: French are like Taliban, in a sense they ARE Taliban.Bush's biblical superstition is there as well, personified by the old crazy seaman: ""I tell you, this vessel is driven by the Devil"". Reminiscence of Melville's Moby Dick no doubt. The French vessel is named ""Acheron"", a complete fictional name referring to Hades's river, the river of hell in Greek Mythology. Interesting subtle hidden message. The poor lad Hollom is a modern Jonas who did well to jump off the boat after all. Clear message printed again on the viewers' brain: ""America has to wipe out this weakest link; otherwise it may put the whole organic community in danger"". It also reflects the American biggest fear in the context of national hyper security: the psychosis of the terrorist threat hiding amongst the population, the Islamist fifth column. Who knows, maybe this Hollom was a discrete French sympathizer. Good riddance!Let's talk a bit of the protagonists' aesthetics. The very short time you'll be really able to see the French in the final battle is just astonishing. A bunch of pirates you could imagine in a tale for children: toothless mammals, scars, dirty bristly hairs, rags. What a contrast with those British play-boy seamen with their perfect teeth and blond-tinged hair: a bit more of those nonsenses and you would almost see them in a Baywatch's episode. The racial gap is hugely and boorishly stressed by Weir in order to dehumanize the evil enemy. A little homage is even paid to the great British scientist, Darwin, from whom so many racial mad ideologies and pseudo-scientific theories have emerged (loads of in particular in 19th century's Great-Britain, namely a feeling of superiority towards all non-islander populations, considered as threatening aliens. Just take a look at John Knox's works or Herbert Spencer's, an avalanche of scientific and historical nonsenses). God is on British's side, and so is Science then, embodied by the surgeon and his isolated humanistic positions. Fortunately, he eventually rallies to Aubrey's militaristic and Manichean ideals. Patriotic romanticism, scientific rationalism: perfect ingredients for the perfect propaganda recipe.Peter Weir's adherence to G. W. Bush holistic Neo-conservative ideology, and to an idealized world Anglo-Saxon imperialism, has really poisoned every minute of this movie, which is nothing but a masterpiece of silliness, a massive indigestible patriotism cake.P.S: I put 5/10 because the sets are incredible despite the story's disgraceful political position.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Russell Crowe is a force of nature, and all the other actors from Paul Bettany to Billy Boyd give wonderful performances. I especially enjoyed the details of life at sea, though most would call them boring.

I heard women take in ""small pursed-lipped gasps"" looking at Russell Crowe on the posters, as we entered the theater. They were enjoying the night before the lights were even dimmed. This swashbuckling adventure had all the trappings of an Errol Flynn epic, Mutiny on the Bounty and yes, you can still hear Maximus in Russell Crowe's voice. Max Pirkis(Midshipman Blakeney), in his movie debut, shows this young man can have a future in film, if he desires. His emotional display during the amputation scene was felt by the entire audience. Every woman in there wanted to hug him. Every man admired him. Paul Bettany (Dr. Stephen Maturin) helped to keep Russell Crowe from taking himself too seriously in this movie. The Captain has the command presence expected of someone in his position. He is an inspirational leader, leading by example. He is a role model and father figure to the young midshipman. His strong sense of duty and patriotism drives him to go above and beyond what is expected in his mission. This movie should do very well in the box offices and do even better on DVD.

One thing that impressed me a lot in this film was MEANINGFUL DIALOGUE, one thing that has been missing from most modern movies.

Master and Commander however is perhaps the best book adaption I have ever seen, it was an absolute joy to watch from beginning to end, and a general knowledge of 18-early 19th century ships just makes the whole thing even better. The sheer detail of the film was just incredible (Pirates of the Caribbean eat your heart out) Not a belaying pin out of place(apart of course from when the Surprise gets hammered in that extraordinary first combat). One of the masterstrokes of the film was not to base the film on any one specific book, Eg in Master and Commander Mr Pullings is only a 2nd lieutenant and Aubrey is captain of the Sophie.Yet still retaining the relationships between the characters (especially between Captain Aubrey and Stephen Maturin) which is one of the great cornerstones of the novels.

And I started understanding the characters. I think a large failing of this movie is that it expects you to already have an intimate understanding of the characters and the dynamics between them. However, that didn't develop for me until the latter half of the movie, so the first part felt forced. Again, maybe I was tired, because other people around me were laughing in spots that were meant to be funny, while I didn't even crack a smile.

If you are a 50-year-old male who owns a boat, you will like it.Contrary to the trailer, Gladiator it is not.   In the 2 very brief battles (the first one if you blink it is over - saw most of it on the trailers) there is some really cool cannon stuff.  But that was it.  15-20 minutes of action in a 2 hour and 18 minute film doesn't make it an action.  It makes it a long drama.When you finally get to see the bad guys at the end of the movie they should have worn black cowboy hats because I kept getting the good guys and bad guys mixed up in the fighting.It is a story (or a documentary) about sailing and life on a boat a couple a hundred years ago.  That is what the trailers should show and stop trying to trick the public.Sorry. I didn't read the books but I bet you the books had humor and women. This movie had neither.  Gladiator had the strength of the emperor's sister and Gladiator's love for his wife and child and his desire to be with them again.  Nope. Not in this film.If anyone thinks this is Pirates of the Caribbean, think again.    It is a visually pretty History Channel documentary.  If that is what you are looking for, go see this movie.  If you are not, don't.
When you read some of the comments here everyone seems to talk about it as visual poetry.  I think those comments are fair.   But the simple fact is it is a ""chick-flick for guys who like boats.""

True to style, close attention to detail (find another movie where the foremast jacks are barefoot!) and a reluctance to pander to cliche make this an epic. As a naval commander myself, even now in the days of steel ships one recognizes the traditions that the (Canadian) navy keeps alive in the wardroom (officer's mess), the gunroom (the home of the midshipmen) and in the hand's mess.The battle scenes are as authentic as Patrick OBrien made them, without the lamentable urge to explode things in blazes of flame.And as a professional string player, I recognize the intimate scenes with instruments do reflect OBrien's vision of dimensions of Aubrey and Maturin's characters well. I too have brought my cello on naval deployments - though I never had the luxury of a great cabin large enough to play a cello in aboard ship.I loved the movie.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
544,davecosio,"Blockbuster, or history channel archive film",5,15 November 2003,"Going into this film i was expecting great naval battles, perhaps an entertaining chase. I would have been satisfied sitting home watching paint dry. The film begins with a short battle, ok seems interesting. I was then fooled into 2 hours of seamen singing songs, crude surgical procedures and useless plot material. Perhaps one major error in this film was neglecting to develop any of the French vessels crew. Just having a ""phantom"" boat being the enemy doesn't quite do it. This film could have  been many things, a ""how to"" rebuild a 19th century ship. Not a terrible film overall, almost there though. Acting was solid, I bet the script looked better on paper. Maybe we should change the title to Master and Explorer, it could have been an adventure change the plot a little but you can't disguise this thing as an action packed military film.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
545,jniedz,converted skeptic,10,19 November 2003,"I have read all he books, I am not a big fan of Russel Crowe, I wasn't happy they where picking and choosing from a bunch of books, and I complained about how Hollywood would screw this up for he last six months and... It was an excellent movie.  It truly captured the feel of the books.  I expected them to make an action movie with some cool effects and not much else(that seems to satisfy enough people for a movie to make its money).  They could have made a stale period piece, like those Gettysburg or Gods and Generals, that satisfy obsessive history buffs but don't have any drama, They didn't. They made an excellent movie, with an exciting pace, that happened to take place all on a  ship and a deserted island. I don't want to give any points away, if you want to see the terminator vintage 1805 and have the attention span of a flea, you'll be as disappointed as a few others who have written here have, If you want tortured protagonists and excessive pathos, go see Mystic River( which was great), but if you want to be taken on an interesting adventure, with compelling characters, that doesn't insult your intelligence I think you will like this movie.  thanks to good writing, directing and cinematography, you will really feel like you've been cramped on a tiny frigate, and chasing a superior enemy across two oceans. (yeah it is supposed to feel long when you are stuck in the doldrums!) I can be a movie snob, i usually point out what was wrong with most movies I like, but I think they did as well as possible, only one scene was over-dramatic (Jonah).  You should still read the books, Stephen is more complex and Jack has more flaws. a sequel should have more on land, where roles are reversed and they can work in Diana and Sophie.  I didn't think Hollywood could make good movies from books, but with help from the folks down under they've done well the last few years.  Finally, I think I have forgiven Crowe, for that God-awful Gladiator, I'm sure he can sleep better knowing that. Well, worth your $8.00---------10/10",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
546,Starapril,This Is an Amazing Film,10,20 November 2003,"The attention to detail in this film is astounding.  That aspect alone would be enough to carry it; however, when you couple the detail with the story, the battles, and the comaraderie on board the ship, you have for your viewing pleasure an absolute gem.The surgery scenes are especially incredible to witness.  I'd imagine the doctors on board the ships of that era handled things much the same as they are dealt with in the film.Paul Bettany is a joy to watch as Stephen Maturin.  Russell Crowe plays Lucky Jack in much the same way I'd envisioned Jack in the novels.  In fact, all of the actors play their parts perfectly.I highly recommend this movie.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

The story made little sense, the battle scenes were very poorly done - hey director: shaking the camera does make not me think that the battle action is fast-paced and confusing - it makes me think it's too fast and confusing FOR YOU!.  On the snooty side- character development was poorly done for several of the seemingly key figures; either that or the editing was terrible, as you must have left many key shots and dialogue on the cutting room floor. As is, the entire film should be left on floor. This film is the triumph of commercial and marketing hype over reason. Your ads and specials said it was good, so all the lemmings voting on this board follow through to be with the crowd.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

You need to see this film two times, because you will be highly enriched by the second viewing. Peter Weir a Master and Commander at directing, has created a classic masterpiece. Academy Awards potential looks emminent, the battles, the chase, the relationships of the crew and its Captain, the friendship between the Ships Surgeon and the Captain are at the heart of the story.  I think what stands out is integrety and honor, to put duty to the forefront and to care about the people under your leadership.

551,cathouse,"Visually powerful, action however a string of absurdities",6,29 November 2003,"Note: I will discuss some detail of the action.The small British frigate Surprise chases a French privateer bound for the pacific to take British whalers. The privateer pops suddenly out of dense fog and starts immediately firing at the Surprise with deadly accuracy at a distance at which the guns of the Surprise can't bear. I suspect the French had radar for fire control. The Surprise manages to get away in the fog, badly damaged.It turns out that the French sail a frigate of the Constitution class bought from the US. How can they afford what was at the time the most advanced type of frigate and why would the US sell it in the first place? How will they ever make a profit catching whalers? Privateering is a business, you know.Later the officer of the marines wants to shoot an albatross. He performs a wild dance, turning in circles and wildly flailing the gun. He ends up hitting the doctor in the belly.The British finally catch up with the enemy. Since the French will blow them out of the water in a straight fight, they decide to board. So they disguise the Surprise as a whaler. Now that is like disguising a tank to look like a pickup truck. Anyway, captain Aubrey is worried that the French will try to get away once they realize that they are facing the Surprise and decides to cripple them by shooting a mast down. Unfortunately the guns do not have the elevation to do so at boarding distance, so Aubrey runs them out and has the rear wheels removed from the gun carriages. This gives the British just one shot since the guns can't recoil. He also sends the marines (in disguise) up into the rigging so they can take out the French crew. The French do not notice the guns and the men in the rigging and get taken by surprise (pun taken right from the movie).All this is quite ridiculous: Knocking down a mast with just one salvo would be exceedingly lucky, even at close range and anyway, only a couple of feet away are the French, vastly outnumbering the English and a wonderful target for grape shot and chain and all the other nasty stuff one can put into a gun.Whoever wrote the screen play had no clue.The movie ends with a cliffhanger, a sequel is likely.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

It may have been realistic to the period and detailed as to the ship etc, but you need a better story to hold your interest.  I was ready to leave mid-point. . .took a sneak peak in another theater showing The Missing and that looked like a great movie from the little bit I caught before returning to the dreadful battle at sea!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
553,bigjackbrass,Surprise!,9,30 November 2003,"My expectations were, I confess, rather low. A plot drawn from several of the novels, centred around an extended chase, missing out much of the splendid social and personal elements of the books and, worse yet, the horrible miscasting of Russell Crowe as Jack Aubrey. It sounded ominously like another great literary work being churned and processed into a disappointing film.Under the care of Peter Weir, however, the film has become something far beyond adequate or respectable. It may be more Hornblower than Aubrey, but this is a very fine naval film indeed. True, it's hard to accept Crowe as Lucky Jack, but he has a good stab at it and does portray elements of the character (notably when he's drunk, when he's in combat and when he's voicing his authority) excellently. Only when faced with extended, emotional dialogue does he falter. Likewise Maturin on screen is not Maturin in the book, but to be fair the whole cast do such a good job that it is almost possible to forget the novels for a time and revel in a fine tale wonderfully told. David Threlfall deserves special mention, though, for stepping directly from the pages of O'Brian onto the screen as Preserved Killick.Rousing battles, lavish production, delightful details, and just enough of the wit and humanity of the books to raise the whole above the typical naval yarn. It might not be the adaptation we dreamed of seeing, but it's far beyond that which we had any right to expect.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
554,LittlePete,No letdown for Aubrey fans,10,4 December 2003,"Russell Crowe is perfect as Aubrey - look like he should and acts like he would act. Paul Bettany is excellent as Maturin - not as dark and unpretty as I imagined, but excellent nonetheless. David Threlfall IS Preserved Killick - ""which I was already getting your coat...""Not as much character development as O'Brian, but no time in a single movie. Battle scenes outstanding. Ships, weather, etc., very realistic.Borrowed parts from several books, but with 20 books and only one two or...] movie, how could you not?

One comes away with a very strong, visceral feeling of what life was like on a ship back then--the crowded and unsanitary conditions, the amputations, the flogging, the food (mmm weevils), the pecking order, inclement weather, the strategy of a chase and the ultimate taking of a prize. Russell Crowe wouldn't have been my first choice for the role of ""Lucky Jack"", but he proved a fine captain, loyal to the character in the books. Maturin was most convincing and also true to books. ...and by the way, this is not a ""guy"" film (I'm a chick and I loved it), it's a film for anyone who enjoys all things seafaring--from ships to sea shanties (with some swashbuckling thrown in).",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World

Instead of resorting to trendy dialogue or contemporary humour to cheaply gain laughter, Master and Commander aims to be a landmark film that can be appreciated in the long-term as well as the short.

Character development, acting, directing, and editing are all fantastic.  But, the timing was rather unfortunate for this movie.  Return of the king stole 9 of the 10 Master and Commander Oscar nominations and probably stole a significant amount of money from Master and Commander due to it being out at the same time.  But it took a lot of guts to make this movie the way it was done.  It was original, creative, and extremely competently made.  It deserves a better rating than 7.5.

I feel that the movie was well written and produced.  It makes me want more.  I keep buying books related to Naval Warfare during that era.  My only gripe is that it started at book 10 in the series.  There are 9 books worth of great movie material before Master & Commander even starts.  Not to mention 10 books after.  It is obvious to anyone who knows the series and saw the movie.  There not only needs to be a sequel (or 2), but at least one prequel.

570,dossboss,nice idea - wrong books,6,20 April 2004,"an interest in the ""era of fighting sail"" would lead a reader through several nautical series including c. s. forester (horatio hornblower), alexander kent (richard bolitho), dudley pope (nicholas ramage), dewey lambdin (alan lewrie), and eventually patrick o'brian (jack aubrey).
to anyone who has read these series, the o'brian books are hands-down the most boring and least accurate (historically or technically) of the lot. why peter weir and miramax dumped $150M into such pathetic storytelling is beyond me.committed to one of patrick o'brian's banal efforts, we now have a film guaranteed to be trite, dull, and frequently nonsensical. i will give full points to the cinematography, however. the sailing scenes were breathtaking and worth nearly any degree of idiocy to watch.i was glad that i had seen this film, but will not buy a copy of it. pity. maybe if weir had read alexander kent instead...",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
571,santom2,I had a bad feeling about this movie....,9,25 June 2004,"...probably because the previews portrayed it to me as an odd combination of 'Pirates of the Caribbean' and 'The Perfect Storm, that left my aesthetic sense dreading the idea (color/visual variety and shot juxtaposition-wise) of a movie shot almost entirely at sea--a setting that yields potentially monotonous combinations of blue sea, grey fog, and brown hull.However, in this film, that drudging monotony of color reflected the dutiful behavior of the military ""commander"" and his crew in the film, and the extended toil of their long and exhausting journey. Being who I am, I kept getting so P***ED that the Doctor character kept getting SCREWED OVER whenever he tried to go to the Galapagos to collect samples for scientific study.Yet, despite my initial indignation, I soon realized that this misfortune also showed (ultimately) the necessity of the captain's sacrifice or repression of all other endeavors and personal vendettas in order to complete his assigned mission. It isn't a pleasure cruise the crew is on: they have orders that must be followed. Even if it means screwing the lovable doctor and the rest of the world out of fascinating new biological discoveries that lay only a stone's throw away. These conflicts made the movie for me: the obligations of a leader to his country clashing with his personal loyalties to friends and crew, and the related conflict of whether it is best to prioritize the military or the erudite when time and resources are in short supply.So, I still think it is not -my- type of movie, exactly. But, certain things I recall with admiration--the sly camera-work, for example, like the bouncing of the camera offside of the ""ship"" (mimicking the undulation of waves) done in combination with the rocking movement of the actual ship set piece was a nice subtle touch. And the characters were well developed (or well played, if not both). The children, the officers, the crew and captain were all memorable and demanded empathy from the movie-going audience -- even if you did enter (like me) convinced the film was going to be an epic lacking cinematographic grandeur and bursting with sappy (Seabiscuit style) dialogue.My apologies to those who love Seabiscuit. Again, not my type of film.But this one was well done.

Aboard the HMS Surprise, the British Captain Jack , a fearless strategist, battles the French ship the Acheron. Although there are slower scenes depicting the monotony of travel on the high seas, there are also graphic scenes of sailors getting wounded and receiving treatment. It also portrays the relationships of the crew and hardships of battle at sea. The drama between Russell Crowe's Captain Jack and his friend Steven Maturin is especially well-acted.

All you get from it is two battles that make no sense. Peter Weir has shown us that he is able to make good movies such as Gallipoli or The Truman Show, but this time he wasn't able to convince the audience. The movie was a failure in all the lines. It should have been a lot shorter and the story, that seems to be a good one, needs a little of correction on the beginning and in the end, so that the movie would finally made some sense. The visual effects and the camera are great, but this still cannot stop the film from sinking. It really could have been an epic spectacle, but now it is not even an average movie because of the missing parts of the story.

577,jacknstephen,In response to the misinformed...,10,28 December 2004,"I was first bothered to see, when i came to the IMDb.com site for Master and Commander that the sample review that was available was that of a person who hated the film. It upset me, but i have no real problem with it. In fact, it's good to see that there is a difference of opinion. It is hard for me to remember what i first thought when i first saw the movie, because since then i have completely delved myself into the world of Patrick O'Brian. First of all, let me say that i must have liked the movie well enough to buy it, because i now own it and watch it a lot. What i think made this movie great was the fact that it got me to read the books. i loved it so much, i went out and bought the books. The movie, unlike what was stated in a previous review, is not overly-nautical. In fact, it explains very little of the nautical process, unlike the books. It took me several weeks and about 2 or 3 books into the series to figure out the nautical terms, and i still have trouble with a few, but i'm much better now. Speaking of the books, this review said that 'Purportedly it's factual and based on real people'- wrong. It is based on the books. And in fact, it is not entirely based on the books in which it is named after (Master and Commander- the 1st book, and The Far Side of the World- the 10th book). The ""lesser of two weevils' joke is taken from the 6th book, and the plot is not from the 1st book at all and only bits of it are from the 10th book, other elements of the movie are taken from various other books. WHat makes this movie so great is the fact that it melded these elements wonderfully, without being overly-nautical. Paul Bettany, being my favorite, did excellent, though he really didn't have much (in comparison to the character in the books). Russel Crowe i thought did great- he really captured the character wonderfully, minus the occasional stupidity exampled by the character in the book. There are several elements about this movie that make it a movie and not an adaptation of the book. For instance, in the book, Jack is fat and Staphen is ugly- this is obviously not the case in the movie. It wouldn't work well in the books, but it works magnificently in the movie, and i'm glad i saw the movie before i read the books, though i don't think i would have been disappointed had i read the books, then seen the movie. The whole point of this is to simply say that if (1) the movie was half as nautical as this viewer might think, then he would have been too lost to even finish the movie. He wouldn't even know how they got from one place to the other (as i often am in the books). (2) It's not based on true events, it's based on books. And in all of those points, are my opinions. Enjoy.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
578,ssa0825,They've captured the rhythm of life at sea perfectly.,9,14 January 2005,"As a 25 year veteran of the US Navy, most of my sea time on submarines, the one thing that strikes me about this film is how well they've captured the rhythm of life at sea. The routines of watchstanding, crew meals both in the wardroom and lower decks, the occasional ""beating to quarters"" or all hands on deck to handle some casualty or other, are all very real. Even in today's nuclear Navy, some things haven't changed. It was very easy for me, and should be for anyone who's worn the blue and served at sea, to be able to relate well to this film. I sincerely hope that Peter Weir will make another O'Brian book into a movie.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
579,cmpal2,Master and Commander- the Best movie in the World,10,24 January 2005,"Master and Commander was an AWESOME movie. IT had action all throughout it. Jack Aubrey is such a mastermind and such a good sailor. Oeter Weir did such a great job in directing this movie. He is such a great director. The Movie is based on Patrick O'Brien's series. The books are wonderful. All I have to say about this movie is positive... and i can go on all day about it! It is on of the most involved movies out there. It is awesome. Rusell Crowe is awesome in it, so is Paul Bettany. Max Benitz and Max Pirkis were awesome, they are both very good actors! The movie would not have been the same without them. I cannot wait for the second master and commander! it is going to be so good! i cant wait to see what happens.!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
580,kjw379,Intelligent High-Seas Adventure,8,25 January 2006,"There is a scene in MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD where the captain of a British Naval ship, circa 1805, debates the difference between duty and passion. Having passed on an opportunity to make wonderful new discoveries in favor of the pursuit of a massive French war ship, the scene manages to make a rather eloquent, yet subtle comment on the nature of man and his place within the world. The beauty of this film is that there are many such moments where the viewer is simultaneously bombarded with thematic musings, exciting action sequences, great acting and historical accuracy to the point where it becomes difficult to take it all in at once. Those of you looking for something more like Pirates of the Caribbean will be disappointed as this film is short on action and long on character development. There are only two major battle sequences, separated by more than an hour and a half of time. And while they are great; violently realistic and dramatically involving, the real guts of this film lies in the human stories told along the way. The director, Peter Weir, highlights his ability to tell an intimate story amidst a grand backdrop much like he did in The Truman Show. We get to know these men, their strengths and weaknesses and we see how the long and hard voyage plays on their minds over the film's progression. In one scene, a young officer feels the pressure of his men's dismissive stares and decides to end matters in his own way, afraid of what may be in store for him should he stick it out. Weir does a good job at highlighting the many facets of seafaring life. If you're looking for an intelligent and thought-provoking journey into the life of a 19th Century British Naval Vessell, look no further. Master and Commander has the depth of a good Discovery Channel show and the action worthy of almost any other high-seas adventure that comes to mind.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
581,wicked_smart1,One thing bugged me,9,28 February 2005,"Except for the trip around South America, the Surprise always kept her guns run out. This was not the normal way of sailing these ships. If ventilation was needed, only the gun ports were opened. The guns were kept inside ready to be loaded, and THEN run out. You wouldn't keep them loaded and run out all of the time.Remember that these guns used black powder and if you kept them loaded and ready to fire all of the time, the gunpowder would be so damp that they wouldn't fire when you needed them.Speaking of the guns, the ones the Surprise carried were capable of shooting through 2 feet of oak at 400 yards. If they had moved close enough, the cannon balls would not have bounced off. They finally got the chance when they were disguised as a whaler.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
582,f-vaugn,A Confused And Muddled Arc,10,16 June 2014,"Hat tip to Gary Jules for the intro music. But this confused and muddled arc had the potential to be so much more. Shoddy directing combined with top notch acting gets a 7 out of 10 from this reviewer. The characters grow on you. The ones you hate you learn to love. And the ones you like you come to despise. It's not a pretty story. Kudos for philosophy. And for going against political correctness and killing off those whom the world will never miss. Kudos also for the funeral director who is droll to the max and provides some welcome and much needed comic relief, but he's not sufficient to save this badly executed drama arc.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
583,firebird31,Modern Classic,9,3 July 2014,"The only thing I have to say about this film is by way of a question.When are they going to make the sequel?This film was so well done that I get more out of it each time I see it. It has personality, authority, authenticity, spectacle, and maturity.Under the direction and writing of Peter Weir, the story moves along from element to element with pace and interest. The characters are rich and filled with personality and are brought to life with great actors.The sound and vision give such life to the film. The cannonballs fly, the fog wreaths about the ships, the sea writhes and heaves.I want more and I've been waiting more than a decade now.There are so many books in the series that surely the makers have enough material for another two or three (or more) films. The fans are waiting.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
584,june-jackson1,Superb - This will remain my favourite film ever.,10,4 June 2005,"I bought a video of this film, then a DVD because the surround sound is marvellous for the soundtrack of this film. I can't count the number of times I have watched it and as soon as I had seen it I began reading all of the Patrick O'Brian 'Aubrey and Maturin' books. When I cameto the end of the novels I felt quite bereaved. I hope that Aubrey and Maturin were not one film wonders and that further movies about the pair will eventually be made. O'Brian's research was impeccable and the film helps to bring the naval history of Napoleonic times truly to life. Crowe and Paul Bettany were also superbly cast, although Bettany does not quite resemble the Maturin of the books and there is little evidence of his spying activities. This is not a criticism however, simply an observation. Wonderful film. I think possibly my favourite of all time. AND... I am glad there were no women in it. I think if there had been it would have taken away the sheer adventurousness (is that a word?)of it. I almost forgot to mention the wonderful music score. I particularly liked the music Crowe and Bettany played in the times they weren't warding off the dastardly 'Acheron'. I am hoping that the soundtrack has been recorded. I haven't seen it on sale but I suspect it must be out there somewhere. One further point about the message written by the twenty year old girl. I am sixty four years old but this did not make me less enthralled with the 'action'. I could almost feel as if I were one of the crew of the 'Surprise', who were also marvellously cast. I am not a great 'movie goer' and so I missed seeing it on the big screen which I would not have done if I had known what a superb film it was.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
585,busarac-lav,What a sail,10,29 September 2021,"Personally said this is maybe the best movie I watched in my entire life, and I've been watching quite a lot of movies. Gave it the rating 10 but it deserves 11/10, and this is not a lot for the movie of this caliber. I don't want to overhype this movie, but I can definitely explain why is this a masterpiece.First to say this movie won 2 oscars one for sound editing and the other one for cinematography, which is quite a success considering it came out in the same year as the last of LOTR movie series.Secondly the acting is as good as any of the godfather movies or any other classics, the effort put into each sentence and phrase to be said correctly and naturally is astonishing. Peter Weir (the director) used the exact sentences, measures and phrases that British sailors used back in Napoleonic wars. This required for Peter to study history of Napoleonic wars and ship journals to find inspiration, also every each actor in movie managed to pull off Weir's idea of a movie without any mistake and you can't find a single moment in movie where you can say acting wasn't on the highest level.I don't what to give away any spoilers, if you want to watch the movie you will see that story revolves around every character and every each of them has a deep life story and reason to be on that ship, every person has his interests and hobbies which makes this film soo natural. Movie consists of main story and stories of people on that ship. And it flows like a wind in the sails.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
586,testifykitty,an acquired taste,9,2 November 2005,"The first time I watched this movie, I was a bit too young to appreciate it. When I got a bit older and I viewed it again, I was hooked.Contrary to some expectations, this movie isn't a pure-action film about two ships trying to destroy each other. It's more of a 'life aboard a man-of-war thing. The attention to characters and details is superb, and the actors (especially Crowe and Bettany) make the entire crew of the Surprise come alive. I especially liked the dialog: the arguments between Captain Aubrey and Dr. Maturin, some of the exchanges between the midshipmen (when Will is in sickbay, and when Hollom is about to commit suicide), and some of the dialog gems between the ordinary seamen.The lack of romance in this film is not unnerving: in fact, it's a refreshing change. An action film with good characters and no romance...hurray! Folks, if you're looking for a film that moves at breakneck speed with lots of action, this is not for you. If you want something that requires some thinking and patience, ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World"" might be it.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
587,mcloward,Overrated? Boring? I beg to differ. One of the most authentic movies ever created.,10,14 July 2005,"What's not to like about this movie? I've seen this film a dozen times and never tire of it. Peter Weir has created something more than a film here. He's created an unforgettable experience, time machine that actually places you on board the HMS Surprise.His attention to detail for that period is almost perfect. The dialog is accurate for that time in history and closely follows the Patrick O'Brian books (the film is a combination of two O'Brian books). Some have criticized the movie as dull, boring, etc., the books have been criticized as that, but Weir has made a film here that doesn't follow today's tired format full of explosions and trite dialog. This is definitely a ""thinking man's"" film.Paul Bettany is outstanding as Dr. Stephen Maturin and Russell Crowe is the perfect casting choice for Capt. Jack Aubrey. Bettany is a highly underrated actor, if you want my opinion. He plays the role of the on-board surgeon quite well.In fact the entire acting crew has been perfectly cast. My only disappointment is there are no plans to produce more movies from the fascinating series of O'Brian books.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
588,carolinebaldock,Superb interpretation of life at sea in that period,10,14 March 2017,"Peter Wier's Master and Commander is a great tribute to his attention to detail and his feel for the period. His casting created a crew that was totally credible with faces that truly matched the period. All the acting is superb and the story told true to the spirit of O'Brien. As a fan of these books and a trans Atlantic traveler in tall ships I applaud Peter's attention to detail and his enthusiasm for the brief. It has to be my favourite film of all time. I have just found the extended version of the film with commentary from Peter and details of how the film was made. Incredible. So good. Thank you Peter, for giving us sea life from that period. The story was based on the Hunting of the Essex, so all based on truth. Wonderful. A great director.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
589,shan_t_man,A tribute to the Main Star,9,28 October 2005,"The movie was fascinating. Interesting and quite accurate of the way of life (and death) in those times. I am a big fan of the author. Alos, I have worked and sailed on a number of tall ships. The tall ship that appears in the film is (or was) the ""HMS"" Rose. She is a replica of a real British ship that was - by necessity - one of the reasons for the beginning of the American Navy. When I sailed on her she was under the command of Capt. Baily, one of the finest tall ship skippers I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. The beauty and stateliness's of the Rose was captured perfectly by the director and film crews. It was a thrilling chance for me and all film goers to experience the majesty of a bygone time.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
590,henrik-19077,One of the all time greats,10,25 March 2021,"A must see! Every frame of this movie really is a work of art. The scenary, the music, soundeffects and the charcters. A true shame it got in the shadow of lotr 3 when released.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
591,simon-gibbons,An opportunity - not quite taken,6,22 September 2006,"The books, I think, are the best novels ever written. O'Brian takes you into that period (the British Royal Navy, 200 years ago), gives you a wealth of detail, touches of delightful humour, and characters you feel you really *know*.All of which makes life difficult for someone wanting to bring the books to the screen.All credit to Peter Weir and the crew behind the camera for taking a lot of trouble to recreate the physical world of a wooden warship in the age of sail ... but all too often, I was left saying things like ""Jack Aubrey wouldn't say that"", ""Maturin wouldn't speak like that"" or ""Pullings doesn't look like that."" And there are plot weaknesses too - the Acheron taking the Surprise off guard, as though she knew exactly where the Surprise would be? There's no suggestion that Jack Aubrey had any kind of rendezvous to meet, so how could the Acheron know? And one of the characters says, of the Acheron's mission, ""It could tip the balance in the war,"" or some such. Rubbish. It is an out of the way mission, to which the Surprise, an out-of-date frigate, can safely be sent. And then, after Jack turns back from his pursuit to help Maturin, he finds that his quarry has turned back too, and it's never explained why.Read the books, by all means, and savour all their richness. Then, by all means, watch the movie for a faithful physical recreation of that world ... but no more.",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
592,pnestepny,Great movie,10,21 February 2018,"I really like the historical aspects of the movie. Well done, one of the best historical-fiction movie I have ever seen!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
593,Jackleton,Bias far from reality...........,1,4 March 2006,"I thought this movie was very tedious. It had one decent battle scene at the beginning and a marginal battle scene at the end. Everything in the middle was uninteresting filler. They spent more time on the Galapagos islands then anywhere else looking at animal specimens that I couldn't care less about. If I wanted that I'd have watched Jaques Cousteau. I was expecting a movie about wooden naval ships, but those were more of a background scene in this movie. The character of the captain was also as shallow and see through as plastic wrap. All the other characters around him has to tell the audience how great the captain is because the captain character sure couldn't demonstrate it on his own. The political correctness was also nauseating. Make better use of your time and money by checking out something else. Now let's try others capable actors and not about a fiction movie but the true life of french privateers where this movie tend to go, Robert Surcouf life is 10 times more interesting and passionating than the phantasm of O'Brian book, just a movie telling how Surcouf captured the HMS Kent and so much more British warships would not be a story close to reality, it would be the reality of this times!",Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World
