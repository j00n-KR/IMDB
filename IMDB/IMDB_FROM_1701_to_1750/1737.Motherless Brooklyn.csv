0,SnoopyStyle,Chinatown with Tourette's,6,12 December 2020,"It's 1950's New York. Private detective Lionel Essrog (Edward Norton) has Tourette's Syndrome. His boss and best friend is murdered while on a case. He intends to solve it and find his killers. It leads him to a series of urban gentrification efforts against the black and Latino population. A mystery man (Willem Dafoe) directs him to all powerful developer Moses Randolph (Alec Baldwin) who controls everything including the politics. He falls for Laura Rose (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) who is fighting for the minorities in the city.I really like the story of corruption and power in city politics. It's Chinatown all over again. I wish that Edward Norton played it straight with a little more clarity in the beginning. Mostly I wish that he could get out the Tourette's. I haven't read the book and I'm not saying that he's doing it wrong. The story is so dense that more than anything, the Tourette's is distracting. It's unnecessary and it doesn't serve much. There are obvious mistakes that Lionel makes but I buy them for his character. He's smart but this is not Sherlock. All in all, I really like the crime noir story but I still want some changes.",Motherless Brooklyn
1,boblipton,Great Acting,7,10 November 2019,"Edward Norton has Tourette's Syndrome, which comes out when he is stressed, which does not include driving a car, or getting into a gunfight or walking into a strange location when you expect them to kill you. He works for Bruce Willis, who runs a detective agency out of Brooklyn. Willis gets kidnapped and shot, so Norton is the man in the shop who is supposed to track down the killer. This leads him on a tour of an alternate 1956 New York City, which seems to be populated by great actors like Willem Dafoe, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Cherry Jones, Bobby Cannavale and Alec Baldwin as a megalomaniac closely modeled on Robert Moses. One of them is the bad guy. Guess which and why.... I had it figured out four minutes before Norton did, but then, I don't have Tourette's. Still, that means it's a fair mystery.... not who, but why.Mostly, though, it's a chance for actors to strut their stuff, and none more so than Norton, who besides having Tourette's has an eidetic memory, smokes pot to control his symptoms, and will never be rich. No one seems to be put off by his tics, including touching women, making comments which are mildly lewd, making noises while jazz musicians play, and in one scene where he is trying to light a lady's cigarette, repeatedly lighting a match and blowing it out before it can get to the cigarette. Everyone is astonishingly enlightened, except, of course, Baldwin. Being evil, he hates poor people, and Blacks in particular.Good acting, but when I want to visit 1956 New York City, I don't want everyone there to be from 2019. Still, some great acting, some great locations, and the CGI recreation of Penn Station revives my anger towards the morons who tore it down.",Motherless Brooklyn
2,nogodnomasters,I have threads in my head,5,24 January 2020,"Lionel Essrog (Edward Norton) has a mild case of Tourette's Syndrome but acts as if he has autism as he can remember everything. He works for Frank Minna (Bruce Willis) who gets whacked early. He embarks on his own investigation that takes him into the powerful New York Borough Authority.It was an interesting film and in spite of the twists, you knew how it would end and if your good, you knew where the clue was located.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Motherless Brooklyn
3,kosmasp,Norton is working it,9,24 March 2020,"Actually more than working it, because he's doing multiple things or has multiple layers. So it's not just the acting and directing (and whatever else he did on set and behind the scenes), it is that his character is quite - colorful and diverse to put it mildly.He also is someone who swears a lot. It is a condition but try to explain that to someone. Norton does a wonderful job portraying something that is not easy. But he knows his way around outside/inside and more than one layer of character in his roles. This is a love letter to detective movies and movies of the past. It is also a matter of taste. Some will like it and some will question the pacing (which for what it is, is perfect and in tune with the theme it portrays) - all in the eye of the beholder - or detective I guess",Motherless Brooklyn

5,CinemaSerf,"Takes a while to get going, but worth the wait.",7,17 December 2019,"Ed Norton is great in this very good looking murder-mystery story about a PI who decides to investigate the murder of his mentor and boss (Bruce Willis). I'll admit that I found the Tourette's to be quite irritating for the first 20 minutes but it does, over a fairly short period of time, stop being just mimicry and start being a positive attribute to the film. Willem Defoe is also convincing as the angry, duplicitous, brother of Alec Baldwin (whose contribution isn't quite so essential to the plot). The writing is strong and direction doesn't drag at all over this really quite long film. A lot of attention to detail here - and if you are a jazz fan then you will find the score to die for.",Motherless Brooklyn
6,writers_reign,Orphan In A Storm,9,7 December 2019,"When Edward Norton took an option on the novel back in the day he was liitle more than a humble actor albeit a fine one, now, twenty years later he brings it to the screen as a triple-threat, writer-director-actor and we all owe him big-time. Clearly someone involved was frightened by Chinatown and possibly that same someone has distanced themselves (glad about that) by placing this entry on the opposite coast. Again, given the themes - political corruption, racism - Norton wisely moves the timescale a good forty years back to the fifties and hits it right on the nose. Strangely enough the great fifties-set film with a jazz score that immediately springs to mind is Sweet Smell Of Success but when you stack them up against each other although there's nothing to choose in terms of quality the Odets screenplay plays as frenetic in best city-that-never-sleeps mode whilst the Norton entry is almost tranquil. This is a movie that cannot be praised too highly, from the outstanding ensemble acting to the atmosphere, to the photography to the jazz-inflected score. Don't miss it if you've got anything at the front of your face and on the sides of your head.",Motherless Brooklyn
7,grantss,"Excellent, classy film noir-ish thriller",9,22 November 2020,"New York, 1950s. When his boss is murdered by the people who hired him, private investigator Lionel Essrog sets out to find out who the killers are. His investigations uncover a thick tangled web leading all the way to the most powerful man in New York.Written by, directed by and starring Edward Norton, Motherless Brooklyn is a superb throw-back to the film noir classics of the '40s and '50s. It also reminded me strongly of Roman Polanski's Chinatown, a '70s film noir classic, in many respects.Very intriguing and engaging with a plot that is wonderful in its complexity yet not gratuitousnessly and unnecessarily complex. The unpicking of the plot makes for a very compelling journey, so enthralling that you hardly realise the film is nearly 2½ hours long!Solid performance by Edward Norton in the lead role with good support from Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Bruce Willis and Willem Dafoe. Alec Baldwin shines in the sort of role that has become his strong suit - the all-powerful mogul. Think Jack Donaghy but in the 1950s.Brilliant.",Motherless Brooklyn
8,oscaralbert,This flick reveals the startling news that the USA has had TWO Black Presidents . . .,9,7 November 2019,". . . in a row! Now the perplexing, unprecedented events of the past five years ALL make sense! Many folks have wondered WHY anyone would use a Birth Certificate Conspiracy to launch a political career, as well as losing sleep trying to puzzle out WHAT juicy tidbit of blackmail Russia's Red Commie KGB Chief ""Mad Vlad"" Putin holds as an ace up his sleeve against the head of the rump cushion mob. Today we finally know! During MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN, ""Alec B."" plays ""Fred T.,"" a notorious Brooklyn organizer for the clan. However, despite his extreme Rachel Animosity, Fred/Moses fathers a Child of Color by raping a Black maid in a broom closet during a swanky Fat Cat Rich People party. Notwithstanding risky ""gene lightening"" therapy (with severe, soul-destroying side effects), Fred's child is groomed to be POTUS while Fred is inconsistently busy deporting 200,000 People of Color to their presumed ancestral homelands (MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN, 1:03:30). However, by the 21st Century the KGB locks up Don Juan's birth certificate in a Kremlin Vault, and the rest is histrionics. We should all thank the always eponymous Warner Bros. for so clearly warning us that literally ANYTHING can happen next!",Motherless Brooklyn
9,evanston_dad,Bad Adaptation,4,4 March 2020,"I'm terrible at retaining the plots of books I've read. I can remember whether or not I liked them, but two days after finishing a novel I couldn't tell you the first thing about any of the plot details.I enjoyed reading Jonathan Lethem's ""Motherless Brooklyn"" (not as much as ""Fortress of Solitude,"" but that's a different review), and was looking forward to seeing the film based on it. Half way through I thought to myself, ""man, I really don't remember this book well at all,"" because virtually nothing in the movie, beyond the first scene, rang a bell. How gratifying it was, then, to read other people's reactions to this movie and come to find that it bears almost no resemblance to the novel. I knew I was bad at remembering books, but I didn't think I was THAT bad.I don't know why Edward Norton, who also directed this film in addition to starring, wanted to even make a movie of the book if he was going to change it this much. He sets it in an older time period (the book was present day, I believe, or close to present day). And he clearly wants to force the story into being about the marginalization of urban black people, which is relevant right now but isn't what Lethem's book was about. Just craft an original screenplay if that's the story you want to tell.But even if I could overlook the terrible adaptation, the movie in its own right just isn't any good. It's slow and ponderous and confusing and one-note and too long. There's too much fat, like extended scenes of nightclub jazz, that obviously mean something to Norton but don't necessarily mean anything to the people watching his movie. It's an undisciplined film, as if Norton was making it for himself and a close group of like-minded buddies, not for a more general audience.So it's really a no-win situation. People who come to the film because they liked the book will be pissed that it's not a better version of it, and those who know nothing of the book have only a dull, boring movie to watch.Grade: D+",Motherless Brooklyn
10,ferguson-6,a worthy throwback,6,31 October 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. Gumshoe film noir from the 1940's and 1950's is probably my favorite genre after suspense thrillers. Classics like THE MALTESE FALCON, KISS ME DEADLY, A LONELY PLACE, LAURA, and DOUBLE INDEMNITY draw me in with style, mood, and character flaws. Tough guys and clever women combined with secrets, empty clues, and false bunny trails can mesmerize me for hours. Evidently Edward Norton shares my affection for this genre, as he purposefully shifted the time frame of Jonathan Lethem's novel from 1999 to 1957 for the big screen adaptation.Norton dons 4 hats for his passion project that's been brewing for almost a decade. He writes, directs (his second time at the helm), produces, and stars as Lionel Essog, the assistant to Private Investigator Frank Minna (played by Bruce Willis). Lionel, often referred to as ""Brooklyn"" or ""Freak Show"" suffers from Tourette's syndrome, causing him many uncomfortable moments of awkward verbal outbursts and physical tics, while also blessing him with a photographic memory and world class attention to detail. The concern here was that Norton the actor would turn the character into a gumshoe ""Rain Man"", but that never happens, as his affliction rarely overshadows a scene or the story.One of the first things we notice is that the film looks beautiful. The costumes (Amy Roth) and set design (Beth Mickle, Kara Zeigon) and cinematography (2-time Oscar nominee Dick Pope) are all spot on and top notch. The classic cars are especially impressive, despite my pet peeve of each being perfectly washed and waxed in every scene. Daniel Pemberton's retro score perfectly captures the neo-noir moments.This era in New York included jazz clubs, corrupt politicians and power struggles for profiteering from the growth. Norton's film delivers The King's Rooster jazz club with the great Michael Kenneth Williams as the featured trumpet player ... he looks like a natural on stage in the smoky club. We also, of course, have plenty of big time corruption and scheming. The main culprit being City Planner Moses Randolph, the epitome of corruption and racism. Alec Baldwin could play this role in his sleep, and he performs admirably in the not-so-subtle riff on the real life Robert Moses.The film's opening sequence leaves Lionel committed to solving the murder of Minna, his mentor and (only) friend. His co-workers played by Dallas Roberts, Bobby Cannavale, and Ethan Suplee come in and out of the story, contributing very little. Things are most interesting when Lionel crosses paths with brilliant city engineer Paul (Willem Dafoe in a less salty role than in THE LIGHTHOUSE) and activist Laura Rose (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), in a role that would have benefitted from some beefing up in the script. Other supporting roles are filled by Leslie Mann, Fisher Stevens, Cherry Jones, and Josh Pais.The story follows a path not dissimilar to the all-time classic CHINATOWN, and it's in that comparison where the weaknesses in Norton's film are most evident. The dialogue never quite clicks like it should, and at times it comes across like the actors are simply playing dress up 1950's-style, rather than actually experiencing the struggles of the story. Everything just seems too 'clean' for this genre, even the moments of violence. It's the details that make the difference in this genre, and even Norton's voiceover is mishandled. As narrator, his voice is low and gruff which is customary for noir; however, while in character, the voice is high-pitched and sporadic. Both voices are as they should be, but since it's the same character, the contrast takes us out of the moment when the narrator chimes in. The Tourette's Association of America gave its stamp of approval to the film, and we do walk away with sage advice: ""Never lie to a woman who is smarter than you.""",Motherless Brooklyn
11,gradyharp,'I got somethin' wrong with my head. That's the first thing to know.',10,26 July 2020,"For those indelibly impressed with Jonathan Lethem's 1999 highly awarded novel MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN, rest assured that the impact continues with Edward Norton's superb adaptation for the screen and excellent direction - and acting! This is a triple-header for Norton and one deserving of multiple awards.Though the story is well known because of the book's success, the plot follows: Brooklyn's very own self-appointed Human Freakshow, Lionel Essrog (Edward Norton) is an orphan whose Tourettic impulses drive him to bark, count, and rip apart our language in startling and original ways. Together with three veterans of the St. Vincent's Home for Boys - Coney (Ethan Suplee), Danny (Dallas Roberts), Tony (Bobby Carnavale) he works for small-time mobster Frank Minna's (Bruce Willis) limo service cum detective agency. Life without Frank Minna, the charismatic King of Brooklyn - who in his role as an investigator is following the beautiful Laura (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) - would be unimaginable, so who cares if the tasks he sets them are, well, not exactly legal. But when Frank is killed, and Lionel and friends investigate his death. Lionel's world is suddenly topsy-turvy, and this outcast, who has trouble even conversing attempts to untangle the threads of the case while trying to keep the words straight in his head, uncovers the greedy machinations of Moses Randolph (Alec Baldwin), meets the raggedy Paul (Willem Dafoe), discovers the roots of the attempt to 're-structure' Brooklyn and Harlem by Randolph, and many more mystery secrets that would be spoilers to relate. There are superb supporting cast members such as Robert Wisdom, Michael Kenneth Williams, Cherry Jones, Josh Pais et at - a finer cast would be difficult to assemble.This is most assuredly a timely release as we are in the support of BLM: the story is a hint at some of the situations that must be addressed. Engrossing and spellbinding, MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN (btw, that is Frank's moniker assigned to Lionel) is a worthy expansion of Jonathan Lethem's novel. Recommended.",Motherless Brooklyn
12,deloudelouvain,Not a style of movie I enjoy.,5,25 January 2020,"I will apparently never be a fan of Film Noir, or just that style of movie. I don't know where to categorize Motherless Brooklyn but it's just not a style I will ever appreciate. The cast has some big names so I expected some seriously good acting here but even that felt short. Bruce Willis had a very short role, and that's a positive thing, as since Trauma Center he forgot how to act. Willem Dafoe is always good so a bigger role for him would have been better. Alec Baldwin seems to play the same kind of character all the time so no surprise here. As for Edward Norton, playing the main character Lionel Essrog, a detective with Tourette's Syndrome, he's done his job but to me it could have been much better. Storywise it's all very confusing. After watching the whole story with great attention I'm still not sure what it was all about at the end. It's just not that great as a story. The slow pace, the jazzy music, that Film Noir ambiance, it's just not for me.",Motherless Brooklyn
13,ksf-2,historical bit on a real city planner,7,13 April 2021,"An Ed Norton project. He is Lionel Essrog, a detective trying to figure out who gunned down his friend. Alec Baldwin is Moses, a hot-headed big shot in city planning. A fun story in the trivia section here about the real man. Apparently, Norton's grandfather had actually met the real city planner Robert Moses years back. Check Moses out at wikipedia dot com. Bruce Willis is Minna. So we follow Lionel as he runs around town, trying to retrace his friend's steps. In this one, he has Tourette's; Norton seems to enjoy playing people with unusual features. Some great jazz music. Until they beat the crap out of him again. But half the time, it's his own fault for pretending he's someone else. It's pretty good, as detective stories go. Think Chinatown. Directed by Ed Norton.

A fedora-donning Lionel Essrog (Norton), shadows suspects and pieces together paper trails in the aftermath of the unceremonious liquidation of his mentor Frank Minna (Willis), who runs a detective agency, and to whom Lionel, the titular ""motherless Brooklyn"", owes everything, as an orphan taken under his wings.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore",Motherless Brooklyn
15,cherold,Entertaining noir throwback,8,12 April 2020,"I love old detective movies, and at its heart, Motherless Brooklyn is an old detective movie, with the strengths and weaknesses common to the genre.Ed Norton is excellent as a detective with Tourette's hunting the people who killed his boss in 1950s Brooklyn. People are surprisingly understanding of his surprising shouts and taps. The book (which I haven't read) was set in the 90s, so perhaps people are 90s tolerant, but *50s* tolerant?The story is somewhat confusing, which is typical of the genre but could easily have been fixed here. One of Norton's strengths is an amazing memory, so why not, when he hears a name or sees a face, illustrate that with a quick flash of memory. It would have kept viewers clear while offering a window into his mind.Still, it's got a good cast and an engaging story, so if you're a fan of film noir it's well worth checking out. For a rating I'm torn between 7 & 8 but I'll go with 8.",Motherless Brooklyn

17,MOscarbradley,Good enough to see where it could have been so much better.,6,5 May 2021,"You know that ""Motherless Brooklyn"" is going to be a different kind of crime movie from the brilliant opening sequence which introduces us to its narrating anti-hero, a Private Eye with Tourette's Syndrome, played by the film's director, Edward Norton. The sequence is superbly set up but it doesn't explain anything and the bad guys in the scene are shot in shadow and in ends with a killing; yes, we know this movie is going to be 'different'. The period is the late fifties, perfectly captured in Beth Mickle's design and beautifully shot by the great Dick Pope which gives the film the noirish look Norton is after and it's very well cast with Norton himself terrific as the Tourette's inflicted shamus. So far so good.Unfortunately the plot, (corruption in high places), is old hat and as a director Norton is more interested in flash than form; even his use of a hard-boiled narration is a cliche. This is a film eager to be liked but wanting to be original at the same time and failing at it. It's certainly not dismissable; Norton, when he's good, as he is here, is always worth watching and it is certainly a beautiful looking picture. It's just that with a better script, (which Norton also wrote from Jonathan Letham's novel), it could have been so much better and at almost two and a half hours, it's way too long.",Motherless Brooklyn
18,dromasca,immersed in the 50s,9,27 November 2019,"Bruce Willis is one of the famous actors whose names appear in the credits of Edward Norton's 'Motherless Brooklyn', the actor who has been a director for over two decades writing this adaptation of a Jonathan Lethem's novel that directed and release now on screens. Detective Frank Minna, Willis's character, dies about five minutes after the beginning of the film, which is a sign that it is not one of those action films in which he (otherwise an excellent actor) has specialized in the last decades. But Minna leaves behind a mystery to be solved by his employee Lionel Essrog (Edward Norton) and who will immerse him in a complicated plot with ramifications in the political corruption surrounding New York's city developments, and us, as spectators in one of the most authentic cinematic experiences, a time travel in the American reality of the 50's.The talented actor who is Norton was of course fascinated by the role of the detective struck by a nervous illness (Tourette's syndrome) that produces mechanical tics and involuntary and 'unconventional' verbal expressions. His acting performance is remarkable, but there are plenty of other reasons that make 'Motherless Brooklyn' one of the most exciting films of a season among the best in the last decade. To say that the world of New York 60 years ago is well reconstructed on screen is too little. Every detail is compelling and natural, so we have the feeling that we are immersed in this world, with its lights and darkness, with racial inequalities and social injustices, with coin phones and with the fog engulfing the bridges connecting Manhattan to the rest of the city, with nightclubs and the ubiquitous smoke of cigarettes. And then the music - the superb soundtrack of the film, the jazz of the mid-20th century, the sound and rhythm of the city with its joys and despairs.It would be unfair to mention only Norton's acting and omit a team of first-hand actors, some famous, others about to become famous. Gugu Mbatha-Raw is an actress I haven't noticed before and who is launching, I hope, a great career. Bruce Willis appears little, but enough to remind us of how good an actor he can be, and to trigger the whole plot of the movie. Willem Dafoe is amazingly different here, just as amazingly different and very good as in any role he play. The only one who gives a sense of repetition is Alec Baldwin. I understand his motivation on playing negative roles of tycoons or corrupt politicians, but he does it too often in the same tone, thus risking becoming unconvincing. The message that the corruption of politicians and capitalist sharks seems to have remained the same for more than half a century is obvious and does not require explicit overstatement. 'Motherless Brooklyn' is a film that manages to convince through the mastery of reconstruction, the emotion created by the relationships that are established between the characters and the empathy for those different from the norms of the times.",Motherless Brooklyn

22,Thanos_Alfie,Edward Norton...,6,29 January 2021,"""Motherless Brooklyn"" is a Mystery - Drama movie in which we watch a private detective afflicted with Tourette's Syndrome investigating the murder of his boss. He has to search a lot and the evidence that he will find, it will lead him to something that nobody expected.Since I did not know what to expect from this movie, I did not have any expectations by it. I enjoyed it though because it had an interesting plot with some plot twists that I did not expect and the direction of Edward Norton was surprisingly good since he succeeded on showing and explaining very well the plot, something that helped us follow even better the flow of the movie. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to admit that both Edward Norton who played as Lionel Essrog and Alec Baldwin who played as Moses Randolph were simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Gugu Mbatha-Raw's who played as Laura Rose and Willem Dafoe who played as Paul Randolph. To sum up, I have to say that ""Motherless Brooklyn"" is a nice and interesting mystery movie that I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",Motherless Brooklyn
23,cruise01,Long and boring.,4,31 January 2020,"Motherless Brooklyn (2 out of 5 stars).Motherless Brooklyn is a boring neo noir crime film which Edward Norton delivers a great performance. His direction, script, and tone of the movie is so dull and boring. You might want to get comfy cause its long run time does make the movie feel like forever.The plot is about a private investigator Lionel (Edward Norton) who has Tourette's syndrome. When his partner Frank (Bruce Willis) discovers something before something happens to him. Lionel will have to trace his steps and discover who he has been talking too and the corruption that is going on with the Mayor of the city.The plot is dull and with an over long script. It is hard to focus and care on what is going on. The direction is boring. Edward Norton was great playing the character. Bruce Willis was decent for his small brief role. Gugu Mbatha-Raw was okay playing Laura, Lionel's love interest and his source. Willem Dafoe and Alec Baldwin are all side lined as characters.Overall, Motherless Brooklyn is a boring film that fails to get any better with its long and slow direction.",Motherless Brooklyn
24,eddie_baggins,A disappointing bore,4,1 March 2020,"A passion project for its writer, director, star and producer Edward Norton, Motherless Brooklyn is no doubt a piece made with great heart (its main cast all supposedly appeared here free of charge as a favour to Norton) but unfortunately for this crime noir, most of Norton's feature is more of a chore to sit through than an enjoyment as we follow his Tourette's Syndrome suffering Lionel Essrog across his investigation into his mentors murder in New York in the 50's.It was a big move for Norton to transport Jonathan Lethem's well-regarded novel of the same name from a 90's setting to a 50's setting (his second ever venture behind camera after 2000's Keeping the Faith), a decision that came about when Norton felt as though the narrative would suit that era better, and judging from the final product it was a wise move for the film, as its setting is a highlight of the film with Daniel Pemberton's jazzy score and the smoke filled streets of NYC feeling alive and full of mystery here but it's not enough to mask the struggles Norton has making his adaptation come to life.Firstly, it's hard to overly enjoy our two and a half hours with Essrog, a character and a role that seems on paper and delivery to be designed solely for the purpose of Norton scoring awards recognition, as Essrog is a rather non-charismatic oddity that is prone to random outbursts, rhymes and threats but a person we never really come too warm to as he digs deeper and deeper into the nefarious murder of his friend Frank Minna, played by a cameoing Bruce Willis.The other glaring facet of disappointment around Essrog is that his medical condition really doesn't add much to this story at all.Removing his ailment would've taken nothing away from his investigation that includes seedy politicians, building wars and minority groups, while having Norton constantly remind us all that Essrog has Tourette's doesn't make us any more interested in the rather boring pathway he heads down.The best Noirs and those that can be seen even as guilty pleasures always include memorable twists and turns, unforeseen double crosses and colourful side characters that make the plot pop but not even the likes of Bobby Cannavale, Willem Dafoe or Alex Baldwin can make Brooklyn shine with underwritten roles and poorly crafted dialogue, a lowlight of which includes a seriously miscast Leslie Mann as Minna's newly-minted widow.Watching Brooklyn leaves you in a constant state of waiting for things to really take off, waiting for that story development to get things moving into another gear but those moments never come as we are left with uninteresting love interests, far too long in the tooth Jazz Club stop-overs and a convoluted plotline that thinks too highly of itself as it instead flounders about on a long road to nowhere in particular.Final Say -Working with a low-budget and with nothing but passion (and perhaps a little desire for silverware), Motherless Brooklyn is a sometimes valiant attempt by Norton to bring to life a seemingly un-filmable novel but for most of its excessive run-time, this noir is tame and boring more often than not.2 pot plants out of 5",Motherless Brooklyn
25,Ed-Shullivan,"Kudos to the writer, director and star actor Edward Norton for achieving the trifecta",7,16 November 2020,"I always enjoy a film noir set in the 1950's, especially when the film star narrates his/her story interspersed throughout the film. The performances by the supporting cast added to the entertainment value and mystery. Two standout performances were delivered by the small but critical roles played by both Bruce Willis who plays and aging Private Detective named Frank Minna, and the always
Michael Kenneth Williams who plays Trumpet Man. Both characters were empathetic supporters of Lionel Essrog's symptoms of Tourette's syndrome and recognized his uniqueness and uncanny ability to maintain a memory bank that locks in everything he hears and/or sees.Edward Norton may have starred in his own film which he wrote and also directed, but he shared the big screen with many of his co-stars unselfishly and so what we as an audience get to see is a decent mystery/crime film noir with an expansive and Grade 1 celebrity of ""whose who"" with stars such as Bruce Willis, Alec Baldwin and Willem Dafoe, to name but a few.I would recommend Motherless Brooklyn as a better than good crime/mystery film and the cinematography and set design are fantastic, but those classic and big 1950's American made cars are a vision of beauty and a childhood memory that wishes I was back in the 1950's once again, which is what Motherless Brooklyn successfully achieved with its realism. Kudos to Edward Norton for achieving his trifecta, as writer, director and starring role. I give this film a well deserved 7 out of 10 IMDB rating.",Motherless Brooklyn

It's an attempt by the (terrific) actor Edward Norton, an attempt at writing and directing a movie. And he failed. Bummer.The bad: the characters are not credible, they are without any true charisma. The story drags on. The editing is off as well, with too many fast cuts between shots.The story is a mess. Cant even summarize it properly, but Edward Norton plays a small time gangster with a speech handicap who is investigating ""something"".Any good? Acting is ok, but not great either. This movie isnt irritating or awful. There are much worse movies out there, but that's hardly a compliment of course. Really had high hopes for this movie, but Edward Norton is simply much better at acting than at directing/writing. Wont recommend this to anyone.

28,paul-allaer,Well intended but overly long and surprisingly flat-footed,5,11 November 2019,"""Motherless Brooklyn"" (2019 release; 144 min.) brings the story of Lionel, a Brooklyn private investigator suffering from Tourette Syndrome. As the movie opens, Lionel is in a car with a colleague, as they await instructions from their boss Frank Minna regarding a stake-out. The bad guys show up, and before we know it, they drive off with Frank, and Lionel and his colleague are in hot pursuit. They lose track and by the time they catch up, Frank has been shot and left for dead... Why was Frank shot? Who were those bad guys? At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is a labor of love from Edward Norton, who directed, produced, wrote the script (based on Jonathan Lethem's book), and stars as Lionel. The movie was in development hell for YEARS and that Norton finally was able to make it, is a tribute to his persistence and patience. I didn't read the underlying book and hence can't comment how closely the film sticks to the book. Now for the not so good: the movie, set in the 1950s, plays out as a film noir-wanna be (with correlating photography and musical score), and should create a lot of tension and drama. Alas, none of that happened and I was surprised how flat-footed the movie was. I never felt emotionally invested in any of the characters. And what it the plot's big picture? It took forever to take shape, and then it took another forever to play out. In other words, the movie runs far too long (2 1/2 hrs, maybe 40-45 min. too long) for its own good. Norton gives a good performance as the Tourette Syndrome suffering PI, but how many times can one apologize for suffering from Tourette? (Lionel apologizes, literally, dozens of times throughout the movie.) Bruce Willis, who gets second billing, has less than 10 min. of screen time in the entire movie. Alec Baldwin, Leslie Mann and Willem Dafoe also have small roles. One of the very best aspects of the movie is the score, courtesy of versatile and rapidly up-and-coming composer Daniel Pemberton. On top of that, Thom Yorke contributes a new song (""Daily Battles"", it also plays prominently in the movie's trailer).""Motherless Brooklyn"" premiered at this year's Telluride film festival to positive acclaim. The movie was released wide the weekend before last, with mixed box office results. I finally went to see it this weekend, and the Sunday afternoon screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay (about 15 people). The audience applauded when the movie's end credits started rolling. I can't say that I shared the audience's feeling. If you are in the mood to check out a film noir-wanna be that is a bit overly long for its own good (and in my view surprisingly flat-footed), I'd suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Motherless Brooklyn
29,subxerogravity,That was pretty darn good!,8,5 November 2019,"I went into this not expecting much but Edward Norton gave till it hurt.
Overall, this was a great movie with some amazing performances by Norton and his fantastic ensemble cast. So well acted by such fine actors.
It's a very good murder mystery. That classic gum shoe style was done perfectly.
I love the art direction. He painted a great picture of 50s style New York.
And the music was stellar. Those jazz numbers really blended in perfectly with the atmosphere. Then I had that one piece of music made by Thom Yorke of Radiohead (you'll know it once you hear).
This was a really great movie.",Motherless Brooklyn
30,jtindahouse,A very long and tedious experience,4,10 April 2020,"It's amazing the difference two films, both two and a half hours long, can feel like in terms of duration. A great 150 minute film can fly by and leave you asking how it is already over, whereas a tedious film of similar length can feel like 5 hours with you checking the time every ten minutes hoping more time than that has passed. 'Motherless Brooklyn' is unfortunately the latter. This was a very long and painful movie to sit through.The biggest problem with this film stemmed from the fact that I simply didn't care. The film sets up a mystery of sorts early on, and the rest of the film is based around solving that mystery and discovering other truths along the way. The problem is that no time is spent making me care enough about the characters to make me give a hoot about whether they get justice or not. It's not like they couldn't fit it into the runtime, right? There is not one single character in this film (and there are a lot of them) that I found likeable and wanted to see more of.The only thing I managed to enjoy about this film was Edward Norton's performance. He plays a man with Tourette's syndrome and does so very convincingly. He's certainly a very different actor to the one we came to know early in his career, however he can still be very watchable when he wants to be.Sadly though that's where the compliments end for this film. Maybe they could've gotten away with this film if they condensed it down and cut an hour off the runtime. There are ample spots where they could've done it. I couldn't count the amount of times I thought to myself ""Does this scene really need to be here?"" In fact through the middle of the film the investigation part of the story is almost entirely put aside while they try to introduce an extremely forced romance into the story. Stay far away from this one I'm sorry to say. It's not flash.",Motherless Brooklyn
31,Turfseer,"Norton's attempt at film noir turns out to be a soporific poor man's ""Chinatown""",3,10 November 2019,"Motherless Brooklyn is based upon the 1999 novel by Jonathan Lethem of the same name. Edward Norton had been interested in bringing the novel to film for years and ended up writing the screenplay, acting in the lead role and directing. Norton, however, decided to change the novel's contemporary 1999 setting to the 1950s, which he felt it was better suited to film noir as opposed to more of the novel's apparent psychological emphasis.
To his credit, Norton has always eschewed the limelight, preferring to take the subway as opposed to being driven in a limousine. But he also has a reputation as a perfectionist and has had a history of not always getting along with collaborators. Unfortunately here it appears that he got little feedback from others while crafting the screenplay.
Norton used Lethem's main character as his protagonist: Lionel Essrog, a gumshoe posing as a reporter, who happens to have Tourette's syndrome. But Norton invented his own antagonist, Randolph Moses (Alec Baldwin), based on the NY power broker, Robert Moses.
The plot is convoluted and Norton's screenplay is dialogue heavy. Hence, things move along at a glacial pace until the denouement, where things finally get resolved. The inciting incident involves the murder of Lionel's boss, Frank Minna (Bruce Willis), who has four private eyes who work for him, all of whom Minna rescued from an abusive orphanage when they were kids (in the novel, there is a much greater emphasis on the relationships with these four).
Norton was probably drawn to his main character given his ""interesting"" handicap. But it's annoying how the character has to continually explain what Tourette's is to everyone he comes in contact with. What's more I wasn't quite sold on Norton's acting job in depicting an individual afflicted with said neurodevelopmental disorder (let's just say his depiction wasn't natural enough for me).
The bulk of the picture involves Lionel attempting to solve who killed his mentor. This takes him to Harlem where he meets an African-American woman, Laura Rose (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), who's involved in opposing elements in the city government attempting to gentrify the neighborhood and have black people expelled to less desirable areas.
For quite a long stretch, we don't see how the antagonist is connected to this insidious plot, and various people are either assaulted or killed (including Laura's father, the owner of a Harlem jazz club). Also in the mix is Paul (Willem Dafoe) who has held a grudge against his powerful brother Randolph since childhood.
We finally find out in the final quarter of the film that the villain indeed is Moses Randolph, a humorless baddie who is the opposite of a charming Tony Soprano type of character. In addition to the aforementioned glacial pacing, it's really Norton's heavy-handed depiction of his Robert Moses character that does the film in-he's simply a one note, unlikable straw man that Norton uses to peddle his simplistic good guy vs. bad guy scenario.
In the end, Norton of course wants to be on the good guy side. SPOILERS AHEAD. Without going into too much detail, Lionel brokers a deal with Randolph to ensure no harm comes to Laura-he threatens to release information which reveals Randolph is actually Laura's father-after Randolph forced himself on Laura's mother, while she was working as a housekeeper years earlier. Shades of ""Chinatown"" but really a poor man's version.
Had Norton left the screenwriting to perhaps a more established professional in the business, this film might not have turned out as the unmitigated long-winded failure it turned out to be.",Motherless Brooklyn

The depiction of New York and the complexities of the rich and politics at the time are brilliantly depicted. The writing is also very good as I loved the dialogue, metaphors and interactions between characters. The various subplots do a good job of weaving together and leading to a solid conclusion.

Joe:Retaliation.
This is a 1950's style crime drama that was written, produced and directed by Ed Norton-oh yeah, he also stars in it, too. Bruce plays a private detective in New York and Ed is one of his assistants. Ed was an orphan and after Bruce took him under his wing and taught him the P.I. business, he gave Ed the nickname 'Motherless Brooklyn'. Ed has a photographic memory, which helps Bruce on cases but Ed also has Tourette's Syndrome, which can put a damper on things if he has a tick at the wrong time. Alec plays a building commissioner that is destroying areas of the city-mostly involving Black & Hispanic tenants-to put up new parks. Willem is Alec's brother and Gugu is in a group that is protesting Alec's methods. The story is authentic looking with a nice noir style to it and everyone does a good acting job but it's a little slow in parts. There are the usual murders, dirty deals, hidden secrets, etc....and some of the stuff Ed would say whenever he would have a nervous tick was funny-I don't know if it was supposed to be, but it was.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 24 minutes.

34,st-shot,Boroughtown,4,7 November 2019,"Employing at least half a dozen incidentals and characters from Chinatown (1973) Ed Norton saddled with a case of Tourettes channels Jack Nicholson's Jake Gittes in this overlong detective that supposedly takes place in the late 50s while borrowing liberally from other periods.

It makes for the film's greatest mystery, how do they pull it off without being sued?Norton's direction is sluggish as the film plods along with overlong scenes at a club and a pace killing heart to heart with the female lead. He even seems to sabotage his suspenseful moments by being repetitive in situations while his vintage autos convey an artificial look with their with showroom glow still in tact as they tool around Queens and Brooklyn. A smarmy, obnoxious music score does not help matters.Norton's tic is like a scratch on an album you're expecting after a few listens as he overloads scenes with introspective close-ups of himself, the film's meter running into overtime.

38,kluseba,A movie that successfully hearkens back to the art of cinematography established throughout the golden years of American filmmaking,10,27 November 2019,"Motherless Brooklyn is a wonderful film noir that combines drama with thriller elements. It's easily the greatest American movie of the year and only South Korean masterpiece Parasite beats it on an international level. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie were nominated for several Academy Awards a few months from here.The greatest element about this movie is its atmosphere. It's dirty, gloomy and sinister. This is due to excellent camera techniques recalling film noir techniques of the fifties. The light techniques also blend in very well as the movie works a lot with dimmed lights and different shades. The settings also contribute as the lifestyles of the rich and poor are contrasted by the locations they live. The period cars, clothes and music blend in perfectly as well. There are few films that have brought the past back to life so authentically as it's the case here.One has to point out the character developments and excellent acting performances. Edward Norton is incredible as socially awkward investigator with a strong moral compass. Gugu Mbatha-Raw convinces as upright human rights activist with a mysterious past. Alec Baldwin convinces as ambitious, eloquent but sinister businessman. Willem Dafoe perfectly incarnates his brilliant, desperate and isolated brother. Bruce Willis convinces as courageous leader with a hidden agenda. The way these numerous characters interact like dynamic pawns in a twisted game of chess is absolutely incredible.Last but not least, one has to underline the excellent story. It comes around with interesting developments, turns and twists without ever feeling staged. The story is on the pulse of time of what was going on in the United States of America in the years and decades following the Second World War. You can learn about that period of time in this movie than you ever will in documentaries and history books. Telling you anything more would lessen the magnificent experience of watching this masterpiece.In the end, Motherless Brooklyn is a brilliant film noir that perfectly balances drama and thriller elements. It's a movie that takes its time to develop its characters, settings and story but the audience will be rewarded with an authentic, emotional and intellectual masterpiece. Nervously fidgeting youngsters might find the movie slightly long-winded but fail to understand that this movie successfully hearkens back to the art of cinematography established throughout the golden years of American filmmaking.",Motherless Brooklyn
39,aidanratesmovies,"A slow, but unique and smart crime thriller",9,24 March 2020,"Cool, compact, and by all means compelling, Motherless Brooklyn may struggle to earn your attention every minute of its screen time, but is certainly worth the 2 and a half hour journey. Edward Norton stars, directs, and writes the film- all with great success. The film can be a bit slow at times, especially with more drawn out moments than others, but all together makes for quite an interesting mystery that is quite unique, and certainly worth seeing. Ed Norton stars as Lionel, a P.I with tourette's syndrome, and he does an absolutely fantastic job. His performance is one of many in the film to go unrecognized by the academy, with Gugu Mbatha-Raw also casting a shining light on her role as Laura Rose. The film is tightly written, and brilliantly so. Adapted from Jonathan Lethem's novel, the film is full of twists and turns and a sharp sense of nature, that all together makes for not just a great homage piece to the 1950's and its culture (especially in New York) but also a truly gripping crime thriller, that is bound to engage you in at least some ways. The cinematography is nice, although often familiar, and the atmosphere and style of the film is absolutely grand. Norton nails the feel of the film in every inch of material shown on screen, and is not just a great effort from his part as an actor, but certainly as a director and writer too. In the end, Motherless Brooklyn can at times be a slow moving film, but it is certainly an interesting piece of work that should not go unrecognized, and is filled with talent to the brim.

40,questl-18592,Brooklyn Needs Moms,4,3 July 2021,"Oh Ed. I remember the days when I was just a blossoming movie fan and I would proclaim Edward Norton to be the greatest working actor. The man that disappears into roles, that is less concerned with his name or persona than he is with the performance. Over the years, come to find out he's not the most pleasant man in the world and now to watch this... Stick to acting, Mr. Norton. Preferably in someone else's movies.Motherless Brooklyn feels like a vanity project in so many ways. The whole movie revolves around Norton and his desire to play around with this Tourette's tick that he was apparently dying to put to screen. Problem is, it feels fake and workshopped, convenient and entirely unneeded. Sadly, that feels like the problem with the whole movie. He's trying for this noir vibe and it never felt authentic or real, it felt like... Like a biochemist making a grilled cheese. They know all the ingredients, know the directions but it's lacking the soul and the passion that turns these ingredients into magic.I really don't think this is worth watching. I found Norton's portrayal to be obnoxious and the whole idea of the movie has just been done so much better by others.

I find it can be very Samey and the plots can be just a little too convoluted and to be honest Motherless Brooklyn is no different but one thing makes this stand out from the others is the brilliant performance from Edward Norton.Norton plays , Lionel Essrog , who is a private detective who suffers from Tourette's syndrome . Gifted with a few clues and an obsessive mind, Lionel sets out to solve the murder of Frank Minna , his mentor and only friend.Norton is probably the only reason to recommend this film. His portrayal of a Torrette's sufferer is fantastic.
On screen virtually the entire time , Norton really displays his versatility.
Not only is he great on screen , he directed the film too .As Noirs tend to do , it goes around the houses quite a bit and gets a little confusing at times but not too much to make it unwatchable.
It looks great and there is some good music in it .

Norton wrote the script based on a novel that included many real life elements true and fictional rooted in a time in which the criminal power hungry politician/builder Robert Moses literally changed NYC to his personal vision. Norton gives a tour de force of acting and directing a rather complicated story.Adding another element to the story is Norton's characteration of a brilliant man suffering from what would later be known as Tourette's Syndrome. Instead of being a curiosity it adds humanity with a tenseness as he nails the ""ticks"" of the affliction. Everything seems stacked against Lionel who uses his special intellect to uncover major graft -i ncluding more than even Robert Moses himself knew. Treachery was rampant to a point of confusion requiring careful viewing in order to understand the complicated story. That said, it something special for the mature viewer.Even though it is a demanding watch the rewards are plentiful. NYC in the fifties is beautifully re-created. The cineamatography is wonderfully muted for tremendous ambience of film noir. The jazz portions are authentic period and truly excellent.

46,eric262003,A Pet Project Edward Norton Can Be Proud Of,9,17 May 2021,"In 2019, both Mel Gibson and Edward Norton directed two movies that were based off of novel that were released over 20 years. In Mel Gibson's case it was ""The Professor and The Madman"", a film in which Gibson openly admiited that he regrets ever making. So much so, that he refused to do any kind of press releases based off that movie. By way of contrast, after 19 years of directing his last film ""Keeping the Faith"", Norton finally was back at the director's seat and starred in this detective noir period piece ""Motherless Brooklyn"" and he feels proud of his accomplishment. And why shouldn't he? He managed to transform a film that from the book it was set in the 1990's and made it into a 1950's period piece and gave New York City an authentic spin with a crime story juxtaposed with political events that really happened at that time. With the landscape of The Big Apple evolving, the city was facing big changes. Some for the better, but also a lot for the worse. Although with the building of bridges and expansion of highways were beneficial for communters and the development of suburban structures provided better homes for big families to settle, the bad was that it was all for the sake of greed and corruption by people who were doing it for their own selfish benefits. That might seem like a mouthful, but the narrative is very easy to follow.Norton who also wrote the script was well stars as Detective Lionel Essrog, a sleuth with a photographic memory who also is faced with Tourette's Syndrome. He was groomed into the decective business through head detective Frank Minna (Bruce Willis). Minna picked Essrog and three other colleagues, Tony Vermonte (Bobby Cannavale), Gilbert Coney (Ethan Suplee) and Danny Fantl (Dallas Roberts) when they were kids who were residing in an orphanage. Essrog was a favourite of Minna's because of his ability to remember conversations days later. This occurs when Frank instructs Lionel and Danny to be around when things should go wrong as Frank is to attend a meeting with some very heavy-handed authority figures. And sure enough, things do go wrong for Frank as an exciting car chase ensues which sadly results in Frank meeting his fate with the help of a bullet to his chest. This leads to Lionel with his mindset on investigating the death of his boss and mentor which leads him getting involved in some very shady political corruption based primarily on the reshaping of New York City by power hungry, greedy politicians. This leads him to a young lady named Laura Rose (GuGu Mbatha-Raw) who's joining an organization to stop gentrification that is affecting Harlem and the pushing out of community members who live in the area.Norton's multi-tasking ways are always excellent as star, director, writer and producer. One of the things that make Lionel such an endearing character was not kist from the performance by Edward Norton, but for the way he made Lionel a multi-layered character. His character goes beyond the parameters of having Tourette's Syndrome and even his crippling disease was handled with the greatest with care. And though the opening scene was spontaneous and fast-paced, it then remains at a steady pace in typical noir fashion. This allows the viewer to get a better understanding of the characters and the situations they are facing. Aside from the acting, the technical aspects are truly a treat for the eyes. The settings, cars, costumes, buildings, lighting are all very captivating and seem to fit the time period. The jazzy background from reknowned trumpet player Wynton Marsalis adds colour to the atmosphere of the setting. There's also a wonderful song from Thom Yorke of Radiohead ""Daily Battles"". Aside from the leads of Norton and Mbatha-Raw, the supporting performers also are top notch veterans like Bruce Willis, Bobby Cannavale, Willem Dafoe, Leslie Mann, Cherry Jones, Dallas Roberts and Alec Baldwin. Baldwin is the the scene stealer here as a corrupt community planner who's power and greed both helps the city while having little regard to the people who live there.Though the novel was released in 1998, there are some issues that haven't really aged much. Even to this date, politicians move forward everyday to make our lives better without having a clear conscious of who it affects. Their decisions may benefit or it may hinder the people who reside in these cities. There is a lot of political aspects in this narrative that may outweigh the detective noir story, but it's still provides a great deal of provoative issues featured here.",Motherless Brooklyn

53,educallejero,"Slow, boring, and unrealistic",1,29 November 2019,"This movie is so slow, so boring, with a terrible score and a heavy handed approach, and worst of all, unrealistic in the portrayal of the characters and how they talk and react, more than anything to the protagonist.
It's just a terrible movie, besides the good intentions (a protagonist with a mental disorder that isn't dangerous or ""crazy"" for shock value only, denouncing the very real institutional racism, political corruption, etc.).The main problem, I believe, is the direction and the tone. There is no tension. The tourette syndrome breaks the tension every three minutes. But half the time it is not used for laughs as the movie progresses, and is not really a deep exploration of the problems it creates with other people. But then half the time it is used for laughs, but it is just not funny, because that's not the tone of the movie. And sometimes the jokes are funny in theory, but the editing or acting just doesn't let them land. With no tension, no score, a slow pace, a PG-13 script taking away realism from the characters and their reactions and dialogues, and failed and intermittent attempts of comedy, this is a failure in every sense.Horrible, horrible film.",Motherless Brooklyn
54,rockman182,Motherless Brooklyn (2019),7,3 November 2019,"I got threads in my head. I got threads in my head, man. Edward Norton is a great actor but I've never seen him as a director. I thought Motherless Brooklyn looked like an interesting noir of sorts, with a man with Tourettes in the lead role. The film looks nice and stylish, has a wonderful score, and great performances, but it is overlong and gets lost in its own narrative to ever really work, unfortunately.The film is about a private investigator with Tourette Syndrome, who witnesses his boss's demise and then must piece together clues left behind to figure out who is behind it. This man, named Lionel Essrog, is very smart and has a great attention to detail and information. However, he is held back by his various ticks and his inappropriate verbal outbursts. He gets mixed with danger and finds love in 1950's New York City.I'm sorry but I found a lot of Edward Norton's afflictions in this film funny. Not sure if it was intentional but the moment's he says inappropriate thing is hilarious. I think Norton is really good in this movie. Its definitely a passion project for Norton and something he wanted to get going for years. Unfortunately, as stylish and beautiful the film is, its most certainly hampered by its long running length and somewhat dull passages.I kept clock checking the film after an hour or so and kept thinking of things that could have been left on the cutting floor. I appreciate the noir elements and the call back to NYC during the 50's but it gets boring and confusing after a while and you find yourself wanting a way out of Motherless Brooklyn. Still, Norton does a good job behind the camera though the script could have used some revision and cutting.6.5/10",Motherless Brooklyn
55,bankofmarquis,Too slow and self-indulgent for my tastes,6,15 January 2021,"There is no denying that Edward Norton is a talented performer. Ever since he burst onto the scene with his Oscar nominated performance in PRIMAL FEAR, he has been a presence both on and off the screen as an Actor, Writer, Producer and Director.With his latest effort, MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN (based on the base selling novel by Jonathan Lethem), Norton puts ALL of his skills to work as he Produced, Directed, Wrote and Starred in this Private Eye thriller from 2019.If only Norton had handed at least 1 of those jobs over to someone else.Norton stars as Lionel Essrog, a Private Eye with Tourette's Syndrome, who's investigation into the murder of a mentor of his exposes corruption, racism, greed and abuse of power in City Hall in New York City in the 1950's.As the star, Norton brings a nice edge to Lionel, who's Tourette's causes him to twitch and belt out words randomly, as well as gives him a photographic memory. While the twitching and random swearing are a bit over the top at times, the photographic memory helps Lionel solve the case (of course it does).And that's where I have issue with writer Norton - as he cannot resist the urge to showcase Actor Norton's propensity to go over the top and puts in many, many ""Tourette's moments"" as well as putting in long dialogue scenes that tries to show the audience how smart Lionel is.Unfortunately, Director Norton indulges Writer Norton and Actor Norton so the film has a languid pace that just sits on Lionel's actions and words. This is a 2 hour movie packed into a 2 1/2 hour run time. Now, to be fair to Director Norton, there are some absolutely gorgeous and interesting pictures put on the screen and the atmosphere (and characters) that are created are interesting (enough) to ALMOST forgive the self-indulgent ways of Writer/Actor/Director Norton.As for the rest of the cast, Bruce Willis is...Bruce Willis as a Private Eye that works with Lionel and Willem DaFoe is at his ""Willem DeFoe-iest"" in portraying a critic of New York City Hall with a secret past. It's as if Director Norton said to both of these 2 fine actors to just ""do your thing"" while he focused on the myriad of other jobs he had on this film.Special notice needs to be made of the work of Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Femme Fatale Laura Rose (a part that Norton specifically added to the film - her character was not in the book - and wrote just for her). She is quite good in this role and her scenes with Norton crackle somewhat louder than the rest of the film.And then there is Alec Baldwin as a corrupt, racist, politician who is looking out for only 1 person - himself. While Baldwin is very good in this 100% serious role, I couldn't be help but be reminded of a certain comedic character he has played for the past few years on Saturday Night Live.The music by Daniel Pemberton and the Cinematography by Dick Pope add greatly to the atmosphere of this film - and that is good - for when the story bogs down (and it bogs down A LOT), there usually is something interesting to look at or listen to.Not a bad film, but it could have been a much better film if someone would have taken at least ONE of the jobs off of Norton (I would vote for Director) and tightened things up and tone down Norton's tendency to ""ham it up"" on screen.Letter Grade: B-6 Stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Motherless Brooklyn

It's worth seeing, but as I said, ""maybe"", only because it's a slow burn and could've been accelerated in spots. The jazz in the club was great as was the authenticity of the neighborhoods.

Really good pacing and a classic of a who-dun-it of a murder, then splat, the ending just doesn't justify all the twists and turns the film takes the onlookers on.

59,kjproulx,"A Calm, Engaging Mystery",8,11 September 2019,"Edward Norton, by most film fans, has been and will always be known as one of the best actors out there. Appearing in classics like Fight Club and more modern masterpieces like Birdman, he's never been one to pick a bad project on purpose. Motherless Brooklyn marks his latest leading role, while also directing and writing. As ambitious and difficult as that is, he has pulled it off quite well. Motherless Brooklyn is a very well-made period piece.Set in the 1950s, this film follows Lionel(Edward Norton) after the murder of his closest friend and colleague. Hellbent on discovering who the killer is, he finds himself on a paper trail across Brooklyn, never giving up on his plan. Being someone who also happens to suffer from Tourette Syndrome, he is a character that has a lot of depth to get behind. Personally, this particular character needed a great performance in order to be authentic, which is where this film shines the most.It's been a while since I've seen Edward Norton this committed to delivering a powerful performance. There are hardly any instances where he feels like he doesn't actually suffer from this condition. His devotion is what kept me engaged because the overall story does slightly meander at times. At nearly two and a half hours, this film can feel its length at times, but that's simply due to the fact that this movie cares about its characters and spends a lot of time on long conversations, some of which do lead to revelations though.Based on a book, this screenplay here definitely feels inspired and the voiceover work by Norton calms the viewers throughout, making for a sort of relaxing experience. In addition to that, the use of classical and jazz music is so much in the forefront that it nearly became a character of its own in the film. I really admired that aspect. Still, the overall movie doesn't leave too much for the audience to figure out, since the narration does lend a hand.In the end, Motherless Brooklyn is a really, really solid crime mystery that has the perfect setting and feel for this sort of premise. I found myself completely engrossed in this world and was eager to see where the movie ended up. Edward Norton gives an award-worthy performance and his direction only adds to that, making for a great overall movie. Motherless Brooklyn may be meant for a more mature audience as it is quite niche in terms of the nature of the story, which may lend itself better to an older crowd. Even so, I quite enjoyed myself.",Motherless Brooklyn
60,Neptune165,A 144-minute nap,5,30 January 2020,"Movie is terrible. Dull, slow, and predictable Noir style investigation. It was way too long. Had a lot of fillers. There was no need for it to be 2.5 hours long. Just got really boring. It's like they blew their entire $26 million budget on the admittedly impressive cast. The lighting and cinematography are incredibly flat and boring (a terrible idea in a noir film of all things!), many of the sets and locations don't look convincingly period (especially the streets with their obviously-modern street signs and traffic lights), and even some of the costumes are lacking. Trust me not worth your time",Motherless Brooklyn
61,JohnRayPeterson,"Motherless Brooklyn is a person, a contemporary gumshoe in a 50's setting, and of course he's good and so is the movie",8,18 January 2020,"You like thrillers and detective stories, such as you find in novels and movies based on those from the likes of Mickey Spillane, Lee Child or Robert Parker? Then you'll like Edward Norton's adaptation of Jonathan Lethem's award winning novel. For an in depth review check out the one by IMDb's prolific expert reviewer ferguson-6, I always do; I'll give you here my feelings about the movie as I play back some of the memorable scenes in my head.Firstly I must mention there's an excellent cast which include Bruce Willis in a few crucial scenes, Willem Dafoe, the hot Gugu Mbatha-Raw (my personal like), Ethan Suplee, Edward Norton of course who is Motherless Brooklyn, Josh Pais, Michael Kenneth Williams who plays a trumpet player in the most convincing fashion as well as tough guy good guy, and Alec Baldwin who plays the heavy rich powerful bad guy and has the best lines in the movie including this great one: ""Do you have the first inkling how power works? Power is feeling that... knowing that, you can do whatever you want and not one fµ¢king person can stop you. If someone has a dumb idea that you don't like, well then that's the end of that idea or the end of that person if you want"". Baldwin was perfect for the role of Moses Randolph, as if it was written for him.Ed Norton is the main character, a private eye who, of all things, is afflicted with Tourette syndrome, but it's worth mentioning that aspect of his character is not overdone, and by all accounts is quite believable. Thankfully it does not distract from the story and it does make more interesting the character of Lionel Essrog, Motherless Brooklyn is simply what Frank, Willis' character, calls Lionel.The movie has narrative in some passages, but only a few which help the story move along and it includes another great line, this one from Edward Norton: ""Never lie to a woman who is smarter than you."" He uses it in reference to Laura, played by Mbatha-Raw. I particularly like the ending as it does not clash with the overall somber mood of the movie but caps it nicely on a positive and reflective note but not what you would call a happy ending, just a good one.I must mention the movie has a great musical score from Daniel Pemberton which fits both the period and the mood. One song you hear nineteen minutes into the movie and again in the second to last scene is the haunting 'Daily Battles' by Thom Yorke (you may know him from the group Radiohead); his composition is reprised instrumentally by Wynton Marsalis, exactly half way in the film when Michael Kenneth Williams depicts perfectly playing it. There are a few more tunes by Marsalis also in the movie, so you'll appreciate this if you're a fan. Oh, I did like this movie, a lot.",Motherless Brooklyn

Watching Motherless Brooklyn felt a lot like it took 20 years too. It has been a while since I've endured a film as slow as this.It was stylish and had a bit of swagger. Some of the pieces weren't so bad, and the story had interesting elements. But there were too many elements flying around, and not enough of them strong or convincing enough. It all just came across like a confusing mess that I didn't care a whole lot for.Once the ending rolled round, I was exhausted and just over it. I didn't care about what was going on and failed to see the point in half the storylines. I enjoyed Ed Norton's acting and the Tourette's added an interesting layer to his character. The film itself just fell short in every other area though. Waste of time.",Motherless Brooklyn
64,Alexander_Blanchett,Almost a masterpiece - almost.,8,16 January 2020,"Edward Norton's passion project. I liked it. It was really done with a lot of love and much detail. Maybe sometimes a bit too much detail as it dragged a little bit. How is Edward Norton the director? He perfectly recreated the atmosphere and look of the New York of this period. He created a great old fashioned Film Noir ( I think if he had decided to do the film in black and white it would have had an even great impact). He is solid but as mentioned before the pacing wasnt always perfect.
How is Edward Norton the writer? Well, the screenplay was one of the weakest aspects. Mostly due to the screenplay. It wasn't bad at all dont get me wrong, it was just not.... really anything special. Characters were fine, but missed some edge. Story could have been crafted a bit better. Just little things but I guess with a co writer he could have done wonders. How is Edward Norton the actor? Awesome. Fantastic performance. This is were his true talent lies and he proves that once again. A great performance, a special character. Typically Norton. Nailed.
The rest of the cast is good as well. I liked Gugu Mbatha-Raw, but I guessed her character lacked something. The best performances next to Norton came from Alec Baldwin and Willem Dafoe who were both memorable and outstanding in their way. Baldwin even more than Dafoe, as Dafoe got only to shine in the last third of the film.
Bruce Willis had a good cameo as well (for which he was second billed.. oh well) The score direction was interesting . using a jazz score really fitted the atmosphere. The film could have been shorter at least 20 minutes and I think than it would have been the masterpiece it deserved to be and Edward Norton deserved to have after all those years in development hell.",Motherless Brooklyn
65,CANpatbuck3664,Motherless is a Methodical and Well Crafted Noir Story for Adult Audiences,8,17 November 2019,"Edward Norton is wearing many hats (pun intended) in this movie but you have to respect his performance as Lionel. Its jarring at first but its a respectful portrayal and while we all know how talented he is, this is Norton showing another side of what he can do. I wouldn't be surprised if there's some awards attention for his effort in this lead role. My favourite performance in the movie came from Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Laura. She was WONDERFUL in this, there's so much nuance and compassion in her portrayal. She's involving and her chemistry with Norton was impressive. It was a great reminder of how great she can be (it also helped wash the taste of A Wrinkle in Time out of my mouth). I also really liked Alec Baldwin as Moses Randolph, he was a really intimidating villain. They don't paint him as sympathetic but his character is a force of nature and his complete belief in his right to accomplish what he wants to accomplish was believable and unsettling to me. I would also like to credit Willem Dafoe, Michael Kenneth Williams and Bruce Willis for their work in this movie. If there was a performance I didn't like, I would say Bobby Cannavale but that also might be how his character was handled.Norton is known for his acting talent but I think he did a solid job both writing and directing Motherless on top of starring in it. You can tell that this movie wasn't made for a ton of money but the sets look good, the costumes appear accurate and the cinematography is largely on point. Its largely well shot and well edited, the artistic touches are all decent and I think both he and his team did a nice job of building the setting and bringing you into this world.The trailers for Motherless make it look like its more of a thriller, there are those elements but its more of a detective story that leans into drama with the tension of a thriller sprinkled on top. The movie is more of a character piece that's set up around Lionel. He's very sympathetic and I think they did a good job of drawing him in a way that makes you root for him without portraying him as a complete boy scout. He has a good reason to be the way he is and his affliction isn't just something he can ignore or kick like a bad habit. This is brought about with his relationships with Laura and Frank who look past his behaviour and see what's underneath. I was never moved by Lionel but I did feel sorry for him and I was happy to see him find a little happiness (even though it may or may not be fleeting).I can champion the acting and the plotting of Motherless Brooklyn and I'm happy to do so. But it does have drawbacks that are going to throw some people off. The first is that this movie is very deliberately paced. I think they do a good job presenting Lionel's condition and getting you to care about the characters and the drama in the movie. But it is slow and if you're expecting something like Sin City or even the Untouchables, you might be disappointed. You have to be patient, its one of the choices that makes Motherless a very adult movie. I haven't read the book but they changed the time period this movie was set in and I could tell. I love movies that take place in this era but there wasn't really a reason to set it in the 1950s instead of the intended setting. You also feel like there's going to be a huge payoff in the finale that you don't really get. I'm not trying to sell the ending short, I found it to be satisfying but it was a little anticlimactic. You don't get everything wrapped up cleanly and there's no big gunfight and while I respected that decision, it might be disappointing for some.I love going to the movies but living out in the country, I don't get to see everything that comes to the theatre. I had to go out of my way to see Motherless Brooklyn and I was willing to because I really dig noir/detective stories. The fact that this was a period piece on top of that, I was even more excited. Motherless Brooklyn takes a while to get going and while its slowly paced, the plot thickens and after I settled in, I was caught up in it. They develop Lionel impressively, they sell the stakes of the conflict in the plot and the acting is the cherry on top. With the long run time, it definitely won't be for everyone. Although at face value, they have very little in common, Motherless reminded me of The Ides of March (the George Clooney political drama). Both movies are well written, both are very involving with their share of tense moments and turmoil for the protagonists and they both wrap up with the heroes having to settle for surviving as opposed to winning. I would rate them at about the same level (between an 8 and an 8.5/10) and recommend them with the warning to adjust expectations. Motherless is worth catching in the theatre but if you weren't pulled in by the marketing or it doesn't sound like your cup of tea, don't be fooled into thinking this will sneak up on you. It is what it is and you have to decide whether that's what you want for the 2+ hours this movie takes to tell its story.",Motherless Brooklyn

Great work by Norton, Cannavale, Mbatha-Raw, Alec Baldwin, Willem Dafoe, and Michael Kenneth Williams. And very well written. Precise direction. Hollywood could use more mature directors like Norton. Hope he continues down this path. Very good work. Norton's interpretation of Tourette's was both sympathetic and humorous. Baldwin did a great job channeling the hubris, arrogance, waste and destruction of men like Trump.",Motherless Brooklyn
69,PyroSikTh,Why Noir was Dead,7,7 December 2019,"Motherless Brooklyn has Edward Norton at his most Nortony; writing, directing, and starring in a period noir as a private investigator with Tourette's syndrome. Notorious for being a difficult actor to work with due to his passions and ambitions making him very involved in every creative aspect (he did uncredited writing work for Fight Club, and the final edit of American History X was the one he put together himself), I was intrigued to see what he would churn out given complete authority on every creative decision without having anyone's toes to step on.Motherless Brooklyn is a noir through and through. The late-90s setting of the book is replaced with a 50s setting, and Norton narrates his way through a complex and ever-twisting mystery as it slowly unravels over two and a half hours. Unfortunately (so I've heard) beyond the Tourette's investigator, the book is almost completely irrelevant to the film's story, and it kind of shows. While the mystery itself went in unseen directions, and the film plays with various socioeconomic themes still relevant today, the story still manages to come off as painfully generic. There's nothing new or remarkable narratively, perhaps because it leans in to it's noir stylings too much. On one hand it's nice to see this approach brought back again, but on the other hand it died out for a reason. There's only so many ways the same tropes can be retrod without flourishing into cliché.The acting is pretty great across the board though, which is hardly surprising considering its star-studded cast. Norton absolutely owns the role of Lionel, despite the risk of falling into Simple Jack territory. The character's Tourette's is never overdone or cartoonish, showing that Norton really did his homework into the condition and how it displays itself. I've read a number of comments around from people with Tourette's praising the performance in both its accuracy and respect, and honestly I've got to take their word for it. It's never played for laughs, and the film doesn't even make that big a deal of it. In fact you could cut out the affliction entirely without it affecting the plot at all. Instead it adds an interesting dynamic that manages to keep an otherwise generic film from falling into mediocrity, and adds weight to Lionel and his personal struggles. Not to mention the tension that arises from his Tourette's manifesting at the most inopportune moments, particularly when he's nervous.Alec Baldwin is another standout as Moses Randolph, an obvious stand-in for Robert Moses, and more topically Trump himself. In a way I feel sorry for Baldwin being typecast in the Trumpian role so much (which is ultimately why he didn't sign on for Joker), but it's easy to see why he is, because he plays that kind of role so well. Moses Randolph is no exception. He's hard-nosed and brutish, and his final monologue at the end is as captivating as it is disturbing and unsettling. The rest of the cast fall in to glorified cameos. Bruce Willis' Frank Minna dies in the first ten minutes sparking off Lionel's investigation, Bobby Cannavale appears every now and then as another member of Minna's investigation team, Willem Dafoe slips in and out as a wronged engineer seeking to unveil the truth of what's happening, Michael K Williams is as fantastic as ever, but his character could easily have been cut out entirely, Gugu Mbatha-Raw glides her way through more as a plot device than an actual character, and Leslie Mann phones in her less-than-5-minutes appearance near the beginning.On a technical level Motherless Brooklyn has its hits and misses. The cinematography has its moments for sure, such as the lighting in the train station highlighting a woman next to a pigeon, or a conversation between Baldwin and Dafoe's characters illuminated by a hotel entrance. Beyond that the film has a bit of a made-for-television feel to it; cheap, plasticy, with boring camera angles and paint-by-numbers lighting. On the other hand the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic. Daniel Pemberton is fast becoming one of my favourite composers, here offering a sprawling, bombastic score full of even more noir tropes; horns and jazz drums, but modernising them and adding a depth that can only be achieved through expert production. There's also a Thom Yorke song that features prominently, giving the whole endeavour a bit of a Radiohead vibe. In fact I'd argue the music is the film's biggest saving grace, and it's worth watching for that alone.I enjoyed Motherless Brooklyn. It wasn't the best film I've seen this year, but it wasn't the worst either. There's some great performances, a really good suite of music, the noir style was really nice to see again, and the mystery kept me guessing right up to the end. However it does feel a little cheap in places, it can feel overlong and could've done with tightening up, and in general it would've benefitted from a dash more character work to really elevate Lionel and the other characters. I give it an acceptable 7/10. There are worse ways to waste your time.",Motherless Brooklyn

The story is decent but not great, and it's very predictable at certain points. The directing and camerawork are all fine and good, but nothing to write home about.It's the same old stuff we've seen a hundred times before. This will appeal to those who can't get enough of the mainstream offerings that are advertised all day on TV and show up on the first screen at Redbox.

71,ebeckstr-1,"Excellent ""sequel"" to the novel",8,16 December 2020,"A very good script, excellent casting, luscious visuals, and convincing set design & decoration make Motherless Brooklyn an enjoyable and immersive trip back into a time that never was. The movie has an ethereal quality, almost dreamlike, because you see glimmers of true history in it, but, like the novel it's based on, those glimmers flash in a world that is slightly askew and anachronistic. One reviewer expressed annoyance that most people in the movie seem to accept the lead character's odd behavior and simply shrug it off. This is true, but it also matches one of the most interesting features of the novel, which is part of the charm of both novel and movie. Likewise, both film and novel are like love letters to Brooklyn, written in fading ink, wrinkled and creased for having been handled and read often.A suggestion for those who have read the novel or plan to after seeing the movie. Motherless Brooklyn the movie is really almost more a sequel to the novel, except set 70 years before the novel takes place. Only bare remnants of the novel's plot are brought into the movie; but that's okay, because as I noted above, somehow Edward Norton has managed to bring the essence of the story and tone into the film. Like the movie Blade Runner and the novel it's based on, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Motherless Brooklyn the movie and Motherless Brooklyn the novel are two related but completely separate entities. They need to be enjoyed that way, without comparisons of direct plot commonalities and differences, which is usually a futal endeavor anyway. That's just not the point of what Norton is doing here.",Motherless Brooklyn

74,akcenat,After slow start film goes into higher gear,8,22 July 2020,"""Motherless Brooklyn"" is based on Jonathan Lethem's award-winning novel of the same name about private detectives and corrupt city-planners in New York City. In directors vision, the story has been moved from 1999 to the 1957 and draped in genre-recognizable Neo-Noir piece. It's not a crime-action movie, but more slow detective drama with very grounded story, yet ticking along at a more slow than steady pace film can at times feel a little long (144m). The storytelling leans hard on verbal exposition, but this film a pleasure to watch because it have elegant cinematography with a distinct tone, stunning period recreation, humor, strong characterizations and mostly graceful articulation of complex material. The ensemble cast is large (B. Willis, L. Mann, A. Baldwin, G. Mbatha-Raw, W. Dafoe...) and each of them has their moment to shine adding some additional zest to the story, but this is all E. Norton's show (who, also, directed it). On the subject of soundtrack, film boasts gorgeous scores too which are a collaboration between multiple Grammy Award-winning artists T. Yorke, W. Marsalis and D. Pemberton. To conclude, ""Motherless Brooklyn"" is far from a perfect movie and younger audience might not enjoy it as much I did. Nevertheless, it should be held up high on a pedestal for all movie lovers especially for fans of old school Hollywood. I would highly recommend it because, for me, it was passionate, controlled, verbal and smart film.Rating: 7+/8-",Motherless Brooklyn

Despite the mixed reviews, I really loved ""Motherless Brooklyn"". A passion project of Norton's, this is a powerful film filled with elements of film noir, an excellent cast and a moving story.

76,DeBBss,A Good Homage to Classic Noir,7,22 July 2020,"I love Classic Noir films and Motherless Brooklyn is a great homage to the genre. Edward Norton does a great job at directing and adapting the novel to screenplay. The overall production and quality of Motherless Brooklyn is very professional and well done. And the acting was amazing, Edward Norton delivers a solid performance and the supporting cast also does a great job with what they got.Motherless Brooklyn is a long movie, almost 2.5 hours long, but I was never bored. You could say that the pacing is slow, but it's not too slow to the point where it ruins the plot. The first act was the best in my opinion, the pacing was at its best and it did a great job at building up everything. The second and third is where it slows down and the plot gets a little messy. The story starts morphing into several different things; eventually, you'll forget why this plot even began in the first place.Edward Norton is one of the most talented actors out there, and he gave another great performance. Acting out the tics isn't what made his performance so good, it's the realism. Lionel Essrog (Edward Norton) apologizes after the tics in such a genuine manner and his struggles feels real, and all that was because of Edward Norton. Lionel Essrog is such an empathetic character because of the great acting and character development.There's a constant use of jazz for the background music, and that gave it that classic noir feel. If jazz is done smartly in film, it's great, and in Motherless Brooklyn, it fits perfectly. The jazz helped a lot with the pacing too, it kept you occupied during the longer scenes.Motherless Brooklyn is a really good noir flick; it could've been better in some categories, but overall it was good. The plot was solid, though, it does have some issues, like the slightly slow pacing and messiness in acts 2 and 3. The acting by Edward Norton was amazing and this was my favorite performance by the actor. The production quality was near perfect and the jazz really helped with the pacing and tone of Motherless Brooklyn. Overall, Motherless Brooklyn is definitely a movie that I would recommend.",Motherless Brooklyn
77,DuskShadow,I Sometimes Hate Being Right About SO Many Things,4,16 August 2020,"And knowing if a movie is going to be good or bad, or if I will even like it ( I like some B and C grade movies. Some are funny lol) is my thing.I had apprehensions because though Norton has usually been involved in some very groundbreaking and influential films over the years, in recent memory I would not think too highly of the guys skills. True he can stick to characters traits fairly well, but in a film that he had such a hand in making, I could see why the silly creative license was so palpable regarding his character in this movie.
Tourettes is a HELL of a difficulty for some as there are various levels for how extreme it can be, but the way it was done in this film was just bad. It was straight up distracting and constantly broke the 4th wall. I am watching a detective story here, in the spirit of FIlm Noirs, and then this dude just says ""If"" or something else randomly and it just mucks up the whole process. Baldwin was a bit of a stretch too as his character was kinda stale . Bruce Willis deserved a larger part, as did Willem Dafoe. IT just got worse as I watched it. And that stereotypical sax music, though so iconic, was just not doing it for me. Again...the forced tourettes of the character seemed ot diminish the flow of the story far too much. It was too comedic at times. I feel for folks that actually have such problems, but I just could not get with all the forced acting and situations in this film. Such are the times we live in. But hey...I still give props to the actors for trying out something gutsy. Next time I am sure they will score a win!!!
5 outta 10... B grade at best ( like a death sentence in Hollywood)",Motherless Brooklyn
78,januszlvii,NOT Noir,5,2 August 2020,"I know what Film Noir is and Motherless Brooklyn is not it. First off very little of it happened at night and the very word Noir refers to dark. Next no femme fatales, another thing generally needed in these kind of movies ( I admit to being a sucker for Veronica Lake and Kim Basinger and this type of woman was needed). Then I do not see the menace involved ( think of movies like I Wake Up Screaming or The Maltese Falcon). Last but certainly not least there is nothing tough about Lionel (Edward Norton), he even has Tourette's Syndrome. The protagonist in these kind of movies ( Bogart, Ladd, Mitchum, Dick Powell or the later Jack Nicholson ( Chinatown) or Russell Crowe ( LA Confidential) is much a much tougher. character. One other problem is the thinly disguised attack on Robert Moses ( it calls the Alec Baldwin character Moses Randolph). It accused him of being a rapist ( I am shocked the family did not sue). Is this a bad movie? No the 1950's atmosphere really works well, and Laura Rose ( Gigu Mbatha Raw) really gives a good performance. She makes a very good heroine, and looks beyond Lionel's disability ( and race ( Randolph raped her mother)) and loves him for who he is. She is the main reason why Motherless Brooklyn is a fair movie instead of a bad one, and I wish she would have been introduced earlier in the movie, and cut unneeded scenes. Spoilers ahead: Unlike the book there is a happy ending where Lionel and Laura end up together in an isolated beachfront on Long Island and it does work well, especially because both Lionel and Laura are damaged people who need to be away from their previous lives. Again this is not a Noir film, but because of Laura, the atmosphere and the ending which I like, I give it a generous 5/10 stars.",Motherless Brooklyn

80,MogwaiMovieReviews,Last Exit to Brooklyn,4,28 November 2019,"I remember hearing about Motherless Brooklyn 10, 15 years ago when reading some interview with Edward Norton. This story about a private eye with Tourette's was supposed to be his next film and it sounded intriguing, so I kept an eye out for it for a long time afterwards but then it never appeared and eventually I forgot about it.It turns out Norton never did, and many years later finally got the go-ahead to write and direct it himself. The sad news is that, having carried his pet project for so very long, the end result is stale, uninspired, rushed and reeking of last-chance desperation. It so obviously wants to be Chinatown, or maybe LA Confidential, but never even once approaches that level of excellence, and feels instead like a quickie made-for-TV movie with a surprisingly high number of famous faces in walk-on cameos. Few of the actors seem like they fully inhabit their parts, and most look like they are briefly taking time out from some other, better paying film as a favour to Norton, although Michael Kenneth Williams acquits himself pretty well.None of the emotional or romantic scenes convince, they seem to be there simply because the story requires it, and even Norton himself seems hurried and distracted, presumably because of his needing to watch the clock as both director and star. His Tourette's tics become annoying pretty fast and never seem like something his character is continually struggling with but rather obligatory beats necessary for maintaining character that appear when conveniently scripted. Around half the lines he speaks begin with the word 'sorry', which also begins to grate.I feel bad making such harsh criticisms, since it's a film I really wanted to like, that I fully expected was going to be a modern film noir classic. And I guess, really, this is just me trying to figure out why it didn't turn out that way.I think, mostly, it was because of all the time that elapsed: whatever was special about the initial spark of the novel was lost or rubbed off somewhere along the way, and all the many things added and changed - the period setting, the historical and racial politics - just make it more messier and meaningless. I get the feeling this was a film that Edward Norton made in his head many times over, many years ago, and that this final product is a half-hearted cover version of that platonic ideal. There's a tired, routine mood to the proceedings, no-one seems excited or alive in their parts, everyone just going through the motions in service of nothing very memorable at all.A great film feels like a sumptious three course meal, but unfortunately this one just tastes like reheated leftovers.",Motherless Brooklyn

82,movieman6-413-929510,Edward Norton pleases himself more with his passion project than the cinema audience,5,6 December 2019,"Motheress Brooklyn is a new crime drama directed, written and partly produced by Edward Norton, the director of Keeping the Faith.The film is set around 1950 in Brooklyn New York. Private detective Lionel Essrog (Edward Norton) suffers from Tourette's syndrome. He is investigating the murder of his best friend Frank Minna (Bruce Willis). He only needs to find out with a few clues who is behind the murder and the motive of the perpetrator.This film has become a passion project for Edward Norton, because this is only the second film he has directed and the first he has written himself. In addition to producing, he himself also plays the lead role and has arranged with the rest of the cast that they play their roles in this film for free or for little money. Edward Norton has also done a lot of research into people who really suffer from Tourette's syndrome, to credibly imitate this syndrome in the lead role of the film.Despite all the time and effort that Edward Norton has put into making this film, the film is unfortunately still known as a standard crime film. The biggest difference with this film and other detective crime films is that the main character suffers from Tourette's syndrome, which sometimes makes his work as a detective more difficult. The tempo of the film also comes across too slowly. Thanks to the slow pace, as a viewer you can discover more clues and hints yourself. This way you can start to be ahead of the detective and the story that makes the film long-winded.Edward Norton does provide good acting as the main role of the film. He looks good as a private detective with his own personal mission. He also appears credible as someone suffering from Tourette's syndrome. Because of this handicap he has his own advantages and disadvantages. Other larger cast members such as Bruce Willis and Bobby Cannavale also do well in this film, but have more of a small cameo. Other actors such as Willem Dave and Alec Baldwin play larger roles in this film, but you can predict what their characters will do and whether you can trust them.",Motherless Brooklyn

When I found out Ed Norton had written and directed this thing I knew right away that this ought to be good and so it is. Most of the critics said this movie is too long but I say - this is just perfect in length and any other way too; it tells a story of a detective who unravels the mystery behind his mentor's murder and discovers way more puzzle pieces that he had expected. It takes time for him to figure everything out and while he's at it the movie is filled with beautiful cinematography, so many different locations and costumes, 1950s charm and atmosphere which I like a lot, jazzy soundtrack and the most skillful acting you can expect from Norton and Co. Motherless Brooklyn is not only a nickname of the main character but is also a disease that crawled into big city with industrial age, financial instabilities, post-war depression and outlaw men with power in their hands.

My only faults with the movie were that Norton, although giving a very strong performance, seemed a bit too old to play the part and the story was a bit of a noir collection of cliches, but the characters were very interesting and everyone involved did a great job so the scales tip much more to the positive side.",Motherless Brooklyn

89,Bertaut,"Looks great and is well acted, but the pacing is turgid",5,22 December 2019,"Jonathan Lethem's 1999 novel Motherless Brooklyn may appear to be an old-fashioned private-eye noir, but in reality, it's about gentrification, institutionalised racism, political corruption, and how such things are woven into New York City's historical fabric. It's about how the city of today was built on the cruelty, prejudice, lies, and unchecked power of yesterday. The novel is a quintessentially postmodern narrative, fracturing the relationship between the physical and the temporal by taking the sensibilities of 1950s gumshoe noir and supplanting them into an end-of-century milieu. On the other hand, the 1957-set film is more literal, less interested in playing with form. Written for the screen, produced, directed by, and starring Edward Norton, this two-decades-in-the-making passion project asks how much corruption are we willing to forgive and whether truth and ideals even matter in a world in which there's a direct confluence between power and amorality. However, far too in reverence to films such as Chinatown (1974) and L.A. Confidential (1997), Motherless Brooklyn is never anything more than your average noir mystery - a likable but flawed protagonist begins what seems like a fairly straightforward investigation, only to be led down a rabbit hole of corruption and power games, until he's in the midst of an elaborate political conspiracy. And whilst it's aesthetically impressive (the period detail drips off the screen) and the acting is universally excellent, the film can be spectacularly on the nose and didactic. It also moves at a snail's pace, and Norton is never really able to generate any sense of urgency, making the whole thing feel laborious, and, ultimately, rather pointless.New York City, 1957. World War II veteran Frank Minna (Bruce Willis) runs a small PI firm staffed by men whom Minna rescued from an abusive orphanage when they were still children. He's most fond of Lionel Essrog (Norton), who suffers from what we know today as Tourette Syndrome, but who also has a photographic memory. As the film begins, Essrog is listening in on a clandestine meeting between Minna and unidentified parties. When the meeting becomes contentious, tragedy strikes, and although none of Minna's staff know who he was meeting or what he was investigating, Essrog determines to get to the bottom of the case, slowly unearthing a labyrinthine conspiracy involving local government, urban redevelopment plans, and housing relocation programs.Anyone familiar with the novel will recognise that Norton has made sweeping changes, not just in terms of relocating the story to 1957 (thus making explicit what was so indelibly postmodern in the book), but so too in terms of plot and character. The most significant addition is Moses Randolph (Alec Baldwin), a corrupt and powerful real estate magnate who's clearly based on New York's so-called ""master builder"" Robert Moses, the man largely responsible for the city's high-way infrastructure, the departure of the Brooklyn Dodgers to LA, the development of Long Island, and whose controversial philosophies regarding urban redevelopment continue to be implemented all over the world. Operating with almost complete autonomy from regulatory oversight, Moses was a narcissist obsessed with power, and an amoral , and so too is the character in the film. Indeed, although the film is ostensibly based on Lethem's novel, it contains more than a hint of Robert A. Caro's Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Moses, The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York (1974).Motherless Brooklyn's most obvious strength is its aesthetic, about which I really can't say enough. Beth Mickle's production design, Michael Ahern's art direction and Amy Roth's costume design are all exceptional, contributing to the nuanced and immersive period-specific tone, with the milieu feeling lived-in and completely authentic.Norton's direction is, for the most part, straightforward and unfussy, but one visual motif he uses several times is shooting directly from Essrog's POV. First-person shots in cinema are infrequent enough that when a director uses the technique a few times, it stands out. What's most interesting here is when Norton uses it - three scenes in which Essrog is lying on his back either currently being beaten up, or having recently been beaten up. It's a nice (if somewhat unsubtle) directorial choice, drawing us directly into Essrog's experience, but only when he's at his most vulnerable. On the other hand, the tonally inconsistent use of dream scenes is far less effective, feeling as if they're from another film entirely.In terms of the decision to set the film in the 50s, it actually makes sense. One of the reasons the novel works so well is because the modern setting clashes with the mannerisms of the characters, the style of the dialogue, the cadences of the plot, all of which are straight out of classic 40s and 50s noir. The effect of this is quintessentially postmodern - a self-reflexive pastiche that's drawn from both the 50s and the 90s, and yet which belongs to neither. And although this works tremendously on the page, Norton argued (correctly, I think) that to try to replicate this on film - have the story set in 2019 (or even 1999), but told in the manner of a classic noir - wouldn't work, as it would send mixed and confusing messages to the audience.And so, he simply relocated the story to the time-period which underpins the style of the novel. With this in mind, the film features many of the trappings of classic noir - the world-weary private eye, the laconic voiceover speaking directly to the audience from an unspecified point in time, the seemingly important clues which ultimately lead nowhere, the seemingly irrelevant clues which ultimately lead somewhere, the smooth (so smooth) jazz score, the smoky (so smoky) jazz clubs, the chiaroscuro lighting (albeit very restrained), the antagonist who seems to see all, the political corruption. There's even a scene in which Essrog finds an address written on a pack of matches. About the only thing missing is a femme fatale, although there is a woman who may (or may not) know more than she's letting on.For all its thematic importance and laudable aesthetic aspects, however, I found Motherless Brooklyn disappointing. For one thing, there's the pacing, which is so lacking in forward-momentum that the story is practically somnolent. The narrative is unfocused and flabby, needing at least one more editorial pass, occasionally doubling back on itself and wasting time giving the audience information we already possess. Partly because of this, it's a good 20 minutes too long (at least), and much of it feels like padding - characters that do nothing, clues that lead nowhere, scenes which don't advance the story or develop the characters. I understand Norton wanted to let the material breath (the novel is around 300 pages), but there's a difference between giving the characters and themes room to develop and stalling for the sake of it, and so much of the film feels like the latter.There's also a significant disconnect between the politics and the detective story. In Chinatown, everything feels organic - the personal and the political are intertwined, with the political elements never feeling artificially shaped so as to fit a generic template, or the genre structure never feeling artificially bolstered with extraneous political elements. In Motherless Brooklyn, however, Norton is never really able to integrate the two, leading to a kind of identity crisis, with the film unable to find a comfortable middle ground - in trying to be both a noir mystery and a societal commentary, it ends up as neither. Another issue is that because the novel features 50s values displaced into the last years of the century, the endemic racism is deeply disturbing - society today is more enlightened about such things, but here's a novel in which characters are acting like it's 40 years prior despite being set in a modern milieu. This is a vital part of Lethem's postmodernist deconstruction of power structures. However, with the film set in the actual 1950s, the racism just comes across as period-appropriate window dressing, losing virtually all of its thematic potency.An old-fashioned detective story with a lot on its mind, Norton's passion for the material is self-evident. However, that passion hasn't translated into an especially good film. Void of almost any tension, although it looks great, Motherless Brooklyn fails to unify its genre elements and its political preoccupations, resulting in a film unsure of its own identity and unable to make us care about much of what it depicts.",Motherless Brooklyn

Set in old NY it follows a Lionel (Edward Norton) as he is trying to figure out who killed his boss and uncovers big secrets along the way.Production and design of NY in 50s is pretty great in both tone and atmosphere. Norton takes us on a pretty long journey of almost two and a half hours and along the way everybody might find something that they like. There are some pretty decent characters to explore and follow, sometimes it even seems like there might be more into the mob world that we don't see. But don't be fooled it is quiet long movie and very slowly paced so it takes a lot to watch it.Cast is also very good as we have some pretty familiar faces like Alec Baldwin, who is great as he plays villainous character and his intro was quiet tense. WIllem Dafoe, whos secrets we slowly unfold as the story goes. Bobby Cannavale, giving his classic performance that you would expect. A very little bit of Bruce Willis, which is honestly shame as there could be a great potential. There is also brilliant Gugu Mbatha-Raw, she is just great alongside Edward Norton who keeps you there for his performance, cause he is great actor and he always manages to prove it.It's quiet complex story for 140 minutes but it's well written and paced not awfully but so slowly and there seems like some scenes could be replaced with other ones for greater effect and storytelling.

From what the commercials showed, this was looking to be a nice gritty, Noir with a seemingly good story with a stellar cast and even Edward Norton at the director's helm, and don't get me wrong he does do a good job directing the movie, it's just that it's too long. This movie could have been cut in half and would have been great, but 2 hours and 24 minutes as a run time it's just too long, especially the way that the story is paced and written.Edward Norton does a fantastic job playing somebody with Tourette syndrome oh, and The Supporting Cast is great as well, it's just that the story drags and by the time you get to the hour and 20 minute mark its misery and how long it feels. When I press pause to take a leak and saw that I had that much more to go, I knew that when I came back I was going to be skipping to the end and was still not impressed.This movie had potential, but unfortunately it was wasted. I'd give it a Solid 4 out of 10 Stars, only for the first hour and 20 so minutes, after that I'd say it's not worth your time and to rent it at home and do not go see it in the theaters.",Motherless Brooklyn

It's a political mystery that loses me after the first 15min (when Bruce Willis is killed; not a spoiler, given that he's 5th billed it should be known), wherein the viewer is swamped with dense dialogue, scenes that move at a snail's pace, and the core of the mystery is as far from compelling as could be. The key to the mystery that he's seeking for the first half is revealed an hour and fifty minutes in and is so obvious (as in, should've been uncovered at the 20min mark if anybody had a single detective cell in their bodies), it hurts to watch. My only compliments are the acting, which can be expected from the great cast, and the cinematographic finesse in some scenes. Norton's character, also the narrator, has Tourette's, and it feels like a pointless gimmick throughout the movie, everybody shrugs it off and it never adds anything; yet when he's narrating, of course, he's a flawless speaker.

The problem is where to combine all these pieces of a greater puzzle and it's here where Edward Norton fails a bit. The film is a continuosly going up and down with a slow, rigid pace and a story that could have been shorter but more intense, apart from the amazing cast and its brilliant acting.

106,jakob13,A biitersweet tale as Homeless finds a home.,8,2 November 2019,"Adapting Jonathan Lethem novels for the scrren, Edward Norton's Ivy League pettigree is put to good use, in adapting the script with Lethem for the screen.
'Homeless Brooklyn' is highly entertaining, although a mishmash of themes that are loose threads of a sprawling story, albeit well told.Norton as Lionel Essrog, aflawed hero with Tertz Syndrome, yet endowed with perfect pitch of a memory that forget nothing; a restless mind that stitches together a murder with mumbled clues.
Set in Brooklyn in the 1950s, in a New York that Robert Moses is transforming a New York that feeds his autocratic inclination, as the power ebhind the throne. The indiscriminate use of eminent domain, to class and ethnic cleansing the working poor, the blacks and the Puerto Ricans, without providing them with places to go.
The villain is Moses (or Moe) Randolph, a not so veiled character that is modeled on Robert Moses, and played well by Alec Baldwin.
Murder, greed, sibling rivalry and trachery, mafia-like tactics, adultery, corruption, tape, jazz, taut racial relation, resistance from below and the stone=willed determination of Norton to solve the disparate pieces of this puzzle that is 'Homeless Brooklyn'.
A sure fire cast with cameos by Cherry Jones, Wilhem Dafoe, Gugu Mbata-Raw, Michael Kenneth and the splendid Bruce Willis.
144 minutes fly by at a fast clip. Brooklyn or what appears to be Brooklyn is well used as a back ground. 'Homeless Brooklyn' speaks to the politics of our day, nonetheless the moral of justice is frayed in a jagged pattern. The camera is a good eye in capturing the narrative in close ups, medium and wide shorts.",Motherless Brooklyn

109,jmvscotland,WAY TOO LONG AND WAY TOO ANNOYING,4,2 June 2020,"I normally make it a habit here not to review a movie unless I've done it the courtesy of watching it all the way through.
On this occasion though, that simply wasn't possible for two main reasons:
1 although I like Edward Norton very much as an actor, his character in this movie was just so utterly annoying/infuriating with those stupid Tourette's type vocalizations as to make it impossible for me to endure the movie beyond about 50 minutes. I am not intolerant of people who suffer from mental illness but this was simply overdone and infuriating. Which leads me to my second point
2 like so many movies these days, at 144 minutes, this one is simply way too long. One doesn't mind making that kind of commitment to a movie like say ""Ford v Ferrari"" (or ""Le Mans 66"" if you prefer). That movie was, in my opinion thoroughly gripping for its whole two and a half hours, but ""Motherless Brooklyn"" just couldn't hold my interest when it was after all (admittedly only as far as I watched) really nothing more than a NYC gangster movie, the theme of which has been flogged to death.
My recommendation is not to waste nearly two and a half hours on this one.

It's like a jigsaw puzzle where pieces that don't quite fit are forced together. The otherwise excellent layers sit on top of each other like oil and water, instead of being perfectly blended. The incompatibility of it all starts to get distracting, no matter how good the acting might be. The final straw is how the villain reveals his true nature. At best it's a five star film.

115,shweta-51657,Well made neo noir film!,8,10 February 2020,"Norton has indeed come a long way from his directorial debut in 2000. This isnt an easy to film to bring to screen, what with the Tourette's portrayal and the issue of coloured slum housing that is based partially on real people. He manages to not only deliver a performance that leaves the audience feeling connected to the character but he also directs renowned actors such as Alec Baldwin, but Bobby Cannavale, Willem Dafoe and Bruce Willis in this movie.Edward Norton's second directorial feature is a lovely piece of 1950s neo noir detective film-making. The movie features such beautiful use of music and sound, that you will be transported to a 50s New York speakeasy with jazz music pouring out every crevice and crack. The visuals in this movie are beautifully done and while they make you admire the camera work, they dont take away from the feel of the movie.As an actor, Edward Norton is stellar here. His portrayal of the usual down-trodden lead, who is also suffering with Tourette's is very reminiscent of the old time classics and he pulls it off so well!If you are a fan of smart, quick, detective films, especially those from the good ol' days, this is a movie for you.",Motherless Brooklyn

Norton gave a very interesting preformance in this film and if nothing else it's a great character study based on the choices he decided to go with to portray his character.

To say Edward Norton is overrated as an actor is a huge understatement-the guy gets in the way of most movies they stick him in-this was another example of this but the problems are way bigger than just Norton-the whole thing is incredibly tedious and phony-it is like a high school play.

118,levybob,Something's Missing Here,5,10 June 2020,"Something's missing in, and about, 'Motherless Brooklyn'. A great cast, a likable lead, true-to-the-period (Fifties) cinematography. But somehow the film misses.The story is Polansky's 'Chinatown' reset in New York City in The Fifties. Both involve big-city power and greed. Instead of water being the treasure worth fighting over, in 'Motherless' it's real estate (and a thinly veiled Robert Moses' attempts to grab it all). In both films we've got a private eye attempting to unravel the maze of deception. In both films there's a woman in trouble, in both films the question of parentage plays a large role. So then why does Chinatown work while Motherless doesn't?1. Gugu Mbatha-Raw as the film's damsel in distress; she's wooden. I'm sorry, but that's true.
2. Edward Norton's hero Lionel. He suffers from Tourettes Syndrome. He is full-time tics and shrugs and out-of-control shouts. The question is, What does this add to the story? The answer, Not one thing.
3. Edward Norton as Director. The film feels flabby, slow, unsure of its pacing. The story is too far in the background, the number of characters too many, given that few of them make a difference in the story's resolution.I brought a lot of good will to the viewing. I'm a big Ed Norton fan. Likewise Alec Baldwin and Willem Defoe. Likewise Bobby Canavale and Bruce Willis. A lot of good will. I wanted it to work.It didn't.",Motherless Brooklyn
119,Amthermandes,A heartfelt throwback to classic Noir,9,29 October 2019,"Motherless Brooklyn is a modern film Noir about a troubled man seeking answers, exploring new worlds within familiar ones, and going toe-to-toe with violent thugs and oppressive tyrants, in the heart of New York during its blossoming years. It also just may be Edward Norton's ""Sling Blade.""Some of its most noticeable achievements, are the visual and audial elements. With the gloomy, yet bustling sets, and the somber, thoughtful soundtrack, the effective lighting and mood of each shot, it's a brilliant homage to the classic Noir style. It's not even just a throwback, but could eventually be considered a monumental addition to the genre.And the acting. Expect nothing less from such a stellar, experienced, well thought out cast. Edward Norton nailed it especially, and shines a humorous, yet wondrous and even educational light on Tourette's syndrome. Excellent performances by all.Story-wise, it's nothing groundbreaking. But it's certainly engaging. One can tell it's no cookie-cutter script, a lot of heart went into it. Sure some may find it boring, slow, presumptuous even. Others will find it exhilarating, and refreshing. Hopefully most will find the passion, love, message, and humor in it, and also discover that it could be that movie which so many people have been wishing Hollywood would make, instead of those dry, cash-cow blockbusters that stain the very heart and art of filmmaking itself. While also being unique in its own way, it's also familiar, without being too familiar if you know what I mean.I wish Bruce Willis was in it more, and there are some plot holes and mildly annoying coincidences, cliches, etc. These are few and far in between. While it can be difficult to follow at times, it's still quite a fantastic movie.Those who would enjoy this movie, probably also enjoyed other titles like Chinatown, L.A.

Interior shots frequently had accessories that post dated 1957, and slums filled with used appliances and furniture piled in the streets were often of a vintage that would have made them new in 1957. The streets were especially unconvincing with incorrect street lights, concrete 'jersey' barriers (a brand new idea in 1957 that were first used as highway dividers not construction sites), and store signage were distractingly anachronistic. Using more distinct 'period' materials, like corrugated metal hoarding, wall mural advertising, awnings, and metal trash cans, would have created a more period feel.The problem is that 1957 New York is harder to find in present day New York than it was even just 20 years ago and the film may have benefitted from filming in another location, like Syracuse or Buffalo, for a more period-accurate feel.",Motherless Brooklyn

The Tourette's Syndrome he is suffering from, which compels him to say out loud all the nasties that are on his mind, has made sure of that. When his only friend, mentor and the director of a detective agency is brutally murdered, Lionel will leave no stone unturned in finding the culprit, even if it means going head to head with the most powerful men in NYC.Passion project by Edward Norton finally got its release and it's not all bad news. New York of the 1950's is a fascinating place and if Edward Norton did anything right with MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN it's transporting us to the time and the place.Rather designed for streaming services due to its lengthy run, the movie has been a box office failure, but it doesn't mean it's not great. Norton gives his all to the performance, we can just see here what an underrated actor he is.The film's original score by Daniel Pemberton has received a Golden Globes nomination, but it's the other score, the jazzy one with compositions from the likes of Tom York that is taking MELBOURNE by storm (check out the LP at Readings). Constantly balancing on the verge of a high drama and a noir movie this is an overly long, but ultimately satisfying affair, when whodunit is less important than ""why"". It's a tad predictable but rings true, mostly because of the characters being so warm and alive. At the end you feel like you have persevered with a particularly long book and suddenly realise it is a great one. Probably that was the way Norton felt when he finished the original novel the movie is based on.All in all MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN is an engaging crime drama that is worth every minute of your time",Motherless Brooklyn
135,jcarlos-96740,An acceptable movie but a bad mystery movie,5,12 March 2020,"This has some good acting, especially Edward Norton who has a great performance, Norton is also a decent director and the movie has some good angles and shots and a pretty cool photography, they did a great job in recreating this historic time. But unfortunately these were the only good points everything else is bad, the story is very weak and for a mystery movie there's not much of a mystery it's actually pretty basic, especially after reading the sinopse and having in mind the ideia of a murder and a detective with Tourette I expected a great mystery with a lot of twists and a big depth.
I thought that due to the fact of the main character having Tourette that this would be a important factor in the story and particularly in solving the mystery but it wasn't, ""IF"" only I was wrong this would have been much better but now I just thing that was unnecessary and brought pretty much nothing to the development of the story.
Some things were also pretty obvious from the jump and they were confirmed near the end, a good mistery movie makes you think some tipe of way and then surprises you, well Motherless Brooklyn doesn't do that. The story is so simple that I could tell you all about it in a simple paragraph, at some points it even felt like a story for kids.
There is no plot twist or amazing revelation that compensates the two hours plus you sat watching this, the ending is really lame and looked like from a Nicholas Sparks movie. If you're looking for a great mystery movie this is definitely not it.",Motherless Brooklyn
136,canadude,Like the Two Jakes to Chinatown,4,19 January 2020,"I get it, I know what it's trying to do, but it hits the beats of greater films like Chinatown or Touch of Evil or L.A. Confidential without capturing the atmosphere of corruption and evil those films communicate so clearly. Here, the emphasis is on the plot underlying the mystery - but the mystery is never as central in film noir as what it suggests about the world in which the gumshoe operates. There are murders, thugs, double crosses, and twists and even a rich and powerful Alec Baldwin standing in for the much more terrifying John Houston's Noah Cross in Chinatown. But they feel rote - plot points we've seen before in better stories.The film lacks a sense of urgency and part of that is due to Norton's direction. He's not a great director, the film lacks memorable scenes, and the story feels both crowded and somehow uninvolving at the same time. The performances are fine, I guess, though the main character's Tourette's probably works better on the written page, in the book from which this script is drawn, where it likely served as inventive word play that punctured a typical first person noir narrative (subverting it). I've never read the book, but here it feels incidental - it's not clear how the condition serves the story or the telling of it, except for the main character's photographic memory, which reveals some important plot points. Finally, there's something too literal about departing from the original novel and setting the story in the 1940s. It suggests a naive commitment to genre that movies like Chinatown transcend by playing with noir trappings to say something bigger about the darkness of human nature. Noir is not a time period, but a mood; an orientation.",Motherless Brooklyn

Screenplay was great, yes the good didn't win on evil but we are one step closer to achieve it, Edward didn't get the big man down, but he took his revenge and protect the woman he loves the most, our movie is compared to William dafoe(paul) in the story, you are great and talented but things don't go your way, although he's the best in what he does his project didn't got accepted, same for our movie although the movie is good and Ed did everything to take the big man down but we didn't took the ending we really wanted for Edward.

141,E Canuck,Entertaining and Relevant,8,31 October 2019,"Motherless Brooklyn (opens Friday Nov 1)
My friend won advance screening tickets tonight for Motherless Brooklyn, which turned out to be a rather deluxe affair with wine and food served beforehand in the ""VIP"" cinema area of a cinema in Vancouver, Canada.We needn't have worried that all these emoluments were buttering us up for a bad movie-it's a really good one and likely to get Oscar nominations for Edward Norton, who not only stars as Lionel but also directs and co-wrote the screen adaptation from a novel. When I was grasping for the real world connection I thought I saw in this feature drama, my husband prompted me the sociopathic mogul, Moses Randolph, depicted by Alec Baldwin in the film is only a thinly papered over Robert Moses. That smasher of neighbourhoods in the name of grand schemes had a leading role in the 2016 documentary Citizen Jane: Battle for the City, about Jane Jacobs and her fight for the soul of New York City. (That soul, I'm hearing, has suffered some blows of late.)This 1950s period film has an instant classic feel to it. It has enough Hollywood dynamics and star power in it to pull in a larger audience but there's some very nice cinematography and lots of social relevance, both in the good old USA and in satellite nations like good old Canada, where I live, with regard to present-day politics and power-wielding at various levels by wealthy people. This is particularly the case when it comes to who runs city hall and gets to force out large numbers of people from the communities where they belong.The city where I live has an ongoing struggle for which Motherless Brooklyn has relevant things to say. Even as I travelled to the cinema in question, I was distracted by the ugliness of the rapid-transit corridor it sits on which has been heavily redeveloped since the line went in for the 2010 Winter Olympics. The construction cranes are still plentiful, the featureless higher density buildings lining the route have an oppressive, mountain-view blocking dominance. Robert Moses/Moses Randolph or whoever wears their snappy shoes would love it.Almost the only thing I was indifferent to in the film was the ""brain thing"" affliction of Norton's character, which seemed like some kind of cross between Tourette Syndrome, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and a revisiting of Dustin Hoffman's Rainman character, at times. The syndrome had relevance to the story, though, and there were some nicer moments in how it was depicted.In addition to Ed Norton's strong performance and Willem Defoe's decent contribution, I enjoyed seeing Michael Kenneth Williams as a mellow jazz musician (I always think of him as Omar in The Wire.) Alec Baldwin was convincingly evil, though I think some real life power mongers prettify their harsh decisions, to themselves and others.",Motherless Brooklyn
142,STEVE24BUS,"Splendid film noir, with a great difference.",7,17 January 2020,"Plodding and thoughtful without ever being boring, and what a performance by Ed Norton as the tourettes afflicted gumshoe. Following every lead, looking under every stone to uncover the truth in the best Sam Spade fashion. Not an action film, far from it, but such a great story with a couple of surprising twists to keep you guessing. Shot in a great stylish fifties setting which looked accurate to me, could've easily been shot in black and white for a better atmosphere. Maybe a little too long but in fairness I'm unsure what they could've cut out to shorten it.

It's almost 2 1/2 hours of figuring out what's going on and who's doing it, but at least the look and sound of the movie provides a huge respite with the best sounding Bee Bop jazz and lush background theme soundtrack I've ever heard in a movie.As a photographer I thought the cinematography was stunning in color and composition, less film noir and more '50's style New York street Kodachrome photography with compositions of odd reflections and angles interspersed smoothly with the flow of the narrative master shots in a style similar to Winogrand and Vivian Maier.The variety of vintage '50's automobiles in pristine and brand new condition with the rich look of Kodachrome color is another treat.

It's not tagged liked this, but for me the movie carries a slightly comedic undertone. It's not the dialogue and it's not the story, but the overall feeling is just light and entertaining.

150,michaeldoud,First Hit: Meandering and unfocused attempt to bring this Jonathan Lethem novel to life on the big screen.,3,6 November 2019,"First Hit: Meandering and unfocused attempt to bring this Jonathan Lethem novel to life on the big screen.Screenwriter, Director, and Actor Edward Norton failed to make this an engaging crime thriller in the tradition of Roman Polanski's ""Chinatown."" Although there were aspects of this film, I thought exquisite, for instance the jazz club scenes were exceptional as were the scenes in Moses Randolph's office, generally it felt long and tired.One way it felt tired to me was me having to analyze scenes to see if things were making sense as the film moved along. Often, they didn't, which is tiring. For instance, a few early scenes in the Minna Detective Agency office were confusing, and I found myself questioning how the agency made any money, had pleasantly nice offices, and everybody in the office seemed flush, not struggling. There were hints that people in the agency drove people around in cars for a fee and that this was a side business, but everyone at the agency always seemed to be in the office and sitting at their desks doing nothing. I kept thinking, how did all four guys in the agency make money. The main character Lionel Essrog (Edward Norton), always seemed to have money to buy drinks with lavish tips, pay for taxis, and buy dinner or two for meetings with other people.These and other logic questions kept popping up in my mind as the film wore on and took me away from engaging more with the story.Basically, the story is about Lionel's dedication to his boss and friend Frank Minna (Bruce Willis). Because Frank gets shot and killed early in the story, Lionel has to find out who did it. He cannot let go of the puzzle in his head, which is where his being afflicted with Tourette's Syndrome adds to the plot. He's always blurting out comments at an inopportune time, but it helps him to drive to answers to open questions.The trail to find his boss's killer begins from a hint Frank whispered to Lionel just before his death in the hospital from a gunshot wound that Lionel witnessed.The hint has to do with a woman, Laura Rose (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), who un-be-knowingly was fathered by a powerful city politician Moses Randolph (Alec Baldwin). Although he's never in an elected spot, he's always be chosen to run the public parks, building commission, and the housing commission. This is where the real power of control over the city lies.The audience sees his bullying ways in an early scene when he storms into the Mayor's office and demands to have all the commissions he had before recent the election.Randolph has a genius brother, Paul (Willem Dafoe), whom he keeps on a short leash and on the edge of hope. Paul figures into the story because Lionel interviews him and learns more about his controlling brother Moses.I can say that I spent 2 ½ hours watching some good scenes with some excellent acting sprinkled in along the way. However, the meandering nature of the movie and overly complicated scenes to achieve a visible result were not well-intentioned.Norton was at times good as Lionel, but somehow his expression of the syndrome became part of the distraction versus adding to the film and story. It's a difficult thing to do, and at times it failed. Willis' small but pivotal part was good while it lasted. Mbatha-Raw was outstanding as Rose. Her ability to be both strong and vulnerable was effectively used. Baldwin was the best of the bunch in this film. Without any doubt he brought the role of powerful non-elected city politician to life. His conversation with Lionel about the importance of building his future dream city was wonderfully done. Dafoe gives a reliable performance as the younger brother of Moses. He's continually seeking approval for his work, and subsequent disappointment was exquisitely displayed towards the end of the story when he opens an envelope, filled with hope, only to find something else. For me one of the most compelling scenes was between Lionel and Trumpet Man (Michael Kenneth Williams). While in Trumpet Man's home, he and Lionel talk about their respectively messed up heads and how they each try to soothe their inner beasts, watching Williams's performance, I was transfixed. Norton both wrote and directed this film. The direction of his own performance needed work. He seemed too engaged with watching himself where trimming his screen time might have helped the film by being more focused. However, he does has directorial talent and was able to evoke several powerful scenes by letting the talent shine.Overall: I can say that I spent 2 ½ hours watching some good scenes with some excellent acting sprinkled in a long, meandering, and overly complicated moments to achieve an obvious result.",Motherless Brooklyn

He positively never fails to Impress and delight me, remaining true to his reputation for being utterly prepared and methodical, and at all times professional.Norton absolutely shines in this role, never over or underplaying his ""affliction"", as he calls it.As a director he slips on kid gloves, using a soft touch to weave this story carefully while steadily building the suspense naturally, without the heavy-handed action and over-editing many would have used with far less success.Consider me duly impressed. Impressed indeed with yet another stellar performance as we have come to expect. No one renders a more convincingly accurate portrayal of characters with physical or mental challenges. He does his craft, and his industry proud and is a joy to watch.

152,doppleganger19692,"""Chinatown"" sideways and slow",6,1 June 2020,"First, kudos to Edward Norton for writing, directing and starring in this movie. The screenplay is great, and his performance - as usual - is marvelous, while his direction (while effective enough) is still developing and the 45-day shooting schedule shows. I agree with what others have stated about the cinematography; it is very well done and captures the era. Bruce Willis is the Janet-Leigh-in-""Psycho"" here with a short part which is vital to the story. The rest of the cast are fabulous as well, though I wanted to see more motivation for Alec Baldwin's character: I never ""got"" what made him tick.On the downside, it felt like some sort of homage to ""Chinatown"" turned on its ear, but I suppose any story involving private investigators looking into nefarious big business deals with crooked politicians and women of unusual parentage would warrant such a comparison. My biggest gripe is the pacing. The unfolding of the story zips slong at the blistering pace of a ""Zooptopia"" DMV employee on a gallon of NyQuil. Some judicious editing would probably broaden the appeal of this movie. All that stated, it certainly is worthy of a viewing; just make sure you are wide awake.",Motherless Brooklyn

Characters were really interesting and the actors all did a great job. I like the period setting for the movie and the jazz music.Only complaint was the look of the movie. It just felt so clean and video like. I guess that's probably since it was shot on video. Just seems like it would have been helped by shooting on film.. or at least making it look more like that. Everything was just so bright and sharp and video like. That part of the movie just didn't work for me and didn't feel like the right mood.But other than that small issue..

No surprise: He's excellent in a difficult role, having carefully studied the ticks and other idiosyncrasies Tourette's causes. Indeed, almost the whole cast is terrific, filled with great character actors -- Willem Dafoe, Michael K. Williams, Robert Wisdom, Cherry Jones, Bobby Cannavale, Leslie Mann. Bruce Willis has a great role as Lionel's friend and mentor. And with many street scenes, Brooklyn ably stars as itself.Norton spent years working on this film, keeping intact his own character and the gang of detectives led by Willis. But Norton changed almost everything else, setting the film in the late '50s, and focusing it on a character based on NYC power broker extraordinary Robert Moses. It's perfect film noir fodder: power and corruption, progress vs. community, race and a bit of sex, all with a jazz score in the background.The characters are great, and for the most part, the plot works well. The tight first hour devolves into a more muddled and ""fat"" second half that could have been cut by 10-15 minutes. And Alec Baldwin as the ""bad guy"" might have worked better if I hadn't had his SNL Trump riffs in my head.

156,thetyvonlesure,Great Acting and A Convoluted Plot,6,28 December 2019,"Motherless Brooklyn is a detective drama set in 1950s New York City, based on a 1995 novel of the same name. Motherless Brooklyn is about a private eye investigator solving a case that his mentor left unfinished. The film provides social commentary on topics regarding racism and gentrification. Motherless Brooklyn stars Edward Norton as Lionel Essrog, Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Laura Rose, Willem Dafoe as Paul Randolph, and Alec Baldwin as Moses Randolph. The leads do a fantastic job in their portrayal of these characters. Edward Norton's portrayal of Lionel stands out, because of the character's Tourette's syndrome.Norton's portrayal of Lionel accurately depicts the neurodevelopmental disorder. Lionel's character fidgets throughout the film, and symptoms of his Tourette's syndrome are worked into lines of dialogue, as well as various scenes throughout the film. Norton loses himself within the character, providing some of 2019's finest acting. Willem Dafoe's once again delivers a good performance. His portrayal of Paul was well done. Dafoe is a bright spot in the film, when on screen with others. His conversations with Norton's character are great. Norton and Dafoe have great chemistry in the film. Alec Baldwin's performance as Moses Randolph was intimidating. He successfully captures the power behind Moses Randolph with his presence alone. His tense and emotionless facial expressions successfully convey the character's serious tone and Bourgeoisie stature. Baldwin's delivery of lines are great. Moses Randolph is a villain of villains, portrayed by a great actor. The rest of the cast varies and fluctuates between amazing and amateur. Gugu Mbatha-Raw's portrayal of Laura falls in between. She's good all around, whereas actors such as Ethan Suplee are corny in their portrayal. Certain actors feel as if they are acting for a television show, as opposed to a motion picture. Generally, the acting is fine in the film.The plot of Motherless Brooklyn is fine as well. It's a standard story that adds a lot to contemporary discussions regarding race and gentrification. Despite having great social commentary, the story drags and ultimately the film suffers from it. The investigation within the film is incredibly drawn out and boring. The answer being hidden in plain sight could immediately be discovered by the viewer if they pay little attention to what is going on. The investigation feels like a waste of time, especially when a lot of the core questions are answered relatively easily. There's various unnecessary subplots within the film, that add nothing to the overall story. The progression is convoluted. The bland nature of the plot does not aid the film's problem solving. At times, it's baffling how certain issues solve themselves within the film. For the dragging that the story does - the ending is not as satisfying as it could be. Suffice to say that this film could have been cut 45 minutes shorter.The set pieces within the film are amazing. 1950s New York City looks really cool. The cinematography is fairly standard, with nothing really groundbreaking or visually stunning. However, that's the point. The audio was fine. The score successfully reflects the 1950s, as well as a detective drama. The film did not fully feel as if it was in the Film Noir genre, however it was definitely a detective drama. The direction was okay, the film did not have a unique flavor to it. However, the movie is not bad, nor is it amazing.Overall, Motherless Brooklyn is a fine movie that is carried by great acting and great social commentary. The story was rather bland and boring, and could have easily been shortened and more clairvoyant.",Motherless Brooklyn

This story is set in the 1950s when the real Robert Moses was ramming through ""urban renewal"" projects in New York City. He wiped out the Bronx with a freeway and threatened to run another freeway through Greenwich Village. He was opposed effectively by Jane Jacobs, a vocal non-elected amateur opponent who lived in Greenwich Village. Both Jacobs and Moses are now deceased, but their personalities have realistic roles in the movie under other names. It is interesting, probably realistic, that Moses is not portrayed as corrupt, but as someone who really loved power. ""Motherless Brooklyn"" is a fictional story set in a real world. It emulates the black and white crime films that appeared in the fifties, films such as ""The Maltese Falcon"", but with a twist. The hero has Tourette's syndrome.

This is all done clearly, forcefully and thrillingly for viewer for whom this mix is congenial. On the scale between 10 for Huston's CHINATOWN -- the film to which MOTHERLESS is often said to aspire-- and for CHINATOWN's sequel, the rather flat TWO JAKES -- a natural contrast with CHINATOWN -- MOTHERLESS is an enthralling and instructive 8.

These elements show that he has a lot of potential and I can't wait to see what he directs next.However, the film has a lot of issues which unfortunately bring it down, the film is way too long for the type of film that it is, a Noir detective drama/thriller such as this had enough content to go for an hour and a half, however the film exceeds two and a half hours making it feel like a drag to get through especially in the second act. The film also tried to cover a lot of things and moments that seemed to weigh down the quality of the film, and make me feel confused for a number of moments and revelations. These could have been more impactful with a shorter run time and tighter plot lines that give the audience a meaningful connection to the characters and the actions they set to do throughout the film.Overall, Motherless Brooklyn is a film that had a lot of potential and showcased a number of promising aspects of Edward Norton as a director, however, a messy second act, a stretched run time, and too much expository dialogue rather than use visual storytelling weigh the film down and decrease its quality making it tough to get through at times, fans of this genre will find something to love here but its far from being a fantastic film.",Motherless Brooklyn
173,bobbie-16,tedious Noir clone,5,28 July 2020,"Classic Noir formula: Private eye, with lots of personal issues, uncovers intricate misdeeds in high places; excellent musical interlude by African American artists.True fact: In the 1950s and 60s, in the name of ""urban renewal"" and ""slum clearance,"" working-class communities of color were bulldozed and replaced by expressways and new high-end development,Urban renewal sounds like promising material for neo-Noir, but unfortunately this movie offers only a feeble hodge-podge-- and the pacing of the action is tedious. The movie misses the mystery, longing,dread,and suspense at the heart of Noir. References to Noir can't substitute for the real thing (e.g., homage to The Third Man--""oh, look, there is the shadow of Orson Welles""). Norton seemed to be referencing Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man and Midnight Cowboy. We are constantly being reminded of better movies in a way that distances us from the plot and the characters of this one. And the. ""Dominique Strauss Kahn"" thematic was handled in a clumsy and borderline offensive way. .",Motherless Brooklyn

The music is amazing and the direction and you can't forget Norton's acting. I hope you find it entertaining more than me.,Motherless Brooklyn
175,lightheartedbeing,There's much to enjoy in Motherless Brooklyn.,9,4 February 2020,"What a fantastic film! Everything about it. Edward Norton didn't miss a beat, including the jazz he Touretted. It's a sophisticated film and people who are used to all the flash and fury of most movies today will probably not adjust to something a deep, rich, historical, personal as this one. The actors are first class and so was the acting. The set design and lighting, photography so filled with mood. The music, great jazz all the way through. Is it a race war, or is that a smoke screen for a class war? Relevant to today's corruption in politics as well.Edward Norton's character aka ""Motherless Brooklyn"" and the use of seeing what he sees brings you deeper in to his inner life, what it is taking for him to investigate. There's something about Norton's presence on screen that keeps you watching him, and somehow he can direct and produce it too. It seems a bit of a motherless world as well...As we find out, along with out gumshoe, what's really going on, we get a portrait painted of our villain. It's not so black and white, so to speak. It's important in our divisive vilifying world to spend a little time understanding more about what is going on in people. The character is based on actual persons and historical events in NYC. There's plenty of action building up to the final climax. It's one of the few films I don't figure out the whole thing long before the first act is over.I don't often see films of this caliber any more. Much of the violence is off screen or in short takes, glimpses. There's no sex, though there's a love story. I can't say how nice it is not to be overly directly assaulted in a film. Ever since Sam Peckinpah, we seem to have to sit through visceral violence, and it's wearing on the nervous system. I did have to get up and move around during the climactic scene, though, but that's just me. There's much to enjoy in Motherless Brooklyn, i'm just sayin'.",Motherless Brooklyn
176,chancellorpink,Over-Directed/Edited Nice Try,5,26 July 2020,"Norton did a decent job with the complex, noirish script adaptation, and his performance of the irritating character is fine. All acting just fine. No one rises above. The plot is convoluted and overly-ambitious, without a satisfying resolution. But the real problem here is emotional investment and payoff, which is hindered by the chronic insistence by Norton to inject his presence into the film via quick edits to multiple camera angles, zoom shots, quick pans, & odd perspective shots, until you'd rather be watching 1950s TV than all this razzmatazz. Definitely feels like Norton was trying too hard at the helm, and it gets in the way of falling into a nice flow/vibe that might have otherwise invested you in the dense, unraveling story.",Motherless Brooklyn

""Why did an actor not having Tourette's played a character having Tourette's ""?For the same reason that an actor who hasn't murdered anyone is playing a murderer. Because it's called acting, you entitled, spoiled brats. Having the same condition or sexual orientation as a character does not entitle you to play it.3. ""Too long and boring"". No it's not.

178,PeteThePrimate,See it for the acting and cinematography.,10,10 December 2019,This and 'Joker' are my favourite films of 2019. For me the 2½ hours passed quickly and at times it was like sitting there watching a series of Edward Hopper paintings come to life. Someone's mentioned that people seem to accept his Tourette's too readily but given that this is set a decade or so after WWII I believe there would have been many people suffering from mental afflictions (PTSD etc) which people of that time would probably be used to seeing and therefore they were more accepting of him than we realise. The acting and cinematography are superb as is the soundtrack. The plot is solid and as the film centres mostly around Norton this means that some characters are less developed but this doesn't detract from the overall experience. Well crafted and well acted films like this come along rarely - Recommended.,Motherless Brooklyn

Hooks up with a hot black chick who is at the forefront of the protest movement, saves her life which was in danger for various reasons, (she's the secret daughter of one of the white politicians), so what do they do when they win and she falls in love with him?

It's a great nostalgia for the 50's, there is a little bit of jazz and there is great kind work in the politics of this movie.I have to admit I skimmed through the first 45 minutes and that has cost it.

Fast talking. Slurred lines. Lots of details. And then we find out Norton's character's has a speech impediment, maybe Tourettes Syndrone. Coincidentally the same speech impediment he had in Primal Fear. It wasn't all that bad to follow then, but here, it was way overdone. As Forrest would say, ""And just like that I was much more annoyed by it than the movie seemed like it was worth."" Once Bruce was killed off early I didn't want to waste another 2 hrs of life listening to that annoying way of speech so I turned it off. Sorry but I just couldn't.",Motherless Brooklyn

The cinematography and score are both beautiful. There's action, violence, romance, suspense, drama, mystery, and a lot of heart. The story also ties into many real issues that will resonate with people.
This movie is wonderful. It was such a satisfying watch and I was completely drawn in. This is easily one of my movies of the year. Every single actor was on form.",Motherless Brooklyn
192,michaelseither,"Reverse holistic, the sum of the parts is less than it should be.",5,15 January 2020,"Ed Norton worked long and hard to transform a very good novel into a workable screenplay. Then he directed and starred. He is a talented man and you could see he had a story to tell. His story overlaid the novel, which he ""adapted."" He changed the setting to suit his story. If you're ""woke"" you should like it. It's twisted and bent to deliver a a priori message. Pedantic? Didactic? Powerful men like Trump and Robert Moses destroy the little guy to help the big guys. The little guys are women and minorities. The smartest person in the room is partially disabled. The bad guy has to be squashed by the woman, who is a minority. I sat though it. It was flat. The novel was exciting, interesting, unique and fun to read. The movie was none of these things. The message doesn't bother me. There's some truth there. And Norton is multi-talented and me critiquing his work is ludicrous. I have no such talent. So my opinion should only be taken at face value. As a consumer, I was disappointed in the movie because it lacked all the excitement of the novel. Because I understand a little history, I got the Moses references. And it has elements similar to ""Chinatown"" which is a great classic of cinema. I like film noir. I am glad I saw it because I would have been disappointed if I hadn't. But boy, could it use an injection of adrenaline, humor, heightened drama, improved soundtrack and less forced woke messaging.Read the book.",Motherless Brooklyn

And what does it take to create an epic film? Good cinematography and excellent photography. That is, lighting, texture, atmosphere. Neither with a hundred smoke machines nor with yellow filters you get that, you get that with a good technician-creator behind the cameras and Norton didn't know that. Or did he forget? Without that actors are well dressed and better combed toys moving on an empty stage. You leave them without resources. They are left naked of their character. They are left with nothing. And there is no sharp story, no freaky character with Tourette's syndrome to save him.",Motherless Brooklyn
195,nti-547-765973,A new classic with a geniusly balanced performance from Edward Noron,9,17 January 2021,"This is a movie to be watched when you're in the mood for a new classic, when you're open to receive it because like most brilliant movies it demands something from its viewers, it doesn't just give, it's an exchange and you have to be up to get in it. Edward Norton as always elevates the material he approaches, he brings a whole new class to it, there is something in the way he puts on his characters till they live in his bones that is hypnotizing to watch. The whole cast plays beautifully, the music completes everything very sensually and it all comes together seamlessly. Even with all this going for it, I'd say this movies' strongest atribute is its tone - there is nothing loud or vulgar in it, it never screams for the viewers' attention, it simply evokes it, awakens it in you through its humanity, passion, humor and intelligence. For me this created a sense of connection, timelessness, a lack of gravity, like I had nowhere to go or be and the most natural thing was to just live in the movie. Safe to say I loved the experience of watching this movie. I'm always immensely grateful when I find something so beautifully done.",Motherless Brooklyn

198,snookie-6,"Fast-paced, picturesque, well-acted noir",10,4 March 2020,"2019 is a great year for movies and this one was promising enough with a line-up like this.
The cinematography is incredible. 1950's gritty New York is like something out of a postcard. The dialogue is great and the acting is superb, from the all-stars to the fresh faces. Norton's performance is stellar from start to finish. It's been a while since I've seen Willis in a good role. I was also thrilled to see Fisher Stevens, having grown up with Early Edition. Great Miles from Williams. Mbatha-Raw and Mann are also incredible. Baldwin, Cannavale, all of them are a joy to sit through.
Two hours and a half felt like a breeze. The story is very powerful and the characters are well-written. You can't help but sympathize with everyone in this film, the jazz cats, the crew, the ""villains"". Everyone has a story to tell and it's all the more touching when you realize they come out of their own personal hardships with a great sense of humor and witty jabs.
As a musician, Lionel's condition paralleled with jazz improvisation felt so relatable I could cry. The bond between all the characters in the otherwise big Brooklyn is also a very powerful message. There is no two-dimensional conflict, everything is complicated and extremely human. No good or bad, no black and white, it's all worldly. Even though it is a play on noir stereotypes, the characters are painfully real and so is the subject matter.
I'm giving it 10/10. In normal circumstances I'd give it a 9, but it's been a long time since I've seen a movie with so much heart in it and seeing its low rating on imdb makes me sad.
Bravo, Norton!",Motherless Brooklyn

The hero's psychological condition is entirely incidental to the story, but it works OK as an unusual, colourful flourish. Alec Baldwin looks bored but does the job as a regulation bad guy.

Ed Norton (who wrote the screen play and directed) is fabulous as the detective suffering from undiagnosed Tourette's. He tends to stay in the background but when his boss and mentor is killed he starts searching for the truth.

Edward Norton does it and his performance as the OCD/autism/Tourette challenged detective is one of his best and deserved an Oscar nomination. But hey, Oscars are not about good movies anymore but about hypocritical, fake political correctness.
Alec Baldwin and William Dafoe are also great and Bruce Willis is... well, Bruce Willis.
The movie starts strong but then loses momentum. Yes, as others complained it is a long movie and it has a slow pace. But this is part of its charm, it recreates that mood and atmosphere of old detective movies narrated on the first person and also of the 50's New York. If you like Fast and Furious and Justin Bieber this is probably not for you. If you like subtle things like listening to jazz you're probably going to enjoy the movie and by the way, there's a lot of fine jazz in the soundtrack.
The cinematography is gorgeous, they succeeded in emulating the saturated colors and the creamy look of 35mm classic film but without the graininess.
The story manages to escape the stereotypes: everything is not in black and white, no absolute truth, no ultimate good guy and ultimate villain, the hero doesn't save the world (even if Bruce Willis is in the movie).

Motherless Brooklyn (Edward Norton) is the brainchild of it's writer, director, and star. Delivering a quintessentially classic Edward Norton performance, the film draws viewers in.

A neo-noir well narrated with a hard-boiled touch that involves the story but keeps the main detective, Lionel Essrog (Norton himself), a sensitive and lonely character, at the same time endowed with an extraordinary memory, a good intuition but also with a pathology (Tourette's syndrome) that forces him to nervous tics and to sudden emissions of noises, words and nonsense sentences (but sometimes they are also surreal, comic sentences or that reveal his most intimate feelings). A comic and dramatic character at the same time, who accompanies you even after the film is over. All set in late 1950s New York, as a fitting tribute to hard-boiled literature and cinema. A must-see film that doesn't suffer at all from its length (over 2 hours).",Motherless Brooklyn
219,Chronic_Cuntlyf,"A Modern-Style Noir Film Set in the 50s.. not exactly a new idea, but...",6,15 January 2020,"While it suffers from a fairly cliche plot template, this film looks great and has a nice style that modernizes the noir genre while maintaining the usual time period. It's very well directed, filmed and acted. The jazz soundtrack is also a character of its own. I love films that give off ""neurotic loner in New York"" vibes, and this has a decent amount of that. It won an award for Art Direction and Production Design, and I can see why. Many nominations for the soundtrack too, among other things.The tourettes stuff might be annoying for some, but I think it's respecting in its portrayal, while still offering the occasional moment of humour. Though, this isn't a funny movie and never was intended as one, it's a mystery drama through and through.The writing is clearly the weakest aspect, mostly because this is a type of story that has been told many times, just with slightly different characteristics. But this would be of no fault to director, writer and actor Edward Norton as the story is based upon a novel that came out in the late 90s. I'm not sure why he wanted to adapt this to film, as it would inevitably suffer from feeling like something that's been done too many times before. But he does a great job with what it is. I cannot overstate how much I liked the aesthetic of this film. Not only what is shown on screen, but the aspect ratio that makes it look like something shot in the 70s by Coppola or Scorsese, but with a much more crisp image that makes the format look even more impressive (not unlike Joker's format).One small issue I noticed is that nobody in 1957 seems to know what tourettes is, yet it was discovered 72 years earlier in 1885. Maybe it just wasn't widespread knowledge? Or maybe it's just poor writing? Not sure.If you're fine with a dated narrative, but everything else appeals to or interests you, it's worth a watch. It's not even close to being a masterpiece, but it has style and Edward Norton, Willem Dafoe, Michael Kenneth Williams, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and even Alec Baldwin (who I don't care for as an actor) all put in worthwhile performances.6/10.",Motherless Brooklyn
220,Nahid_15,Solid crime mystery with great acting and the perfect setting,8,1 March 2020,"This movie has surprised me more than I thought. I've always loved Edward Norton as an actor. In my opinion, this guy rarely has a misstep in his career so I got pretty excited when I heard he's been working something. By the look of it you wouldn't be able to tell this is his second movie as a director. I wouldn't say that it's a masterpiece or anything but a damn good one.The movie is set during the 90s in New York City. Everything from the set design to color and music and the calm atmosphere felt astounding. From what I know he's been trying to make this movie for years. You could tell that a lot of thoughts were put into this like something that was made with care.Edward Norton plays a character named Lionel Essrog, who has Tourette syndrome and works at a detective agency. He lived in an abusive orphanage when he was a kid alongside a few others. Bruce Wilis' character Frank Minna, their boss rescued them from that abusive orphanage and gave them a purpose in life. Lionel because of his condition most of his life felt detached but Frank recognized his talent and sort of took him under his wing and nicknamed him ""Motherless Brooklyn"". One time Frank was working on a secret case that gets him killed and that leads Lionel and the others to investigate the reason for their boss was killed. While Lionel is talking to people despite his difficulties and trying to put together the missing pieces of the puzzle to get the exact story he realizes that it isn't just another simple case and there is a lot more to it than meets the eye, Frank was involved in something and found want what he wasn't supposed to. Lionel continues his pursuit to get the bigger picture.The only thing that bugged me the most is that Lionel's condition which makes him say things repetitively, and constant touching of people on the shoulder while talking to them face to face were surprisingly well accepted by everyone he met. Anyone didn't seem annoyed, said anything insulting or made fun of him, I doubt people were that accepting and conscious of people with disabilities back in the days. Other than this I mostly enjoyed everything.Overall, This is an absolutely solid crime mystery with great acting and the perfect setting. While I do think it's a tad bit long but it is worth watching for sure.",Motherless Brooklyn

The film had too many cliches. A couple of examples: closing the medicine cabinet mirror and seeing another person behind you and calling out to someone sitting in front of you only to see that he's dead.Alec Baldwin plays his role almost as a caricature except in his last scene.Norton's character's Tourette's syndrome and his constant ""I'm sorry"" disrupts the film and there would have been a lot more people making fun of him in that era.The new head of the investigator firm can easily be seen as working against Norton's character from the very beginning and all ""surprises"" or ""twists"" can be seen a mile away.A nice try at film noir but in the end too many cliches and a failure.Note: watching and listening to the jazz scenes were the highlight for me",Motherless Brooklyn

Writer/director/actor Edward Norton paid homage to the classics in this movie. Featuring an All-Star cast, there was no way he could lose with the characters' performances. I think that is the one drawback of the film, with such a stellar cast he had to give everyone time and the movie boasts a runtime of 2:24 minutes. A bit lengthy for a crime drama/who done it because there will be slower portions of the film. However, it was never boring and the dialogue is spot-on with the snappiness of Sin City but it doesn't come across as a caricature.

Plot very complex & sometimes hard to follow, but welcome given that so many hard boiled detective mysteries have already been made. So that is why the hero has to spell it out for us at the end.

227,awrobel,Film Noir ? Not so much!,4,8 November 2019,"I watched Chinatown on TCM the other night and frankly was blown away by it for a variety of reasons. After the film Norton was on and talked about the film, his admiration and about his own upcoming film. In the week that followed he subsequently was on almost every podcast I listen to. Ultimately, my curious peaked and after reading the names of the cast members and the plot that was outlined I went to see it.
On the merits, I would have to say that Norton's film was ambitious and very timely, but casting it as film noire, I'm not certain. In my opinion, the film lack the subtlety that I associate with the genre. The characters were not far too cartoonish and lacked depth. I was particularly disappointed with Alec Baldwin's performance, who I admire greatly, but lacked any nuance in his portrayal.
In conclusion, the film is clearly a homage to Polanski's ""Chinatown"", with a variety of scenes that were directly drawn from it and a plot that was equally convoluted and focused on unfettered power. Norton's film seem far too long, his character's malady was honesty distracting and unfortunately most of the characters were remarkably familiar.",Motherless Brooklyn

Show, Don't TellThere were many scenes I thought where you see characters such as William Defoe's character just telling Edward's character about who his brother (Moses) is. All the maneuvering, politics, master of puppets pulling the strings kind of thing. Norton could have showed all of this but instead chose to tell with Williams character. Especially a character like Moses, people familiar with Robert Caro's The Power Broker (like me) were disappointed to just to have a film tell me all this versus showing me all this. Imagine all the exciting b-roll of Alec's Moses evoking his power across the city. I would of bumped this up to an 8 for a change like that.2. Two Movies at OnceI really felt like Norton was trying to cram two different movies into one. I understand the connections Moses and his brother had with Laura and the jazz bar family but I kept thinking ""what is this story about"" and ""what doesn't belong here"" some storytelling advice I received when I took a storytelling course many years ago.Acting is strong, and the film is visually stunning.

Nothing that threw me out of my seat.The biggest surprise was how much Alec Baldwin's character reminded me of the character that he's famous for portraying on SNL. I don't know if Edward Norton had those parallels in mind when he wrote the screenplay, or if the source novel was based on current events, but it sure seemed heavily allegorical. (I've learned that he's based on an actual historical figure, just not *that* one.

I cannot see any other reason for the hero to be afflicted with Tourette Syndrome except to strengthen his underdog credentials. At the other end of this one-dimensional structure, the villainous capitalist has no redeeming features. Even his contributions to the city are mere camouflage for evil intentions.

Ed Norton, William Defoe, Bruce Willis, even Alec Baldwin -- great foundation for a film noir. How can you go wrong? However, I struggled through the beginning of the movie. Although I tried and tried, it was really hard to shake the suspicion that Ed Norton was reprising his role of Brian from The Score, a ho-hum heist movie from the early 2000s. (""Okay, Bye Bye!"").Now a film noir involves a flawed hero, someone who's a little good, and a little bad. But here Lionel's (Norton's) flaw is simply Tourrete syndrome? What's next, Schizo Sal, a hard-as-nails PI who moonlights as a reluctant serial killer? (Hey, that one actually sounds kind of interesting!). Although a few of Lionel's Freudian outbursts were kind of funny, for the most part I found them irritating and distracting.And the underlying message of the movie, the obvious trashing (and basically doing a Trump job) on poor Robert Moses (Baldwin's character), a man responsible for getting done many of the major highways and most of the major bridge crossing in NYC? Verrazano, Whitestone, Thogs Neck, Triborough, and others -- without Moses the citizens of New York would probably STILL be riding over-priced river ferries to get INTO NYC, and then strugging through perpetual and nonstop gridlock in an endless maze of local roads.

No one more so than the bad guy, played by Alec Baldwin, who is introduced in a strange way by not showing his face, as if to build up tension (like Alec Baldwin is a bigger deal than he actually is?). I could go on about every detail that bothered me with this film, but in a nutshell it just feels like a passion project by an actor who is merely playing at writing and directing.

267,nysalesman,BOORING! Left wing Hollywood hit job on Robert Moses,2,22 February 2020,"Let me begin by stating two facts. I am a 60-year old man with Tourette syndrome who grew up in New York City. That being said, I am divided about this movie. On one hand it has four fatal flaws. The most notable is that the Tourette syndrome angle brings nothing to the film and is more a distraction than anything else. In other words, the film would likely have been a little better without the Tourette angle. As someone with Tourette, and someone with both a brother and child who have Tourette, I can also state that I was not happy with the way Norton portrayed someone with Tourette syndrome as his portrayal simply perpetuated a false stereotype. The word association for instance, which was portrayed accurately in the book, is something we think in our head but do not verbalize. That being said, there was also some truth, like the fact that the majority of people with Tourette have compulsive obsessive disorder. It was also nice to see Norton's character show that Tourette is not a mental disease but a physical one. Hence, the two star rating instead of only one star.The three other fatal flaws were: 2. The moving was so boooring! It was so boring that I fell asleep half way through watching it in the early evening. This made me wonder, how can a movie with such great actors be so bad? This brings us to the third fatal flaw. 3. The movie was written and directed by Edward Norton. Norton is obviously a brilliant actor, but his is obviously a horrible writer and director. Ed - stick to acting please. The last fatal flaw was the obviously politically left-wing driven agenda of the movie to trash Robert Moses, who wasn't even in the book on which this movie is based. To set the record strait, Robert Moses did not rape a woman and Robert Moses made New York City what is it today (yes believe it or not life in New York would be even more miserable - even for minorities - had Moses not modernized the city). As far as the parks are concerned, Moses gave up his own land to create many of them. Furthermore, Moses lived in the slums that he purportedly destroyed. So, he didn't call them slums because there were minorities, he called them slums because he lived there and saw it for himself. When it comes to eminent domain, it is clear that highways, bridges, fall under that statute. So, this movie had no right to trash Moses for doing what the law allows. If this movie wanted to trash anyone, then it should have gone after Bobby Brown; who's unrelenting efforts to build the Metro-Center stadium and Mall in Brooklyn displaced hundreds (if not thousands) of minorities to convert their neighborhoods into rich-white Yuppie heaven. Let's see, Moses Taylor used eminent domain to build roads and bridges and Brown (along with the New York Politicians who put his plan into place) used eminent domain to build a stadium and shopping mall. Hmmm, I wonder why Norton didn't go after Brown instead. Oh , now I know, it's because Brown is a rich black left winger, and Hollywood only targets rich white right wingers. The movie would have been better if it just left politics out by portraying Moses as who he really was or at least not building their villein as a parallel to Moses. Even so, it would not have been much better thanks to the other three fatal flaws.",Motherless Brooklyn

273,eugenelevine,A lot to like,9,26 February 2020,"I am 76 years old. I grew up in Queens during the period of this film. I lived in subsidized housing in Astoria because my dad was a returning navy veteran. My family moved to Jackson Heights, and then to Forest Hills.As a kid, I swam in the Astoria Pool during the polio epidemics of the 1950s; I swam in the St. George hotel salt water pool in Brooklyn. I lived in the shadow of the Tri-Boro Bridge and the Hell's Gate Bridge (both of them consigned to bit parts in the dialog).I worked two summers in Robert Moses World's Fair (1964-5). I remember Robert Moses losing his first serious battles to housewives pushing baby carriages in Brooklyn and Shakespeare fans fighting for free Shakespeare in the Park.This movie shows the essence of the Moses attitudes -- but it is not a Robert Moses biopic. It is not an historical document. I have no idea whether there was a sex-based scandal in his life, but I have no doubt Robert Moses believed he was doing necessary things, and that if people were being hurt, it was unavoidable if he was going to accomplish his great works.It is true that NYC's modern physical configuration has been largely shaped by Robert Moses. I think it will be many years before we know if what he did was good or necessary for the well-being of the people of New York. Ada Louise Huxtable (the architectural critic for the New York Times during the Moses years) was not a big fan of Robert Moses. Jane Jacobs was not a big fan. His mid-60's World's Fair was widely disdained for its non-stop commercialism, and its complete disregard for the possibility of international cultural engagement.The movie briefly alluded to something that sums up the Robert Moses era (and it is a well known and true storyt). Moses built a truly beautiful sun bathing beach on Long Island called Jones Beach. He also built a network of truly beautiful limited access parkways in the outer boroughs and the inner parts of Long Island. The parkways were built with bridges to carry cross traffic, and these bridges were intentionally built short to block bus traffic between the inner city and the Long Island parks. This was done to satisfy the concerns of Long Islanders that the parks and parkways would invite inner city residents  to invade the beaches. The Long Islanders would have fought the parkways and the parks and the beaches if the overpasses were not built this way.You don't have to a liberal or a conservative to know this story. .And it sums up Robert Moses theories and strategies of development in New York.The Moses-designed transportation system is based on privately-owned automobiles replacing light rail, electric buses and mass underground and elevated transit systems. The suburban parks were automobile accessible; the inner city parks were not of grand conception.Two of the final chapters in Robert Moses declining power were written by the Free Shakespeare festival and the Brooklyn bases ""stroller brigade.""Moses even wanted to build a limited access thoroughfare through the middle of Washington Square!During his remarkable reign, Moses controlled the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which, in turn provided the financing that made him the most uncontrollably powerful public person in New York state.The movie gives us the essence of this man and his time. However, as I was once told in a different connection: this work should not be taken literally, but it should be taken seriously.As to the movie's other qualities: it is beautifully shot; the script is terrific, the quality of the acting, writing, direction and cinematography are well matched. The backstory and context provide meaningful structure, and the characters are truly interesting.I suppose you could say it follows in the tradition of Chinatown and LA Confidential--but I don't get why that is a bad thing, since those are two of my favorite movies.And, in case you haven't got the message: I really enjoy Edward Norton's acting and take on things.If you got this far: Thanks for listening.Gene",Motherless Brooklyn

The movie was at least 45min too long. Not impressed with Ed Norton's depiction of tourette's syndrome. It pains me to say that because I love Norton as an actor. To be fair, I got pretty tired of it in the book as well. It was a novel idea(pardon the pun), but it took away from the plot line, which was so convoluted, that I stopped trying to keep up with it.

I grew up in the 50's, and this film recreates the mood, music, disparities, and dysfunction of living in a big city, filled with both depressing poverty and powerful affluence. It is an engaging complicated detective story that seems satisfyingly straightforward once it is all unraveled. At times it is reminiscent of The Maltese Falcon, and other times like Chinatown. At times, you can hear an echo of Donald Trump explaining how powerful people take what they want without regard to law, facts, or the opinions & feelings of others. And if you know anything about Robert Moses and the building of modern NY City, you will be thrilled by the plot as well as Alec Baldwin's performance. Indeed, every actor was given opportunities to shine in their roles. At times tense, frightening and sad. Other times very calming and introspective. This movie has so much to offer. I rarely give a 10. But certainly this movie deserves a 9. It is worth seeing a few times for the visual clues, the attention to detail, the music (Wynton Marsalis etc), the beautiful photography and the nuanced performances. Thank you Edward Norton.",Motherless Brooklyn

283,Motion-Picture_Maven,Motherless Brooklyn's moral ambiguity...,10,4 November 2019,"From the onset of the prized Motherless Brooklyn adaptation, I realized this film was intellectually casted, and so carefully and intricately crafted, by giving a beyond-the-surface treatment to the characterizations presenting juxtapositions to one another.This is a rarely seen approach to a film's tableau including outstanding performances by an array of praise-worthy actors including Ed Norton, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Cherry Jones, Bruce Willis, Willem Dafoe, Michael Kenneth Williams (the Trumpet Man), Dallas Roberts and Alec Baldwin to name just a few... the wildly talented Ed Norton, who delivered a gritty, suspenseful noir, a well-developed character portrayal, a thoughtful, deliberatively-paced adapted tough topic screen-play.The film put to rest the common belief system that racial tensions are inherently about personal disgust or a perception of un-relatable, cultural differences, but instead it depicts that racism emanates possibly from fear of limitations and personal preferences and/or the protection of the traditional power dynamic.Norton was also able to cleverly execute a literary device, to quickly contrast the difficulty and constant un-predictability of being unfortunately plagued by Tourette's Syndrome, to the unpredictable and unexpected struggle and consequence of being an African American in today's society. This creative tool was used in the story to effectively shred the notion of an expected complex racial relation to instead deliver a gift of closeness, an understanding that we all share common humanity.Phenomenal Jazz Music was compellingly performed in Motherless Brooklyn to also melt away our differences, enrich and facilitate social diversity in the movie and fuse audiences.Anchored to the film, is Norton's breath-of-fresh-air comfortability, showing that the source of our quiet, personal strength (in one's soul) perhaps originates from nurturing, loving women spanning one's life, symbolizing that the natural patriarchy is perhaps female not male.This picture was a nice duration to enjoy on a leisurely day at the theater.

The movie played more like ""Chinatown"", only instead of Jack Nicholson we got Ed Norton with Tourette's Syndrome. The story is somewhat confusing so you had better pay attention. It was clearly a swipe at Robert Moses who built most of the highways and bridges on Long Island (which was originally part of Brooklyn). Story was about mostly Black people being displaced from their homes through Eminent Domain by idealistic to a fault ""Moses"" character. In reality, people who were displaced by government projects were offered equal value for their property and most property taken was used ,for the housing projects you see today. There is one scene in a Harlem Jazz Club where we must listen to not one or two, but three jazz tunes which has nothing to do with moving the story.

It is a very solid crime drama story that wears it's inspirations on its sleeve. The recreation of 1950s New York was impressive on such a small budget. This was clearly a passion project for Ed Norton, something that I'd like to see more out of Hollywood. Motherless Brooklyn isn't flashy, and it doesn't need to be. It's a good time through and through, and doesn't seem like a two and a half hour movie. Very niche indeed, as I was only one of five people in my theater for the viewing. Some may critique it as being a slow burn, of a story that we have heard a thousand times already. While there is some truth to this, I can't say that I didn't like this one. The performances were not pronounced, yet solid altogether. Norton does a great job, though. It's nice to see Willis and Dafoe in good movies. I haven't read the original novel, and most say that some creative liberties were taken in its production and final product. There are some allusions to modern times, with Baldwin imitating a Trump-esque figure. That never really bothered me, he did a nice job as well. If you're into these sort of slow paced, intriguing films, than Motherless Brooklyn is for you. Once again, I'll say that this one was a pleasant surprise.

299,Heisenberg999,"Beautiful from the outside, but broken from the inside",5,6 November 2019,"This film had every right to be an excellent film. This project was Edward Norton's baby. He was committed to this project for almost 20 years, the book is apparently amazing and the story itself sounds somewhat decent. But, something unfortunately went wrong.So, from the director, producer, actor, and writer Edward Norton comes a story about a private detective who has Tourette's syndrome. As he's investigating one particular case of murder, he becomes more and more involved, and he starts to risk everything that he has.
Despite an interesting premise and all the commitment behind the film, it didn't end up being good. The biggest issue of the film is that it's way too long. It has a runtime of almost 2 hours and 30 minutes. There are so many unnecessary scenes that only dragged the pacing of the film and which didn't contribute to anything. You could easily trim about 30 minutes of the film and almost nothing would change. The only thing that would change is that the film would be more concise. Furthermore, Norton should've given the screenwriting job to someone else because the script was very bad. All the characters were underdeveloped and the whole film in the general was unfocused. The film very often switched focus between many characters, but the thing is that most of them weren't interesting at all. They were just a caricatures which only had one character trait throughout the whole film, and that's it. E.g. Bruce Willis' character had only one purpose in the film, and that was being the role model to Norton's character; Baldwin was a bad guy; Dafoe was a shady, mysterious guy; Gugu Mbatha-Raw was a love interest. It's unfortunate because all of them are terrific actors and they didn't have any material to work with. Regarding the script, Norton used narration and exposition a lot, and the worst thing is that he milked both. If there wasn't any exposition laid out in the narration, he would use it a couple of minutes later to explain the simplest things which didn't need any explanation. Instead of doing pointless exposition, the film could've given more development to the relationship between Norton's and Willis' character. Every 5 minutes Norton talks about him and how he's a huge influence on him. I wish they built some grounds for those statements because they seemed shallow. You didn't have any reason whatsoever to understand/believe why exactly Willis was Norton's idol. And because of that, all those monologues fell short.Despite all those negative aspects, for some unknown reason, I was sucked in into the world which film presented. That was achieved through aesthetics. The production design was beautiful and it was delightful to look at all those set pieces. Especially, if you're a huge fan of Once Upon a Time in America and films similar to that one, you're going to love the locations and the time period in which this film took place in. The costumes were great and they definitely contributed to achieve a noir ""homage"". It's actually impressive how well the atmosphere was built despite the bland script. If the actors weren't great as they were, the film would lose a lot in its quality. Norton was fantastic and he was definitely one of the standouts from this film. If it was marketed and promoted better, and maybe if the film received a better reception from the critics, he would be in competition for an Oscar. Bruce Willis gave the second acceptable performance in this year, and Baldwin and Dafoe were decent but their charisma was completely wasted.When you combine all those positive and negative aspects you'll get an atmospheric and beautiful film from the outside, but unfortunately, from the inside this film ended up being rotten.",Motherless Brooklyn

There were times in the film that some of the shots and script reminded me of a Hallmark Channel Original Movie.

305,interstellarstyles,Heartfelt drama mystery but has boring political scenes,8,6 November 2019,"To start off, the beginning has you captivated right away. The chase and Minna's death. We get introduced to Lionel and at first it seems a bit odd at his behavior but as the movie progresses, you get used to it. Edward Norton portrays Lionel very well and all of the cast is talented. The only thing about that I have to say is in the first conversation with Laura, his acting seems bad but the rest of the movie his acting his incredible. The only parts that seem complex or boring are the political scenes. The whole ending to do with Paul and Moses is very confusing and I got lost along the way. A rewatch would help.Laura and Lionel's relationship seems a bit rushed and I don't think Laura would like Lionel that easy but she finds his tics amusing while he just keeps apologizing. Alec Baldwin's whole trump like character was not necessary. It was just a way for Norton to express his political views in the film.Near the middle there are boring parts but then it picks back up again near the end and the only thing that seems inaccurate is when Lionel doesn't tic for more than a few minutes you think something is up. He said it happens a lot when he gets nervous or excited or something like that.During an intense scene with a bad guy, you don't see him doing that which makes you question the character a bit. The description said Lionel had OCD but honestly, I didn't see too much of that but I'm no psychiatrist.Lionel is a character you can easily like and he's sweet. His presence gives that off. The cinematography is always somewhat dull but that's what to expect from a noir movie.Edward Norton's passion project is worth watching for anyone who an intelligent audience. For any age inquiries, there is quite a lot of vulgar language, and some blood but other than that, the movie should be fine for teens and up.",Motherless Brooklyn

The film showcases what the power of money and greed, all ingredients of capitalism, can do.Love and lust have no boundaries, this was indeed a pleasurable takeaway from this movie. Other themes covered were loyalty, trust, kinship and corruption in public office. Some political undertones remind me of the current political climate in the USA today.All in all, a great film for those who have the patience to watch it, and who appreciate real everyday life topics that impact us.",Motherless Brooklyn

In fact, I'd almost bet that Ed Norton patterned this story after Chinatown... and just adapted it to the culture of Brooklyn in the 40's & 50's. A very similar plot... with similar genre... and superb jazz music of the times. I'd bet any amount of money... that... Norton is that... and even... a bit creative.

What a treat to see his inner mind laid out here.Stylistically I think the challenge would be for him to keep the intelligence of his dialogues, but to package it more tightly. If some chats or scenes were constrained better then even a handful of minutes shaved on run time would have put this squarely into the bell-curve of universal appeal. Having noted that challenge for the audience, what it pays the viewer back in abundance is both deeper interactions and fully-rounded characters across the length of the film.The location sets were gorgeous and eye-popping frames exist in this film, peppered throughout.This film charges into the debate of inequality and exclusion, with good and bad characters across intersectional lines, under the guise of a mystery-adventure period piece.I have high hopes for Norton honing his craft in the years and decades ahead and will remainly eagerly expectant.",Motherless Brooklyn

Lionel's symptoms of Tourette's syndrome, repetitive verbalizations of a rhyming nature, were accepted equanimously by everyone he encountered. No one displayed annoyance, made fun of him, or called him insulting names to cast aspersions about his intelligence. His repetitive touching of people on the shoulder as he faced them ought to have caused women to back away and men to knock his block off. They did neither. It was as if these 1950s characters had been taught the acceptance of people with disabilities that was not really commonplace until the 21st century.

What happens to franks wife? why is she even part of the story? sometimes is seems like some pictures are missing or they cut to something with no use. The rooms and rhe buildings do not even look real, they just look like paper houses and not authentic. You do not get the relationships or why they say certain things?!

360,mikhail_d_frolov,A good detective story with the atmosphere of old New York,8,19 January 2020,"A good detective story about an orphan detective Lionel with a nervous system disease. He is trying to unravel the murder case of his boss Frank, who had once seen the protagonist by pulling him out of the orphanage, arranged him in the search office and gave him such a nickname. In parallel with the investigation of Lionel and in anticipation of the New York municipal elections, there is a relocation (and in fact - eviction) of ordinary Brooklyn from dilapidated housing for the construction of infrastructure facilities in their place. Before his death, Frank dug under the organizers of this capitalist campaign - the so-called ""Borough authority"". He was also interested in a girl named Laura, an activist in the movement against oppression of the ""colored"" residents of Brooklyn slums. Lionel has to determine the connection of Laura with the ""law-breaking"" authorities and, of course, the murder of his best friend Frank.
The film itself was beautifully shot; the atmosphere of New York in the 50s of the XIX century was struck to the depths. There is not much humor - it is often based on Lionel's fits and his obscene rhymes, but the story is more serious in tone.
Maybe because of this very seriousness, the film on my rating scale is a little less than 10 - I apologize for the fact that I pay a lot of attention to my emotions that I feel after leaving the cinema.",Motherless Brooklyn

368,gadair11,Edward Norton is one of America's great storytellers,5,12 May 2020,"I'm sure many of heard of what a ""difficult to work with"" person Edward Norton is. There is only one problem with that. If you look at the body of his work, and I have, you'll find he rarely makes a bad decision as a storyteller.
"" Motherless Brooklyn"" I will not say is a masterpiece for one reason only. It is in the hope that we will be seeing more of the best of Edward Norton and Films to which he attaches his name.
I am not going to retell the story here. As I find most reviewer's spent too much time retelling the story.
So this is what I will say: if you're looking for an engaging film with multifaceted and layered and colored (artistically not racially) Characters that move through a story that is a mystery thriller who done it in a why done it? Then do it I did buy the DVD and put the DVD in a section of your collection marked ""Classics"".
The writing was fantastic. The set pieces were evocative of the era and of the characters that inhabited those set pieces. And the acting was spot on with every character every actor every word and every action.",Motherless Brooklyn
369,graham-b-kent,Tourette is Finally Depicted Responsibly,8,7 November 2019,"The first time I saw Tourette Syndrome portrayed in mainstream film was, as I imagine is the same for many others, in Deuce Bigalow. It wouldn't be the last time, however, that the portrayal was an exaggeration of coprolalia (the swearing tic), the shock value of which was used for a cheap and easy laugh.Over the years, I've seen that many people have presumptions about this neurological disorder - understandable, given the circumstances. Unfortunately, I've also learned the hard way that many of these presumptions have been heavily (and negatively) biased towards this inferred 'swearing tic', and I can't help but feel like Deuce Bigalow, or Not Another Teen Movie, or others, have helped shape this presumption.The presumption honestly doesn't bother me, provided the person holding the belief is willing to have a conversation with me about it. I've always been open about my Tourette, and I consider myself lucky and fortunate to have won awards, or spoken with the media, or inspired others, due to my openness and having some small success with writing and acting.What does get to me, though, is when the people aren't willing to have a conversation with me. I've been fired from jobs once it's become known that I have Tourette, even though it hasn't affected my work. I've had dates suddenly lose interest. I've been kicked out of bars when bouncers have mistaken my tics for drug use and refused to hear any explanation without threatening violence.So when I heard that Edward Norton would be portraying someone with Tourette Syndrome in #MotherlessBrooklyn, I was excited to see what an actor of such calibre would do with such a complex condition. And I was not disappointed.Motherless Brooklyn is great. Adapted from the novel and written and directed for the screen by Edward himself, the film is an enthralling and charming noir detective piece peppered with big names playing relatively small roles, all of whom tell a captivating story about government corruption in 1950s New York.Edward's presentation of Tourette Syndrome was refreshing. It was delivered with a level of maturity and respect that is seldom seen on the silver screen. And even though the condition is never outright named in the film, much like his tics, it can't be hidden from anyone watching.And yes, his character does have coprolalia, and echolalia (the tic where you have to repeat things said), and other verbal and motor tics. And sometimes it's funny. But his tics aren't just a cheap laugh for the audience - they affect his character. A PI trying to stay unnoticed on the subway who suddenly blurts out some choice words and draws attention to himself is funny. And when he's consoling someone and can't stop touching their shoulder, it's funny. And when they reassure him that it's okay, it's endearing.And it's okay for us to laugh at the realities of life, however absurd or uncontrollable they may be at times. Tourette Syndrome is real and sometimes it's funny and that's okay. But at least in this film, we're finally laughing at it for the right reasons. And with his portrayal, which also shows some of the positives that can come with Tourette - as opposed to just the obviously stare-inducing drawbacks - I am hopeful that this may help provide the less-aware with a better, more informed presumption about this condition.Are there actors out there with Tourette Syndrome (and who are open about it) that could have played this role? Absolutely. Like me. But I'm not Edward Norton. And are there actors out there with Tourette Syndrome (and closeted about it) that could have played this role? Absolutely. But they are also not Edward Norton.The issue of roles going to actors who don't live with the condition being portrayed has been a hot-button issue for many, and I do think there are instances where the role should have gone to someone else. This isn't one of those times. Actors are actors, after all - their job is to convince you that they're not pretending.Edward was convincing. And I - and I imagine a number of others with Tourette Syndrome who have been subject to unfair or illegal treatment due, at least in part, to a sub-par late '90s movie - thank him for being so. I was fortunate enough to see this at TIFF this year, where he introduced the film. Had he stayed for a Q&A afterwards, I would have loved to have said this to him in person. But I doubt I am the first, and know I won't be the last, person to say this.",Motherless Brooklyn

But the negative thing was that the movie was too long and it could've been shorter by 30 minutes, too many unnecessary conversations and at some point watching the movie you feel lost because of the complicated details. The sound track was amazing especially ""Daily Battles"" song. I'd recommend it with a large cup of coffee to stay awake and not to fall asleep watching it.",Motherless Brooklyn
381,pearcejill,Enjoyable story,9,22 May 2020,"Great story. Brilliantly acted with haunting Jazz music, didn't notice two and half hours going by.",Motherless Brooklyn
382,mjf387,Waste of time,1,19 February 2020,Spent $5.99 to rent this on a rainy afternoon because of the wonderful cast. Sorry to say it was turned off after 45 minutes. Bad acting. Bad direction. Always thought I would love to live in 1950's NYC. I've since changed that opinion.,Motherless Brooklyn
383,eddiethesnitch,The overly clean cars....,7,28 November 2020,"Like Ed Norton, I also have my annoying quirks.The period cars, nearly every one of them, were shiny clean. Highly unlikely, if not impossible, with the obvious slushy streets in winter.",Motherless Brooklyn

385,daviddawson-20000,Norton brilliant,8,12 March 2021,"Very very good movie, Edward Norton is exceptional as the gumshoe with Tourette's, fact he directed as well is even more astonishing, supporting cast excellent as well, highly recommended.",Motherless Brooklyn
386,jtradioranch,Classic Detective Story,10,7 February 2020,"Ed Norton proves his chops again as a director putting together a great story keeping you on the edge of your seat all the way through. It's a classic detective fable up there with Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep and Out Of The Past where the story takes the lead.",Motherless Brooklyn
387,jeffverbeek,Nice movie,10,9 December 2019,A nice movie with a great story! With a good acting portfolio! Maybe a little bit long...,Motherless Brooklyn
388,vbookem,Excellent movie draws you in fast.,9,7 February 2020,"The movie pulls you in hard and fast. Edward Norton did an outstanding job becoming the character or Lionel. His demonstration of a person suffering with tourette's syndrome was spot on. He also did a great job in writing for this film. He was able to make the character someone you feel sympathy for but also very likeable and funny. The actress who portrays Laura was also very believable on her role. The music was beautiful all throughout the movie. I honestly cannot say that any of the actors or actresses including the supporting cast were anything less than believable in their roles. The only thing I felt was a little lacking was the final conclusion to the movie. I feel like you spend all that time watching this guy work so hard for justice that it would have been nice to have visually see it all unfold and have the ""devil get his due"" so to speak. It has been a long time since I have watched a mystery movie that had such a developed plot and story line. It was refreshing and I have nothing I feel it should be compared to. It was in a league of it's own.",Motherless Brooklyn
