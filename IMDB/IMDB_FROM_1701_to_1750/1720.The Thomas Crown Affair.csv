0,TheLittleSongbird,Loose but stylish and classy,8,2 August 2011,"I am very fond of the Norman Jewison original particularly for Dunnaway and for the song The Windmills of My Mind. This is a very worthy remake, and almost on par in my opinion, and I thought I'd never say that after seeing far too many pointless ones along the odd truly great one. The story is not quite as convincing here, it does have some great scenes that also some that don't quite work like the dance scene which was not very well filmed and didn't enhance the story as much as the chess scene of the original. However, visually it is very stylish, with striking locations, crisp photography and editing and great fashions. The direction as expected from John McTiernan is very convincing, the screenplay is taut and the soundtrack is memorable. Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo are fine leads, and their chemistry is somewhat steamier than the original's, and there is also some great support from Denis Leary and Faye Dunnaway herself. Overall, a more than worthy remake, loose of course but very stylish and classy. 8/10 Bethany Cox",The Thomas Crown Affair
1,SnoopyStyle,Fun game play,7,19 October 2013,"Super rich Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) can't resist a great caper. He steals a $100M Monet painting in an elaborate scheme from the museum. Police detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary) heads the investigation. Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) is the super smart investigator for the insurer who's only goal is to retrieve the painting. Only she falls for Thomas along the way.The caper is great. I love the robbery scheme. I also love the solving of the robbery scheme. From there, the movie goes into game playing mode between Brosnan and Russo. Some of it is great like the burning of the wooden crate. Others are more contrived and stylized. Most of it is fun. It's all very light and jazzy without the tension.",The Thomas Crown Affair
2,lee_eisenberg,the original wasn't really worth remaking,4,14 January 2011,"Norman Jewison's 1968 movie ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" cannot be considered any kind of masterpiece. True, it was a clever look at embezzlement, containing a cool chess game. But in the grand scheme of things, it seemed to go more for aesthetics than plot (although I will admit that Faye Dunaway looked mighty sexy in those outfits).So why remake it? John McTiernan, known for flicks like ""Predator"" and ""Die Hard"", changes the setting from Boston to New York and changes the focus from a bank robbery to an art heist. The roles played by Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway are now played by Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo (with Dunaway co-starring as the psychiatrist, and Denis Leary and Ben Gazzara also appearing).The original, despite its flaws, did manage to create a steamy, tense feeling. The remake just can't compare. They could have at least given it a better ending than they did.Also appearing is columnist Bob Novak, a few years before he infamously outed Valerie Plame.",The Thomas Crown Affair
3,jboothmillard,The Thomas Crown Affair,5,22 September 2005,"I had seen this remake prior to seeing the original Steve McQueen caper version, and to be honest, I prefer the more fast-paced and raunchy version, from director John McTierman (Die Hard, Predator). Basically Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) is the self-made millionaire with everything he could want, who likes to steal priceless art paintings in his spare time. After a recent theft from the Claude Monet museum it is up to insurance investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) to uncover key suspect Crown in a cat and mouse game. Soon enough it is obvious that she can't resist the charming playboy, and they end up sleeping together, and start enjoying glider rides over country, cruising in his expensive car, and holidaying for three days in Martinique. There is a point where Thomas asks Catherine to go away with him, confessing anything she wants to know to be with her, and he proposes a day he can be caught or left alone at the museum he robbed before. This is a setup though and he manages to arrange many other men to wear the same getup-up as him, and he disappears, only to reappear behind Catherine on her at first sad flight, so it is a then happy ending (unlike the original, no back together there). Also starring Denis Leary as Detective Michael McCann, Anatomy of a Murder's Ben Gazzara as Andrew Wallace, Frankie Faison as Detective Paretti, Fritz Weaver as John Reynolds, Charles Keating as Friedrich Golchan, Mark Margolis as Heinrich Knutzhorn and Faye Dunaway (star of the original) as The Psychiatrist. It might not have the quite sexy chess playing scene, but it has a quite racy first sex scene, and Brosnan and Russo make a very sexy couple, and it has much more modern ways to tell the story. Worth watching!",The Thomas Crown Affair
4,ccthemovieman-1,They Have Us Rooting For The Crooks Again!,7,28 August 2006,"I found this to be a pretty solid re-make of the Steve McQueen-Faye Dunaway film of the early '70s. Actually, a lot of people thought this version was a lot more interesting and entertaining.This '99 re-make was more of a thinking man's crime movie that one normally sees these days in which violence and profanity are way overdone so many times. However, this movie is far from family entertainment with amoral lead actors including Rene Russo baring her breasts a few times and Pierce Brosnan having sex with her at first opportunity.Speaking of morals, one gets tired of the film world constantly making the criminals the good guy and the police as someone to root against. That mentality is so Liberal it's sickening and those messages abound in this story. Neither of the two leads has an ounce of integrity....but we are manipulated into rooting for them.For nostalgia buffs, the let Dunaway play a small role in here, as the annoying psychiatrist.I really liked this film the first two times I saw but was totally turned off at the third viewing. Maybe my conscience was slow to kick in, as this movie is clever story- wise but sick message-wise.",The Thomas Crown Affair
5,Tweekums,A '90s version of a '60s classic,8,30 December 2019,"If you've seen the original version and don't see the point in watching a different version of the same story don't worry; apart from the protagonist's name and general themes there are more than enough differences to make this worth watching.Thomas Crown is one of New York's ultra-rich; he owns his own company and partakes in expensive sports. He is also bored. To alleviate that boredom he stages a heist in a museum and walks away with a painting valued at one hundred million dollars. The police start investigating and are soon joined by Catherine Banning, an insurance investigator hoping to save her employers from having to pay out. She quickly suspects Crown and soon a flirtatious game of cat and mouse begins as she tries to prove her suspicions and he leads her on without giving her the evidence she needs.Remakes are seldom quite as good as the original, making them somewhat redundant, but thanks to the differences I'd definitely recommend this. The way the robbery takes place and later behaviour makes this Thomas Crown a slightly less amoral character. The robbery itself is enjoyable thanks to the way it is undertaken; the lack of real threat to people in the museum makes it easier to enjoy without feeling guilty. Once Catherine Banning arrives her character is at least as important as Crown and her pursuit of him is a lot of fun. The cast does a fine job most obviously Pierce Brosnan who is suitably suave as Crown and Rene Russo who brings a mature sexiness to the role of Banning. Overall I still prefer the original but still recommend this fun mix of crime and romance.",The Thomas Crown Affair
6,Quinoa1984,Never saw the original. This one is probably the better one anyway.,7,14 June 2000,"*Possible spoilers ahead*The Thomas Crown Affair is what most movie-goers like to see often (or like to pay their 8.50 to see).  It is also the type of movie that is fun to watch on a plane (ironic saying considering the ending, oops).  Pierce Brosnan and Renee Russo are great together, and make a good on-screen duo (and it is actually sexy for 40 year olds) considering.  Denis Leary is also very good (and funny) as detective McCann and plays it good and done.  John McTiernan doesn't break any new ground here (in fact, Faye Dunaway who was in the original plays another role again in this feature), but it does show what one man can do with a remake.  Great scene location at the Metropolitain museum of art in NY.  A- (for a flaw or two)",The Thomas Crown Affair
7,sunwarrior13,A Brilliant And Stylish Remake,9,27 September 2012,"The Thomas Crown Affair is a heist film that features Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo and Denis Leary.It is a remake of the 1968 film of the same title.It was directed by John McTiernan.When a priceless Monet painting is stolen from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the police find themselves wondering which world-class art thief pulled the job. What they don't know is that the thief wasn't a professional, but an amateur. Thomas Crown was born poor but made his way through Oxford on a boxing scholarship. With his sharp sense for business and ruthless ambition, Crown has become a self-made billionaire; but despite his wealth and power, he still seeks new challenges, and he steals art not for the profits but for the sheer excitement. However, as fun as art theft might be, it's still illegal, and investigator Catherine Banning is brought in to track down the culprit. Certain clues point to Crown, so Banning introduces herself into Crown's social circle. Police detective Michael McCann warns Banning against getting too close to Crown. She takes McCann's suggestion lightly.But she finds herself falling for the suave thief.For the Hollywood remake rule, which dictates that an update of an older film be inferior to the original in almost every aspect, The Thomas Crown Affair stands as a glorious exception. The original 1968 film was a diverting pop confection of mod clothes and nifty break-ins, but not much more. McTiernan's new version, though, cranks up the entertainment factor to mach speed, turning what was a languid flick into a high- adrenaline caper romance. Overall,it was a brilliant and stylish remake with interesting plot twists.",The Thomas Crown Affair
8,LeonLouisRicci,"Safe, Puff and Fluff Escapism that's Frequently Cringe-Worthy",4,24 September 2015,"A Puff Piece from Inconsistent Director John McTiernan. it's Unexplainable how He can make Excellent Films like Die Hard (1988) and Predator (1987) and then deliver such Shallow, Uninteresting, and Safe Stuff like this bit of Eye Candy, so Sweet and safe.It's a Remake and does Nothing to Enhance the Original. In Fact, that's what this Bland, but Beautifully Shot Film does best, Nothing. The Movie is a Throwback to more Innocent Times when it wasn't Cringe-Worthy for Super-Rich People to flaunt Their Insensitivity and ""World as a Game"" Philosophy and Behavior in the Faces of the regular Folks who buy Tickets and Popcorn, for Escapism. It Literally has No Qualms to say, ""Don't you wish you could be so obnoxious?"". In the turn of the New Millennium, this is Just Antiquated hubris from the Billionaires. It's Not Fun, Not Funny, Not anything but Embarrassing. Pierce Bronson's and Rene Russo's Sophisticated Cool watching what might be a ""Renoir"" go up in Flames with a Shrug says It all. Speaking of Russo, where did She get that ""Fingers on a Blackboard"" Laugh? Dennis Leary is the Best thing in this thing, besides the Slick look, but His usual Acerbic Personality is mostly Wasted.",The Thomas Crown Affair
9,lastliberal,Men make women messy.,8,2 October 2007,"I usually hate remakes, but this is the exception that proves the rule.Pierce Brosnan is so much more classy that Steve McQueen. He is utterly convincing as a rich playboy and an entrepreneur. While Faye Dunaway did a marvelous job in the original and I have no criticism of her performance, I am enchanted with the performance of Rene Russo.Brosnan and Russo were a pair that were perfectly matched. The soundtrack was fantastic, even including ""The Windmills of Your Mind"" from the original. Adding Dunaway as a Psychiatrist was a masterful touch.This is much more of a caper film as you actually saw some beautiful work her. The ""other woman"" was beefed up and really added to the plot. The ending was much more satisfying, and, unlike the previous version which had to be rated ""R"" because the bad guy won, this actually earned the rating with some magnificent scenes.",The Thomas Crown Affair
10,Uriah43,A Good Remake but Lacks the Suspense and Sexual Chemistry of the Original Movie,6,18 February 2021,"""Thomas Crown"" (Pierce Brosnan) is a wealthy businessman who resides in New York and is both extremely competitive and likes to live on the edge of danger. That being the case, he devises a plan to steal a famous Monet painting at the Metropolitan Museum of Art worth an estimated $100 million. To accomplish this task he carefully selects a crew from Eastern Europe while at the same time hiding his from them. Once they begin to carry out his instructions he cleverly double-crosses them which creates enough confusion to allow him to safely abscond with the piece of art with nobody capable of tying him to the theft. At least, that is what he initially thinks. What he doesn't count on is the insurance company hiring an investigator by the name of ""Catherine Banning"" (Rene Russo) who has an uncanny ability to take what little evidence is available from the crime scene and build a solid case from that point. Likewise, the fact that she stands to make a profit of $5 million gives her even more incentive. What then transpires is a battle of wits in which Catherine is prepared to do whatever it takes to nail Thomas one way or the other. Now rather than reveal any more I will just that this was a good remake of the 1968 film which starred Steve McQueen in the lead role. Unfortunately, even though Pierce Brosnan performs quite well in this particular film, it lacks the overall suspense and sexual chemistry of its predecessor and for that reason I have rated it lower than the original movie. Slightly above average.",The Thomas Crown Affair
11,anaconda-40658,Thomas Crown's Fifty Shades.,3,13 August 2015,"The Thomas Crown Affair (1999): Dir: John McTieman / Cast: Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo, Denis Leary, Faye Dunaway, Fritz Weaver: Pointless remake that is more soft corn porn than a worthy detective caper that the original film succeeded as. The affair in question regards both the execution of the crime at hand as well as the constant sex. There is lots of sex and sweat and as little plot as possible because the budget went to whoever could orgasm the loudest. Pierce Brosnan plays an art thief and Rene Russo plays the investigator who is suppose to arrest him but her handcuffs are for different purposes. Their relationship lacks chemistry. Brosnan is always leaving his briefcase wherever he stops and Russo guzzles strange drinks. Directed by John McTiernan who under some strange miracle directed two stupid films this year. He is also the proud maker of the blood gutty The 13th Warrior as well. To his credit he displays skill in the film's warped conclusion. Denis Leary is cardboard as Russo's boss. Faye Dunaway appears from the original although her work here is merely a reminder that the original is much better. Not nearly as much plot as there is sex. The original examined the crime and how crafty the anti-hero is but here plot takes second fiddle to dumb sex scenes. Perhaps the film would make better material for sex education than a suspense caper. Score: 3 / 10",The Thomas Crown Affair
12,whpratt1,Brosnan & Russo Burn Up the Screen !,7,9 December 2003,"This film version of the ""Thomas Crown Affair"" was full of romance, passion and lots of guessing games.  Pierce Brosnan,(Thomas Crown),""Grey Owl"",'99 had lots of fun playing fantastic games with Rene Russo (Catherine Olds Banning), ""In The Line of Fire"",'93. Thomas Crown fell madly in love with Catherine, but kept her guessing and she did a lot of teasing for awhile and then the two of them burned up with passion and great desire.  Faye Dunaway(The Psychiatrist), "" Drunks"",'97, laughed herself to death with Tom Crown telling her his most intimate problems.   Ben Gazzara(Andrew Wallace), Crown's lawyer, tried to keep the police away from his hidden art treasure's.   Lots of depth in this film and plenty of HOT PASSION !",The Thomas Crown Affair
13,JamesHitchcock,Lacks the Original's Distinctive Style,6,1 September 2005,"As the original ""Thomas Crown Affair"" stood in roughly the same relationship to real-life crime as the James Bond films do to real-life espionage, the current 007 Pierce Brosnan was perhaps a natural choice to star as the new Thomas Crown. He brings to the role a similar combination of cool sophistication with a hint of toughness as Steve McQueen, the King of Cool, brought to the original. (I have always thought that McQueen would have made a great James Bond if the producers had ever felt they wanted an American in the role).The new film follows roughly the same plot as the 1968 version, with one or two minor variations. The setting is transferred from Boston to New York, and the millionaire tycoon Crown is British rather than American. The most significant change is that the robbery which Crown organises is not of money from a bank but rather of a priceless Monet painting from an art gallery. As in the original, he is pursued by an attractive female insurance company investigator with whom he becomes romantically and sexually entangled. As in the original, the trappings of Crown's millionaire lifestyle are much on display- his expensive cars, his exclusive New York residence (even more luxurious than was McQueen's), his private glider, his yacht. (In this version Crown is a yachtsman rather than a polo player, although he is still a golfer). Even the theme song ""The Windmills of Your Mind"" comes in at the end and Faye Dunaway makes a cameo appearance as Crown's psycho-analyst.Despite the similarities in plot, I felt that something was lacking compared with the original film. That film is one that you watch less for its plot than for its atmosphere of style and sophistication, the epitome of sixties cool. The remake never really captures this. To take an example, it dispenses with the famous game of chess during which McQueen is seduced by Faye Dunaway; instead the investigator (here called Catherine rather than Vicki) seduces Crown after they have been dancing together. To make a game as intellectual as chess sexy was quite an achievement on the part of the actors and director; it is much less of a challenge to do the same for dancing, an activity which has been described as the vertical expression of horizontal desires. The chess scene is memorable precisely because it is so unexpectedly erotic; the dancing scene is much more forgettable. The director John McTiernan dispenses with Norman Jewison's use of the split screen; that was probably the right decision, as that technique used today would probably have given the film a very dated feel, but McTiernan does not come up with anything equally distinctive to replace it. Pierce Brosnan is good as Crown, but I was less taken with Rene Russo's Catherine, who I felt (surprisingly for an actress who is a former model) lacked the sophisticated elegance of Faye Dunaway's Vicki.I make no apologies for comparing this film to the original version; film-makers who remake earlier movies are deliberately inviting such comparisons. It would be wrong to say that I disliked the newer version. In some respects it is superior to its predecessor; it has, for example, a more coherent plot. There are some humorous touches such as the scene where Catherine thinks she has recovered the missing painting, only to find that it is a fake painted over ""Monet's unknown masterpiece- Dogs at Cards"". There is also a neat twist at the end when Crown (helped by a number of accomplices, all identically dressed with bowler hats and briefcases) succeeds in replacing the painting on the walls of the gallery under the noses of Catherine and the police. Seen as a romance/comedy/thriller, the remake is not a bad film. It is, however, a routine one. The original was not a great film, but it was never routine. It had its own quite distinctive style and personality, something the remake lacks. 6/10",The Thomas Crown Affair
14,ksf-2,great art heist. good all around.,10,3 March 2020,"This updated 1999 version is SO much more fun and tight-knit than the original from 1968, which had Steve McQueen. Rene Russo is the insurance detective, hot on the trail of rich guy Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan). She's sure he has stolen the painting that has been snitched from the art museum, and she will do ANYTHING to trap him and catch him redhanded. SO much back and forth, with Denis Leary telling Catherine (Russo) that she's cheap for sleeping with the enemy, just to try to trap him. The story is tight... no plot holes, no wasted lines. Great stuff! Directed by John McTiernan. he only directed twelve films, and most of them were well done, successful, and big jackpots. Die Hard, Hunt for Red October. I HIGHLY recommend this one. so much better than the original version. GREAT music tracks from Nina Simone and Wasis Diop.",The Thomas Crown Affair
15,KineticSeoul,Maybe what would happen if James Bond retired,6,22 May 2015,"This is a film where I enjoyed the first half, but just didn't really get into it with the second half. I guess this is a film that most guys and girls can enjoy to a degree. Because there is something for both genders. There is that cool suave guy Thomas Crown played Pierce Brosnan doing what he does best, except he isn't a MI6 agent this time around. It's mostly what James Bond might do if he ever retired. So he is this rich and clever guy that lives on the edge, while attracting just about any women. And steals expensive art works during his spare time for the rush of it. And on his tail is this smart and articulate female detective who Crown has a bit of chemistry with. So the first half is this cat and mouse game with a bit of flare. Which I was really into, because the chemistry just seemed to work for the most part. Plus it was intriguing to watch the interactions between the two characters. But once the actual romance starts up with the rich guy just showing the woman a good time, it quickly becomes boring and started to drag in my opinion. Most women dream about turning a bad boy into a man that is just for her, especially if he is a handsome rich guy. And that is what this movie is, although I didn't really see why Crown would fall for the lead women in this movie. But I everyone has their preferences. So you want to watch a film about a topnotch classy Alpha male than this might be a film you might enjoy, for the first half anyways.6.5/10",The Thomas Crown Affair
16,gbill-74877,Uninspired,4,17 August 2019,"A nice heist at the beginning, but it quickly descends into a film that is too glossy and packaged to be anything other than fluff. Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo, and Denis Leary are all pretty tepid here, and there are many ways the script insults the intelligence of the viewer all the way up to the end. It was nice to see Russo get the part at age 45, or was it? Her character isn't that strong, and her sex scene with Brosnan is comically cliché and anything but erotic.

And the supreme pleasure of that thought was tinged with an element of doubt...""but what if she doesn't feel the same way""?Take the first stirrings of love and blend it with a smoothness. Smooth like smooth jazz. Like a warm brandy. Smooth like a ballad sung by Sting. ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" is smooth.This is my favorite film by Rene Russo. She is so smart and so stunning. She could easily be the object of an artist's affections, right? Remington Steele. Bond, James Bond. In ""Thomas Crown"". Pierce Brosnan gets the role where he is his smoothest. No sharp edges. Collected even when not cool. Like a muted trumpet. Like a Modigliani. They play the game of confidence, where the artist promises to trust the pigeon. Not since ""Double Indemnity"" has the business of insurance been this sexy. There are other worthy performances here, but this is a pas de deux, aided by some wonderful writing.The final sequences are clever, captivating, perhaps confusing in the best way, but then....smooth.Why compare this film to the original?

21,Anonymous_Maxine,"In The Thomas Crown Affair, Pierce Brosnan portrays some weird variation of the James Bond character that he has become known as, and the film succeeds (although vicariously so) in that sense, but fails with",7,12 November 2000,"SPOILER ALERT This movie had a great beginning, a great ending, and a lot of c**p in between. By `great ending,' by the way, I am referring to the bowler hat scene in which Mr. Crown (Pierce Brosnan) returns to the museum to replace the painting. The closing scene in this film, in which Catherine Banning whispers into Thomas Crown's ear, is one of the most ridiculous closing lines I have heard in a movie in years.Pierce Brosnan plays Thomas Crown, a tremendously wealthy businessman who steals tremendously valuable paintings from high security museums to add to his eccentric collection. One of the best things about this movie is that Brosnan plays the part so well. He just LOOKS rich. He could never play the part of a poor man.  When an investigation follows his acquisition of a $100 million dollar painting, one of the more prominent investigators (Russo) tries seduction in order to get Crown to admit something, and ends up falling for him. While I am generally against more elderly actors having rough sex and acting like teenagers in movies, I was able to tolerate it here because at least they were approximately the same age, right? It would have ruined the movie if the part of Catherine Banning had been played by a young actress like Denise Richards (the latest and worst `Bond girl').Anyway, after the highly entertaining scene at the opening of the film in which Crown acquires the painting, you get about an hour and a half of an almost boring criminal investigation mixed with a horribly unlikely love story. Banning finds what she is looking for very early on, but she still decides to just sleep with Thomas Crown for a while longer until she eventually falls for him. However, despite the load of garbage that is sandwiched in the middle of this movie, and the fact that even with the big names it was unable to live up to the original, The Thomas Crown Affair is a quality film. It takes an unlikely story and makes it into a fairly well thought out movie, even though it did resort numerous times to excessive nudity to pull it along. Renee Russo looked surprisingly good for her age, it's just that so much of the nudity in the sex scenes (and on the dance floor, for that matter) was obviously thrown in just to get a reaction. Yes! Renee Russo does get naked in this movie! But who cares? Russo AND Brosnan got naked, but it was all just a gimmick. It's just to get more people to watch the movie. That disappoints me, but I still enjoyed the movie, and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in a good action/drama.or just interested in seeing high priced Hollywood actors take off their clothes.",The Thomas Crown Affair

Barely bearable.",6,2 February 2020,"Best suited for fans of romantic comedies, because this movie is almost entirely about the romance between Pierce Brosnan (thief) and Renee Russo (cop).But will love last? That's one cliffhanger. The other cliffhanger is IF Pierce Brosnan will be arrested for being a thief.The good: acting is ok. A bit slick, but ok. The actual heist plots are very good, smart and enjoyable. There is also a long hot romance for those who like that sort of stuff. I didnt. Which brings me to the bad...The bad: the plot is pretty ridiculous at moments. Especially the part of Renee Russo as an insurance cop is NOWHERE near believable, which essentially spoiled the rest of the movie for me. There is more wrong:the romance between the 2 lovebirds happens right from the start. So there is no real long foreplay, which makes the romance quite boring. And there is basically nothing else but a romance to be seen in this movie.Therefore only suited for romantic comedy fans. NOT recommended to those who like cool heist movies.

23,dfranzen70,Looking to hibernate? Try this film!,5,15 January 2000,"Far be it from me to come down hard on an actor like Pierce Brosnan, who has made a career out of being suave and debonair, but that kind of characterization really can only carry an actor so far. This remake of the 1968 film that starred Steve McQueen is about a multigabillionaire investment banker who happens to be an art thief.  Well, he's struck again, and it's up to the luscious Rene Russo (as an insurance investigator) to catch the thief.Similarities to the more recent Entrapment abound - in that one, Sean Connery was the suave rich fella with an eye for art, and Catherine Zeta-Jones was the sexy insurance investigator. The problem with that film might have been the romance between Zeta-Jones and Connery, who easily is old enough to be her grandfather. In this film, the two characters appear to rather close in age, so at least that quibble doesn't exist.
So let's see what we have. We know right from the beginning that Crown has stolen yet another priceless work of art, so that bit of suspense is gone. And we know that our friendly neighborhood insurance investigator (did you know they can be sexy, too? Who knew?) will nab him not by catching him in the act but by - ahem - pretending to fall for him so she can learn his methods and turn him in as an insider. When you know your 'good guy' is willing to risk it all to get her man, you know her credibility is shot. The chances of her keeping her head above water and not falling for him are incredibly slim, and we know that as the movie progresses we'll see Crown as less of a thief and more of a victim. Ho-hum.Now that I've blasted the script, let's look at the actors' work. Brosnan plays Crown pretty much the way you'd expect him to - aloof, cunning, intelligent - kind of like a James Bond Lite. He doesn't bring a whole lot of excitement to the role, other than the fact that he's Pierce Brosnan. As far as Russo goes - well, she did several inexplicable gratuitous nude (topless, anyway) scenes in this film. Now, sometimes gratuitous nudity is okay in my book - it can distract you from an otherwise dull film. But it seems to me the only reason Russo - an accomplished actress - would consent to showing her breasts is to demonstrate she's not bad-looking ... for a woman in her forties. Other than for vanity reasons, there's no reason in the world for her to get naked. (And for what it's worth, I kind of wish Catherine Zeta-Jones had done the same in Entrapment!)For me, this movie wasn't even good as escapist fare. Quite frankly, a suspense movie with no suspense has little going for it, although the lush production locations did ease the boredom a little.",The Thomas Crown Affair
24,MBunge,It's really the Catherine Banning Affair,4,16 December 2010,"The Thomas Crown Affair is like a jigsaw puzzle with the wrong pieces put together in the wrong order. If you stare at it hard, you can almost make out what it was supposed to be. What is actually is, however, looks quite different.A remake of a Steve McQueen film, it begins with a rich, New York City financier named Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan). He's the sort of man who has it all and still isn't fulfilled. He makes bad bets and takes costly risks to bring some meaning and sparkle to his existence. Now, that drive has led him to steal a 100 million dollar Monet painting from a museum. That brings high society insurance investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) into the picture. She instantly fixes on Crown as a suspect, despite a complete lack of evidence, and the two of them begin playing a game a cat and mouse. Banning tries to seduce Crown to get at the painting, but he ends up more than seducing her. She falls in love with the isolated mystery man and has to decide if love is enough or if she also needs to trust him. Along for the ride are Crown's psychiatrist (Faye Dunaway), who appears to exist in the story just to give Faye Dunaway some screen time, and police detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary). McCann is the straight man to the supposedly sophisticated manipulations of Crown and Banning. He's also the most likable character in the movie and when you find yourself rooting more for a minor supporting character than for either of the leads, that's the mark of a film that's gone plain wrong.There are so many things about The Thomas Crown Affair that don't work. To start with the structure is terrible. It opens up with, I kid you not, a 20 minute long museum robbery where Crown is involved for less than a minute. Which means the first 19 minutes of the film are about characters and actions that have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Nothing that happens in those first 19 minutes have anything to do with anything else that happens. Then after the theft, Catherine Banning finally comes on screen and within another 10 minutes, she becomes the main character in the story. After initially alluding to Crown's problems and complexities, he quickly becomes second banana to Banning's dilemma of love and trust. Instead of being about what happens to Crown, or even what happens to Crown and Banning, the movie becomes entirely about what happens to Banning. To recap, the film is called The Thomas Crown Affair. It spends 19 of its first 20 minutes focusing on everyone except Thomas Crown. Then after another 10 minutes, it should really be retitled The Catherine Banning Affair.The pacing of the film is also horrid. The big heist at the start is almost 4 times longer than the big event at the end of movie. There's a long montage of Crown and Banning flying a glider followed almost immediately by a another montage of them driving along an island road. A scene where Banning suspects Crown has brought the stolen Monet along with them to the island ends almost before it begins. I'm not sure what director John McTiernan was trying to do with this movie but whatever it was, it didn't work.The soundtrack is also incredibly annoying. Almost every scene is accompanied by this loud, insistent instrumental music that sounds like something from the 1970s that's been digitally remastered. It's almost as though the music is meant to beat you into submission so you don't notice everything else that's wrong.What fatally wounds The Thomas Crown Affair is that both Crown and Banning are unlikable, self-centered jackasses. These two wealthy, arrogant, narcissists are utterly unsympathetic, something only highlighted by the working man appeal of Denis Leary as Detective McCann. Crown and Banning are the sort of puffed up elites that should be deflated by the ordinary McCann. Instead, McCann is just a bystanding stooge watching his betters interact.Rene Russo look really bad for the first part of this movie, as well. Banning has supposedly flown in from Europe to investigate the museum theft, so she's decked out in the Paris-runway type fashions and is adorned with a very pronounced make-up job. I would guess she's supposed to look high class but the clothes make her look stiff and the make up in harsh and garish, making Catherine Banning look frighteningly like a drag queen impersonating Rene Russo. It's only later in the movie when that crap is stripped away that Russo's beauty has a chance to shine.I haven't seen the original Thomas Crown Affair, so I don't know if this is a bad remake of a bad film or a bad remake of a good film. I don't know if it's bad because it stuck to close to the original movie or because it tried to be too different. All I know is, this thing is pretty bad. Unless you're desperately to see Russo topless, don't bother with The Thomas Crown Affair.",The Thomas Crown Affair
25,smatysia,Rene Russo makes this film,8,17 September 1999,"Rene Russo makes this film. She is gorgeous. She is a goddess. Brosnan can't be topped at playing aloof, but when his character needs more range, he doesn't deliver. Dennis Leary does a creditable job in a non-comedic role. I haven't seen the original, so cannot comment on the McQueen-Dunaway chemistry. All in all, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit in spite of its flaws.",The Thomas Crown Affair
26,smatysia,A good modern caper film,8,4 January 2002,"A really good caper flick. I thought the chemistry between Brosnan and Russo was excellent, unlike some previous reviewers. The intricate plots that unfolded in the museum never failed to hold my interest. I confess, I haven't seen the 1968 original film, so I can make no comparisons. Fay Dunaway's part was somewhat superfluous, but it seems to be a recent fad for remakes to pay homage to originals by casting the original principals into minor roles in the remake. (Such as the remake of Cape Fear with Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum in small parts.) Rene Russo was beautiful and charismatic in this film, but I haven't heard anything from her since. Denis Leary turned in a solid performance also. The direction was a little distracting a few times, but not enough to hurt the film. Grade: A-",The Thomas Crown Affair
27,MissSimonetta,Why do I prefer the original? It's all in the ending,7,3 June 2019,"As far as needless remakes go, you can do much worse than the 1999 version of THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, I guess. There's nothing in it that made me cringe. The performances are pretty good and the production values are nice, However, it feels like such a generic romantic crime thriller in comparison to the older one.I think the single biggest reason I prefer the original movie to this one is the difference between the two endings. The original movie ends with Steve McQueen and Fay Dunaway unable to get together in the end. He chooses the empty thrill over her. The last few shots, with Dunaway looking up to the sky relieved and broken-hearted all at once, and McQueen listlessly staring out the window of his getaway plane, have stayed with me.The happy ending here just rings so hollow and is far less believable. The 1968 original is made the classic it is by its sad ending-- it's not the style, which is dated to the late 1960s, nor even the heists themselves. It's the fact that McQueen's character can never have what he's really looking for, despite all his power and money.But here? Nope! You can have it all. And that's a far more predictable finish than the haunting original.",The Thomas Crown Affair
28,noralee,Bang-Up Fun Fresh Re-Make,9,21 December 2005,"Hooray for Hollywood! The world may be falling apart so like we needed money spent on a remake of ""The Thomas Crown Affair."" But then heck if Tinseltown in all its unoriginality doesn't do a bang-up fun job of unreality with characters who have no place in the Unreel World, from the classy looking opening credits to Sting covering ""Windmills of my Mind"" over the closing credits. In the opening scene I'm thinking, wait I know that woman's voice and voila it's Faye Dunaway from the original film as Crown's shrink - I cheered out loud (OK so I was the only one in the audience that got the joke).Pierce Brosnan and Renee Russo are an age-appropriate couple with genuine fireworks and chemistry (with help from director John McTiernan and editor John Wright in the tango and copulation scenes).There's unconventionally good music choices - that tango is from Three Penny Opera of all things and a terrific use of Nina Simone's ""Sinner Man"" in a marvelous Magritte-inspired ironically tense heist scene. Brosnan's trainer gets a credit, as there's plenty of skin. Russo laughs, a gorgeous belly laugh, unlike so many frozen femmes fatale.The credits also say that no museum was used as a locale, so gosh they really recreated the Met amazingly accurately (and how much did that cost?), though it didn't seem crowded enough Crown goes in at 9 when the museum doesn't open until 11.I would think this is a great date movie.

If you ask me, Thomas (Pierce Brosnan) and Catherine (Rene Russo) made a cute couple. As far as I could see, they looked really good in the attire they wore to the ball. I just don't understand why he wanted to rip off a piece of artwork, though. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this project did an excellent job. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend excellent action movie with a little romance thrown in that has excellent performances to all you Pierce Brosnan or Rene Russo fans who haven't seen it.

31,davidmvining,"Solid, adult fun",7,25 May 2020,"This movie is at its most entertaining when people are stealing things, art in particular. It's the story of a rich man who's always in search of thrills and decides to steal one of the most valuable pieces of art on display at the Met. He's fabulously wealthy and doesn't need the money, but we could believe that he wants to keep it hidden behind a print of The Son of Man by Rene Magritte just as a private joke. The only problem with the film is when it asks us to emotionally involve ourselves in the lives of these people. They're too cynical and detached from real life for that sort of investment.The movie fires on all cylinders at the start and the end when we watch the two heists. The first gets laid out in exact detail with Thomas Crown, rich financier, going about his day making big deals and stopping by the Met to look at ""his haystacks"" by Van Gogh, a team of thieves sneaking into the Met through a hollow horse statue, getting into the room with the Monet, ""San Giorgio Maggiore at dusk"", setting off all the alarms and giving Crown a way to quickly move in, grab the Monet off the wall, and throw it into his briefcase before simply walking out. Combined with the witty and fun score by Bill Conti, this first twenty minutes of The Thomas Crown Affair is the movie at it's most effortless and fun.That's not really to say that the rest isn't fun, it's just different. In comes Rene Russo's Catherine Banning, an insurance investigator who is out to save some Swiss men a one hundred million dollar check. She quickly zeroes in on Crown, and while she doesn't have the kind of hard evidence that would allow Michael McGann, Denis Leary's police detective, to actually do anything, she isn't limited by warrants. She just needs to recover the painting, and in by being matched with Crown, the two have found the perfect match for each other.They're both thrill seekers and both know exactly what the other is about. She knows that he stole the painting, and he knows that she's out to find the painting. He keeps her close because of the excitement and she reveals herself for the same reason. What follows is a game of cat and mouse that I felt was never about genuine emotion. It was always about using the other person to get what the other wanted, and when, late in the film, we see that Catherine had developed real feelings for Thomas, I didn't really buy it. I suppose it was the depth of feeling implied by the sudden weepy turn by Russo, but it just didn't feel like it fit the film. The Thomas Crown Affair isn't about deep emotion, but thin fun.The movie ends with its second heist, the effort to put the Monet back, and the manner in which it plays out is fun, calling back to the film's opening, with a wonderful, if a bit outside the realm of believable, resolution. And, of course, the deep emotions get paid off through another couple of twisty turns.I think if the film had managed to keep its eye on the fun angle more closely without falling into an emotional pit it didn't really earn, this could have been a more clear-cut thin romp at the movies. Brosnan and Russo are fun as the leads. Leary is understated and effective as the police detective who's sometimes a step behind on the plot but always clear-eyed when it comes to Catherine. Bill Conti's music is delectably amusing, and John McTiernan's direction is assured and confident. It's a solid time at the movies.",The Thomas Crown Affair
32,onepotato2,wonderful,7,5 November 2007,"As this movie started I had built-in resistance to the movies premise as little more than the costly diversions of the bored, idle rich. And the movie is certainly guilty of countless crimes against audiences by the time it becomes a much, much better film. Every fifteen minutes or so, a truly interesting, intelligent development occurs. And startling payoffs, that have nothing to do with explosions or screen-writing cop-outs, begin arriving in the 2nd half: The smirk of recognition from the forger. The double meaning of the hotty that Thomas is hanging around with. The ""returning the painting"" sequence made my mouth hang open completely. How may times does a concluding sequence leave you joyous, smiling, and your hair standing on end?But I still had reservations about the movie. I still resented that Russo had to, as women generally do, cave in the end.How satisfying then to discover on the 2nd viewing that all of Thomas's rejoinders are smartly phrased to provide ambiguous double-meanings, which I missed the first time. The first viewing suggests he is master of all he commands. But upon the 2nd viewing, a new layer of meaning emerges. In every interaction with Russo he tests her to see if she's on board, via the neutral voice. Rather than establishing his superiority, he is trying to yield to her but can't play his hand, and is forced to use neutral language to feel her out. Seen this way, he yields long before she does. What an intelligent film.Small problems: I hate the insipid dance scene. The sex is gratuitous for a movie this intelligent, and it's a crying shame about all those conspicuous Pepsi One, Lucent product placements. Save those for shitty movies please. Russo's irritating witch-cackle is also hard to forgive.",The Thomas Crown Affair
33,PredragReviews,"So it's not high art, but...",7,12 May 2016,"The performances given by Mr. James Bond himself, Pierce Brosnan and by Rene Russo were perfect for this movie. The plot of the original movie has been given a total makeover. Whereas in the original 1968 version, Steve McQueen organized a $2 million bank robbery, in a very 60's blow against the system, Brosnan pulls off an art robbery single handed, walking out a museum with a Monet painting worth fifty times the amount. However, the essence of the original movie has been retained, and revolves around a tough-nosed female insurance investigator conducting an ambiguous love affair (Rene Russo) with millionaire playboy Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan), whilst at the same time trying to trap her seemingly uncatchable quarry.The script by Kurt Wimmer and Leslie Dixon is very good and there is really never a boring part in it. The script develops the characters well and the heist scene in the art museum was really well done. The photography is great so is the jazzy music from Composer Bill Conti. Oh you can't forget the small but funny role by Faye Dunaway who was in the original. Rent this or do what ever to see it. because it has great chemistry between Brosnan and Russo and what is really great is that they are about the same age. But what is the stand out i think is John McTiernan who shows that he can direct other films than just action.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",The Thomas Crown Affair
34,philip_vanderveken,Too bad that the start wasn't better.,7,16 February 2005,"After seeing ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" I had a double feeling about the movie. The beginning of the movie wasn't really good and most of all very predictable, but in the end it all got a bit better and more interesting to watch.A few Eastern European guys try to rob a museum and get in by copying the idea of the Trojan Horse (I guess everybody knows the ancient Greek legend, but for those who don't: they are smuggled inside the museum in the belly of a gigantic statue of a horse). They do some special burglar stuff, cut some wires, get to the paintings,... but than something goes wrong and they are caught by the police. But even though they were caught, one painting is missing. Of course the police immediately starts an investigation and a mysterious lady, Catherine Olds Banning, suddenly appears. She works for some Swiss insurers and she will monitor the case closely and try to find the thief, because her employers aren't very eager to pay. She soon finds a suspect, Thomas Crown. Thomas Crown is a multi-millionaire and successful playboy with a rare hobby: stealing expensive works of art. He finds himself much too clever for the police, but he is eager to participate in the cat-and-mouse game that Banning, in which he sees a worthy adversary, wants to play with him...My main problem with the movie was the predictability, especially in the beginning. Of course she will do anything to catch him and ignore the rules made up by the police. Of course he'll show off with all his richness and seduce her. Of course she will fall in love with him. I can't really say that such a script is very original or even very clever. It has been done so many times before and will be done even more in the future. However, that doesn't mean that the movie didn't have any clever parts. For instance the part where he wants to return the painting and uses a painting by René Magritte, a Belgian surrealist painter, as a source of inspiration is absolutely brilliant.What I also liked was the fact that Pierce Brosnan was casted as the classy, elegant and sophisticated millionaire / playboy. He really played that role very well. The other characters however weren't all that excellent. I wasn't really blown away by the performances of Denis Leary, Rene Russo or Frankie Faison. They stood in Brosnan's shadow from the beginning and never were able to get out of it. In the end this was a quite good, entertaining and fast-paced movie, but far from a masterpiece. It had too many plot holes (for example where does Catherine Olds Banning, immediately after the robbery come from when nobody told her what happened or asked her to come to the museum? She just shows up.) and the acting wasn't always excellent. I give it a 6.5/10, but certainly nothing more than that.",The Thomas Crown Affair
35,Luigi Di Pilla,An entertaining romance thriller,6,9 May 2002,It was a good cat and movie. Some twists seems to be unrealistic but who cares it works anyway because all is possible in a Hollywood film. The main actors played very well and Rene Russo was sexy. I think the sound track could have been better and would have given perhaps another touch to the story. I gave 6/10.,The Thomas Crown Affair
36,PatrynXX,"Good movie, weak ending",7,2 February 2000,"I liked this movie, maybe I'm biased for Brosnan, but I thought it interesting.  Plus the fact a fortysomething Rene Russo bothered to do a rather sexual scene (which is a rarety since a lot of movies go for that, oh so young look).  It had a depth of reality to it.  However comparing this movie with Entrapment, I'm likely to like Entrapment more.  Simply because Catherine Zeta Jones worked so well with Sean Connery, than Rene Russo to Pierce Brosnan.I also didn't think the ending to TTCA was strong enough.  (spoiler below)

37,baumer,"Interesting at times, slow in others",7,11 August 1999,"Warning, may be some tiny spoilers:What I've always liked about films like this is that you can have fun with the wealth that is on screen.  The kind of wealth that is reserved for the likes of Bill Gates or Donald Trump, yet they lack what Mr. Crown has, the looks and the cahrm to be a true playboy.  How many of us would love to have an infinite supply of money to go around so that we can wreck a boat if we feel like it just because we enjoy the thrill of the ride?  It is small moments like this that are fun.  Most of us will never know what it is like to make 30 million dollars in one business acquisition or what it is like to be chauffered around in a Mercedes and then flying off to some exotic island and spend the night at your own private beach house with a beautiful naked woman.  So living vicariously through the characters in this movie is half the fun.  And fun the movie is.  It is not a great movie but it is not boring either.Thomas Crown is a wealthy finance guy in the business world and he also collects fine art.  When he sees his opportunity to steal one of the most expensive pieces at the local art museum, he jumps all over it.  His plan is rather brilliant as well.  But then we meet Catherine ( Russo ).  She is hired by the firm that insures the painting to do a little investigating before they decide to shell out 100 million dollars.  And it is here that the movie fails.  Not so much that it is Russo playing the part, but how the part is written.  The character here is a little too head strong and she is a little too confident and she figures things out a little too quickly and she has all the answers a little too quickly.  That is my big problem with film.  I found that Russo's character to be not believable and seeing as she is one of the two major characters in the film, that possesses a problem. When you can't like one of your stars then the rest of the film has a damper put on it.  There are also a few scenes that I found to be much to silly for the Thomas Crown character.  Some of what he does is just plain dumb and even though you get to understand that he likes a challenge more than anything in life, I just don't buy the fact that he would reveal some of the things that he does.  Also a complete waste in here was the Faye Dunaway character.  Her role is useless and it feels like they just put it into the film so they could have an original actor from the first film.But what is fun is some of the cat and mouse that ensues.  Catherine is so sure that Crown has the painting that she becomes obsessed with finding out, and in the process she jeapordizes her career, not that you would know that judging by her carefree attitude.  Some of what she does in here she would never get away with in real life.  All in all, the film had a good beginning, a terrific end but the middle was lacking.  It was sometimes boring and slow.  But it still worth seeing.  And the final conclusion of how he gets himself out of or into more trouble is really quite smartly written.  See this film during a matinee and try to enjoy it for what it is, and that is a look into a life that none of us will probably ever have.  But it sure is fun to pretend.",The Thomas Crown Affair

I think that Russo and Brosnan's chemistry is what makes it a much better movie as much as I love most of McQueen's movies (I've not seen many Dunaway movies).There is a little superfluous action with the boat scene that easily could have been cut.It's a fun movie with great skits and very much worth your time.",The Thomas Crown Affair
39,classicalsteve,Enjoyable Chick-Flick But Pales to the Original of 1968: McQueen vs Brosnan is an unfair match,7,19 November 2010,"Sometimes the actor makes the movie, and such was the case with the original Thomas Crown Affair of 1968. Steve McQueen was and may still be the unrivaled king of the enigmatic male persona on film. In the original I doubt if McQueen said 15 lines; probably closer to 9 which is what made the original so compelling. You never quite get a sense of who McQueen is, even at the very end. This 1999 remake is certainly enjoyable but I don't know if I was quite sold on the idea of Brosnan as Thomas Crown. Crown is supposed to have both the extra-sensory intelligence and the amoral sensibility to pull off heists in ways which make the Gardner Heist of 1990 seem like it was pulled off by drug-store shoplifters. McQueen in 1968 definitely did. Did Brosnan? Maybe not quite. Despite Brosnan, the ending here is much softer than the original, although there is a kind of ""bait and switch"" which does work very well and saves the movie.The initial heist is a brilliant piece of workmanship, somewhat akin to the original movie in which the team of perpetrators are all unknown to each other. A famous Monet is stolen from the NY Metropolitan Museum, and the real mystery is how easily the theft was enacted like a 2-year old stealing a cookie from the cookie jar. Alas, we should remember this is a movie after-all. We know pretty early that Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) ended up with the cookie--a $100 million dollar cookie. (Earlier in the scene, some grade schoolers are being shown the painting by their school teacher who can't get them interested until she reveals to them how much it's worth. Somehow very American as the price of something is even more intriguing than the thing itself.) Rene Russo is the art investigator, essentially the equivalent character from the original played by Faye Dunaway, although here she's Catherine instead of Vicky. (Faye Dunaway plays a small part as Crown's nameless psychiatrist.) Russo decides before they've even gotten all the fingerprints that Brosnan is ultimately responsible for the absent Monet by looking at some art auction records and seeing him attempt a death-defying feat at sea. This quick deduction seemed forced as if the script wants to get to the affair as quickly as possible, and I wasn't quite buying into it. Maybe I wanted her to investigate a little more slowly than jumping to a conclusion, like most art investigators. The ""affair"" begins with Russo and Brosnan engaging in a relationship in which Russo can't decide whether she's pursuing the painting and its thief or pursuing a relationship, which is the same quandary of the original film.As stated earlier, buying into Pierce Brosnan in the role of Crown was a little problematic. He comes off as too much ""Mr Nice Guy"" to really believe he enacts such a selfish crime. For that matter, he's supposed to be a ruthless financial businessman, buying stock options and other securities for millions less than other competitive buyers. He almost seems too polite and well-mannered to believe he's simply a better-looking Donald Trump type. McQueen for some reason hit it on the money as a kind of well-dressed cookie monster in which millions of dollars are the chocolate chips. Brosnan seems more akin to someone running for student body president, someone who would never dream of getting into the cookie jar without permission. One aspect which makes the original different from the remake is that there is more revealed about the thieves and how they met with their ""employer"". Hardly any reference is made about about the theft itself once the ""affair"" gets going.Despite some of its shortcomings, particularly overlong love sequences, replete with lush melodic saxophones, the remake of the Thomas Crown Affair is still largely enjoyable. The twist at the end is quite interesting, and some pieces of the puzzle fall into place. It's good escapist fun, certainly not a masterpiece by any stretch. If you have the option of having an affair versus killing two hours watching this movie, I think you know which one will probably taste better. In several years, I will probably see the original Thomas Crown Affair again. Will I see the remake? Well, don't bet your chocolate chips on it.",The Thomas Crown Affair
40,CitizenCaine,"Slick, Glossy Caper Film",7,14 November 2003,"The film stars the perfectly cast, suave Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo as counterparts to each other in this high class, glossy, slick art theft film. It's also a remake of the 1968 film starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway, who appears here as Brosnan's therapist in cameo scenes. There are a number of supporting actors, such as Ben Gazzara, but this is essentially a two person film. The film opens with a fantastic heist scenario and ends with an even cleverer heist. In between, the film alternates between a battle of wits and a romance. The battle of wits is interesting, but the romance is not always entirely believable. The jazzy soundtrack and location shooting add a lot to the enjoyment of the film. There's comedy, romance, and thrills to be had. However, the film would have been even better with a strong third lead as a police investigator that tracks both of them. More surprises, twists, and turns would have been available for the writer to explore. Perhaps that would provide too much intellectual busyness. In most of these art caper films it's the relationship between the characters that gives the films their specialness: To Catch A Thief and How To Steal A Million among them. An enjoyable film, especially good as a date film perhaps, but a better caper film came out in 1999: Entrapment. *** of 4 stars.",The Thomas Crown Affair
41,jhclues,Plenty Of Sparks Between Brosnan And Russo,9,18 September 2000,"A wealthy businessman with an eye for art meets his match in the clever and romantic, suspenseful, `The Thomas Crown Affair,' directed by John McTiernan.  Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) stages an intricately planned heist of an art museum, and successfully makes off with a Monet worth millions.  Enter the insurance investigator, the crafty Catherine Banning (Rene Russo), and the game is on.  While detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary) follows the bread-crumb trail left for him by Crown, Banning sees through it immediately, and zeros in on Crown from the beginning.  But how to nail him?  Therein lies the heart of the story, as Banning goes right to it.  She tells Crown that she knows he did it; Crown responds by taking her to dinner, then proceeds to court her, without ever admitting or denying her allegations.  Then it's head to head, as they each vie for the pole position, and the sparks begin to fly. 	McTiernan shows some style here as he leads his stars through their interlude of discovery.  He wisely avoids any showy displays and lets the tightly wound suspense of the story play out through the charismatic performances of Brosnan and Russo.  Brosnan fits the part of Crown perfectly; there are shades of Bond, perhaps, and even a bit of `Remington Steele here,' but he makes Crown his own man, a separate entity which he plays with aplomb.  Russo has never been better, nor looked better, and makes Banning a force to be reckoned with; there's a worldly sophistication to her, an intelligent confidence that lets you know there's something always cooking beneath the surface.  The chemistry between the two sizzles, and how refreshing it is to see romance develop between two mature adults, as opposed to the more prevalent screen pairings Hollywood usually has to offer (Connery and Zeta-Jones in `Entrapment,' for example); it lends credibility to the story and makes the proceedings all that more interesting.  There's some memorable scenes here, especially the initial caper, when Crown purloins the Monet, and later on, the `bowler-hat' sequence that takes place in the museum.  In something of an homage to the original 1968 `Crown,' Banning is taken aloft by Crown in his glider, which proves to be visually stunning, and adds a placid moment that fits in well with the overall film. 	The supporting cast includes Faye Dunaway (Crown's psychiatrist), Ben Gazzara (Andrew), Frankie Faison (Detective Paretti), Fritz Weaver (John) and Charles Keating (Friedrich).  McTiernan has fashioned a romantic caper that is satisfying to both the eye and the mind; and with an imaginative plot and the performances of Brosnan and Russo, `The Thomas Crown Affair' is a success on all fronts.  Compared, especially, to many of the contemporary movies that purport romance and suspense, this one is the real deal.  It's like a breath of fresh air that's risen above the prevailing smog of mediocrity.  If you're looking for quality, and a film that delivers on it's promise, you've come to the right place.

42,Stampsfightclub,A tense romantic thriller,7,7 September 2006,"Reading the summary of the film I was lead to believe this 1999 hit maybe questionable but thankfully after a while I was proved wrong.Pierce Brosnan (Goldeneye, Tomorrow Never dies) stars as Thomas Crown who is a rich painting loving snob who steals and deals paintings for a living. British agent Rene Russo (Get Shorty) is brought in to investigate the mysterious millionaire. Up until the point where Rene was introduced I was lead to believe that this film would be overly predictable and outright boring. The first half an hour or so is extremely dull. Brosnan's character is poor with no personality (not much of a change but still...) and the story is terribly poor.If you want a terrible action scene watch when his agents are underground turning off the alarm systems with atrocious music juxtaposed with bad filming was making me cry for help. It was very conventional and uninteresting and made me want to turn off but I kept at it and thankfully I did because the film remembered it had a purpose, to engage the audience through uses and gratification: Rene Russo.A fantastic performance as she performed brilliantly and steal the show from Brosnan. Her actions are outstanding as she learns throughout the film about her feelings in different frustrating situations as she tries to cope with her job and personal issues. Her likable flirtatious character is always under pressure and is extremely enjoyable.Brosnan to his credit performs acceptably. But he always chooses a character with a boring personality e.g. James Bond, Stu from Mrs Doubtfire and its hard to accept him as a good actor if he continues these types of performances.Apart from the beginning the plot is exciting and tense with many twists and turns at the end.This remake of the infamous 1968 film brings charm and excitement to the romantic thriller genre with an exciting plot but with inconsistent acting there is always a question of verisimilitude.If you enjoy tension and an amazing love relationship then I defiantly recommend this film",The Thomas Crown Affair
43,gbheron,"Slick, but Lacking Depth",7,9 June 2002,"Having not seen the original, I can't make that comparison. But by itself, the 1999 version of ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" is pretty slick, high-gloss stuff. Clever, witty story and dialogue, with Pierce Brosnan right on target as a rich, high-rolling businessman turned art thief. Rene Russo is hot, hot, hot, as the insurance investigator out to catch him. With all this though, the movie seemed like the cinematic equivalent of Chinese food; a half-hour later you're hungry again. Or in this case can't quite remember what you just saw. I keep getting this movie mixed up with the other recent caper flick with Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones that suffers from a similar problem. Lack of depth sufficient to raise the movie from the category of just a decent popcorn rental. And that's all it is.  I grade it B-.",The Thomas Crown Affair
44,carbuff,OK remake of OK movie.,7,11 May 2015,"It's been a long time since I saw the original, and, as far as a I remember it, this remake is about as good. It is different, but very much along the lines of the original. It's heresy to say this, but the ""King of Cool"", while being a charismatic movie star, wasn't a very convincing actor--to be honest, mostly a lot of squinting, scowling, and strutting mixed in with some open-faced innocence. McQueen had excellent taste in machinery though, which was reflected in many of his films and, as homage, is repeated here. This production has very high production values, but I thought Pierce Brosnan was way too smug and smarmy and not very likable, Rene Russo came off as a bit creepy, and the plot wasn't smooth and kind of stuttered along. Still it was OK and not a terrible waste of time or anything like that, and, as referenced earlier, being a remake of a Steve McQueen star vehicle, it had some nice stuff in it--a Bentley, racing day- sailing catamarans, a few other hot cars, and a sailplane. So, pretty much average movie, not bad, but not great either.",The Thomas Crown Affair

46,bopdog,Great affirmation for us 40-somethings!,10,16 August 1999,"It was a bit of a surprise to see this flick and realize how bizarrely YOUNG most movie and TV romance and sex has become. Either that, or OLD I've become! As a 40-Something myself, attending grad school at a U.C. campus and thus surrounded by 20,000 19-22 year olds 24/7, I was comforted and gratified to see a movie that shamelessly portrays hot and desirable physical play and romance between to real life 40-Something actors. Yaay for us! And yaay to Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo. Further, the movie was also a finely tuned, exciting ""caper flick."" Sure, it may be implausible that a multi-jillionaire would swipe art; the ins and outs of the thefts are also a touch ""over the top,"" but dang it, it's a MOVIE! If it was exactly like real life, I could stay home and watch myself. As it is, the whole thing was meticulously planned and executed-- a nice, satisfying work of art. It was exciting, playful-- very entertaining! And very nice for the pre-Viagra-but-paying attention-to-it-just-in-case-for-later crowd. I suspect that anyone of ANY age, even my 20-Something students and colleagues would also find it great fun. I rated this one a solid ""10.""",The Thomas Crown Affair
47,Movie-12,"Stylish with charm and allure, but does inhabit several flaws. *** out of ****.",7,13 March 2000,"THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR / (1999) ***Starring: Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo, Denis Leary, Frankie Faison, Fritz Weaver, and Faye Dunaway Directed by John McTiernan. Written by Leslie Dixon and Kurt Wimmer. Running time: 113 minutes. Rated R (for sexuality, nudity, and some language).	""The Thomas Crown Affair"" is a production of clever writing and sly, unconventional twists, with a sneaky and lightweight plot. It begins on a positive note through style, high stakes and crucial events, and concludes with some of the same kind of material. The only flaws in the production are a lot of flat dialogue, a slow moving, non-progressive second act, and unnecessary scenes that only distract us from the true theme of action. If not for these problems, we would have had one heck of a mystery thriller that may have played with our minds like a curious cat with a spool of string. 	The movie begins with a rich sense of visual action and enticement. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is the setting, where a filthy rich individual named Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) burglarizes the building of a Monet worth over one hundred million dollars. Within this first rate setup, the producers grant us several twists and turns, unexpected occurrences, but little character development. The official assigned to this complicated case is Michael McCann (Denis Leary), who teams up with an insurance investigator named Catherine Banning (Rene Russo). When Catherine meets Thomas at a banquette, her skepticism arises about this man, who has nearly everything money can accommodate. 
However, Crown has devised a foul proof heist with the Monet, and it will be very difficult for anyone to prove he committed the crime. Although conviction is not her main goal, she attempts to seduce her way inside the Crown mansion to examine the artifacts there, and possibly convince the thief to return the painting so that her company doesn't have to write an enormous check. 	Crown and Banning become closer. She becomes more suspicious. He teases her with clues and temptations along their cat and mouse chase. Eventually, he takes her to his resort in the tropics where they exchange outcomes and gather information about each other. Complications ensue when she suspects Tom to have another mistress, and she reluctantly becomes overly involved in his status, and is forced to choose between the life of an insurance investigator or Thomas Crown's partner. 	A lot of the second act includes wasted time through scene after scene consisting of cat and mouse-like material. These wondering sequences do develop chemistry, but really do not move the story forward. There are also segments that clarify Thomas Crown's motives, treating us like slowwitted dummies, through intercut visits with an unclassified psychiatrist (Faye Dunaway). Naturally, these demonstrations are meaningless, and contribute nothing to the story.The casting is perfect, eminently with Pierce Brosnan as the title character, who performs with elegance and style. He presents his character with firm knowledge of the script and scenarios. Rene Russo is also devilishly clever, handling her role with glamorous style, and charming intimacy. Surprisingly overlooked here is Denis Leary's character. He doesn't induce much intrigue here because he is a puppet of the plot.
""The Thomas Crown Affair"" may embody style and allure, but  much of the dialogue is flat. Many of the conversations only restate what is already obvious, thus obtain in a dreary, dual fashion.  Although, aside from the unsuccessful soundtrack, I did enjoy a lot of the movie's éclat, it did have somewhat of a smarty pants tone throughout. It is almost if the film thinks it is better than it actually is. The film is directed by John McTiernan, whose most famous credits include ""Medicine Man"" (1992), ""The Hunt for Red October"" (1990), ""Last Action Hero"" (1993), two of the Die Hard films, and the more recent ""The 13th Warrior."" Coming from a mostly belligerent individual, I was expecting something more action packed with Crown. Instead we receive more romantic chemistry than action, and more intellect than injury. Whereas ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" is not a remarkable movie, I even struggle to recommend it, I still enjoyed enough of the overall presentation to call it ""good."" Actually, if the sex was handled with more discrepancy, ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" could possibly pass as the next James Bond installment.Brought to you by MGM Productions.",The Thomas Crown Affair
48,alice liddell,"Barely tolerable, but only because the first one was so bad.",4,7 September 1999,"Marginally less awful than the original for a number of reasons.  Firstly, the style.  Don't get me wrong, the style here is bland and anonymous, but this is a relief after the ghastly flashiness of the original.  That employed dim-witted split-screens, showy edits and ludicrous, unmotivated camera angles, which wearied the viewer with its monotony, like a loud, precocious kid.  This remake is filmed like any standard-issue Hollywood film: flatly, without ever daring to waver into invention or cinematic frisson; with rather embarrassing attempts at 'class', but rarely headache-inducing.Secondly, the heists.  The second one especially is a little gem of near-wit and surprise, but both, by utilising suspense and focus, tower over the botched cleverness of the original, which drowned any tension in its attempts to be 'formal' and modern.Thirdly, the female lead.  Faye Dunaway has on occasion been known to be a reasonable, even beautiful actress, but she is lousy in THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR: like a drag caricature in ludicrous outfits, she is loud, unglamorous, clumsy, smarmy and dislikable.  Rene Russo, though saddled with some equally dire outfits, manages to rise above a sketch role of blatant male fantasy (love some of the reviewers' euphemistic praise here of her 'outfits'!), with some real, tough, human, emotional acting, showing up the shoddy shallow enterprise for what it is.  And yeah, she also looks gorgeous.One wouldn't have expected it, but the remake also manages to disimprove on the original in two ways.  Firstly the lovely, melancholic Michel Legrand score, the only redeeming feature of the McQueen movie, is replaced by muzak variations on it rich theme, with contributions from the detestable Sting (loved the Brecht/Weill though.  How on earth did that get in there?).The greatest crime of all, though, is Pierce Brosnan.  Never has a man with so little talent been so pleased with himself.  Steve McQueen, a real actor, was atrocious in the original, but was Marlon Brando compared to Brosnan. Cosmo Landoman has called his sense of cool 'Ferrero Rocher naff', and Brosnan's smug attempts at cool provide much unintentional comedy.  He has simply no personality, no expressive qualities, his breaking into laughter is bovine and grotesque - it is simply unbelievable that a woman as smart, strong and gorgeous as Rene Russo would ever fall for this humorless cipher. Their love scenes were as risible as that awful chess set-piece.This film also retains the original's tasteless fetishisation of wealth (how thrillingly transgressive can a multi-billionaire stealing more money be?), an uncritiqued wallowing in a lifestyle that doesn't offer the humble viewer a vicarious entry into a normally inaccessible world, but rubs his or her inadequacy in his or her face.  For such a vanity project, this is a very ugly film.At least it gropes for some seriousness - the obsession with the gaze, identity, reflections, authenticity, forgery, truth, trust, gender are all linked in the film's art heist subject matter.  The punctuated visits of Crown to his psychiatrist are meant to show us his depth, pain, emptiness and identity crises, but only serve to demonstrate what an insufferable, self-regarding, spoilt brat he is.  Dennis Leary (excellent, by the way)'s final rant about Art being an oppressive rich man's hobby is interesting, and hinted at throughout - there is little sense of the aesthetic or spiritual pleasures of art.  However, by the time this speech comes, it seems more like a defence of the film's vulgarity.",The Thomas Crown Affair
49,FlickJunkie-2,Slick remake a good film in it's own right,8,5 January 2000,"I'm not going to compare the remake with the original because this film stands on its own.  As a matter of fact, the story is probably the weakest element of this film and it was pretty good.This was a slick, big money production that delivered.  John McTiernan's direction was excellent, the photography rich, the locations magnificent and the opulent lifestyle nicely portrayed.In the story, a rich gazillionaire art collector, bored with the ease with which he makes his gazillions, decides to steal a Monet that he easily could have purchased if it were for sale.  Hmmmmm.  A little far fetched, but okay.  The heist itself was the best part of the plot.  The rest of the story after his nemesis love interest (Rene Russo) is introduced is pretty predictable stuff.  The writers tried to throw in a couple of curves but I can't imagine anyone was fooled.  Still, it was entertaining and there is a certain feeling of harmony when everything turns out about the way the viewer hopes and expects.Pierce Brosnan was the perfect choice for this role.  It was a small transition from James Bond to Double O Seven Figures.  He only had to lose the Walther PPK.  He was born to play the oversexed, smarter than everyone else, high society loner.  With him as the anchor, the film could not go too far wrong.I have mixed feelings about the selection of sex symbol wanna-be Rene Russo, who was looking a bit weather beaten in this film.  Russo's (and McTiernan's) decision to bare all was a miscalculation.  Rene's sexuality benefits when something is left to the imagination.  On the other hand, she handled the emotional tight rope of the character superbly; cunning, smart, and torn between her ambition and her passion.  If you could combine Russo's acting ability with Catherine Zeta-Jones' (who played essentially the same character in ""Entrapment"") looks you'd have the perfect actress for this role.Denis Leary, as the detective, was the biggest disappointment.  Here is a guy who has perfected the art of being the insensitive tough guy, trying to play the role as Mr. Sensitive.  He was either miscast or misguided in this endeavor.  It fell flat as a canvas.All in all, a commendable film.  I gave it an 8, and though it may not become a classic, you could do a lot worse.",The Thomas Crown Affair

You can see that the most famous of roles has had an effect on his acting style, but I thought he was good if a little unimaginitive at times.Russo was the star for me, impressing as she usually does, despite the gratuituous sex scenes with Brosnan on the stairs - debatably unnecessary to the plot, but they no doubt brought in the crowds - with her slick and stylish approach to a challenging role.Definitely worth seeing, if only because Brosnan and Russo is a far more likely combination than Connery and Zeta-Jones in Entrapment.",The Thomas Crown Affair

Pierce has his indisputable charm even though with furrowed brows and wrinkles.

56,SKG-2,Surprisingly good,9,9 August 1999,"A lot has been written, in this forum and in others, about remakes, and people probably feel the same way about them as they feel about cover versions of favorite songs.  Though I'm with the stereotype of the film lover in a lot of ways (I hate sequels, hate colorizing movies, prefer subtitles to dubbing), I must admit I have nothing intrinsically against remakes.  One of my favorite movies of all time, NO WAY OUT (the Kevin Costner movie, not the Richard Widmark movie), is a remake (of THE BIG CLOCK).  And I've seen a handful of good ones over the years (I don't count remakes of foreign language movies because the chances are usually slim that I'd get to see the original).All of this, I guess, is a roundabout way of saying I enjoyed this version of THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, which is a remake of the famous 1968 version directed by Norman Jewison and starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway.  I must admit I don't think the original was a classic.  Not to say I hated it, since I liked Steve McQueen, I liked the cinematic tricks Jewison used (like the split screens), and I liked the song ""Windmills of Your Mind"" (and I'm not a fan of Alan and Marilyn Bergman, two of the songwriters).  But I caught the strain at times, and while Faye Dunaway is good in the right role (CHINATOWN, NETWORK), her character was way underwritten, and she was forced to act girlish, which is not her best mode.  So ultimately, I found it okay but forgettable.Now the remake.  Pierce Brosnan, I must admit, suffers in comparison to Steve McQueen.  He's got a movie star presence, and he effectively communicates the joy he gets out of high risk activities, like the boat racing and the airplane flying.  But McQueen showed you the boredom which led Crown to pull his heist, and Brosnan doesn't.  And McQueen has more depth to him than Brosnan does, so the strong, silent thing works for him better(although Brosnan's scenes with Dunaway, who plays his psychiatrist, are fun, you know it's a plot device to show the feelings Brosnan can't quite access).On the other hand, the remake does improve on the original in some substantial ways.  As I said, I liked Jewison's direction there, but director John McTiernan makes it even sleeker and tighter here.  When people mention McTiernan, they usually mention he's the director of two of the DIE HARD movies.  More appropriate to this discussion, however, is THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, another film he directed with a slick polish.  There, I thought it clashed with the good straightforward story and the fine acting, but here, it buttresses the story and the acting.  There isn't a wasted moment here, and the two heist sequences are quite cleverly done.  Also, while I don't really remember the detectives in the first one, Denis Leary is quite good as the detective here.  As in his best work(THE REF, WAG THE DOG), he's able to be Denis Leary within the context of the character, and I liked the fact that even though he played by the rules, he wasn't a clod.But the real improvement comes in the form of Rene Russo.  As I said before, when Dunaway played the insurance investigator, there really wasn't much for her to work with.  Here, Russo is shown thinking with her brain, and not just her hormones.  And instead of acting girlish, Russo acts sexy in a very adult way, which is refreshing in this day and age.  And while, as I said, I had problems with Brosnan's performance, I think Brosnan the producer was smart enough knowing a good thing when he saw one and allowing Russo to steal the movie from him(I would like to know what that stuff she was drinking, though).In a summer full of disappointments from the major studios, this was a nice surprise.  If all studio movies were as much fun as this, Hollywood wouldn't be in the trouble it's in.",The Thomas Crown Affair

With that, not in mind shall we say, I came to the new version without any set views of how it should, or shouldn't be.It struck me that it was a very stylish film, the music was bold, unlike many of today's soundtracks that ripple past you, and the whole package reminded me of a sixties film yet with a very modern approach.I, miraculously, managed to forget about Brosnan being Bond for the entire film, although it has to be said that his acting doesn't change between roles. Russo was stunning, and I don't mean for her looks or her lingering topless shots. I thought she made this film with some very believable acting and provided a fantastic interaction with Brosnan.I'd recommend seeing this film, if you have seen the original I'd suggest trying not to make comparisons, if you haven't, enjoy.

62,HelenMary,"a stylish but not classy remake of the original, enjoyable though",7,1 February 2014,"Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan play the Faye Dunaway and Steve McQueen characters in the original. Whilst this version is obviously more modern, slicker, more colourful and less implausible, it lacks some of the gentle class of the original. Russo plays the insurance investigator as a hard-nosed woman, who will do anything. She seems more of a loose cannon and less together that her 60s counterpart. However, that perhaps makes her more believable, and her investigation has certainly fewer plot holes and more actual procedural parts. Pierce Brosnan is good in this role; but plays Crown rather smarmy and cheesy, rather than cool like Steve McQueen. I'll admit I don't much like him as an actor, particularly, but this has him as role I think he seems to suit. The film production is excellent, it's an attractive, slick looking film and it plays out less like ""rich people montages"" as the original does but there is an element of that. The characters have some depth both explicit and suggested and I like the excitement from the few twists so there is a little suspense.

One of the aspects that I loved about the film was that Thomas was not really a villain but rather treated As a person that fans cared about and rooting for him to to win and end up with Catherine.

68,Shiva-11,The better art theft film of the summer,7,31 July 1999,"The Thomas Crown Affair: Billionaire financier Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) combines his a penchant for adventure and fine art and indulges in a little larceny.  As a result of his escapades - the liberation of a Renoir from the New York Museum of art - Crown meets his soulmate, one Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) an artworld bounty hunter sent to retrieve the painting.   What follows is a game of cat and mouse, where we're not really sure who is hunting whom. The second art intrigue film of the summer, The Thomas Crown Affair has the advantage of a better storyline (so good they did a remake) and better acting.  While ""Entrapment"" boasted great locales, ""Crown"" is more engaging and subtle (the heist is brilliant in it's simplicity).    In addition, ""Crown"" delivers one of the hottest, sweatiest sex scenes I've seen in a long while (""Eyes Wide Shut"" should hang its head in shame)Brosnan is his typical suave self and displays a greater range of emotion than we are accustomed to, actually laughing, and losing his cool, whereas Russo's gutsy the-ends-justify-the-means character is reminiscent of her role in Lethal Weapon 3.  There is obvious chemistry between the two (something clearing missing between Connery and Zeta-Jones) which gives this film the edge over  ""Entrapment"".Enjoy.",The Thomas Crown Affair
69,Brogan,A wonderful remake of a great film!,8,27 July 1999,"Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway were cautious and charming each other over 30 years ago, is what was one of the best heist film of all time called THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR.  It was not only a great suspense film, but also a very entertaining romance film, as both sides of the law were playing with each others minds, and at the same time would fall in love. Now instead of McQueen and Dunaway, it's Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo charming each other in the remake of the Norman Jewison film.  And surprising, I put this film with Martin Scorsese's 1991 CAPE FEAR as one of the best remakes of all-time.  This is a very entertaining and enjoyable thriller that works on so many levels. The plot has muli-millionare Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) who is rich, wealthy, and living very well off, who decides to rob a Monette painting that's worth over $100 million dollars. After the painting is stolen, a New York City police detective, Michael McCann (Dennis Leary, sporting a Wojo from BARNEY MILLER haircut), and a intellegent and sexy insurance investigator, Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) set out to see who did take the expensive painting.  It isn't long when Banning finds out who did take the painting, she's just waiting for the thief to either admit it or until she get's the painting herself.  From there on is a romantic game similar to chess of a couple playing with each other's minds, and falling in love with each other.  But there's a catch, who could they trust and who's telling the truth? I was very surprised on how well this version was done.  It's what ENTRAPMENT should have been: funny, charming, witty, suspensful, and romantic.  Brosnan and Russo have excellent chemistry together, and they make a great couple.  Brosnan is playing a role similar to James Bond, except that he's on the wrong side of the law this time.  But there's nothing wrong with that, it's always fun to see Brosnan playing that kind of role.  And I have never seen Russo so sexy, and act so well since GET SHORTY.  This was a great role for her, she isn't just a sex object, she throws out witty one-liners and comments that makes her character more enjoyable. The story and pacing of the film is also very good. There are very clever heist scenes, and there are plenty of excellent plot twists that make this a very exciting film to watch.  And fans of the original film (like me) will notice the nice homages director John McTiernan shows towards the original film. First there's the casting of Faye Dunaway playing Thomas Crown's psychiatrist.  And then there is a updated version of the Alan & Marilyn Bergman and Michel Legrand Oscar winning song, ""Windmills of Your Mind"" played throughout the film. This is one of the best movies of the summer, and I personally feel that it should make more money than ENTRAPMENT did.  I just hope that people will actually get up and see a entertaining suspense/thriller, instead of a silly thriller like THE HAUNTING.  Please go see this film!  ****1/2 (out of five)",The Thomas Crown Affair

71,kyrat,Disappointing - could have been good.,6,14 March 2007,"I wanted to like this film. I like art capers (to catch a thief, to steal a million). I like Pierce Brosnan. I know he's typecast - but I like that suave Cary Grant-esquire elegance. I was very pleased to see an AGE APPROPRIATE couple!It started off interestingly and nearly ended interestingly too. I enjoyed the parts that centered on the theft(s). The ""trojan"" horse bit was amusing. The twists and trying to figure out who is doing what was amusing. The Magritte references - not only to the amusing Bowler man switch but the reference to Thomas Crown himself were all done well.However the ""romance"" just didn't work for me. I felt like it was all about Rene Russo's character using her body to solve a case and then (stupidly) falling for a crook. There were multiple gratuitous breast shots (I detracted points just for that). There was an overly pointless long sex segment. The ""romance"" was just boring and overly clichéd. The dialogue wasn't snappy or interesting. The scenes added nothing to the movie. Also, another point was taken off for the soda product placement by Russo in the station.So if you're bored one day & want to see an ""almost"" good movie caper movie or you're a fan of either actor, go ahead and rent it - just be prepared for it to not be as good as it could've been.****SPOILER***** BTW, at the end did he steal 2 paintings or just the boats one for her? If he did only steal 1 -why is he leaving the country?",The Thomas Crown Affair
72,buzznzipp1995,"007 meets Wallstreet -Sophisticated, with Punch!",10,27 July 2006,"I had not seen the previews but, had heard about it. Brosnan's role sounded good, really good, so I went with my wife and a friend and we saw it one evening. This movie, was quite a wondrously detailed beautiful painting, emotionally enticing with sophisticated adventure. Truly I can say, it sparkled. This film was like enjoying a fine and expensive dinner with a nice bottle of wine. This just totally satisfied us. I noticed from early on, that the soundtrack was very alluring, almost sensual in nature. The musical artist 'Sting' performed the 1968 title track from the original film. Now remade with a stunning grace. Then at times the music kicks it up a notch and goes into an action mode. We really didn't stop talking about it for quite a while. The characters from, Catherine Banning (Russo) and 'Det. McCann' (Leary) and (Frankie Faison as) ' Det. Peretti' and of course Pierce Brosnan as the lead 'player' Thomas or 'Tommy' as friend to be Catherine would call him. But from an interview that I saw, truly I am of the same opinion that Denis Leary is when he said,""I'm a big fan of Steve McQueen, but I think he was just miscast in the roll of Thomas Crown. I liked this remake a lot more than the original in 68."" From the art galleries to Manhattan, the beautiful twin towers and all the city lights, where a tremendous addition to this 'platinum story' directed by John McTeirnan of 'Die Hard' I & III and 'Preditor' etc. was one of those, have to be seen again and then down the line again, movies that just reminds you of style, travel, romance and all centered around Manhattan. This was a truly delicious tale of passion, an art lover, a business baron ...with a magician's talent for the sleight of hand, with a love's twist of fate. This is a movie for couples that I believe truly satisfies romantic cinematic cravings, for a beautiful story and a wonderful ending. I can see this again and again and fall in love with it every time. (*****)",The Thomas Crown Affair
73,aramo1,30 years and nothing gained,5,28 December 2002,"Based on R2 DVDI recently had the chance to re-view the original Thomas Crown affair (1968) with McQueen and Dunaway. I looked forward to seeing what Brosnan and Russo would do with the story.While neither film is strong on logic [I never understood why clever Crown believed he should flee] the 99 version is slicker, the dance routine is good [but not as good as the chess routine] and the locations are superior but otherwise the 68 version is a better told story with more tension and the romantic element between McQueen and Dunaway is far more credible than that between Brosnan and Russo.Overall the '99 movie is mostly clever with a stupid ending.5/10 average viewing",The Thomas Crown Affair
74,Meredith-7,"Glossy, entertaining & mindless",7,14 April 2000,"The one thing I can say about this film is that it was very entertaining. If you like Pierce he is in almost every scene, so there was no disappointment in that respect.  Its a classic caper film, with lots of nifty gadgets, exotic locations and some clever scenes.  Its totally predictable, but its a nice ride all the same.  Pierce seemed to fit into the role of Thomas Crown very easily, and Rene Russo was surprisingly seductive in her role as the art insurance agent.  Not what you would call a good film, but very entertaining time waster.",The Thomas Crown Affair
75,len-21,8 on a scale of 10,8,22 January 2000,"I enjoyed this movie throughout. It was action-filled fun with a light amount of suspense - the perfect mix for a Pierce Brosnan film. It reminded me a lot of James Bond (less action) and it reminded me a lot of Remington Steele (more sophisticated). It also reminded me of another recent movie - Entrapment - however, this was a little more enjoyable than that.Actually, if not for a few absurd holes early on, I might have been tempted to give it a 9. I really have a problem with obvious blunders - things that couldn't have happened. That makes me downgrade it slightly.I thought Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan had good chemistry. The cat and mouse game they played with each other was (if not classic) at least entertaining. But, I have to confess that I didn't get the whole Faye Dunaway thing.",The Thomas Crown Affair
76,adrian-43767,"Glib, plastic remake comes nowhere near the original",2,2 October 2018,"Frankly, I am astonished at what was the producers' minds when they cast the wooden Pierce Brosnan (to me, far and away the worst James Bond of all) as Thomas Crown. Suffice the menace in McQueen's laughing eyes, and the way he celebrates his successful heist, and the suave chess/seduction game with Faye Dunaway, and this version would always have an Everest to climb just to come anywhere near matching the original.In contrast, Brosnan comes across as a smug, supposedly classy thief, but never manages to rise above a self-serving, smart-alecky and annoying performance.This 1999 version has one memorable scene, the crowd of men using umbrellas, allowing Crown to give the slip to his pursuers. That sequence earns it one of my stars, but the likelihood of it happening in real life is so improbable that it does not save this completely forgettable film. The other star goes to the plasticized photography, perfectly in line with this completely cosmetic and pointless film.",The Thomas Crown Affair
77,fredericksmith1952,"John McTiernan is famous for the hard hitting, action adventure films",10,7 February 2012,"John McTiernan is famous for the hard hitting, action adventure films, so the remake of a Steve McQueen classic must have been a challenge. This is a different kinds of drama and suspense, based in the world of the very wealthy. Brosnan is up to the task, and perfectly portrays the well mannered, savvy businessman who is bored to death with the society crowd and craves something more from life. Rene Russo is the perfect foil for Crown, the driven, intelligent, and self confident woman who competes and excels in a man's world. Leary has his work cut out for him, bur rises to the occasion as the street detective who has to keep up with Russo, and is always one step behind. The flow of the film is more even than the original, and the photography and scenery is amazing, from the New York City shots to the island that serves as Crown's hideaway in the Caribbean. The homage of having Dunaway as the psychiatrist (She played the investigator in the original), and retaining the original theme (Windmills of Your Mind – written for the original film and performed by Sting) bring an overall polish to the movie that make it one of the best. Nudity and some language make this a poor choice for the under 14 set, but most teens should be able to enjoy the film with a minimum of giggling and pointing. Definitely a collectible, and one to watch with the wife when the lights are low and the kids are in bed.",The Thomas Crown Affair
78,loza-1,Throwing Money at Something Is No Guarantee of Success,3,26 August 2005,"When I heard that they were going to remake The Thomas Crown Affair, I inevitably asked: ""What was wrong with the old one?"" Nevertheless, I tried to watch the remake with an open mind.The impression I got was that the film makers had decided to make this film different by throwing some extra money at it. Thus the settings are more opulent, and we have the added expense of fine art rather than just a cheapo bank robbery. We have gliders,islands in the sun, even an expensive catamaran capsizing. Whereas, in the original film, we had a genuine chemistry between Steve McQueen and Faye Dunnaway, especially during the chess playing scene, in this film there is as much chemistry between Pearce Brosnan and Rene Russo as there is between Pearce Brosnan and Garry Kasparov!The film should never have been made, and, unless you like looking at opulent scenery, you would be better watching the original.",The Thomas Crown Affair
79,merrywood,"An all too rare, superior remake of a fine film.",9,10 August 1999,"Typically, filmmakers who do remakes are not up to the task.  There are a few exceptions and most of us who love movies can come up with one or two. With rare exception, the remake is simply inferior; not so for the 1999 Thomas Crown Affair.  This was done with the assurance of at least equal casting, fine writing, superb direction and beautiful production.   While it salutes the 1968 original Norman Jewison version it generally surpasses it in both characterizations, denouement and the psychological spirals for which the story is known. The single spot where the producers seemed to have stepped on their own toes is their struggle with the Academy Award winning song of the original, WINDMILLS OF YOUR MIND.  Here, Sting and the producers drop the ball.  My choice would have been to use it, beautifully, as in the original or leave it out completely and replace it with something, hopefully just as good. Certainly, the budget was there for something else.  Instead, the original song is soundly trashed in this version. 	Is the film worth your time and money?  Most assuredly so.  The beauty of this is that you could enjoy the original in the morning and still luxuriate in this new version in the afternoon.  This is Hollywood fairy tale spinning at its very best.",The Thomas Crown Affair

While lacking in action this film oozes with the class and style so sorely missing from the other. A case of one up for the new 'Bond over the old one. I noticed in the very last scene Brosnan briefly uses a Scottish accent; deliberate nod to Connery or just my imagination?We are led along by a cleverly written story with the two lead characters trying to outwit one another. Both disregard normal social niceties, they always win except now they are on opposite sides. How can we possibly get to a happy ending unless they both triumph?See the film and fantasize about what you would do if your bank balance measured ten figures and your only distraction was outside the law..",The Thomas Crown Affair

83,mattrochman,Excellent without being overdone,9,29 April 2007,"Some would argue that this film falls short of being a masterpiece.But then again, with the plot that they had to work with, I fail to see how any director or group of film makers could make this sort of film into an Oscar showering epic.So let's be realistic here. This is supposed to be a light hearted and entertaining film and I believe they nailed it. The casting was the first amazing achievement. To begin with, they accomplished something that had never been accomplished before: A James Bond playing the lead role in a non-bond film while under contract. Pierce Brosnan is, in my opinion, a highly underrated actor and I couldn't imagine anyone doing a better job in the role of Thomas Crown.Rene Russo was terrific. While this was her first nude scene in a film, it also now appears to be the last major film she had a part in. Since this, her career appears to have slowed, but that could easily be by choice rather than the decision of casting departments.While there were reasonable support roles, all other parts were relatively ancillary to the two main roles.The plot was nice and cute, without being overdone - which is rare for an American film. The script was sharp without being far fetched or absurd and best of all, the 'cat-and-mouse' aspect of the film was intriguing and entertaining. The bowler hat sequence at the end of the film was magnificent as was the final 10 minutes of the film.Overall, very entertaining, clean and highly recommended without being overcooked on any front. Good watch and enjoy it for what it is, not what you expect/hope it to be.",The Thomas Crown Affair
84,lhhung_himself,Form without substance - typical feckless Hollywood remake,3,7 February 2002,"The original was not a great movie by any means and looks very dated, especially the 60's types of effects that were so popular then. The robbery subplot is not really that great or unique - there were other clever robbery flicks of the time which noone remembers or remakes. Even the disaffected Thomas Crowne character is also not really that remarkable. What does or I should say *did* set the film apart and worthy of remaking, was the interplay between Crowne and the Dunaway/Russo character culmunating in a wonderfully apt ending. Can she play chess (poker in the remake - an improvement..) with Crowne?  Does she dare to risk all to win the ultimate prize, or can take the safe way out and take the sure thing?
So what do they do in the remake? Glitz up the robbery - fair enough - even though it's not that plausible - it's not too bad. Add some skin - again understandable from a marketing viewpoint - but it was clumsily and gratuitously grafted into the film, providing no heat and detracting from the story. The actors were fine given what they were given and the addition of Dunaway to the cast was clever. However, the entire conflict between the two protagonists was so watered down as to be meaningless. No longer is it a conflict between two towering but *equal* titans (that's why the cops were there in the original: to show how stupid everyone else is compared to these two - something else lost in the remake). Instead, Russo has been reduced to a wronged woman chasing after the bad boy prince complete with retrofitted test-audience friendly ending. (I'd hate to see what these guys would do to Gone with the Wind or Casablanca...) Maybe Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan were originally supposed to be the leads...It's not surprising that other reviewers on this page found the film to be rather shallow - because without that conflict at the heart of the plot, all that is left is a styrofoam filled husk, though admittedly a nice shiny husk. In summary, not that bad a movie but certainly one that won't be remade in 30 years.",The Thomas Crown Affair
85,simonrosenbaum,stylishly dull,6,23 April 2003,"Not as enjoyable as I remember when it first came out. It starts off ok and it ends ok but in the middle it really drags. The two leads are very likeable and seem to have real chemistry, and there's a great soundtrack with Bill Conti's jazzy score and some good songs,  but that's not quite enough to make it a good film. Like the original film there's a little too much style and not enough substance. (6/10)",The Thomas Crown Affair

Too many people like being nit-pickers, the only part that confused me was how he stored the Monet without breaking the frame? But I ""bleeped"" that so as to let the rest of the movie flow, here were two worthy adversaries - Renee as Catherine Banning and Pierce the Producer and Thomas Crown.His Crown character brought to mind the apocryphal story that Alexander The Great wept when there were no more worlds to conquer, ennui is a terrible thing and creates trouble when there is none ... simply to see if it can be overcome! I love the diversion of a botched robbery, how the air-conditioning was disabled to botch the new cameras then the real painting was there all along?? As a Cezanne or Pizarro, LOL!! By Crown himself, laughing at everyone, in a quiet version of the anonymous businessman that he so loved.Even if he didn't have a glide or a private jet to Martinique, he still would've seduced the sequins off of that dress Russo wore, the film was dynamite carefully timed and dovetailed to create an effect like a beautiful domino display that only is realised when the pegs fall into place.Denis Leary as the wanna-be lover of Banning was all too true in life, meet a chick and she seems like the bee's knees, but she has the hots for someone else! Faye Dunaway back in the remake (after a sultry performance in the original as the 1st Catherine Banning), this time as the snide and sarcastic shrink who was just the tonic needed to save Crown/Brosnan from himself - Peter Pan growing up and carrying away Wendy...As for the very end, when Renee Russo thought she lost him for good - sigh - keep them Kleenex handy!

88,DavidAllenUSA,The Elegant World Of 1999 Rich People In NYC Travelogue,7,14 August 2009,"The Thomas Crown Affair (1999) starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo is smoother and more elegant than the 1968 movie, the latter shot it proletarian times which valued dirt under the fingernail people (the ""proletarian, war on poverty 60's!"").McQueen wasn't elegant in the 1968 movie, and places visited in that movie weren't either. The starting scene of the 1968 movie set the tone.....a dumb plastic fantastic no-architecture hotel of the times, sanitary with no style...and fat Jack Weston as the ""Everyman"" introducing viewers to the story and it's people.Rich people were doing better in 1999, the Thomas Crown Affair version of that year shows it....Brosnan's version of Crown is smoother, more elegant and polished, almost like a dancer.The museum setting of the two heists in the movie (the NYC public library built by elegant people was used for ""museum"" interiors, the lobby, etc. etc.) makes the movie cultural and celebrates the world of cultured rich people far more than the 1968 movie did.All this is nice....the way ""comedy of manners"" movies (and stage plays) about rich people in the 1930's and before were nice.....a look at ""the good life"" served up in elegant settings, and enjoyed by its participants for good reasons.Brosnan's clothes fit better than McQueen's did. His (Brosnan's) hair cut is better, less deliberate, more understated and elegant than McQueen's.The trip to Martineque in the Caribbean was a good touch (contrast it to the GUYS AND DOLLS [1956] trip to Cuba made by Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons), and the improved glider plane in the 1999 movie was, too (much less clunky plane than McQueen's was in 1968).I could almost taste the smooth, high priced wine served in restaurant scenes Brosnan and Russo shared. Expensive red wine priced at $50/bottle in liquor stores, double that in NYC restaurants.The 1999 version of Thomas Crown is a travelogue showing the good life in NYC enjoyed by people with time, money, good taste, and all the rest of it.Except for the heavy sex scenes (which aren't believable or attractive), the movie is easy to watch, enjoyable, and smooth....just like an expensive bottle of good red wine, served in a nice place by good people doing the serving and nearby as fellow customers.Dinner Rush (1990) is another 90's movie about rich people in NYC, and their night life (about gangsters in part, but gangsters with elegant haircuts!).Sometimes, the best part of movies is the travel experience they provide, and the plot and even the acting isn't as important.""Where were you?"" is sometimes the question to ask.The Thomas Crown Affair (1999) starring Pierce Brosnan does a good job with that.

89,miken-3,A Serious Mishmash,3,12 January 2000,"Don't know whether the intention of the story was to highlight Rene Russo's breasts or to make you like an obvious criminal.  The movie was totally disjointed and difficult to follow.  You have an intricate plan to rob an art museum at the beginning that was nothing but a ruse so Bronson could heist a painting that we are never sure whether he wanted in the first place.  He  seems to like to live life on the edge and is more concerned with the challenge of doing something (betting $100,000 on a virtually impossible golf shot) than the actual result.At the start Russo is shown as a sexy super sleuth that seems to have everything figured out from the minimum of clues.  I was totally in the dark as to what she actually was (an insurance investigator perhaps?).  I found her annoying more than sexy throughout the movie.  Overall I was very disappointed with this film.",The Thomas Crown Affair

91,Deckard-16,A very smart and sexy surprise.,9,8 August 1999,"I don't want to jinx this movie, but this is this year's Out Of Sight (and I hope it makes the B.O. that Out Of Sight deserved to make). It is one of the most stylish, smart and sexy movies I've ever seen. Pierce Brosnan's role as Crown unavoidably has some Bondish trappings but this works as a plus rather than a minus. Brosnan is virtually perfect in the role. Denis Leary has just the right edge as the cop whose job it is to catch him, but despite these two winning performances the movie belongs to Rene Russo. For the last few years she has been one of the most enjoyable actresses to watch due to her ability to carry off toughness with a smile. Here she moves up several levels in her craft as she intertwines real sizzle with a steel will. I hope Oscar does not overlook her work in this one because she is an early and deserving contender for lead actress. And what about John McTiernan? This guy directed Die Hard, Predator (which was much better than it had any right to be) and The Hunt For Red October then slipped almost totally from memory. Now with this one he is back on the A-List with a bullet (something this movie refreshingly lacks by the way). This movie soars on charm, plotting and style. It knows exactly when to cut from one scene to another. It never drags and it looks great. I'm too young to remember the original movie so this was all new material to me. I'm sure if you look very closely at it the plot comes apart, but I don't care to because I was enjoying the ride too much. Obviously I was taken by complete surprise by this movie. Congratulations to all involved with the making of this movie. I'll be talking it up at work tomorrow.",The Thomas Crown Affair
92,lopcar1993,It's the Crown Jewel of remakes,7,8 April 2009,"The Thomas Crown affair is such a rarity among remakes, It's a remake that actually surpass the original. Almost all remakes that come out today have one major flaw; They don't bother to think up a different story they just use the old one and changes somethings around and give it the same title. But with the Thomas Crown Affair that doesn't happen, this movies is a movie all on it's own. It's not a remake or reimaging it's a whole new film with a different style, a different story & a different plot. The Thomas Crown Affair stars Pierce Brosnan as The title character. Thomas Crown is a thrill seeking billionaire who finally decides his world is too safe, so what does he do for fun; he robs one of New York's most highly guarded museum's in broad daylight( Who's got he balls to do that anymore!?). Now he has the painting: but before he can bask in his post heist glory. He has to out smart a beautiful and ruthless insurance investigator by the name of Catherine Banning. But can Crown out smart her or will he get put away for good? The Thomas Crown Affair is a sleek and sexy crime thriller that you can't afford to miss, It's a film steeped in great heist scene and is movie making at it's best. This film is an affair you just don't want to miss.",The Thomas Crown Affair
93,I_should_be_reading_a_book,31 years of moviemaking evolution,7,21 October 2020,"I got to watch the 1968 Steve McQueen - Faye Dunaway - Paul Burke film when it showed in theaters in the 60's, then; at the dawn of the millenium, watched the 1999 Brosnan-Russo-Leary one and came out of the theater firmly believing that the original was much better in every sense. This week, thanks to the magic of streaming services I could watch both back to back. Contrary to popular wisdom there are remakes that are better than the originals and this is the proverbial sample button.The plot is absolutely superior and direction does it justice; while the original, for its period might have been glamoruos and imaginative, it pakes pitifully on the comparison. The new script is much more agile, interesting and glamorous all around. Casting beats the old one hands down.Acting: while McQueen and Dunaway might have been shining stars of their time, they feel stiff and cardboard nowadays. The personifications delivered by the 1999 cast are fluid and three-dimensional. Even with the age difference at the respective times of the films, Russo is way more stunning than Dunaway, who by the way does a credible analyst on the latter film. Burke did a poor performance compared to Leary's, who delivers a full and likable character.In the glamour and high life section, there's simply no contest. Even the gliders are miles apart. The clothes of the characters are without comparison. Accessories, transports, dwellings... Brosnan exhudes money, McQueen... Hmm.While the '68 file has a depressive ending the '99 version manages to squeeze-in a happy ending all around.In sum, to really appreciate the '99 version, you need to watch the '68 one and transport yourself in time to the era. Then jump back ahead and compare.",The Thomas Crown Affair
94,Colbridge,Pierce Brosnan was obviously a good choice to play Thomas Crown for the 90's,6,11 June 2021,"This is a cool, slick, glossy remake of the 1968 Steve McQueen original and Pierce Brosnan, here taking time out from being James Bond, oozes the same charm and sophistication as his predecessor and was obviously a good choice to play Thomas Crown.Switching from bank heist to art theft as a plot device it revels in the playboy antics of the title character and Rene Russo attempts to smoulder as much as Faye Dunaway did in the original, who makes a nice appearance here as the psychiatrist.Director John McTiernan does a good enough job in updating the story and does it in a more conventional way than the more stylized original but it can be a tad too predictable at times and it feels like everyone involved is paying homage to the original rather than making this their own.",The Thomas Crown Affair

Pierce Brosnan is typecast with his habitual aplomb, cheesy Remington Steele character. Rene Russo plays a tipsy, private detector who giggles like a teenage girl and makes witty, teasing remarks every time she opens her mouth.

97,annmason1,A Swing and A Miss,1,30 June 2009,"I do not recall the first Thomas Crown film. But this one is bad (although lovely in photography) because of miscast actors. Pierce Brosman and Rene Russo don't belong in this film. They are both fine actors but Brosman lacks the image of a selfish man, and Russo is not a slut actress. Both of their strengths are class and intelligence. Now picture this flick with, oh, say, Val Kilmer and Angelina Jolie. THAT would be fireworks. Here, it's just pathetic to see such fine human beings cast as ""take what you can"" types. It just don't work, folks.I agree with others who point out the silliness of the plot. But it is hard for me to even consider the plot when I see Russo (or whoever) writhing all over a marble staircase. And what's with that obscene statue in the front hall of Crown's home? Please...is a guy into Monet also into in-your-face pornographic figures? Let's talk class here...at least that marble babe shouldn't be spread eagled in front of incoming guests. And what's with the pouty-faced model cast as the daughter of somebody or other in prison? Her smoldering looks and slinking on and off camera are hilarious. Yeah, like she's able to recreate the soul of Monet; she can't even crack a smile. She looks like a blond Dementor.Hey- I just had a thought: I continue to nominate another ""sequal"", ""Lost Horizon"" as the worst film ever made. BUT if the same crew who hatched that singing turkey really wanted to nail the title, why don't they put this ""Thomas Crown Affair"" to music! That would be the best thing since talkies. Oh, yes, and I agree about the Pepsi One performance. I found it offensive even before that commenter pointed out the ad.Not worth the popcorn, even if you're at home.",The Thomas Crown Affair
98,mikejade,Pretty good movie,6,16 July 2021,I did not like Renee Russo's performance. But that is the way the story was written. Cat and mouse. Liked the story.,The Thomas Crown Affair
99,Rhino Rover,Stylish and Smart,9,9 August 1999,"I wasn't entirely sure what to think when I first saw the commercials for this movie. The first thought was that it was a variation on another 'thief' movie that came out earlier this year - Entrapment. As a result of this attitude, I did not have high expectations. I was very wrong.The plot revolves around a very wealthy business man, Thomas Crown (Brosnan). Like Entrapment, the main character, Crown, steals art more for personal enjoyment than for money. On his latest 'acquisition', an attractive insurance agent, Catherine Banning (Russo), is brought in to find and return the missing painting. Much to the surprise of Crown, he finds that he has met his match in both intelligence and cunning and what ensues is a very smart storyline. I will not reveal much more than this as it will definitely ruin the ending of the movie.From the very beginning, it was obvious this was going to be a very stylish movie. Usually they are if Pierce Brosnan is in it but this movie seemed to take it to another level. There was an unusually large amount of musical accompaniment but it was not your conventional mainstream music. Rather it had a more artsy, jazzy contemporary feel to it, which in the overall theme of the movie, fit in very well. It gave a subtle snobish feel to it and by the end of the movie, there was a line by Denis Leary that seemed to sum it up very well. I won't tell you the line here but you will recognize it when you hear it. There were some parts where the music was a little unusual and slightly distracted from the movie but in general, it was an unusual but very effective choice.Another effective but subtle artistic choice was the vibrant colors used in this movie. In a way, it mirrored the colors used in the art being stolen and I thought worked out very well. Brosnan played his usual dapper, charming Bondish character very well. Rene Russo, however, stepped out of her tomboy type character and played a more sophisticated, feminine but cunning role. Unlike many of her other movies, she wore a dress in much of this one and instead of trading punches with her foe, she matches wits. Her performance was very well done and in some cases, she steals scenes from Brosnan. One other character that was very well done was the role of detective Michael McCann, by Denis Leary. He has proven again that he can make the transition from comedian to actor and I don't think it will be long before you see him in more prominent roles.There were a few rough spots that I did notice though. The beginning is a little confusing but it does become clear later on. In addition, there was a little bit of shameless advertising. In one case, Russo's character picks up a can of Pepsi and very clearly rotates it so that the logo is visible to the audience. There were a few other instances but this one was the most obvious. The story does slow down a bit in the middle but picks up again at the end.Despite those little bumps, I found this movie to be incredibly intelligent. The ending was absolutely brilliant. For any of you who enjoyed Entrapment, you will find this one even more enjoyable. Overall, I think this was one of the better movies of the summer. It makes you think and in some cases, definately surprises you with it's plot twists....9/10.",The Thomas Crown Affair
100,stefanhoeffllin,It thrilled MY mind!,8,30 April 2001,"Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) is a famous millionaire and owner of a bank. He´s tired of being rich. One day he steals a famous painting out of the museum. Catherine Banning (Rene Russo), an insurance-agent is trusted with the case. A game between cat and mouse begins...I must admit that I have never watched the WHOLE original movie, only a few scenes. On the DVD there was an interesting ""Making-of"" with a comparison between remake and original. The Thomas Crown played by Steve Mc Queen robbed out banks - what would probably look a little old fashioned nowadays. Now Pierce Brosnan steals famous paintings out of museums and goes to the psychiatrist - played by Faye Dunaway in a fabulous guest appearance. I think that John Mc Tiernan´s movie comes quite close to the mood of the original - thanks to Sting´s great cover-version of Noel Harrisons ""Windmills of your mind""! Not to forget Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo - what a great couple! I kept my breath during the dancing sequence. This is what I call CHEMISTRY! It´s pure MAGIC! In its style ""The Thomas Crown affair"" reminded me of genre classics like ""Out of sight"" or ""Tequila sunrise"" - they belong to my favorites! But it also works as an hommage to the great caper movies as Hitchcocks ""To catch a thief"".Surely a dignified remake - smart, sexy and romantic!",The Thomas Crown Affair
101,Soledad-2,A waste of time,4,25 January 2000,"I have not seen the original movie but, definetely, this remake deceived me. I didn't like neither Brosnan or Russo's performance.  A few times in my life I have told myself ""what a waste of time!) but after watching The Thomas Crown Affair, I did.  In my honest opinion, when a remake is done, it has to be better than the original.  I doubt that this is the case.  My rate:  4/10.",The Thomas Crown Affair
102,Old Crow-2,A classy piece of work,8,9 January 2004,"Forget all the explosions, car chases, crazy villains, special effects... The Thomas Crown Affair is not an action movie. It´s not even a thriller. Instead, it´s a well-done cat-and-mouse movie that´s smart, entertaining and very sexy. If you had to use one word to describe the film it would have to be sophisticated. The movie might appeal more to mature audiences as both the leading man and the leading lady are over 40 years old. Pierce Brosnan can obviously do other roles beside James Bond, but the role of Thomas Crown is at least somewhat similar to 007. Both guys ""enjoy women"" and are very suave. Overall, Brosnan gives a solid performance and is overshadowed only by Rene Russo who simply oozes sexuality and class. She is simply perfect in her role and though she´s twice as old as I am I find her a real knockout. Not only is she extremely hot, but also a very talented and charismatic actress. A perfect combination! The classy dance scene between Brosnan and Russo belongs to the most sexually-charged scenes in history and the following love-making scene manages to be both sexy and stylish. Usually nude scenes in Hollywood movies seem somehow ""uneasy"", but in this movie the scene is done in real style and with sensual music the atmosphere is sizzling. Who would want a disposable bimbo like Britney Spears when you could have a real class-act woman like Rene Russo? I would also like to mention Bill Conti whose simple yet refined music is simply outstanding. Just listen to the music during the scene in which Crown and Banning go glider flying... You can just close your eyes and listen to this wonderful music. Now I have to find the soundtrack for this film! I guess I should mention that I´ve never seen the original Thomas Crown, but now I don´t even have to bother as its updated version is a true pleasure to watch. I have nothing negative to say about it so just go get this film on DVD and enjoy!",The Thomas Crown Affair

104,Yonhap S,Superb!,8,18 December 1999,This is one fun movie.  I liked this far more than the dullard Entrapment. Brosnan and Russo's chemistry worked very well.  Watch out for Russo in a killer see-through dress.  Brosnan plays Thomas Crown somewhat much like his other role James Bond and I realized he gets past his legal limitation with regards to tuxedoes.The verdict: 4 of 5 stars.,The Thomas Crown Affair
105,engelst,"Crown, my name is James, uh, Thomas Crown",1,6 October 2000,"The Thomas Crown Affair is a totally superfluous remake of an earlier Norman Jewison film (which by the way I have never seen).The story is good, although it is clearly a Bond spinoff (which at the time of the original were still ""en vogue""). After a while the anachronism sets in as you start to miss the whisky glasses and sixties cars and the appropriate hairdoes.Crown (Pierce Brosnan, also producer) is a very successful broker of sorts (he has a huge metal-and-glass building full of well-dressed people bowing and clicking heels whenever he decides to show up between the yachting and lovemaking) who steals works of art. It is clear he chooses crime not for want of money but purely for the adrenalin.And that is precisely where this film falls short. Never at any time do you get that feeling of luxury combined with tension, of elegant crime perpetrated in grand manner. For two hours you see a larger version of a glossy magazine, with Brosnan and Russo as cardboard figures with toothpaste smiles, doing what is probably the most expensive ad campaign to date.",The Thomas Crown Affair
106,Buff2001,Much better than the original!,10,18 August 1999,"This was an absolutely fun remake of a good movie but why remake movies? Simple - In 31 years things have changed a lot in terms of movie skill and technology for the better.Sitting in my ultra comfy seat with my drink holder, hearing the sound track on a fantastic Sony Dynamic Digital Sound System, seeing fantastic footage and camera work on a huge screen, and watching Brosnan and Russo who were made for their roles smoothly cavort through this delightful romantic fantasy was my idea of movie heaven.Of course there was crass commercialism that came with the package.  Where have people who complain about this been? Name a movie that doesn't have some kind of commercial in it these days - or maybe you think movie makers just randomly go to some car dealer to buy the cars they use.  Don't people understand there are product placement people who make a living putting their clients' products in movies?Yes it is much more of a fantasy than the original, but I personally go to the movies to get away from the steady drum of media reality that pollutes our lives in this day and age.Escapism it is, and one of the best I've seen lately at doing its job! 10 stars!!!!",The Thomas Crown Affair

But everyone actor in it does well. I think of it as a comedy thriller/romance. You have to suspend disbelief in parts, for example folding a priceless work of art to fit it in a briefcase without breaking the frame, cracking the paint, and not even a crease when Crown places it among his 'acquisitions' at home! But this is a sophisticated piece nevertheless and well worth watching. And the last half hour is simply brilliant!",The Thomas Crown Affair

At the time of this writing the votes on this site between the two movies were only separated by a tenth of a point. It has mediocre to poor acting, but it is still quite entertaining. As a bit of trivia Faye Dunaway played Thomas Crown's shrink in this film. She also played the investigator in the earlier version, however the name of her character (Vicki Anderson) is different than the name of the investigator played by Renee Russo (Catherine Banning) in this updated version.The story is about a rich thief named Thomas Crown (Brosnan)who steals a 100 million painting by Claude Monet, but to what end. Catherine Banning (Russo) is the investigator working for the insurance company to recover the artwork. The story has some nice twists and turns. I would recommend taking a look at it. However if you have young children you may want to see the film after lights out, because of the nude/love scenes performed by Renee Russo and Pierce Brosnan.",The Thomas Crown Affair
110,jchano123,just watch the original,5,18 January 2018,"Significantly worse than the original. Russo's character in this was incredibly ditzy and came off as stupid. The other detective character played by Dunaway in the original was very smartly written and well acted. Russo has strange emphasis on certain words made no sense at all, but I couldn't tell if it was the director's choice or hers. She also resembled agent Scully from The X-Files, from her hair to her wardrobe-even some of the detectives called her spooky at one point, similar to 'spooky' Mulder. Not only that but Brosnan was James Bond at this point so it was pretty obvious that the filmmakers here were cashing in on already popular media.The romance between them didn't feel at all believable, they had no chemistry, apart form their hollywoods-status attractive looks. Russo's character was overly sexualized and seemed like she was trying to seduce every single man she walked by. It got exhausting. The sex scene went on for way too long and felt like soft core porn. Don't get me wrong, I think sex scenes can work, as they have in the past, but this got obnoxious. The score is probably the worst I've heard in my life. None of it was played at appropriate parts and it was, yet again, incredibly obnoxious when it did play, which was probably 90% of the runtime (or at least that's what it felt like).As a whole, the original was very smartly written with small ques as to what is going on in dilute for the audience to piece together, this spells everything out bluntly, making the audience feel like idiots, including countless filler scenes to pad the runtime.",The Thomas Crown Affair

It was not meant to be taken too seriously--some reviewers complain about holes in the plot--this movie is meant to be a lighthearted romantic comedy.Features an upbeat prettified New York of the rich and famous while also appealing to our antisocial natures.The only part that I could have done without were the sex scenes...both Pierce Bronson at 47 and Russo at 45 were a little too long in the tooth for torpid insatiable sex on marble stairs etc....especially Pierce looked a little saggy with out a shirt on. Ditto the true love angle at this age is unbelievable but is part of the formula. Bronson looked like he needed a few hits of amphetamines and viagra a couple times to keep up his manic behavior...The only part I didn't care for was the ending at the museum with a dozen men with bowler hats somehow confusing a large contingent of the NYPD. Too dumb.Still flawlessly filmed well acted but expensive formula star stuff..a 7 ...I am a tough but consistent grader.... 6 is boiler plate (but decent)...say a Jacqueline Suzanne novel...7 a cut above....I like sleepers and surprises.

112,jtwcosmos,The Thomas Crown Affair (1999),9,3 July 2011,"""Wanna see it?""""No.""""Sure?""This is the remake of the classic 1968 original, with Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. And because it is a remake it squarely divides people into three categories: those who loved the original, those who hated it and those who never saw it.Just like the original, the updated version is a mix of heist movie, cop thriller and romance. It has good directing, a very good cast, an excellent script and good music.Director John McTiernan does a great job. The shots are outstanding, the framing is excellent, the lighting and the positioning of the actors is very good. The moments that require the characters to be deep and thoughtful and interesting are very well done, featuring the director's trademark of cutting actor's faces just below the hairline, a shot that he seems to enjoy very much. A shot that if done right works magic. The passion for carefully framing the shots is a trait he shares with Norman Jewison, the director of the original. Unfortunately, both directors tend to abuse this kind of shots and they rarely and reluctantly let the camera show more than a very tight angle, which practically ruins every single shot that involves high speed action. And this is why I think McTiernan's ""Rollerball"" - the other remake based on Norman Jewison's work - was such a failure.The cast is very good. Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo have powerful performances as leads, and Denis Leary has a very good supporting role. Brosnan does a very believable playboy and when compared with McQueen he holds his ground well. His character is a little more sophisticated than the original, and that has been attributed to his days as James Bond. I think the simple truth is that this type of role fits him like a glove. Rene Russo's character is far better and far more believable than that of Faye Dunaway, her maturity working much better for the role of the sophisticated man hunter. Plus her character has a lot more to do and a lot more dept. Leary is great as a balancing counterweight for the pair, even if his character has much less to do than the original. Nonetheless, he is given ample chance to build and develop and that works very well. Faye Dunaway has a tiny role, in recognition of her work in the 1968 version.The script is far superior to the original and it manages to keep the viewer interested and entertained for the duration, trimming out some of the boring or awkward parts. Nevertheless, there are small passages that are taken from the original, shot for shot, word for word. The parts the two leads play require them to display more passion, to generate more tension and generally show a much broader range of emotion, which makes their story heartwarming and endearing. Were the first movie started strong but then went to sleep, the remake manages to keep going strong, even if it lags somewhat after the introduction. One strong point of the remake was how it dealt with the changes in technology and economic realities. A weaker point would be the problems with script believability, an area where it plays fast and loose but that's OK, because so did the original. The game of chess in the first movie was replaced by a much more sophisticated game of cat and mouse, and the movie is not shy about showing all the thrills, tension, fun and emotion that go with it.The music is good and it complements the action well. It is as much a character as it was in the first movie, only a lot less loud. It could be said that the music and some of the long sequences of empty space in the middle could have been cut down a little, but they stop short of becoming long and boring. Plus they are visually beautiful.The Thomas Crown Affair. A very good remake, that still keeps a lot of the original. 9/10.",The Thomas Crown Affair

I have never seen any Steve Mcqueen movie, so I can't compare him to Pierce Brosnan. What I can say is this is a very sexy and fun movie.Crown is the type of rich, suave character Brosnan was born to play. If you liked him as Remington Steele or James Bond, you will enjoy this character. Rene Russo has been lucky enough to not only get great roles, but to work with some of the top actors in Hollywood. Russo and Brosnan are great together. These 40-something actors burn up the screen in their sex scenes. Russo is totally sexy here, especially when she shakes her behind while wearing a see-through dress. Denis Leary is terrific in a small part as a cop. I wish he'd had a bigger role.The Thomas Crown Affair is a fun movie. At a time when so many teenage movies are being made, it's refreshing to see two sexy older stars who get to frolic and have fun on-screen.",The Thomas Crown Affair
115,preppy-2,Half a good movie,5,24 August 1999,"This remake of the 1968 film is, during its first half, better than the original.  It moves quickly, is well-directed  and Brosnan and especially Russo are great.  Cool sex scenes too.  But halfway through Brosnan takes Russo to his island getaway (and I'm not giving anything away--it's in the coming attractions), and the movie falls apart.  It still LOOKS good, but the story gets repititous, confusing, needlessly convoluted and downright boring.  There's one good twist near the end but the very end is very insulting to the audience.  The only thing that kept me watching during the second half is the excellent direction, great music score and (again) Brosnan and Russo.  These two put to shame McQueen and Dunaway from the original (nice touch to have Dunaway play Crown's psychiatrist).  Team them up together, hopefully with a better script.",The Thomas Crown Affair
116,Parks,Bad Movie Alert!! AOOOGAH! AOOOGAH!!,1,19 August 1999,"This is a heist movie.  So they claim.  All the adverts show Pierce Brosnan nabbing off with works of art, and then being chased by Rene Russo in a cat-and-mouse game of nerves.  The adverts LIE!!!To be fair there are two robberies in this film, one at the very beginning which is ""quite clever"" and one at the end which is ""very clever"". Neither of them are clever enough to warrant suffering through the rest of this AWFUL film however.You see, Thomas Crown is a billionaire businessman who is BORED.  Poor lamb. So he gets his fun by stealing paintings.  Rene Russo is also BORED.  She enjoys chasing Crown because he's a challenge.  He enjoys her for the same reason.  And both of them are very BORED and very CLEVER and very IRRITATING.The most part of this movie then, is taken up with a romance between these self-involved, mindless, hedonistic characters.  And frankly I couldn't wait for Dennis Leary (playing the cop) to catch them both and send them to Texas for a lethal injection.At one point in the movie Rene Russo throws a Renoir on a fire and the both of them look on like this is a fine old joke.  Now I know it's just a movie, and I shouldn't take it seriously but this is not the sort of action that makes me LIKE a character.  This just makes me want to get right up there on the screen with them and bang their heads together.Sorry for being so crabby.  But this film sucked.

He is a cool and canning individual bent on doing the impossible and confidently planning to get away with it. She is an experienced and skillful investigator bent on pursuing her target and catching him red-handed. Their relationship is the centerpiece of the cat and mouse thriller captivating the riveted and envious viewers. That's how it was in 1968 with Steven McQueen and Faye Dunaway and the very same thing is happening in the 1999 remake with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo. But what a delicious difference. It is hard to believe that only 3 decades ago we were considering the Norman Jewison technique of split screens a revolutionary invention and were so impressed with it. I watched the remake first and then wanted to see the original. It was so difficult to get used to the slow pace and lackadaisical (as it seemed) unfolding of the 1968 prototype. Brilliant and precise rhythm of Brosnan's Thomas Crown is almost mesmerizing. Rene Russo is a powerhouse of feminine high voltage energy.

Brosnan and Russo are pleasant to look at (depending on your preference) and they both do a good job of playing people who are used to getting everything they want.  It's a kick to see how the rich and beautiful enjoy their wealth and beauty.  The biggest flaw (besides some plot loophole, such as how an old masterpiece could be folded in half and exposed to water with no discernible damage) is the semi-obligatory cameo by Faye Dunaway as Crown's psychiatrist, who says nothing terribly insightful and whose scenes merely slow down the proceedings.  Dennis Leary is also good in an unusually sympathetic role for him.  A piece of fluff, but a good-looking, well done piece with real chemistry between the leads.",The Thomas Crown Affair

All in CinemaScope.And frankly, sometimes that's enough for me -- the kind of movies that Pauline Kael calls ""great pop trash.""Sure, the script could be better, and some of Ms. Russo's outfits are so over-the-top as to be giggle-worthy, but I was thoroughly and utterly entertained.

I loved ""Entrapment"", but this one blew away everything. Once again I would like to know what more could people want? Pierce Brosnan is simply incredible. Only he could have played this role.
The director's use of background music is just pure joy. The photography, the locations, the entire feeling of the movie is something special. The romance is the way it should be and there is no emotional stress involved.
Most of all, its a movie that is about using your head. Alfred Hitchcock would be proud of this movie. Its refreshing to see mature actors, instead of usual loud-mouth hyper teenagers. There is no shouting, no shooting, no cursing, no chasing, just pure fun, joy, and romance. Kudos to the director for not attempting to spice it up with needless morbid violence and over-acting.You will remain in good mood for long time after watching this beautiful master-piece.",The Thomas Crown Affair
122,MundaneNoodle,Why was this and Entrapment released so close together?,5,24 January 2000,"And why are both so dumb and unrealistic? Ok, I can suspend my disbelief for the sake of a good movie. But this is not one of those times. It's Hollywood escapism at its worst. I guess the message to all the young ladies out there is: If your are good-looking and sassy enough like Rene Russo or Faye Dunaway, some very rich and handsome man will wisk you away to a tropical island, shower you with lavish gifts and expensive restaurants. While all the time being utterly fantastic in bed. That film premise might have worked thirty or forty years ago, but today it's insulting. Come on, this wasn't even a good story! It was so predictable, that I left the movie for a full half hour, came back and knew exactly what was going on. This movie offered very little surprises, save for where the painting finally turned up. So let me get this straight; it's alright for a spoiled rich guy to steal priceless paintings, as long as he puts them back; and in way so he doesn't get caught? A big happy, sappy ending in which you don't mind a criminal getting away because he's good-looking, rich, and loves the woman. This is how Hollywood operates, and I'm getting so tired of it.",The Thomas Crown Affair
123,mhoney-1,One of the best romantic pairings in recent years,9,14 April 2004,"Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo are electrifying in this clever romantic thriller. They bring a much-needed maturity to their characters as a businessman/art thief and insurance investigator, respectfully. The movie works on a number of levels, but it is a character-driven film all the way.Thomas Crown is a man who has it all. He's wealthy, and has plenty of time to take off to look at the paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan. But one day, while security is diverted by a Trojan Horse scheme, he walks in and takes a valuable piece of art. The cat-and-mouse game begins.The art-thief story takes a back seat to his ambiguous romance with the insurance investigator who was sent to find it. She knows he took it, and he knows she knows. He even plays games with her. He hands her a covered painting he says is what she's looking for, and she throws it in the fire without even looking.Bottom line, it's all fun and games. The closest thing to an explosion or anything is when three men pop out of a Trojan Horse during the actual theft. When all is said and done, you know everyone has had a great time making this film. It reminded me in a few very elementary ways of the atrocious ""Entrapment,"" only done right for a change.",The Thomas Crown Affair

Overall it exuded class, with exotic, beautifully shot locations, exotic and interesting characters (great casting!) and an engaging score to boot.Regarding other comments, I don't know why so many people are comparing it to Entrapment, the connection didn't spring to mind at all for me. Also I don't know why so many people are slating this film, as it seems to have elements that would appeal to a wide range of viewers. Maybe these elements were so well balanced that they cancelled each other out for viewers interested in only one side of the story.I haven't seen the original so can't compare, but I think this is a very good film on its own and voted it a 9.",The Thomas Crown Affair

128,Movieguy-47,Gentleman Thief Movie At Its Epitome,8,7 August 1999,"THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR. John McTiernan's ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" shows the gentleman thief movie at its true epitome. The film is enjoyable, slick, and sometimes amusing; the lead character also has the same three qualities.Thomas Crown (played by Pierce Brosnan) is ""a millionaire with everything."" Just for kicks, he decides to steal a Monet painting worth one hundred million dollars. His obstacle: Catherine Banning (Rene Russo), a beautiful insurance investigator who loves the chase her job allows her to pursue. A seductive game of cat-and-mouse ensues, and it's a worthy guessing game as to which one of the two leads is one step ahead in the race.The summer of 1999 began and ends with two enjoyable gentleman thief movies. ""Entrapment,"" with Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones, was perhaps more exciting than ""The Thomas Crown Affair,"" but the latter entry offers more romance and a tighter plot.

With so many movies now which feel like pastiches, or just very cynical and very dead formulaic rehashes, there's a cheesy popcorn heartbeat to this movie that's a reminder of a simpler and less complicated era in movies.The chemistry between the leads is also just spectacular, so perhaps for most this movie will boil down to how much they like the lead actors, and like them together in this.

132,louiss,Better than the original,10,26 July 1999,A near perfect 10 from start to finish. A purely entertaining smartly written slick film. One of the rare occasions where a remake is better than the original and the original was pretty good but not nearly as intricate nor did it have the delicious suprises of the new one. My only criticism and its a small one Rene Russo is not as sexy or seductive as a young Faye Dunaway but she is equally convincing as the determined insurance investigator. What a breath of fresh air to see a terrific summer entertainment film without mindless over the top action sequences and special effects. If thats what your looking for skip it but if you want to have a good time and put a smile on your face your in for a real treat.,The Thomas Crown Affair
133,Stroheim-3,Not Exactly What I Had Expected,7,9 August 1999,"I have to be honest; I walked into The Thomas Crown Affair expecting a James Bond type of movie.  I mean, I haven't seen the original yet (and I stress yet), so I didn't know what it was about apart from what I had gleaned from the trailer.  Well, it wasn't James Bond.And that is not a bad thing.The beginning of the film (no not the credits; I'm referring to the theft sequence) was totally McTiernan.  I mean I could see Hans Gruber and his European cronies pulling that off exactly the same way, and THAT is cool.  I thought this would set the pace for the rest of the film, but I soon found out I was wrong.And that is not a bad thing.I can't say the movie was slow, because it really wasn't.  It kept my interest even though I really couldn't see Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan getting together.  Maybe that's just me.  It seemed that their sex-capades were merely a game, and I didn't quite like that.  Neither had anything to gain from that.Then it hit me.  The theft, the stolen painting was a ""MacGuffin!""  It really has nothing to do with the story.  The story was about Rene Russo's character finding love and happiness.  Like Joan Fontaine in Hitchcock's Suspicion, Russo is in a relationship with a man whose ability to be trusted is constantly in question by both her and the audience.  Thomas Crown's reliability and trustworthiness is the premise of the film.  The barriers to which Rene Russo can determine these factors is illustrated through their game of cat-and-mouse.  It is truly an interesting move to make her the film's protagonist, but as I said before, I have not seen the original.I must say, I never believed that Crown would end up in jail.  If that possibility existed, it would have made the film a better movie.  On the other hand, I was not sure how he would get away with it.  It was a nice move - not quite what I had expected...And that is not a bad thing.  Definitely above average.  That's about it.",The Thomas Crown Affair

135,slothropgr,Shows that McT CAN do a remake,9,1 March 2008,"Like Sting's rendition of ""Windmills of Your Mind"" compared to Noel Harrison's, this is SO much better than the original, which was all surface and style and flash, with the gloss and depth of floor polish (1 coat). Brosnan and Russo aren't as all-out glamorous as McQ and Faye, but much more apt to their roles and they do strike sparks with each other. The difficulties of these two closed-off people finding each other in the midst of a major theft investigation are clearly shown. The movie does exactly what great remakes should and damned few do because the phrase ""great remake"" is an oxymoron. It plays off the original, updates it and makes it fit into a different world, entertains equally those who've seen the original (by confounding their expectations at every turn) and those who haven't. The various facets of the plot fit more tightly together and all obey Poe's dictum about short stories--every word bends toward the finale. As an example: the gratuitous ""other woman"" in the original, seemingly there only for a cool gliding sequence and to make Faye's character jealous, becomes an integral part of the story. Russo's Katherine Banning is given more opportunities to be smart and perceptive than Dunaway's, while Brosnan's Crown is softer and more sympathetic. He actually has a character arc, which is more than can be said for McQ's one-note samba. Dennis Leary's cop is also given a character and an arc, instead of being merely a sounding board and moral finger-pointer like Paul Burke. The music is great, especially the use of ""Sinner Man"" which began turning up everywhere after this came out. And one more subtle concordance I didn't notice till the DVD came out: the autumn leaves really are turning to the color of Rene Russo's hair.",The Thomas Crown Affair

The fact that the name-carrier of James Bond (Pierece Brosnon) would be chosen for this role is pure genius. He had the role down-pat! Very slick!Opposite of him was an actress who has been ignored for major movies roles besides, ""Get Shorty"" and ""Lethal Weapon 3"" and 4. Rene Russo stunned the audience with her new form of, ""physical acting"". Her show of sensuality relaxed her role and formed it to be very classy, but sneaky at the same time. Ahh, and the verbally-powerful Denis Leary. What a pro-star! His first serious role but he still kept the humor in the story. It was quite hilarious how Russo was always one step ahead of Leary, but it was also hilarious how Brosnon was ALWAYS two steps ahead of everyone else.
So overall, the three main characters took this movie and soared with it. If you have just finished reading this review, and you want to go see, ""The Thomas Crown Affair"", then by all means, enjoy yourself, and the ending. :)",The Thomas Crown Affair
137,Robert-132,A nice diversion for an afternoon...,7,11 August 1999,"This was not a bad film, but also not the film of the year by any stretch of the imagination.  Pierce Brosnan plays Thomas Crown, a billionaire who is completely bored with life.  As a diversion, he steals a Monet painting worth $100 million from a museum.  This results in a cat-and-mouse game with an insurance investigator (Rene Russo).The film certainly has its charm.  I never thought a robbery could be so delightful to see on screen, but somehow this movie does it.  Brosnan and Russo also have a great deal of chemistry on screen.  So, what is wrong?The pacing, for a start.  This film is incredibly slow.  I am not saying that it should have a few explosions; indeed, it is extremely nice that it didn't.  However, a film can be fast paced without incredible amounts of property damage, and this just wasn't.Secondly, the sex scenes somehow manage not to work.  Brosnan and Russo steam up the screen while they are fully clothed, but as soon as they take it off and go at it, something is lost and never found again.  It feels as though they were put in as filler just so that the audience could see Rene Russo naked.However, the film could have been much worse, all things considered.  As it was, it was a pleasant and charming diversion for an afternoon. 3.5/5.",The Thomas Crown Affair

Pierce Brosnan is not at his usual standard like in the James Bond films and Rene Russo was almost perfect for her character. The chemistry between the two of them was kind of- lets see- um, boring? Although the robbery scenes were fairly entertaining and you get a few chuckles out of the scene with the Trojan horse, the point of the movie is hard to find and the movie is definitely not unique in the slightest. Its definitely not the first time we've come across a female detective who seems to only care about sleeping with the suspects of crimes she is investigating.

Sorry for all you fans. That one was pretentious and tried too hard to be ""groundbreaking"". That said, this version is smart, mature, and makes us wonder what is around the next corner for these two characters - who are too slick for their own good sometimes. I appreciate the honesty that two grown-ups with careers and money are still trying to find themselves - and find love in each other.

140,shushens,Smooth and Deep,7,15 January 2008,"Fist time, it impresses you as a quality thriller. Second time, it impresses you as a quality romantic thriller. Third time, it looks much deeper into the human mind.This movie is not made for general audience. If you advise your kids not to play with fire because they may burn their pretty hands, make sure they don't watch this film. If they don't spoil, they will flood IMDb bragging about how it hurt their sense of morality. For a very few, who live in a league isolated and unmistakable with a common man's, morality takes after a different sort of definition. When you are in their game, and you sense adrenaline flowing through your veins like you never expected it to, the definition of morality becomes abrasive.Thomas Crown is a billion dollar man with many million dollar plans that often fail to rescue him from the quotidian ennui. Katherine Benning is not so much of a an elite herself but more like a hunter of elite criminals who do it just to see if they can get away with it. They see each other, play the cat and mouse game, and don't realize when the game became their life.Wonderful movie. I give it a 7 because at the first glance, it's light in nature.

It was an interesting blend of being sort of a guy flick, but sort of a gal flick at the same time. Without giving any spoilers, I would best describe this movie as one big long seduction.

144,MaRX-4,BRILLIANT!,7,25 September 1999,"What do you get for the man that has everything? Apparently a mindless remake. John McTiernan's version of the 1968 film starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway falls short of actual amusement and is even occasionally excruciating  save the brilliant ending that easily one-ups its predecessor. Leonard Maltin called the original `perfect non-think entertainment,' and the remake offers more of the same.Pierce Brosnan plays Thomas Crown, an art-loving multimillionaire who spends his time plotting the perfect heist. Like the original, most of the film's first half-hour is devoted to the theft of a valuable painting from a museum (originally just over $2 million, but here a $100 million Monet). Catherine Banning (Rene Russo, Lethal Weapon 4) is an insurance agent for the museum and, together with NYPD detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary, True Crime), immediately suspects Crown and tries to mount her case against him. The trouble is that somewhere along the line, Banning mounts more than her case.Casting-wise, the suave and debonair Brosnan is a much better choice than McQueen, but Russo is downright horrible in Dunaway's role. She looks awful and acts even worse. Leary seems lost as the cop and the film could have used more of his sarcastic spunk. The score never really seemed to fit the picture, and viewers will have a hard time connecting with any of the characters. Those responsible for the updated script include Leslie Dixon (the abominable That Old Feeling) and Kurt Wimmer (Sphere). Of other note, viewers should now know to be wary of any film that prominently displays a bowler hat (remember The Avengers?).Alan Trustman's original screenplay (he also wrote the superior McQueen vehicle Bullitt) may have seemed invigorating in 1968, but today seems as stale as a cardboard pizza with felt pepperoni  especially since we all recently suffered through a very similar cat-and-mouse chase in Entrapment. The original, directed by Norman Jewison (Moonstruck), was shot by the legendary Haskell Wexler (Limbo) and included the use of what I like to call Brady Bunch windows  several smaller multi-image screens that make up the entire frame. Also look for Dunaway, who plays Crown's shrink in the updated version.",The Thomas Crown Affair

This is clear in the dialog she gave to the character portrayed by Faye Done Away. I know that's not how her name is spelled but then I M D B thinks her last name is a prohibited word. Idiots. Anyway, in the movie, the shrink accuses Thomas Crown of being a Peter Pan. How convenient to forget Jesus saying ""You must become like little children"". So when men do, women rag on them for being little boys. Also implied in the dialog of the shrink is a reluctance to commit, a common complaint of women about men, completely ignoring the fact that the man HAS committed.

148,snaunton,"Clever, exciting, but a silly plot",6,11 March 2000,"It is difficult to judge the remake of The Thomas Crown Affair without continually comparing, and contrasting, it with the superb original which it touches at many points.  Yet it is far from being a pastiche.  The fundamentals of the plot are the same in both cases: crime as a diversion from extreme wealth and alienation, and the mutual fascination of investigator and investigated.  In the original, Steve McQueen's Crown was as serious and professional about the theft of money as he was about everything else in his life.  The problem with the plot of this version is that the crime is just too much of a hobby, too much of a silly game intended to indulge Crown's whimsy or to please a girl.  His alienation, especially as evidenced in the rather ridiculous sessions with the psychiatrist (Faye Dunaway), seems merely inconsequential, even childish.Denise Russo's Catherine Banning is interestingly different from the Vicky of the original.  They are alike in being roles that require little action or acting, but Miss Russo's investigator is an intriguing confusion of the sophisticated with the banal, of the sleek with the tawdry, with none of the dependence of slight gestures to signify major transformations.  The central game that made the 1968 original a masterpiece, that defining game of chess, is absent in the remake.  It turns out that after a little attention and a few days in the Caribbean, Banning falls for her man.  Just like that. There is no tension to it, nor, despite all the talk of it, is there really any sense of a cat and mouse contest.  Although Banning is given, and takes, the opportunity to betray Crown, she is not the master of this game - throughout, it is Crown who sets the rules and leads the play.  And, in the end, it is he who gets the girl on his terms: the uncertainty and ambiguity, that in 1968 had peppered the relationship of Crown and Vicky right through to the end, is absent in the newer version.Still, this is an enjoyable and clever movie, with good performances from the two leading characters.  They completely eclipse the rest of the cast. The final museum scene, with Magritte's derby multiplying exponentially, is well done and tremendous fun.  Russo's portrayal of social ambiguity and slightly forced sensuality are particularly admirable.  A strange sidelight on her role is cast by her preoccupation with liquids, the consumption of which seems almost a fetish.  She consumes, often noisily, a vast quantity and range of fluids during this movie, from vintage champagne to a product most closely resembling sludge.  Perhaps this affectation exposes the fundamental absurdity of the plot, an absurdity that is there in the original, but to which we there willingly surrender.  Here, in 1999, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it's just silly.",The Thomas Crown Affair

152,Linda-21,A Nothing Movie,3,28 August 1999,"Starring Pierce Brosnan as a wealthy banker who steals fine art because of the thrill of it and Renee Russo as an insurance investigator, this film is supposed to be witty, sophisticated and interesting.There are some cleverly conceived capers which are so unreal as to be comical, a clash of egos between the two lead characters who never rise above their pretentious characterizations, and some supposed  sex scenes which show off the photographer's use of creative camera angles but lack any bit of real eroticism.  The characters play mind games with each other and that's supposed to be sexy.  The degree of luxury is unreal, and although Russo wears a different outfit in every scene, she never seems really attractive.  Neither does Brosnan.  Basically, they seem like dressed up dolls playing a silly game.Faye Dunaway, who was in the original 1968 version with Steve McQueen, has a small and silly part as Brosnan's psychiatrist.  Ben Gazzara also has a tiny part as Brosnan's lawyer.At no time did I identify with or have any feeling for any of the cardboard characters.  And there wasn't enough action to call this an action movie. I never got into the story and was bored throughout.Not recommended.",The Thomas Crown Affair
153,koconnor-1,"""Thomas"" is the ""Crown"" Jewel for your collection... SEE IT!",9,4 May 2001,"This DVD was an impulse buy, pure and simple.  My wife and I like Pierce Brosnan, and I have enjoyed Renee Russo's other works, so what did I have to lose?  Only my mind!  This film was positively one of the most enjoyable, nail-biting, suspenseful romantic capers ever made.  A remake of the steamy 1968 Steve McQueen flick updated to the sleek and self-referential 90s, ""Thomas Crown"" features Brosnan as the title character - a bored billionaire businessman in the business of ""acquisitions"".  For a thrill, he heists an extremely valuable Monet from the New York Museum right under the noses of security guards, cops, and about a thousand unsuspecting museum-goers.  Renee Russo is the very sexy, very worldly Catherine Banning, whose insurance company underwrites the painting - and she is determined to get it back at any cost... But the cost just may be her soul as she woos, and then falls under the spell of the enigmatic Crown.  Will Russo discover the location of the Monet?  Will she rat out Thomas Crown? Or is Crown manipulating her affections like Bobby Fisher manipulates the pieces on a chess board?What we have here is a high-speed chase film whose vehicle is clever dialog, rich and exotic direction, and more than a little sexual tension!  Brosnan, as Crown, is ever the cool Brit charmer whose every word and action are as calculated as the movements of a Rolex.  Russo smoulders every time she appears on screen.  And when the two of them get together, the chemical reaction is pure dynamite.Dennis Leary has a nice bit as a streetwise NYPD detective on the case, who dispenses advice to Russo's Banning, and watches her begin to spiral out of control.  His role here most likely resulted in the deserved attempt at a television series on ABC (""The Job"").The action in the film moves exotically from caper to cover-up and back with dizzying speed... All the while, we are kept guessing about the motivations of the two lead, and find ourselves eagerly anticipating their next move. When the final checkmate comes, we are left totally bewildered, befuddled, and baffled... which is most-likely the director's intention!On all levels, ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" will steal the hearts of men and women alike... but for different reasons - Men can enjoy the action and thrill of the chase, and Crown's ability to win over the most beautiful women and his attempt to get away with the ultimate heist... Ladies can marvel at the suave Brosnan and his life of extreme wealth, and all-the-while wonder if he will betray her, or if she will betray him...I will not betray you... I ain't saying!",The Thomas Crown Affair

Taken on its own, I liked this flic more than I expected to, mostly because of the clever ways the art works disappeared and reappeared, and the clever by-play between our two stars.  The shots were crisp, and the film editing was very good.  The story went by fast, which meant I was involved and liked it.  If you see this one, as in the old shell game, keep you eye on the pea (or the paintings, in this case).",The Thomas Crown Affair
155,Curtize,This is the film that Entrapment wanted to be.,7,28 August 1999,"The Thomas Crown Affair		-	***Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) is a billionaire Manhattan playboy who has everything a man could desire - fame, fortune, success, even adventure.  The adventure is supplied by Crown's risky leisure interests, which include sailing, gliding, and art theft.  The movie opens with an elaborate heist of a priceless Monet from a heavily guarded gallery in New York.  It is a long, complex, and wonderful sequence which keeps the audience guessing about its eventual outcome.  Enter police detective Michael McCann (Denis Leary) and insurance investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo,) who join forces to recover the painting.  McCann is quickly frustrated by Banning's tactics, which include approaching Crown and boldly announcing that he is the guilty party.  What Banning understands, and McCann does not, is that Crown is basically a bored rich kid in search of a thrill.  And what better thrill than to seduce an investigator who knows you are guilty, and will do anything to prove it?If the plot sounds familiar, that's because it is.  This story was originally told in the 1968 film of the same name, which starred Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway, directed by Norman Jewison.  In that version, however, Thomas Crown was a bank robber.  But more likely audiences will be reminded of Entrapment, a film which came out earlier this year starring Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  It, too, featured a rich art thief and a beautiful insurance investigator who conducted an affair while simultaneously plotting against each other.  Of the two recent films, The Thomas Crown Affair is the more effective one. The success of this story depends entirely upon the chemistry between the leads.  We must believe that they are truly attracted to each other.  We do. After all, who would not be attracted to either Pierce Brosnan or Rene Russo?  (And what a wonderful decision to cast the female role in the same age bracket as the leading man.  Sadly, this is so rare as to be groundbreaking.)  We must also believe that each party in the relationship is capable of swindling, even abandoning, the other.  While the attraction between Crown and Banning is evident, both actors maintain enough detachment to make the viewer believe they could each lower the boom on the other at any moment.  The relationship is like a chess game, where each participant has hidden agendas that play out in the background while the romance fills the foreground.Unfortunately, the screenplay calls for the Russo character to lose her edge fairly early in the game.  Previously a hard-bitten investigator, she eventually degenerates into a lovesick puppy.  This softening  of her character, coupled with the overly conventional ending that it generates, is the movie's greatest flaw.  But along the way, the viewer is treated to a well-made film.  The locations are picturesque, from Crown's palatial Manhattan office to his secluded Martinique retreat.  And the impeccable wardrobe seems to have been provided primarily by Giorgio Armani.  Finally, the movie ends with yet another astounding gallery heist even more daring and original than the first.  Robberies aside, however, the thrill of this picture is in wondering which of the lover/competitors will win the game. The disappointment comes when we realize there will be a draw.",The Thomas Crown Affair
156,sgpfan,Slick,8,11 June 2005,"Those who maintain that remakes never are as good as the original on which they are based should take a look at this film.Pierce Brosnan recaptures the rebellious cool that Steve McQueen displayed in the original film of the same name and adds a further gloss and polish to the character.While the story line remains basically true to the original, it has been modernised and comes across even tighter.As in the original, Thomas Crown is a successful businessman to whom everything comes easily, so much so that everyday dealings leave him bored. Bored enough to strike out in a non-violent way and stage a super art heist, where the thrill of staging the caper and the following cat and mouse game to stay ahead of a feisty female insurance investigator assigned to the case provides the kicks he is missing.Eventually and expectedly, the relationship develops and the viewer is dragged on an interlude of exotic locales besotted with the props of a very good life.The lead players display a sizzling chemistry that propels the film along at a scorching pace, culminating in an ending that is better resolved than the original McQueen edition if you are a sentimentalist.Good support cast, with a cameo by Faye Funaway (who was the female lead for the original), help the film along. If one listens carefully to the background music, the original theme ('Windmills Of Your Mind') may also be heard. It is touches like these that pay homage to the original version, while allowing this renewed edition to have an identity all its own.Overall, a classy and dynamic remake that scores highly on its own.",The Thomas Crown Affair
157,givantha,An Affair of Heist Proportions!,8,11 September 1999,"I liked this movie,it was fun and entertaining at the same time!Unlike it's predecessor Entrapment this movie does not deal with alot of action,instead it has a really nice Affair between the two leads Brosnan(Thomas Crown) and Russo(Banning).A neat opening sequence full of suspense and Brosnan plays Crown with his Eyes Wide Shut..(aham) because he fits the role like a glove and Russo gets a rare chance to show-off her really sexy side especially during the Dance sequence with her netted evening gown.Hot!The film involves a Billionnare businessman(Crown) bored with life who  in turn steals a 100 million dollar painting (A Monet) and finds out the greatest challenge is yet to be faced....a relationship.Enter Rene Russo who plays a insurance investigator Catherine Banning set out to find the thief.A nice soundtrack with some really cool photography and the perfect ward drobe.Directed by John Mctiernan(Die Hard With A Vengence and Predator) keeps the film engaging on all aspects and delivers one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen in a long time.Good for Brosnan as well who also happens to be the Producer of this film.",The Thomas Crown Affair

Strangely, in view of the changes in the social status of women since the original, the lead woman seems to have lost power and status since the original.  Victoria Anderson was Thomas Crown's match, and some, but Catherine Banning just caves in at the first sniff of pheromones. I thought Pierce Brosnan was a little more attractive than Steve McQueen, but he is not such a good actor, and Rene Russo looked cheap, superficial and unattractive, and I really didn't care whether she got him or not.  One was driven to ask what he wanted with her.  There was too much unneeded sex, presumably to keep up excitement levels when the plot was flagging, and too much use of Crown's lavish lifestyle.  Okay we knew he was a rich man, enough already!  The ending sucks.  An innocuous way to pass part of a Saturday evening and that's all.",The Thomas Crown Affair
159,Lag2Deth,"An improvement on the original. No classic, though.",6,18 October 1999,"I liked this better than the 1968 original, but neither of them lived up to the promise of the premise.I like heist stuff; the complex plans, the sneaky execution. This 1999 remake had a lot more of that sort of thing than the original did, which was a plus for me.Then of course, the romance comes along to muck everything up. For some reason, someone thought it necessary to include a great deal of sex and nudity. (And hey, I enjoy a little female skin as much as the next guy, but there comes a point when even I start thinking ""Why doesn't she just put her shirt on and get on with the story?"")Although I've always liked Rene Russo, her character here is not well done. She's supposed to come across as one of those fictional movie women who is just better at everything than anyone you've ever met. She's more intelligent, more talented, more experienced, more passionate, more daring, etc. But she comes across as over-the-top rather than larger-than-life. It's a screenplay problem, or maybe a directorial problem, not her fault, but it's a shame.Pierce Brosnan is very good for this part, I think, and his character (having a lot in common with James Bond and Remington Steele) is less of a stretch for him. His Thomas Crown is cool, calculating, and sophisticated. He's always one step (or more) ahead of everyone else in the movie, but you don't end up hating him for it.All in all, an entertaining evening for the bargain-basement $2 admission I paid. I wouldn't have been too happy paying full price, though.6/10",The Thomas Crown Affair
160,Tim Gomersall,A thriller? No one under thirty? Surely not...,10,6 September 1999,"I never saw the original. I have no idea whether or not Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway's chess scene was more erotically charged than Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo's more direct scene-on-the-stairs. I loved this film; I got my £5.00's worth and I'm happy.It was just so good to see a tightly worked thriller with no-one under thirty in it; having recently seen 'Cruel Intentions' (ie Dangerous-Liasons-Lite with Sarah Michelle Gellar and hip young co-stars making a mess of a perfectly good story), it was good to see that McTiernan and Brosnan had obviously realised that to make a good remake you don't have to half the age of the cast. It was smart, sexy, had a couple of great twists and had my undivided attention from start to finish.
Dennis Leary finally played the straight man I've always suspected he could, Rene Russo managed to convey pure sexuality without compromising the 'worthy adversary' aspects of her role, and Pierce... well, I didn't think it was possible for him to up the cool from his James Bond levels, but Thomas Crowne blows 007 out of the water. If you haven't seen this film, go and see it if you get the chance. If you've seen the original and want to tell me exactly why it's so much better than the original, feel free to do so. I maintain, however, that the most important thing is to leave the cinema happy, which I did. Whether or not this is a remake, it's a great movie.Thanks for reading.",The Thomas Crown Affair

Russo's laugh drove my wife crazy - it's a bit overdone and piercing at times. Also, I don't think she was the ideal pick - just didn't fit the role as someone else might have - seemed like trying to put a round peg into a square hole. The wardrobe people could have done a better job - Brosnan's attire was a bit boring at times - too many solid blue shirts - the only variation was white - boring.

163,Nick-290,Sexy movie worth watching,9,6 March 2001,"I like the original Thomas Crown Affair (the erotic chess scene is one of the best film scenes of the 60s). The remake is different but also very enjoyable. Brosnan and Russo have chemistry, their affair is intellectual, challenging and sexy. (Although most of the nude scenes are shot in the dark, some people here complain about the nudity and call it pornographic, which gives them away as bible belt purists, who do not know what they are talking about. There is more naked flesh in every James Bond.) But the movie does not need the overtly erotic scenes to carry its message (in fact I saw the absolutely flesh free airline version prior to the uncut version).Russo has the sex appeal of a mature woman, who knows exactly what she wants. To match Brosnan with her, instead of a twentysomething blonde bimbo, shows how important her role in the movie is, and is mandatory for us to believe why Thomas Crown is ready to give everything up for her. He could have any bimbo he wants, but that is not what he is after. He wants a soul mate, not a brainless doll.SPOILER ALERT ON: There are some unexplainable parts in the plot (how on earth does the Monet fit into the much smaller briefcase without folding it? How can you paint with WATERCOLOUR over an OIL PAINTING. The paint does not stick to the canvas and the messy result would never fool the experts of the museum. How did he steel the second picture?)

There's an okay love-making scene on a stairway, a terrifically sexy ballroom dance, a topless beach scene, and a roll in the sack.

165,diffusionx,"A Dull, Boring, Overrated Mess of a Film",2,9 April 2000,"I could see that the people that did Thomas Crown Affair were going for a stylish, intriguing, sexy, and classy film. However, it just didn't work. The different ""action"" scenes (like when Thomas goes to steal the first painting) lacks flair or style - I immediately thought of comparing it to the opening sequence of Michael Mann's ""Heat"", and I noticed how little flair this movie has in it. Rene Russo's character is amazingly arrogant and snobbish - she did a pretty good job in the role (although it was not all that well written), but it's hard to like her. Pierce Brosnan did an okay job but his character wasn't that likable. The ""cat and mouse game"" the two were playing wasn't all that convincing - it just didn't seem like they had much chemistry.The sex sequences were overrated and dull, and they were also far too long - they didn't have to be in the film in this quantity. While I guess they were in there to try and emphasize the ""cat and mouse"" game that Brosnan and Russo were playing, the end result was just that the filmmakers were going for ""shock value"", because they were simply pointless.This movie was also saddled with one of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard - sequences that were intended to be intriguing and exciting were stuck with some of the worst ""jazz"" I've ever heard in my life. The music deflated the movie a great deal.In its credit, this movie did pick up at the very end (when Crown deliversthe stolen painting back), and it was enjoyable at the very end (although the music did hurt it a bit), but that doesn't help this too much (although I would have given it a 1 had the ending not been better).

The tongue-in-cheek humor, innuendo and subtle humor abound, making this a great movie for the reasonably well college educated person. However, the classiness of the humor will surely be lost on the uneducated. The caper is, however, well enough revealed for the average man. This is a great date flick for the less sexually squeamish with the flirtatiousness of sexual innuendo moving to a subtle slow burn, followed by a full blaze, causing this to be uncomfortable for couples not fully involved, but encouraging the couple to become fully involved. The chemistry between the leads is so strong that it cannot be missed by anyone. So, this is not a good flick for couples who don't want to go there. The capers involve Sherlockian imagination and intelligence with wonderful twists. The final caper is a wonderfully imaginative romp to music, reminding me a bit of a more classy type of Monty Python humor, and shouldn't be missed.",The Thomas Crown Affair

Someone wrote here this movie has good dialogue: well, I found it unbelievable and one of many things that detaches this from being a real movie, both for Russo and for Brosnan. The acting is average for Brosnan, but will he ever stop playing that character? You don't need a crystal ball to foresee typecasting. Russo's acting is very, perhaps also due to a character that makes no sense, at least in this script. If they really tried to give it irony it was too gross for this type or movie, and maybe her character could make sense in a different story, some sort of b-movie.

Rene Russo is not an obvious choice to play a high-vamp art detective, and her character's messy hair (wig?)style is weirdly distracting, but against expectations, she occupies the role believably, and delivers certain lines with memorable panache.  Pierce Brosnan, always a short step away from self-parody (perhaps a hang-over from James Bond), nevertheless plays the title role of master-financier-and-possible-art-thief Thomas Crown with exactly the right degree of casual menace.  Surprisingly, the Brosnan/Russo pairing works, and a couple of their sexy scenes generate real heat.The storyline neatly balances suspense and playfulness, and delivers several supremely funny moments.  The film moves quickly - dialog is snappy, and pacing is brisk and effective.  Throughout, the look of the film is lush - beautiful people, clothes, artwork, all expensively and attractively presented.  In a sly wink at her leading role in the 1968 version, Faye Dunaway has a small but central role as a shrink with a sense of humor.In light of all these pluses, it would be churlish to note that the plot is thoroughly outlandish and cannot be parsed.

Almost a James Bond like character without the gun. Russo shines as the insurance investigator sent to trap Mr Crown(Brosnan) using her charm and her lovely figure. I think this role is perfect for her: she is so suductive and sexy. As a male i loved it. My Girlfriend however thought it was only quite good. My comments through the film probably didn't really help (mostly on Russo). And the sex scene certainly caught my attention. It is the first sex scene McTiernan has done.The script was witty, but what impressed me was the superb choice of shots McTiernan used:- the smoothness of the it all, the way everything ran perfectly.

I expected a total James Bondish type feel (which in some ways it was) but I got more than that. The movie has good twists and turns that keep the story moving. There are a few plot holes that loom over the movie but they are soon forgotten. Plenty of skin is shown between Pierce and Rene (who looks like her face is aging but her breasts aren't)as they form a pretty far fetched rommance. But then again it is a movie and you can't always be realistic. Enjoy this fun film for what it is worth. A good time.",The Thomas Crown Affair

Unfortunately somebody screwed up with the casting. Russo was completely miscast ed ,she is a good actress but should never play ""femme fatal"" she is as sexy as as fridge on the north pole and with her performance in this movie she brings it down to a ""b"" movie. In the beginning of the movie i could laugh about her clumsy way trying to look hot, but as further the movie went i get really irritated by her performance. I had the impression she knew her self this part was out of her league. Anyway, the story is great and Pierce Brosnan makes it worth to watch.",The Thomas Crown Affair
185,tom-durham,The remake is clearly superior unless you love dramas,7,18 June 2016,"I watched the remake and the original back to back for the first time, so this review is more about whether you should watch the original or the remake.Both movies involve a heist, a love connection and a police investigation. However most of the details are quite different in the two movies, and they almost stand alone.The heist:The heist in the remake is much more interesting, detailed, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The original's heist is straightforward and there are no surprises. It is just a plot device in the original, whereas in the remake it is very well done. The item being stolen makes more sense and really helps the story in the remake.The love connection:The remake does not just rely on the two main characters to create intrigue. The original spends most of it's time on this. To me it is quantity over quality. If you prefer the classic 1960s actors gazing at each other communicating via body language instead of dialogue, you may prefer the original. I prefer the remake.The police investigation:The remake has additional side plots which make it much more interesting. The original is very straightforward, there is an edge of your seat moment or two, but they are not as well done. The way the driver is caught is just wrong and unbelievable, not clever. The remake is far more interesting and well done.ConclusionThe remake is more interesting and contains much more action. The original is more of a drama about two people.",The Thomas Crown Affair
186,jnbseid,Does not live up to hype.. or potential,6,6 March 2000,"This movie could have been so many things, but unfortunately winds up being another overdone, predictable Hollywood movie. The treatment of Rene Russo's character is indicative of the entire stories shortcomings.  SHe starts out as a no-nonsense competent investigator, but in the end she winds up neatly falling for Pierce Brosnan in a way that everyone is happy, even the museum owners and police detectives.Having seen Entrapment about a week before seeing this, at least Crown has an interesting and more believable plot.  It just does not follow through on the many avenues it has open.",The Thomas Crown Affair
187,FilmActuary,Not as good as the original,4,5 January 2000,"This is a very solid movie. Brosnon is wonderful, the story is great, and the dissimilarities from the original do not take away from the picture's quality. There is one thing, however, that makes this movie completely annoying. That is Rene Russo. Her acting performance is horrendous. When her acting wasn't so horrible, I still couldn't ignore the fact that she is completely repulsive. This movie could have been spectacular had someone else been cast in her stead.",The Thomas Crown Affair

It's got tons of action, plot twists, and great visual scenery.I am suprised at the high-6 rating here on IMDB but my only guess as to why it doesn't deserve a 10 is that the actress chosen to play Thomas Crowne's love affair is kinda ugly in my opinion... and if not ugly than certainly a little on the aged side (and kinda annoying). Other than that the movie is a 10/10.",The Thomas Crown Affair
190,maxlebow,The Thomas/Catherine Love Feast,8,28 February 2006,"The Thomas Crown Affair is an exception to the Hollywood rule that the remake must be true to the original. In 1968, Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway served up a 1960s sexy confection of skimpy clothes and clever heists. John McTiernan turns the flick into a sultry, almost jaded, romance. Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan, slick from practicing seduction as James Bond) is a power-lunching, billionaire robber-baron who gets his kicks stealing art treasures from taxpayer-supported museums. Catherine Olds Banning (played by the tough, but sexy Rene Russo) is the insurance company detective determined to get back the painting he steals at the beginning of the film. If she can get it, she will save her insurance conglomerate a nice chunk of change. The billionaire and the detective try everything to outsmart each other including a highly charged love affair that's a heated mix of business and pleasure. Russo looks very good with her clothes off.The director's attention to the detail of the sumptuous, luxury sets, provides a suitably comfy backdrop for the steamy action. McTiernan also directs the action pieces almost as well as one might expect from the director Die Hard.Brosnan and Russo supply most of the heat for the developing romance. The witty dialog by Leslie Dixon make the film move by with enough grace to paper over the fact that it is the sex we are interested in. Russo is beautiful, stylish, smart, self-possessed, and incredibly sexy.Denis Leary gets a good character role as a police detective smitten with Russo, and Faye Dunaway (the love interest in 1968) gets a wholly enjoyable cameo as Brosnan's therapist, who helps him try to figure out why he is such an irresponsible business man.One wonders now, after Enron, Tyco, and other big payoff corporate heists, just whom Crown is robbing to pay for his high-tech robbery crew. How many of his company's employees will have to give up their pensions or health benefits to keep his company looking good on Wall Street. Who cares? It's just a movie! Actually, it is a great date movie. Pop it in. See if it works.",The Thomas Crown Affair
191,Turtle-7,It looked good.,7,10 January 2000,"I have always wanted to see the original. I'm a fan of Steve McQueen, but, for some unknown reason, haven't had a chance to see him in The Thomas Crown Affair. So, I can't make a comparison of the two films. I rented this one on DVD, because I heard it was good. It looked beautiful, but the acting left much to be desired. At least, Rene Russo's acting left much to be desired. I'm not a big fan of Pierce Brosnan, but I really liked him in this. I normally like Rene Russo, but I thought she was just awful in this movie, and didn't believe the attraction between the two, which was supposed to be the premise of the movie.I did enjoy the movie, but it might have been better with someone else as the female lead.",The Thomas Crown Affair
192,battle-3,Plays like a TV show with nude scenes.,4,22 May 2000,"A ""thriller"" in name only.  There is not one second of this movie when you feel that any of the main characters are in danger (of harm, of prison, or of acting like a believable human being).  Russo (usually one of my favorites) has an unplayable part requiring her to go from being icy, professional and smart to brain dead, sometimes within the same scene.  The love story is just unbelievable.  Plays like your regular TV series with nude scenes tacked on. The original had to have been better.",The Thomas Crown Affair
193,William9,Decent but indulgent,6,10 August 1999,"The ending to this film was pretty clever, but this can't make up for the over indulgent sex scenes, the ""boy, being rich is fun"" scenes, and other various annoyances (like, why do we need a black cop and a white detective when both are irrelevant to the plot?  How about just one, and let's NOT make the stereotypical casting choice.)Either way, it's a big crowd pleaser.  Lots of laughing (in a good way) near the end, and applause when the credits rolled.",The Thomas Crown Affair
194,aeolianknight,Change the channel,1,14 January 2001,"What a waste of two hours.  I never understood the need for remakes and this one definitely gives proof to my non understanding.  To say that that this is a bad movie would be to give it a practically a rave.  This goes beyond bad, just think of how many starving children that could have been fed with the money that it took to make this tripe. First you have the Bond guy who steals a picture, and a (what the filmmakers thought) sexy investigator, perhaps less close ups so that we couldn't see the lines on her face, would have only improved this sorry excuse of a film. Anyway she's on to him from the beginning and we go through a series of dates, getaways, jealous fits, all culminating in an ending which is even dumber than the rest of the movie, if that's humanly possible.  So he returns the painting, (sort of) but steal another in a way that not even Houdini could have done, (no wonder they don't show you how he did it)and they live happily ever after. Movies such as these are infuriating because they steal two hours from peoples lives and not even apologize for it.  I think I may want to make a movie, for I couldn't do any worst than this piece of #*%@!!!",The Thomas Crown Affair
195,Goose-30,I'd rather trim my pubic hair than watch this movie.,2,21 April 2000,"This movie is an abomination. I rated it as a two instead of a one only out of respect for McTiernan's ""Die Hard"" and ""Hunt for Red October"". It's terrible. Everything about it is terrible. The cinematography is wretched - and I don't think it's just my TV, but Russo and Brosnan frequently look bizarre and hideous. Bad makeup. Horrible wardrobe. Mediocre, at best, set design. The script makes TV, and in particular the WB Network, look smart by comparison... it's truly dreadful. Even the sound editing is poorly done and, well, gross - annoying sound effects (the chewing-with-the-mouth-open effects are always a nice touch) are overly loud while dialogue is frequently muddled. There are long, dreadful scenes of supposed ""rich decadence"" that are shockingly pedestrian. And, oh my sweet lord, don't get me started on the soundtrack. Oh, god, not the music! PLEASE just let me forget the music! Why do you torment me like this?!?Overall, the whole mess is compulsively unwatchable.In fact, the film is still playing as I write this. I'm making my girlfriend stick it out so she can fill me in on how bad it gets. I know, I know... but usually I *am* a good boyfriend. Honest.The last time I hated a movie this much it had to be the time I went to a test screening of ""Nick of Time"". Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken - hey, it sounded good. The only reason I didn't walk out of that one was because I was sitting next to a bombshell blonde, who was very interesting and talkative and almost totally ignored her obnoxious boyfriend to chat with me instead. That was fun. If it wasn't for her, I would've gladly walked out on that turkey. But at least ""Nick of Time"" had Christopher Walken.Well, my girlfriend just called me in to force me to watch the ending. It actually managed to exceed my expectations of how horrific it might be. I wonder if I can go back and change my vote to a one.So: if you enjoy film, don't be tempted to give this ""hit"" a try. I know what you're thinking... but don't. Trust me. It's not even worth renting just to make fun of. Just rent ""Red October"" or even ""Predator"" and pretend that John McTiernan is still making good movies.",The Thomas Crown Affair
196,readinglips,Doesn't hold up (if indeed it ever did...),6,9 September 2008,"Sometimes, your first impression is right: when I saw this film in high school, I remembered thinking, ""All form and no substance."" Re-watching it last evening not only reconfirmed that, but the passage of time makes its weaknesses even more obvious: when you put aside the great photography and sets (and they are great) and the star power of Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway, there's not much else here. We see how wealthy Thomas Crown is (glider flying, polo game, well-appointed house) and how sophisticated Vicki Anderson is (mostly the wardrobe). But without that form and style, the content that is left is vacuous. Where's the sparring and test of wills? She tells him right away he's the target and he has to prove he doesn't blanch easily. The scene with him and Jack Weston at the police station is a good one because it shows what Thomas Crown is made of: nerves of steel. The film could have used more scenes like that. In real life, of course, none of this could happen anyway (an insurance investigator who went to bed with the target would be out of a job by nightfall). But even allowing for the poetic license of movies, what drives these characters doesn't make much sense: 1. Let's say she DOES fall in love him (and that's a big if  she's presented as a cut-throat investigator who only wants the 10% she'll get for solving the crime). Still, she's never presented with any options  like throwing the investigation over and running off with him. Instead, the ""crisis"" at the end is having her stand by and watch him replicate the heist. Her actions simply serve the plot instead of driving it. 2. Or, let's say he falls in love with HER. If he really loves her, why doesn't he try to tempt her to go off with him? Instead, they spend their time as though they are in a relationship where one person is terminally ill and they know there's only a little time left. 3. At the end, there's a twist  but since there's not much at stake for either of them (she's not going to run off with him and he hasn't asked her to do so anyway), the twist doesn't hurt. We're not left feeling sad that these characters crossed in the night, but missed. Instead, we watch passively as she is left holding the bag (figuratively)  and after all, did she really think he would show up and allow himself to be arrested? The split screen photography is terrific and it works. It's not there just to dazzle us: it actually serves the plot. But how well this component works only goes to show how empty the rest of the film is.The remake (1999) is much better: the investigator (Renee Russo) isn't a clotheshorse looking for love. She's tough and driven  she wants to beat him. The sparing between the two sets off sparks. Granted some of improvement of the 1999 version may be the evolution of the relationship between men and women since 1968. But still, it does give you a feel for some of the lost opportunities of the first version.",The Thomas Crown Affair
197,comix8,"Close, but just missed the mark",7,6 August 1999,"The Thomas Crown Affair was one of those movies that you see the preview of and think blah, but it does surprise.  The first theft of the painting was very well done, but a little too slow for the opening sequence of the movie. It took too long to set up and the payoff was in the previews so it lacked a little bit.  The next hour was good, but a little slow and a little too commercial.  Pepsi, Lucent, and Apple were all over this movie and it was not hidden well.  For someone who drinks green gunk every morning, Russo sure did gulp that Pepsi One quite fast. What is not seen is the reason why the movie is rated R.  I can put up with a little bit of nudity, but that was a little much.  I don't know about you, but I rarely see a woman walking around my house without a top on.  The rest of the movie is a little confusing, but fast pace and the ending is the big payoff.  It is the one part of the movie that I didn't predict (part of it at least).  I won't ruin it for all of those who chose to see this flick.For me, this movie was a little bit too slow in certain parts.  It isn't that I don't like slower movies, but I went into this movie thinking it would be a 007 rip-off movie.  I mean they even got Brosnan to appear in it, but this movie stands out on its own.  I have not seen the original and after seeing this, I'm not really sure I want to.  I do know that the first one is about a bank robbing rich guy and that seems a little too low-brow for me.  The art theft is more romantic and it really fits in with the flow of the movie.  If there is one thing in this movie that was almost flawless it was the music.  Each scene got just the right style of music and at the same time, it avoided the fast paced violins that you normally hear during these types of movies.  It changed it into a lighter more comical tone because that is what this movie really was.  It was a romantic comedy in the disguise of an action movie.  You still get the action, but you also get the romance at the same time with just the right amount of humor.  I think that if you lost the commercial endorsements and the bare-chested Russo, you would have had a better PG-rated movie.Overall, I give this movie a solid 8 out of 10.",The Thomas Crown Affair

Director  John McTiernan has done a superlative job at bringing to life  the original Alan R. Trustman story which made the 1967  Thomas Crown Affair a valuable addition to the classic Action/thriller  genre. His cutting edge direction made every moment of this film a pleasure.  Not one scene drags and the characters are explored in exacting detail.  I can't imagine a multi millionaire of Thomas Crowns Stature played better than by Pierce Brosnan. The original character creation by  Steve McQueen's looked as though his suit were a straight jacket. We have to admit though we cinema goers loved the man,  there was no Classic quality in McQueen's face like there is in Brosnan's. Rene Russo was perfect as the investigator Catherine banning. Relentless in her carnality and designs to play Crown at his own game. The tension lasted  right to the last minute.  Frankie Faison  breathed sensitive life into  Detective Paretti and and an equally  strong cast made this movie experience even more of a pleasure.

Even the normally annoying Denis Leary gives a good performance as the embittered detective who watches Russo's struggles between her heart and her job. Frankie Faison has an excellent supporting role(most may remember him as the landlord in Eddie Murphy's ""Coming to America"").

I was pleased that Catherine didn't just tumble head-over-heels for Thomas, but maintained her integrity and principles till the end -- even while pantingly attracted to Thomas!  The sex scenes, and the dance scene, were awesome -- steamy and erotic.

Each character is attractive, each of is justified, the ending hangs in the balance even in 1990's hollywood.

Two things were remarkable about that - theaters are not normally packed in South Bend and the average age of the crowd was probably 48. Everyone seemed to leave happy.

I was wary of a re-make, but I think they improved on the original. Set design were quite good. It was a sexy film, too.

Two things were remarkable about that - there are few times that theaters are packed in South Bend and the average age of the audience was probably 48. Everyone seemed to leave happy. This is a smart film for grown-ups.  Not quite as smart as ""As Good as It Gets"", but it was a nice way to spend the evening.  I liked all the little twists and jokes, from the Etruscan horse onward. I liked some of the changes from the original - the art heist instead of money (why would a guy like this find taking money any challenge?) The set design was very good. It is a nice movie to look at. Acting. Loved the scenes between Brosnan and Dunaway.  No complaints about acting in general. For fans of the original - this is a different Thomas Crown, don't look for McQueen and you will be happy with the Crown that Brosnan presents (a little more character development, done in a more subtle way would have been nice). It is also a sexier movie than the highly anticipated ""Eyes Wide Shut"".  I had forgotten that you can do this in a movie without the pre-teen leer and jiggle. My only criticism are the overlong glider and cat sequences, probably done in honor of the interminable dune buggy sequence in the original.  It didn't help move the plot or set much tone.

I like movies that do that.The art, toys and clothing, cars, boats and planes were an added pleasure to this movie.I would have to say that Rene Russo's black dress is what brought Hollywood women back into couture.

Rene Russo's character was irritating beyond belief and Thomas Crowne himself was flat and stereotypical. To say he was two-dimensional may be a little generous.

Pierce Brosnan was pitched in a role that could be viewed similar to his 007 character, but he played it more than that.  His character carried the same cockiness and suaveness, but was deeper and more complex.  He made you wonder after a few compromising scenes if he was an appropriate bad guy to root for, which he was by the end. Rene Russo still looking as hot as ever.  The fact that she did some nudity in this film, her first time I believe, was a surprise and not necessary I felt.  It really didn't contribute to the plot and she was able to be sexy without going topless.  Even still after some of her other sexy roles where nudity would've suited her better, I really can't complain on what she showed on screen.  She has a great body!  Denis Leary did a good job as the detective and is beginning to carry himself well as a good actor in Hollywood.  Just like Rene said to him towards the end, ""You're a good man."" You could look at his character that he portray and actually believe it. Overall, I give the movie a good rating.  The story was well thought out and played well by the actors.  Not bad at all.",The Thomas Crown Affair
213,eudoxus,Let them eat cake.,7,31 August 1999,"The Thomas Crown Affair is pure entertainment. There was nothing challenging in the plot, the actors are eye candy, as are the sets and camera work.

214,ekedolphin,Wonderful movie!,10,7 October 2000,"Hmmm, where do I start.  Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo did a fantastic acting job in this movie.  Brosnan's Thomas Crown character is both innovative and cunning, and Russo's character, Catherine Banning, turns out to be his match in both departments.  Even though Banning is assigned to discover whether or not Crown truly stole the painting from the museum, Banning gets rather `caught up in her work', so to speak; she and Crown end up in a complex love affair.The scenes between Brosnan and Russo are *very* classy, and the climax was very nicely done (that's all I can say without spoiling it).  The music is also *very* well composed, and is not something to be overlooked.  If you like a good movie, check this out, you will not be disappointed.",The Thomas Crown Affair

216,Colorado Boja,A quality remake...,8,6 August 2001,"I saw this version of ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" before renting the McQueen/Dunaway version.  Having seen them both now I can say honestly that I find the remake [surprisingly] superior to the original. 
As a big fan of Steve McQueen, and as an even bigger fan of nuanced caper flicks of the late 60's / 70's, I have to admit I was flummoxed by my own conclusion here.  But so be it.  I found the original a bit uneven, a bit tedious--and the relationship between McQueen and Dunaway frankly wasn't as interesting as the Russo/Brosnan coupling, though ordinarily I'm not a huge fan of either actor.  The cat and mouse game between the two is nicely orchestrated, and the action is frenetic and slick.  The film has a nice visual feel to it, as well--sleek and classy.
Not sure Dennis Leary's character added a whole lot to the proceedings (and I usually like him), but overall the film makes for an enjoyable evening's viewing.",The Thomas Crown Affair
217,mrkrumi,brilliant..,9,15 July 2009,"fantastic.brilliant.what the else i could say about this movie.i have seen the original one but this one is more convincing.Pearce Brosnan is fit for the character as 'Crown'. HE IS as usual stylish,dashing and charming.And about Russo, she is mind blowing as detective-smart, stylish,intelligent etc.. etc.The pair is a charming one to see.I just don't understand why he wanted to rip off a piece of artwork, though. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this project did an excellent job. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend excellent action movie with a little romance thrown in that has excellent performances to all you Pierce Brosnan or Rene Russo fans who haven't seen I enjoyed the movie a lot.Believe me you will definitely like it if you have not seen the movie yet.describe in one word it is 'BRILLIANT'",The Thomas Crown Affair
218,srcooper-756-646671,A fantastic reworking,10,20 March 2011,"This film is perhaps a little difficult because of it's title - the actual star of the film is Rene Russo as it is her emotional journey that we follow. Then again everything about this John McTiernan classic is slightly unexpected. Beautifully composed from the credits through to the wonderful airy summer feel McTiernan manages to convey of New York. Brosnan is enchanting as Thomas Crown and Dennis Leary is the perfect fit for his role as the police detective. If you are looking for a romantic, thrilling adventure then I cannot think of a better example. Deep, honest and full of intrigue and class. The soundtrack remains my favourite to this day.",The Thomas Crown Affair
219,kruno-f,Making it plain stupid,1,15 February 2006,"As a remake, this movie is as poor as can be. This is actually a translation of a beautiful movie in to a language of stupid American half-wits who can't read beauty. Let' make everything corny for illiterate yanks. We have all witnessed the downfall of American mainstream cinematography, but for me personally this is too much. Close to the remake of The Stepford Wives. Someone actually tried to fit slimy, spineless Pierce Brosnan into the shoes of all time god Steve McQueen, and drawer jaw Rene Russo into a thong (I wish I've never seen this), dancing to some cheap Latin rhythm, perking her drawer as though in trance. Instead of Faye Dunaway softly meddling chessboard figures, and moistening her lips until she drives Thomas Crown out of his minds. I don't want to be reasonable about this movie, this is a shame.Has general taste really descended this low? Does this movie really stand where the original use to? Instead of an absolute genius Michel Legrand playing one of his greatest chanson sung by Noel Harrison, you've been offered some Latin wiggling, absurd flipping of a trimaran yacht, with one goal only and that is to try (desperately) to make Pierce look cool about it, and in the end Rene's drawer jaw face to convince you that she is an intelligent detective. Pierce Brosnan does not look, for one moment, as though he is bored by his wealth and wants to raise the odds by going against the law; he looks like a show-off with extreme lacking of that Chekhovian stroke of superfluity and wastefulness that McQueen wore so naturally, and what is Thomas Crown all about in the end. Why do they do this to movies, why can't they leave it the hell alone? This is poor. My only regret is the score by Nina Simone",The Thomas Crown Affair

It's 'James Bond' crossing over the 'Entrapment' crossing over to 'Mission Impossible' with a fantastic ending of the movie that will have you smiling and feeling great about the whole thing!The soundtrack alone is a winner without a doubt!

221,Djonn,A Brittle Grade of Steele,7,19 August 1999,"Is this a worthy remake of the McQueen/Dunaway film?  I can't say; I haven't seen that one.  Is it a new film classic?  Probably not.  But is it a reasonably entertaining high-class caper picture?  Definitely.Pierce Brosnan is as elegant and charming as ever as Thomas Crown, though one could wish for a bit more of the impish mischievousness that came through on the Remington Steele series of old.  Rene Russo is attractive and clever as Catherine Banning, the high-powered insurance investigator recruited to look into a daring and dramatic museum theft.  No one else makes much of an impression -- with the odd exception that the police detective loosely partnered with Banning reminds one of Remington Steele's sometime nemesis, LAPD's Inspector Jarvis.When the film is concentrating on the art thefts, it's crisp and ingenious, though not entirely unpredictable.  Elsewhere, it sometimes falters.  The sexual chemistry between Crown and Banning is only about 60% ""there"" -- one can see the attraction, but not quite understand why it's working.  And the core characters are not as well-defined as they should be, especially Russo's Banning -- a flaw in the script rather than in the actors' performances.All in all, it's a fairly lively and watchable picture, but it doesn't realize its full potential either as a caper movie or as a Brosnan vehicle. The Bond movies have given Brosnan a good chance to show his ""edge""; what's been left largely unexploited is his talent for romantic comedy.  The Thomas Crown Affair doesn't give viewers enough of this lighter Brosnan; hopefully, future ventures will do more.",The Thomas Crown Affair

So why not a sequel to it? They are all alive and well, little older of course, but a good writer could find a story that suited them in their current state.

It's really hard to find great fun movies starring ""grown-ups.""Like Crystal and Ryan as Harry and Sally, Brosnan and Russo literally come to the rescue as one of the best romantic pairings in current cinema.For it's genre, the movie succeeds in being smart, sexxxxy, savvy and even sweet.

226,Arnie-30,An improvement on an overrated 'period' piece.,8,10 September 1999,"Nostalgia is always a good way of distorting the merits of any film.  True, with time, works that 'bomb' on release often do substantiate their claim to fame.  However, the original 'Thomas Crown Affair' (if severed from the umbilical of Steve McQueen's iconic status as the 'King of Cool') betrays significant weaknesses in both plot and characterisation.  (One excellent chess scene does not a great film make!)Pierce Brosnan's remake of the 'Thomas Crown Affair' is a gripping and stylish thriller which justfiably establishes itself as a contemporary thriller rather than as advertisement for the fads and fashions of a particular era.  Pierce Brosnan gives a menacingly enigmatic performance in the title role.  Where Steve McQueen traded on his image, Pierce Brosnan sells the audience a disturbingly ammoral man who attracts as much as he repulses.  Rene Russo, in perhaps her most accomplished role to date, provides a wonderfully aggressive counterpart to this moral dilletante, her own predatorial ethics arousing both lust and loathing in equal measure.The film's only real weaknesses lay with the director, John McTiernan. Although the action sequences are riveting, the love scenes do come across as a little too 'Die Hard'.  The eroticism between the two leads may not be the stuff of panoramic beach scenes, but without something for the audience to find genuinely arousing in these scenes - no matter how unnerving - they become almost superfluous.Altogether - a must see.  Highly Recommended.",The Thomas Crown Affair
227,BigYellowBiohazard,Be prepared for some inane smiles...,9,13 May 2001,"Admittedly, this is a loose remake, which usually spells trouble. To take an example, Never Say Never Again (the remake of Thunderball) was a flop, with plenty of cheese and terrible script. It ridiculed those who were in it. But, hoorayhoorah, this is one of the best thrillers I have seen for a while. And what a feast! 3 fantastic actors in the main roles (Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo and Denis Leary), brilliant script, and some of the most impressive scenes to be found amongst all the many crap pictures they seem to be reeling off at the moment. The teasing, cat-and-mouse chemistry between Russo and Brosnan is quite noticeable: she constantly playing games with him, he overly confident that he can get what he wants. Brosnan is a natural, it seems, at playing rich men (see James Bond, Grey Owl, The Tailor of Panama), but he has a certain vulnerability and sensibility which makes him a fantastic man to watch. The most amazing scenes in the film are those in the museum: the way he uses the other robbery to his advantage and makes a ten-second job of stealing the Monet; and the final scene in which he uses 6 different men all in the same attire to completely baffle the police as to his whereabouts. Both will have you grinning like an absolute imbecile!! it's an excellent film, but if you are looking for guns, death and explosions, stay firmly away: you won't find it here.",The Thomas Crown Affair

Brosnan and Russo are great together and were one of the best matches on screen I have seen for a while. The one thing that sets the film off is the music which is excellent and really adds to the feel of the film. Its better than a lot of stuff Hollywood pump out. Brosnan produced it.

229,faustian_jargon,Ugh!,1,29 January 2005,"This is a remake in every sense of the word. ie: they took a perfectly good film and made it again. This film is a cover not a remix and one where all members of the band lack the charisma and talent of the original. The original film is a heist movie about a millionaire industrialist type who runs a very tight art-theft operation, purely for his own enjoyment. The interesting bits are when an insurance investigator is set on him and they spar over the ethics of the ""caper, sir"". It's light on the surface, but has depth if you care to pay attention. They soundtrack also tells a story and syncs beautifully with the scenes in the film - like the game of chess between the two apparent adversaries and the song ""His eyes, Her eyes"". The chess game is one of the many innuendos of predator and prey, outwitting and seducing at the same time. The remake fails dismally because it lamely attempts to reproduce the soundtrack and casts the leads as caricatures of Steve and Faye - even down to a terrible impersonation by Pierce Brosnan of Steve's laugh which is so awful both my wife and I hit the floor in hysterics. The dodgy ""brand new"" sounding 'smooth jazz' sax in the soundtrack is simply awful, any sax player knows you have to go dig a horn out of the fifties if you want the best sound, this film is almost a like one of those dodgy Star Wars spoofs over at ifilm, simply laughable. 1/10.",The Thomas Crown Affair

Both feature similar plots (wealthy, debonair art thief and a gorgeous insurance investigator play a game of cat-and-mouse), but all-in-all this movie was much better. Rather than relying on cool gadgetry and spandex, ""Crowne"" relies more on the on-screen chemistry between Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan (quite effectively, I might add). You leave the movie feeling as if James Bond suddenly decided to go crooked. And yes, there are some cool gadgets but they aren't featured so prominently that you think the movie is about them.

Spoiler-free version: stop the VCR or turn off the TV about 30 seconds before the end, if you want to know why please read ahead.** SPOILERS ALERT READ AT YOUR OWN RISK **
This movie would have been an 8/10 if it wasn't for the last 30 seconds or so (the scene in the airplane): I really can't understand why a movie has to be ruined for the sake of the typical happy ending.My opinion is that the director wanted to cut the movie with the main female character on the plane, just before the obvious handkerchief appears, but that the powers-that-be thought that such a perfectly logical, consequential and meaningful ending would have been too much to bear for the average movie goerThe director probably decided to try, without succeeding, to not ruin the movie by cutting the following scene short. I wish he just had the guts to stand his ground and let the male character do what most people in his situation would do.My advice: turn off the vcr/television as soon as you see the female character on the airplane, maybe you can wait 5 more seconds if you want, but please do not wait for what happens after the handkerchief magically appears beside her.Vote: first 112 and a half minutes 8/10, last 30 seconds 1/10, average 5/10",The Thomas Crown Affair

The plot is intruiging and has a fair bit of depth. As you watch the film, you realise that the story is always one step ahead of you.

Each character is about as believable as cardboard cut-outs, the dialogue seems so bad (""Do you want to dance or do you want to DANCE?"") that it's painful to realize that Dixon also wrote Mrs. Doubtfire and Pay it Forward. The plot is immensely and inexcusable predictable. So much so, that because you can't imagine that you've guessed the ending within 15 minutes, you'll invent a better and more original movie.The acting is decent, but can Pierce play anything but an exciting, older white male? The only thing he ever seems to do in movies is not react to things. If you always play it cool, is that even acting? Rene Russo gets out of acting by continuously taking off her top, apparently to prove that ""older women still got it.""

Neither does it include some seventeen-year-old girl whose sole purpose is to ""entertain"" the males in the audience.  It is a film that requires you to pay attention, to think a little, and to actually enjoy the movie instead of picking holes in every stupid thing that comes along.I recently sat through the Beach - fine movie, but in the row behind me were a couple of adolescent losers who insisted on making whiny, derisive, pointless remarks for the duration of the film.  I bet they didn't like TCA either.Pierce Brosnan shows that he can handle more than just Bond, and is more convincing in his role than Steve McQueen was.  Sacrilege, I know, but McQueen never impressed as the bored billionaire.Rene Russo is a talented actress, and I was very grateful to see two actors of similar age involved in a relationship.  This was one of the strongest areas of the movie - the love affair / cat-and-mouse hunt between Crown and Banning.

From a story standpoint, the problem can be traced to the fact that both the lead characters -- Crown and Banning -- have figured each other out by the end of their first meeting.  So where's the suspense? (Granted, there's one nice character revelation in Act Three, but it's a case of too little, too late.)Most potential audience members will have never seen the original Steve McQueen/Faye Dunaway version, so comparisons are pointless.

The heists are especially good and thanks to the reviewer for posting the name of the song ""Sinner Man"" as was played during one heist.There is genuine chemistry between Brosnan and Russo which makes this movie especially compelling- especially Russo's vulnerability when she fears a younger woman. Brosnan is impeccably dressed and comes across as an intelligent handsome lover with style (the inside of his home will just make you melt if you are an art lover!). It would have been easy for the writers to slip and make him into a spoiled rich playboy-- but the movie has far more depth than that.Really wonderful- I am in my late 30s and don't think I would have appreciated it as much in my 20s - for whatever reason.

The second flaw, more minor...and even a pleasure to some people, is the abundance of sex scenes in this movie.Now, if I remember right, there are two or three sex scenes, but they never end.

253,Lilian-van-Ooijen,Smooth 90s movie,7,2 June 2017,"I'm a sucker for Pierce Brosnan. Hence I could not let this movie be unseen. In addition, it would be about a rich playboy who steals art, which provoked my interest. A 6.8 on IMDb, I just dared it.In retrospect a good choice. You'll be back in the 90s with this smooth movie. Simple tension, sincere love, cuddly humor and more of those concepts that have totally disappeared from the contemporary film industry. Nowadays everything is complex and complicated. In the nineties you could still enjoy the genius of a wealthy businessman.I was not really attracted to the screen every moment of the movie so I cannot call the story extremely good. Yet, the quasi-nonchalant act of Pierce Brosnan - Thomas Crown in this story - combined with a fascinating image, forms the quality of this film. Think of tropical holiday homes, luxurious dinners and exciting nightly scenes.Should you see this movie or not? Watch this movie if you like to watch nineties movies. If you do not feel the urge to see The Thomas Crown Affair based on this description, I have to confess that you probably do not miss anything. This is not a must-see, but a want-to-see.",The Thomas Crown Affair
254,thomnkiki,WOW! This is a fun tickler!,9,7 September 2007,"I love this movie! Every time I see it on TV, it reminds me that I should go out and buy this for my personal collection. I especially love Faye Dunaway's character as she unreservedly psychologically peels the main character. I prefer the current version to the original as the original revolved around a bank heist, which seems so much more vulgar than art theft. I believe the film was supposed to be based on Tomas Van Der Heijden and his thefts of the Renoirs from the Louvre in 1961 so I found a theft of a Monet in the remake to be more in accordance with the spirit of the original heist. Although, I must admit, the first film used the dune buggy that T. Heijden used to escape in was a fun bit of reference. This film is a bit slow on action but there are so many levels that the actual heist itself becomes just an undercurrent to the more interesting interpersonal relationships and the emotional complexity that manifests in the process. Superbly acted by the three main characters. This is an excellent cat and mouse movie; the best part is trying to decide who is the cat and who is the mouse! If you like a shoot 'em up, crash the car explosion fest, this movie will bore you, but if you like complex character driven movies, this one should tickle your fancy!",The Thomas Crown Affair

256,azachar,Dreary and flat,6,13 September 1999,"Without the benefit of seeing the original. Pretty thin stuff, this, and not enhanced by flat performances from Renee Russo and Pearce Brosnan. The background and plotting are slapdash (Brosnan - who is Irish - does not sound at all like he comes from Glasgow, and Oxford, unlike American universities, does not offer boxing scholarships). Worst of all, this is clearly meant to be wish fulfillment by proxy. We are supposed to envy Crown his amazing talent for everything and his astonishing lifestyle. Instead, rather like with Sherlock Holmes, we end up thinking he's a very smug person who needs a good kicking. Perhaps in a country that lionises big businessmen, Crown would seem like a charming man. From here, I just wanted him arrested without delay.",The Thomas Crown Affair
257,MHerve,Very entertaining,8,11 August 1999,"Now, maybe its because I didn't even realize it was a remake until after seeing it, but I thought this movie was full of suspense,  daring, sexy, and definitely entertaining.  Rene Russo was incredible (especially in the dress she wore to the black tie party - hubba hubba).  Denis Leary was good in a supporting role as usual.  Pierce Brosnan was convincing as the bored affluent playboy. I recommend it for anyone without incoming dispositions about the first film.",The Thomas Crown Affair

259,bcsmith,"What happens when two people who always get what they want, want what the other is trying to hide?",8,3 April 2000,"Before I watched this movie, I was worried hat it would simply be a cheap imitation of Pierce Brosnan playing James Bond while not playing James Bond. After the movie was over I decided that Thomas Crown is all the good things about James Bond plus a few extra.  For one, Crown is a lot looser than Bond could ever be.  The best part of this movie is the sense of humor that all the characters have.  Crown is a very rich individual that still seeks a challenge.  When the mergers and acquisitions business becomes boring, he resorts to other means.  It was interesting to see someone commit a crime just for the sake of doing it.  The only gain that he gets from the activity is the couple of minutes of excitement that it provided.  This was perfectly played against Rene Russo's character.  She is also the woman who always gets what she wants.  In her case it is art thieves.  The best parts of this movie are when the two of them are trying to accomplish their respective goals, even though they run counter to each other.  Overall this is an excellent movie and I recommend that anyone should see it at least once.",The Thomas Crown Affair

He would have had no trouble buying an expensive piece ($100 million) by his favorite artist, but instead he risks everything he has and steals it (in a very James Bond like manner).The rest of the film I will not give away, but it includes some hot and heavy love makin', a sweet-ass police chase through the museum and a happy ending for everybody. Below are some of my highlights and lowlights from the film.Best scene: When the cops are chasing the ""Bowler Man"" through the museum.Best acting: Pierce Brosnan (Thomas Crown)Worst acting: Rene Russo (Catherine Banning)After thoughts: Pierce Brosnan plays the ideal billionaire.

273,toptna,Russo miscast but otherwise an enjoyable remake.,7,8 December 2016,"This movie had so many good things going for it: handsome and debonair lead actor (this movie could have been written for Brosnan),good supporting cast, great scenery, surprise twists and turns, etc). However, I thought all of that was undermined by a horribly miscast Rene Russo as the female lead. I've always loved the performances of mature actresses such as Helen Mirren and Judi Dench who never lost their appeal even as years passed. But featuring Russo as Catherine Banning made me cringe. Her actions and dialogue never fit her post-menopausal persona. She looked more 54 than her actual 44, and I found it made her role more annoying than alluring. At times, even pathetic. It's not Russo's fault. Writers simply wrote the part for a young seductress as the lead, and then casting tried to shoe-horn Rene Russo into the role. I would have much rather seen Brosnan and Russo play chess (like a scene in the original version), than see Russo grind on the dance floor wearing a formal gown. Indeed, Russo appeared to rely on her looks and sex more than her intelligence as the film progressed. In the original, 1968 film version there was a memorable kissing scene between Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway that went on to become famous. The kissing scenes in this 1998 version made me say,""Ick.""The original and the remake are different enough to stand on their own.

To be honest, the story was old ( it's a remake and not as good as the original one) , the acting was so-so, good but not great, even some stiff moments. But still it entertains me every time I watch. The reason why? That's because the soundtracks brilliantly tuned in and even enhanced the storyline, the acting. The movie will always be one great cat-and-mouse chase, very sexy (yes, for 2 middle aged actors, not a popular choice at all, eh? ), sophisticated, modern and high-end movie.

276,elg-35534,Crime against art,1,24 March 2017,"This review CONTAINS SPOILERS, but to be fair it's pretty much impossible to spoil the experience of watching this turkey beyond what the movie itself achieves. To illustrate how bad this movie is I'd like to call your attention to one small scene. The film begins with a classic intricate heist of priceless art from a high-security museum. That plan is quickly revealed to be an elaborate cover for the real theft of one painting by uber-cool billionaire Thomas Crown, played by the steely-eyed wooden-expressioned Pierce Brosnan. The actual theft is facilitated by Crown's placing his briefcase to prevent an absurdly hefty security gate from fully closing on the room housing the painting. The briefcase is later shown to contain a highly engineered titanium structure built to sustain many tons of pressure. Keep that fact in mind.The female lead, Catherine Banning played by Rene Russo, quickly identifies Crown as the thief based on nothing in particular. Feminine intuition, perhaps? Anyway, she sets about trying to extract a confession from Crown by means of irresistible hotness which I'm sorry to say she's a bit too old and inept to carry off. The rest of the movie is basically a series of dream dates for Banning along the lines of Pretty Woman interspersed with scenes of her annoying the police and interfering with their investigation. The police official, Detective Mike McCann played by Dennis Leary, who for no apparent reason kowtows to the civilian Banning, is the most likable and believable major character in the film. Having seen Leary's real-life temperament, I found his portrayal of nice guy Detective McCann to be an impressive piece of acting.Now about that briefcase. If you watch the scene where Crown places it to block the security gate, you'll see that his hands are bare. Given the obvious design of the case as a tool for burglary, even the most plodding dullard of a police detective would have simply taken fingerprints from the case and thus been 95% of the way toward nabbing Crown. That step was never taken. Instead the police humor Banning and provide occasional relationship counseling as she parades herself in and out of a series of ridiculously opulent and/or see- through garments while enjoying her dates with, or agonizing over, Crown. Everything in the movie, IMHO, is just as poorly thought out and ineptly executed as the briefcase debacle. That holds true right down to the music and the disruptingly obvious product placement shot for a can of Pepsi One. The real crimes against art in this movie are the ones committed by the director, writers, actors, composer and musicians, and the real theft is of any time you might spend watching this travesty.",The Thomas Crown Affair
277,poecraft,Ultra-cool businessman gets in trouble with sexy insurance detective; or so it seems.,4,6 August 1999,"Disappointingly unsubtle remake of Norman Jewison's Sex and Crime-Thriller of the Sixties. Brosnan and Russo are a clever casting choice at first glance, but John McTiernan's vulgar direction lacks every  kind of style this sort of ironic caper stuff needs. It is either too dark or too deliberately tongue in cheek and as a whole therefore completely out of balance. In Mid-section Rene Russo performs whole scenes bare-breasted, which is absolutely unnecessary whereas Brosnan is still too stiff to be a remarkable leading man and far too James Bond to be believable as somebody seriously in conflict with emotional ballast. Denis Leary has the best moments in a surprisingly soft and moving part as police detective with a heart-breaking history.",The Thomas Crown Affair
278,Xiibaro,Bond Gone Bad is far from Crown Gone Better,3,28 July 1999,"I must be one of the biggest fans of the Norman Jewison film The Thomas Crown Affair from 1968.  With its suave stars (Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway) and its terrific look (thanks to Jewison's direction and the cinematography of the great Haskell Wexler) the original The Thomas Crown Affair is a salute to experimental filmmaking in the 1960s.  Now 31 years later I am forced through a remake that would have been better titled James Bond Gone Bad than The Thomas Crown Affair.  Very little of the original still remains in this supposed remake.  The only things that cause a similarity between the two:  the main character is a wealthy trader named Thomas Crown, a robbery causes the interest of an insurance investigator that falls for Mr. Crown, and a fly in a plane over fields.  The differences are much bigger and more important like the fact that the bank robbery in the original is now the stealing of a painting.  Even the two main supporting (oxymoron?) have different character names.  Then of course there is the fact that the two have completely different and opposing endings (I remember a story where some writer changed the final line of a poem and in turn the poem completely opposed the statement it had made before the change; that is pretty much how this change works).This version of The Thomas Crown Affair follows the relationship that blossoms between a white-collar thief (Brosnan) and the insurance officer investigating him (Russo).  Along the way, she must meet the problems caused by police officer Michael McCann (Leary) who would rather be busting some thugs than after some painting.  As stated before, the robbery involves a priceless painting that Crown steals for his own pleasure and for the thrill of the chase.The opening and closing parts of the film are enjoyable (though the ending is pretty bad), but the rest of the film is near awful.  Brosnan and Russo are sub par (and by the way, I do not think that all that Rene Russo nudity was needed; Reese Witherspoon in Twilight: understandable, Rene Russo in The Thomas Crown Affair:  no!).  McTiernan had proven once again that he cannot direct and making me even more fearful about The 13th Warrior.  None of the comic relief really works and neither of the stars show any real charisma (especially Russo).  Still there were small moments that I liked in the film, as well as some nice quirky moments, but the film on a whole is a straight out disappointment.  Do yourself a favor and rent the original instead.",The Thomas Crown Affair

Even aside from the nude scenes, her Catherine Banning is better developed and more interesting than Pierce Brosnan's one-dimensional Thomas Crown.

It's that good!As for the hot ""romance"" between Russo and Brosnan I found it just so-so. Frankly, I think that Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway in the original generated more heat fully-clothed, with one kiss (AND WHAT A KISS!!!), than Russo and Brosnan did buck naked, rolling around on staircases and desks. The mindboggles at what McQueen and Dunaway could do in a love scene in these more liberal and explicit filmmaking times. Maybe it's just a matter of chemistry. M & D had it.

I'm glad they didn't try to recreate the split screen editing that was so perfectly done in the original.  But the addition of Dunaway as the therapist was so unnecessary that it bordered on annoying. It detracted from the movie.  I didn't mind the change in the story (bank to museum) but the movie lasted about 5min longer than it should have.  I call it the ""What's Up Doc?"" ending.  But it is well worth seeing.  Brosnan and Russo were great and hopefully Denis Leary will get more dramatic roles after this.

292,Number siX,"A very good film, but a very average remake",6,25 March 2000,"Well, what can I say after watching this film, being a fan of the original. To begin with, I enjoyed it as it was almost a 90's play by play remake, and I am always pleased to see how a 60's or 70's classic would have looked 20 something years later. The early scenes in the film were very close to the original, with the business deal going through, and then Crown going to observe the heist; although participating this time around, and so, with what I saw I saw a hell of a lot of promise to shine up to the original. The heist seems in both are superbly conceived and very well filmed, with just the right amount of tension about the problems arising. Good stuff.Enter Russo, dressed as a total Dunaway clone (Remember the headscarf?) and with some scenes of total over acting which could have worked well but on the whole didn't. Where Russo seems to let go and enjoy herself is a slip mistake that the character would never have done; Dunaway ALWAYS kept her cool in the original.Enter the cat and mouse thriller element of the film. I have seen a few reviews here that say that this dragged the film along, slowing it down considerably. However, this film, in both versions, is not about a robbery, it is about the chase. The point of the film is the exchanges between the two protagonists, each trying to catch the other out; and this is the brilliance of the film, because it isn't a visual action plot with little in it that so many films are today. This makes you watch, this makes you observe and it makes you think.Moving on to the character of Crown by Brosnan. Some people have said that Brosnan was hollow and one dimensional, with no background to his motivation to the robbery. This is EXACTLY the point and this is why the ending of the 1999 version does NOT work. Thomas Crown only has two things that he cares about: Greed and acquisition. The scene in both versions with the business deal at the beginning is the evidence at this, with the corporate suits joking about ""Thomas Crown actually selling something"" then we find out that he only sold it because, unknown to them, they were offering 30 million more than anyone else. All Crown cares about is possessing as much as he can, this is why he has been alone all this time. And, with this being the point of the character, that is why the ending of the film is so disappointing and unbelievable compared to the original. Crown desired to own the painting and he would not have given this up for the love of a woman, because, although it is obvious he wants a woman to love him, he cannot love women, because he can only love what he owns, and he wants to own everything. The original version, with McQueen deceiving Dunaway, after she betrayed him and then leaving her on the plane is a much more convincing ending.Another unconvincing aspect is the comparison between the McQueen/Dunaway and Brosnan/Russo relationships. Firstly, the dance scene comes nowhere near comparison to the chess scene of the original; and the dance scene is very poorly filmed as well. The chess scene showed both characters attempts at dominance over each other, their lust to win over each other, and they sexual tension between them as they play with the chess pieces, slowly and seductively. The dance scene is a quick montage of unclear movement with the only piece of sexual tension being Brosnan laying his hands on Russo. All the dominance that Dunaway had in the original was disposed of and Russo caved into to sleeping with Crown very easily. Then, there is the Brosnan/Russo sex scene; which in my opinion was HIGHLY unnecessary. McQueen and Dunaway never needed to do a nude scene together, as the sexual tension between the two was so obvious that it could be cut with a bread knife. However, Brosnan and Russo do not have that touch, the spark was nowhere near as big, and the inclusion of a nude scene still does not bring it anywhere near the status of attraction that the original couple had.This film could have been a classic remake if it didn't try to be so politically correct. The only reason why the remake switched from a bank heist to art theft is because, in today's world, armed robbery cannot be presented as an elegant theft. This is ridiculous, as the reason that the original's heist was so smooth was because of the planning, timing and element of no one of the criminals meeting until midway through the heist; all goes on while McQueen watches from across the road. Where was the planning and recruitment in this remake? Oh yes, Russo mentioned it so quickly, it would have been dismissed faster than one of Brosnan's butler's lines. And the idea of a happy ending, with both of the characters, now definitely lovers, flying off into the sunset with plans for happiness together. Garbage. These two characters are selfish and greedy because they only look at for number one in a dog eats dog world. McQueen's Crown saw this, knowing to drop Dunaway or go to jail; and this PC happy ending is just not compatible with this film; as with a cat and mouse thriller, someone has to lose.",The Thomas Crown Affair
293,jgphoenix,"This was a good movie, but the whole egotism thing got to me.",5,10 September 2000,"I had a problem with the fact that Rene Russo's character was just SO much smarter than her male counterparts. Not in a macho way, just that they were all so dumb and whatever she said, was like, ""Huh? Oh, okay."" As if they had no brain of their own. I understand that she is one of the principal characters, but no one else did anything to help solve the case except this superwoman who never had to identify herself or be accountable to anyone.",The Thomas Crown Affair
294,kvkienlin,Wrong title - This is not a remake!,1,6 May 2002,"The original ""Thomas Crown Affair"" showed a cool and disciplined Steve McQueen, a seductive and self-controlled Faye Dunaway and - very important - a really cleverly and well-planned crime. The Story is really like a game of chess, and the dilemma of Faye to choose between love and business is climaxing in the end. Every part of that film could be true.The new film shows nothing of all that. It could be called a ""nice film"" if they only had not tried a ""remake"". Pierce Brosnan is playing a rich loser, who gives away 100.000s of bucks for dull bets. And no real lover of art would handle paintings like he does. Rene Russo always seems to be drunk and remote-controlled. Unfortunately even Faye Dunaway accepted a role in this film - as if that could justify this catastrophe. In the end you are feeling cheated - how can all people be so dumb: if only guards would accept wrong deliveries, if only art experts would not recognize water colors instead of oil, if only detectives would follow every step you take but not after obviously your lover committed a crime (and you will run to him), if only monitoring systems would be at the level of the 1950s... anybody could easily become a criminal like Thomas Crown.Very disappointed!",The Thomas Crown Affair
295,kbmastin,A near-perfect fantasy crime-caper/romance.,9,24 August 2021,"I should say at the outset that I've never seen the original, so this won't be about comparisons.Beautifully choreographed heist scene at the beginning, topped by the last museum scene, an absolute classic.The movie is carried by Russo, and a sizzling interplay of the leads; a pleasure to see an unabashedly hot tango of the two leads, figuratively and literally, and consummation with two actors in their mid-40's, speaking as someone their age.I was also delighted to find the sharp repartee with seductive undercurrent with his therapist was played by none other than a very fine-liiking Faye Dunaway, who my memory has it was famously stroking Steve McQueen's, um bishop in the original about 30 years earlier.It was also a pleasure watching a heist show with zero firearms or bodies. All of the characters were sympathetic, something you rarely see, especially in a movie about a criminal. Even the soundtrack was unexpected but worked well. I doff my bowler hat to everyone that created this movie.",The Thomas Crown Affair
296,setukamal,Striking style and great plot!,8,1 May 2002,"When I first saw the movie I wasnt as struck by it.  However, it was only when I saw it the next time that I realised how entertaining it was - far superior to the original.  There are several great things about the movie - the cast was excellent, I thought.  Pierce Brosnan is not the greatest actor in the world - but he has the look which is great for doing caricatures such as `secretive spy' or `suave business man'.  Being a caricature isnt necessarily a bad thing - most of Dickens characterizations were highly caricatural and very entertaining.  The best wo things about the movie were the soundtrack (which was great) and the plot (the twist with the painting at the end was completely unexpected).  But what also made it great was the direction - you can tell that the director is enjoying Crown's plot as much as the man is himself.  The last sequence of how Thomas Crown replaces the painting shows a complete enjoyment of its mechanics.  the physicality of the moevments and even the presence of the characters from the paintings is relished.  It was also a treat to see how rich people live - and not just rich people, but those with good taste.",The Thomas Crown Affair

299,mikiboy,Better than expected,8,14 October 2005,"I have never been a huge fan of Mr Brosnan and this film has not changed my view TOTALLY. On balance I enjoyed it especially the twist in the tale which was at variance with the original movie and although I don't feel that it is as good as the original (what sequel ever is) it sure made for an pleasant evenings entertainment. Given that to follow such a classic original as the one starring 'the king of cool himself', this company should be congratulated for a very good effort. Certainly worth watching and far better and slicker than other, more highly publicised thriller movies. Go with open mind and enjoy the show.",The Thomas Crown Affair
300,cubsinengland,Emotional Chess . . . updated,8,26 August 2007,"Firstly, it's not a cookie-cutter remake of the original staring Mr. McQueen and Ms. Dunaway - so no comparison required.You might say Brosnan was typecast by Bond, and the idea of a suave player getting one over on yet another woman might be the obvious outcome, but not this time! Instead we're treated to a sophisticated game of cops and robbers, played out in this stylish and seductive entertainment. Mr. Brosnan (Thomas) is at the top of his game and may be involved in something illegal. Ms. Russo (Catherine) is called in to investigate, claiming an office and sharing confidences with the local police department looking for clues. Catherine epitomises sophistication with hair, makeup and fashions styled to perfection. She's an understatement of success; a woman playing a man's game, bounty-hunting life and sex on her own terms and 'enjoying the chase'. Once Catherine is on the trail of Thomas Crown you'll join her in a hedonistic game of one-upmanship. She's done this kind of work before and must stay on her toes if she's going to implicate the wealthy Thomas Crown. The local cops and cultured community believe Mr. Crown to be beyond reproach; an untouchable pillar of wealth and good taste.These two characters exist in their luxurious world through strange circumstance and have made it their own through hard work and some bluffing. The movie provides glimpses into their lifestyles, and at the same time, keeps them both just outside what you'd expect from a wealthy businessman and a woman working for an insurance company.Supporting character Mr. Leary makes a cynical, yet caring detective attempting to save face by nabbing Thomas Crown - however it's quite obvious in a city the size of New York that a bored millionaire looking for thrills by staging a theft is not his priority. Mr. Leary is guilty of a bit of cussing and jaded police behaviour, but ya 'gotta hope he's still on the force.The story races from one clue to the next, and we glimpse a world where time means nothing, and money is just, well, not an issue. The film really sets the tone for the lush life with ultra-posh, elegant sets, millionaire-hobbies and exotic locations. The soundtrack is perfect, giving the entire movie an upmarket, worldly feel that befits a modern romance.This is really a love story for anyone who imagines being whisked away from the mundane into places that you've only read or heard about in glossy magazines. It's a film for any person out there who'd like to have the freedom to do what they want and damn the consequences. Well, either that or have enough money to do anything, then disappear. There is some hot on-screen chemistry between Thomas and Catherine, making the love scenes, coupled with the sexy music and breathtaking backgrounds, erotic. They have a healthy appetite for each other so the love scenes in his apartment and 'island retreat' are the 'stuff that dreams are made of.'Yes, there are little snafus, such as a painting being folded in a manner that would permanently ruin it, and the usual gaffes that serious film-goers will pick over - but heck, it's just a movie and a love story - let yourself go and imagine you're a woman who's just crashed a black tie event in a dress making every man in the room salivate, or that you're the man she's heading for on the dance floor - then have fun with it . . . In the end, for all their cunning, Thomas and Catherine must decide if they can trust each other, just like most men and women must do in any love story. What you may find hard to decide though, is who to root for, and who really wins the game of cat and mouse at the end of this movie.",The Thomas Crown Affair
301,ljmsimons,The whole movie was carried by Renee Russo's personality,8,28 November 2005,I have seen the first TCA with Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway and thought this was superb directing and acting. However Russo's expression and physique carried so much warmth that the whole film was an above average movie. And more easy to watch than the first one. The seducing of Faye was a little overdone . Russo on the other hand was of an extreme held back tension in her eyes which made her performance all the better. We all know less is better and thats what Renee did.La Russo as we Europeans tend to call her is of extreme capabilities and therefor should she quickly be cast in some Italian or french drama films. It is always a pleasure to see her on screen alone or with the whole family does not matter she is a natural born LADY.,The Thomas Crown Affair

This movie was far and away the worst thing I have seen in recent memory, and qualifies as being one of only three movies I have ever walked out on and demanded my money back for. I feel like an hour of my life was sucked out of me by this movie, like some kind of horrid cinematic vampire.What exactly was wrong with this movie?  It was very very very SLOW.  Slow like my grandmother.  Slow like atoms at 1 degree Kelvin.  I'm talking SLOW here, folks.  Which can be ok, if at least the characters and dialog are interesting.  Which they aren't.  Which can be ok, if the story is at least a little bit engaging.  Which it isn't.  And to make it worse, you are assaulted by a soundtrack that could have been ripped straight from your favorite Charlie Brown TV special.All of which leads to a terrible movie.

304,melklein,Smart & Sexy -- two very charismatic actors with great chemistry.,8,22 July 1999,"Saw this at a preview last night -- wonderful. Rene Russo is incredibly beautiful and plays her role with the right mix of beauty & brains. She's smart, seductive, daring and gorgeous. It took a lot of confidence to do her first nude scene at age 45, and she pulls it off with panache. Pierce Brosnan is equally sexy as a billionaire who steals a Monet for sport from the Met (which also is beautiful). The plot twists are wonderful, better than the original. The New York upper crust life that Thomas Crown (Brosnan) leads is nicely contrasted with the poor slob cops chasing him. The homages to the original are less than subtle, but are in good taste. While the story is not credible, you willingly suspend disbelief to see how this beautiful-people love story turns out, and it does not disappoint. 8 out of 10.",The Thomas Crown Affair

I saw it at a sneak preview and will see it again upon regular release; don't miss it!  Rene Russo is stylish and sexy at 45, and does a better job than Faye Dunaway did 31 years ago.  But of course Brosnan can't match Steve McQueen.  Several plot changes from the original keep the fun flowing throughout the film. Music is great as expected from the '68 standards, with a better version of ""Windmills Of Your Mind"" by Sting.  Enjoyable all the way through, with 3 exceptions: dance scene left out what could have been a fast paced, intense innuendo; it didn't adapt the ""comic-strip"" views from the original; and the last 2 mins or so.  But almost all others will disagree with me on that last one I can guarantee.  Overall, a great crowd-pleaser.1999 version: 0-91-100 or ""A"" or ****.1968 version: 0-96-100 or ""A+"" or ****.",The Thomas Crown Affair

It would have been my loss. This movie was a delightful surprise: complex & likable characters, witty dialogue and a clever, suspenseful plot. I watched the original a few days afterward, and with the exception of Yaphet Koto's stunning cool, the '68 version has nothing on the '99 vintage. It does loose a few points for shameless product placement, but all-in-all definitely worth a night at the movies.",The Thomas Crown Affair
311,Neo-115,"Tries hard, but ultimately misses the mark",4,2 August 1999,"Never having seen the original, I went into this one without any preconceptions.  There are 2 things I liked about this film: the beginning and the end.  In-between was about 1-1/2 hours of a clichéd attempt at an erotic thriller.  Pierce Brosnan gets an ""A"" for effort when trying to create chemistry with Rene Russo, but she just looks so god-awful *bad* in her close-ups that we can't imagine why in the world Brosnan's dashing billionaire character would find her physically appealing, let alone give chase.  Sharon Stone or Catherine Zeta-Jones would have been much better (and more believable) in the role. The art heist at the beginning starts out predictably, then throws in a nice twist.  The end similarly has a nice twist of its own, but about halfway through the film I figured out where the stolen painting had been hidden. It wasn't hard -- after all, I had nothing else to do while watching the mechanical cat-and-mouse game between the two leads.  All in all, it makes me want to see the original to see how it compares. Finally, Faye Dunaway's character is completely unnecessary and just bogs down the plot.  The filmmakers' attempt to be ""cute"" with her cameo appearance is fine, but then they beat a dead horse.  At most, she should have been seen in bookends at the beginning and the end, instead of randomly thrown in throughout the film to no benefit of the plot.",The Thomas Crown Affair

It was fun, exciting, and full of wonderfully played out scenes. Pierce Brosnan was at his best in this film, showing off his gorgeous face and rear of course, and exercising his charm as best he could, while Renee Russo seemed to have found a different take on life from the looks of this picture. She was intensely erotic and stylish with her shirt both on and off. I would recommend this film to anyone who has a love for films that just make you feel good about life, This film revolves around a non violent plot, its a very calm movie, worth your while, and your eight bucks!

The therapist scenes with Faye Dunaway are a waste of film, but the rest of the movie is fast paced and holds your interest.Watch the credits and see the big disclaimer regarding the museum angle of the movie - living in the NYC area, of course I assumed the action took place in the Metropolitan Museum, but they are obviously trying to distance themselves.",The Thomas Crown Affair

I loved the original and doubted Mr Brosnan's ability to pull off a successful remake of one of my favorites.  I was wrong, I feel that Mr. Brosnan and company have succeeded in making an excellent variation of the origianl story-line.Coming out of the theater I felt that I now have two excellent versions of the same basic story.  My hat is off to Mr. Brosnan as well as Ms Russo (Wow!).Commenting on some of the details in the new Thomas Crown, I felt that the sound track was very good and contributed greatly to my enjoyment of the movie.  Enough of the original music was kept to lend continuity between versions while the new material was excellent.  The inclusion of Faye Dunaway in the film was an exciting and amusing touch.  There is no way that the cinematography of the original could be duplicated so I was very glad that they didn't try.  I was still happy with the cinematography of this version even though it cannot match that of the original.In summary, given that a successful remake is very rare I am very pleased to now have two excellent versions of one of my favorite stories.",The Thomas Crown Affair

I enjoyed it so much that I rushed to the video store to rent the original, but was immensely disappointed.  The characters in the original are flat and false.  McQueen's Crown has no redeeming qualities and I am still at a loss trying to figure out why he would plan to rob a bank but not do it himself.  Vicky Anderson, with her babydoll voice, is hardly believable as an insurance investigator (and the chess scene is barely viewable).  It was boring.  The 99 remake is a fast-paced and complex film that charms the viewer.  Crown actually participates in the burglary, it's not only about the prize; it's about the rush of the action.  Russo's Banning is a strong and vibrant woman and her incentive to catch the thief is completely believable.  Without giving away too much, it was an absolute delight!

I thought that the plot was fun.  Although a bit predictable at times, I did enjoy the few twists and turns.    I thought that the romantic scenario was typical ""Hollywood,"" but somehow it never fails to work.I enjoyed the character of Thomas Crown.  What man doesn't fantasize about being a ""Thomas Crown"" --abundance of wealth, pulling power-plays with a grin, secluded island hideaway with a sexy woman, etc.  Looked like fun to me!  Brosnan fit the part like a glove, with his look and ever so cool persona.  I was reminded of ""Bond"" at times, although these attributes are probably the ingredients that favor him as a choice for these types of roles.  At first I wasn't sure about Rene Russo playing the part of Catherine Banning.  In the beginning Catherine was a little too brash for me but as the movie progressed her character grew on me, as did Rene.I also enjoyed Sting's rendition of an old  classic.I say lay your money down, sit back and enjoy a 90's kind of movie.",The Thomas Crown Affair

It wasn't romantic, it wasn't cute or funny or serious (with itself at least)..what exactly went wrong?It was boring. I missed almost an hour (by choice) and understood the ending and surprised that it took that long to get there.I also felt that they played off the Bond/Remington Steele image but added a little too much sex into a romantic character and that destroyed the image quickly with nothing to replace it.In a world of fast paced movies I was hoping for something a little slower-but not this slow.Next time I'm in the mood for a nice romantic film this movie will remind me they don't make them like they used to and I'll head for the classics.Not a good last impression.",The Thomas Crown Affair

328,mike thompson,Definitely a film to miss,1,7 October 2001,"Having spent two hours yetserday evening watching this film on Satellite TV, the only positive feeling that I had was that at least I hadn't spent money renting the DVD, or even worse purchasing it. Although the film is beautifully shot, it lacks a certain element - namely believability.From the moment of the robbery, which is full of inconsistencies, to the point where the insurance investigator decides that Crown is the thief (for no other reason that I could see but it was the only way the scripters could manage to move what remained of the plot forward) right up to the ending the film is laughably inept.As an attempt to make a 'sophisticated' film it failed simply because it treated its audience like morons. Sophistication has to fail when the audience spends half the time wondering where on earth they managed to find a judge to sign a search warrant against one of the richest men in New York on no evidence at all, or why the police didn't arrest the insurance investigator after discovering her illegal activities.The obligatory sex scenes were equally laughable - making love on a marble staircase has to be the most uncomfortable experience ever (I do not speak from personal knowledge).Apart from some good camera work this film has nothing to recommend it and must rank as one of the worst films it has ever been my misfortune to see.This is a definite not-to-see.",The Thomas Crown Affair
329,armand_ar,"One of those movies you just got to watch, again and again",10,24 July 2007,"I caught it on HBO and realized what an entertaining movie this is and regretted not watching it on the big screen.Pierce and Rene owned the movie and their superb acting holds the story together. It is not about the heist nor the painting, though the soundtrack was excellent. It's about love between 2 person who refused to believe that they are capable of being loved.Never a fan of Pierce but this movie certainly cemented his status as an actor. None of his James Bond movie came close to delivering such a superb performance. You can always count on Rene to deliver her best in any movie.You can say I am inlove with this movie and yes you are right indeed. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys watching movie for what it is and not trying to show off your intelligence by disecting the movie.Simply, one of the best!",The Thomas Crown Affair
330,Matwau,Sit back and enjoy the ride.,10,2 November 2002,"It does not take a fool to realize that this is one of the most entertaining films to appear in recent years. Those who don't recognize that fact must lead very lonely and frustrating lives. It's fantasy, pure and simple. Enjoy it as such. It's also better in every way than the original which must go down as one of the most boring films ever made as a result of the best scenes being left on the cutting room floor.",The Thomas Crown Affair
331,cjvancastel,Great movie!,9,17 May 2009,"The Tomas Crown affair Directed by John McTiernanI've never had real class and style, but Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) has it all. When Thomas Crown is bored, he likes to visit the Guggenheim museum in Manhattan. There is one of the greatest paintings ever, ""the Crepuscule"" from Claude Monet on exhibition. On just an ordinary day the painting is stolen. Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) a bounty hunter, who is sent in by a Swiss insurance company, wants to solve the theft. She suspects Thomas Crown from the start. What follows is a cat-and-mouse-game between Catherine and Thomas.Thomas Crown is the reason that I like this movie so much. His extravagant style and class makes me want to be him. For example, Thomas has got a nice car with a driver, a nice house in the middle of New York with his own butler, a very nice yet plane etc. These are not the things which give him style, it's the way he treats his property and servants. He is really easy going and gentle to them. He treats people with respect,that's why people treat him with respect too.Thomas Crown has got his own company: Crown Acquisitions. He is a very wealthy man who likes to enjoy his money. As already told before, Thomas is easily bored. When he is bored he makes up the most exiting things to do. For example he destroyed a 100.000 dollar boat just because he liked the splash. He also likes to play other exiting games, like the game he plays with Catherine. But the question is, can he win this one. The larger theme of the movie is action/romance. This is because of the great wonderful scenes like the scene with were Catherine and Thomas were flying in a glider. They made a wonderful tour through the hills. They landed about four states away from Thomas his car. He called someone to pick them up and they were brought to an airport from were they flew to a very beautiful tropical island. Thomas has a really nice house on the island on the top of a mountain. The view was wonderful they could see a part of a jungle and the sea. Even though the movie is filled with nice romantic scenes, the movie doesn't become soft at all. The movie never gets dull because the cat and mouse game between Thomas and Catherine goes on.This movie from John McTiernan is his best movie ever. If you will take a look at it, you will see a wonderful playful movie about a rich man and his nicely played games. You also will find out if Thomas will ever grow up and if he will end his games.",The Thomas Crown Affair
332,kosimo,An excellent movie,10,21 March 2015,"Elegant, stylish, complex and elaborated. Pierce Brosnan acts extremely well, his character seems created by him. The conversations, the plot, the storyline. I am in love with this movie and watched several times, listening to the music connections in every single scene. From the beginning to the end, a masterpiece. Unexpected until the end, and never loosing that beautiful touch of elegance. Sure there are some scenes that could be improved, but all the goodness of the movie hide some minor errors completely. Totally worth it. The sound track by the way is a masterpiece too a mixture between south American music with some jazz",The Thomas Crown Affair
333,austinmwhaley,superb,9,10 October 2011,"No need to go into major detail but... this movie is superb 1) Pierce Brosnan is perfect for this role. He plays this character perfectly down to his attitude. Rich but not snobby. 2) Story-line is the perfect length. Does not go into great detail about unnecessary subjects but provides detail in areas that are needed. 3) Soundtrack fits perfectly to the movie. Every scene has a unique vibe to it that it allows the viewer to just experience the movie with enhanced feelings. 4) Ending could not get any better. NO SPOILERS but it really could not get any better. 5) Auxiliary characters ,such as the museum art wing director, provide a perfect base for main characters to effectively get an introduction. Personal Opinion: amazing movie. strongly recommended.",The Thomas Crown Affair
334,mickey-flager,A comfortable crime comedy/romance.,10,30 June 2019,A yearly favorite that ages like a fine champagne. As good as sitting in Central Park reading a great romance novel. The cast makes it work...extremely well.,The Thomas Crown Affair
335,thrausos,"See the life of someone who has everything, but steel searching for something he didn't have...",10,19 December 2005,"The film begins were usually the others ended! With a robbery! But it isn't any robbery! One rich guy steal a peace of artwork, everyone knows who did it, but anyone can prove it...! Until he find someone on his match... You will see a charming game between Brosnan (one of his best films) and Rene Russo (perfect for the role)! You will be played almost at the end, you will never know what happens next... Who thinks Brosnan only can be 007, see his perfect role which we can see either points of his personality, the charming and elegant Brosnan! Inspiring for boys and lovely for girls... Rene Russo is a surprise! We see Catherine Banning superiorly performed! Russo makes the kind of woman that have everything under control...

336,missnicoleb-1,Best Movie Ever,10,9 January 2005,"I never saw the original so I can't compare the two but everything about this movie is pure genius. It is a fast paced movie with a lot of dry humor and sexual appeal (The sex scene is very explicit). You have to watch all of the details in order to follow the movie and it really makes you think! I think that Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan have an excellent chemistry together and Denis Leary makes a great cop who though starts out bitter, softens up quite a bit to someone you end up liking. The music is excellent especially Nina Simone's ""Sinner Man"" and the song from the original movie ""Windmills of your Mind"" The scenery is beautiful the effects are great and it is a movie that you will want to watch over and over again.",The Thomas Crown Affair
337,bragasouza28,Masterpiece!Everybody should watch it!,10,17 January 2008,"When I first watched this film, I found it very interesting,but it was when I watched it for the second and third time that I found it excellent,terrific.I just loved everything on this film. The performance of the actors is too good.Pierce Brosnan's performance exceeded all the expectations,I think it was the best performance he ever did!And Rene Russo,I think I don't even need to write much,her performance was stunning,just fabulous!!And about the director John McTiernan,I think he can walk home knowing that his job on this film was done!!!My expectations now are focused on the new film of Thomas Crown Affair. Will the director Paul Verhoeven do a terrific job on that film like John McTiernan did on the last film?Just time will let us know! While the new movie don't come out,I'll keep watching the last version!!! If you have the DVD of this film,don't lose it,cause what you have in hands it's a masterpiece!",The Thomas Crown Affair
338,mbuchanan05,"Boring, clichéd, and predictable",3,27 August 2005,"I didn't really enjoy this film.Pierce Brosnan plays a stereotypical, rich, arrogant businessman who enjoys art theft as a pastime. Right from the moment he meets Catherine Olds Banning, you can sense immediately that they will become romantically involved, and ""live happily ever after"", so to speak. You just knew he was going to be on board the plane at the end of the film, and that yet another romantic encounter would occur.Pierce Brosnan's finest moment was, obviously, Bond, but this was just a lacklustre performance which led to a dreary, formulaic film that was just boring to watch. During the first art theft, you knew right away that the professional art thieves were all going to get caught, but Pierce Brosnan was obviously going to get away with effectively ""stealing"" their crime, leaving them to the mercy of the police and gallery guards.The scenes at the end of the film, involving the many men in bowler hats was purely ridiculous and, in my mind, unnecessary. It was the usual overdone glamour that plagues Brosnan films, the same effects as observed within the Bond movies.On the whole, the plot left nothing to the imagination - most things were far too obvious. The script was full of the usual cheesy clichés that you'd usually expect, and everything was too far-fetched to be anything like entertaining.Dreadful.",The Thomas Crown Affair
339,pedro_ximenes_padilha,Totally underrated,8,5 January 2020,A masterpiece. I didn't understand this average evaluation.,The Thomas Crown Affair
340,laurence-66,Best Brosnan movie,10,17 November 2005,Liked any of Brosnans outings as Mr Bond??? - you will love this ! More suave than Bond - is that possible ? Having seen this movie- Brosnan proves himself to have a range beyond bond too - whilst engraving the fact that he was born to be the secret agent. I won't hide the fact that I think its a massive disappointment to loose him as James Bond ...and a double blow when I learned who replaces him.No matter how good an actor MR Craig might be - he is no JB Sorry ....was this review about The Thomas Crown affair ???!! ha ha Yes - a fine film indeed and much better than the original (if you could call it that?)If you haven't seen it - rent it/buy it Laurence,The Thomas Crown Affair
341,boenspeed,Excellent,10,24 January 2006,"This movie is probably number 1 on my top ten list of the best movies of all time. With excellent writing, acting and cinematography on all accounts it is impossible to find a hole in the plot anywhere. Rene Russo is in rare form with exceptional emotional moments through out the movie. Pierce plays an affluent Wall Street business man to a perfect T. With meant-to-be on-screen chemistry Brosnan and Russo are truly a pair to beat. The movie also includes fantastic cinematographic views of all scenes especially Manhattan and Martinique Island. It is a movie that will entertain all audiences older than 18. With two rather racy scenes you best put the kids to bed before starting this flick. Overall I give the movie 10 out of 10 stars. It's hard to beat this movie in any Genre. It even has comedic moments and is a true must see.",The Thomas Crown Affair
342,kent_c,Rene Russo Ruins the Movie!,5,22 February 2006,"The Thomas Crown Affair is a great heist movie. It is clever and original (of course not that original... it is a remake).Pierce Brosnan does a great job as the main character and his acting talents lend themselves to a suave, live dangerously rich guy (I mean, he is James Bond as well).Now the problem. Rene Russo. Her character is not only a huge cliché, but she does a horrible job acting out the part, and is relatively unattractive on top of all that. Who wants some apparently over the hill bad actress in a bad role. She wears thigh high black leather boots to work, you know, 'cause she is sexy, but then sits down and drinks sludge in one big gulp. Oh I get it, she is tough too.If only the stupidity of one character did not consistently ruin scenes and annoy the viewer this movie would be a solid 7 or 8. Putting Rene in makes it a 5. And I'm being generous.",The Thomas Crown Affair
