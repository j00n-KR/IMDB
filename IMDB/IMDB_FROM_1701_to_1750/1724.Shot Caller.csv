0,Leofwine_draca,Grim and gritty,6,29 October 2019,"SHOT CALLER is another grim and gritty crime thriller with lengthy sections depicting the brutalities of prison life. The starring role is given to none other than GAME OF THRONES star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who makes an excellent job of it and is unrecognisable when compared to the clean cut Jaime Lannister. The one part I didn't like was the editing and format, which needlessly cuts back and forth in time so that the protagonist's prison experiences are shown in flashback; I never see the need for such contrivances and it gets tiring pretty quickly. I suppose having half the movie a prison flick and half a post-prison flick, in chronological order, would be out of the question. Jon Bernthal burns up the screen again in yet another dangerous performance.",Shot Caller
1,nogodnomasters,You're the stockbroker,6,15 August 2017,"Jacob (Jon Bernthal) is a stockbroker who is involved in a fatal accident involving a DUI. His sentence was light, but in order to survive he gets involve with a prison gang and subsequently gets his sentenced extended. The film is divided into a plot and subplot with one showing Jacob in the present planning an arms deal and Jacob while in prison prior to getting out.I thought it was odd that Jacob went from stockbroker to planning the job for the gang with his only criminal experience was while locked up. This is different in that Jacob tells his family to move on, while they want to reunite with him. The film has action and drama that was decent, but nothing about the film makes it stand out.Guide: F-word. Brief nudity (Sarah Minnich)",Shot Caller
2,classicsoncall,"""A warrior's deadliest weapon is his mind.""",8,12 May 2020,"""Shot Caller"" seems to be an awkward title for a movie, but the story eventually gets to the point where it's explained well enough. This is a gritty crime and prison drama following a former businessman's descent into depravity upon receiving a jail term for a DUI resulting in the death of a friend. Forced to conform to a jailhouse code of conduct, Jacob 'Money' Harlon (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) becomes an instrumental link in a plot to sell illegal assault weapons confiscated by a former soldier during the Iraq War. Harlon walks a tightrope between a massive prison inmate nicknamed The Beast (Holt McCallany), and parole officer Ed Kutcher (Omari Hardwick), who's intent is to bring down the gang involved in the weapons deal. The story utilizes multiple flashbacks to Harlon's former family life, and the non-linear format is made a bit easier to follow with the obvious changes in his appearance in the appropriate segments. There are times in the story where you might be as conflicted about Harlon's behavior as that of Kutcher, but when things settle out, you realize that everything he's done as a lawbreaker was meant to keep his family safe, even through a forced estrangement with his wife and son. This seemed to me to be a film that could have gone either way in the IMDb ratings system, as it's '7.3' standing as I write this seems pretty favorable. At the same time, it doesn't seem like the kind of movie a casual viewer would tune into with nothing better to do. I liked it, with my first look at actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, not having been a follower of ""Game of Thrones"".",Shot Caller
3,Wizard-8,Don't miss this one!,9,16 May 2020,"I hadn't even heard of this movie before stumbling across it on Netflix. It had a sparse description, but it was enough to intrigue me enough to watch it. Sometimes I stumble on a real gem when cruising around Netflix, and that is definitely true for this movie. It manages to tell two stories - how a law abiding man can turn into a harden criminal, as well as what happens when that same person is freed into society. The movie chooses to keep cutting back between these two parts of the man's life, which I think is much better than if it had been told chronologically - it keeps the storytelling fresh while peeling away the layers of the character so we know what's driving him and making him make his decisions. Almost everything else about the movie is top notch - the production values are solid and the acting is convincing and professional. The only flaws I feel the movie has is that the central character's transformation into a hardened con is done a little too quickly, and the ending to somewhat of a degree is predictable. But those are just minor flaws in an otherwise outstanding production. This is one movie that is definitely worth the time to invest in.",Shot Caller
4,gradyharp,Alternative concepts of Family,8,1 September 2017,"Writer/Director Ric Roman Waugh (Snitch, That Which I Love Destroys Me, Felon0 has devised a film that shows the inner minds of prisoners, the effect of being incarcerated has on newcomers, and the changes that can happen as the prisoner leaves family on the outside and joins 'family' on the inside. With a strong cast he makes us understand these transitions and while during the film the time lapses between the before and the after behaviors are trying, the end result is a heady statement.A newly released prison gangster Jacob/Money (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldeau) is forced by the leaders of his gang to orchestrate a major crime with a brutal rival gang head by The Beast (Holt McCallany) on the streets of Southern California. The members of both the police side of the story and the criminal side are well enacted by Jon Bernthal, Omari Hardwick, Evan Jones, Jeffrey Donavan, Juan Pablo Raba, Benjamin Bratt, Keith Jardine et al. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldeau inhabits this challenging role and he is the reason the film ultimately is satisfying.",Shot Caller
5,mm-39,Excellent film.,8,17 August 2021,"Excellent film! Shot Caller has a social message without a social message. There is non violent man entering the penial system leaving a better criminal. Wondering if house arrest would have been better? Shot Caller has a business man who is a family man. A tragic distracted car accident but the protagonist in jail. The harden prisoners watching the new the protagonist. Our protagonist see what happens weak, and we see the primal human animal operate in prison. Survival and looking after his family is the protagonist life. As the film evolves we see him change. From businesses man into the Shot Caller. Well directed, acted and scripted. Netflix had one good movies. Just a story with out any over dramatics. There is the cops, prison guards, and the Aryan nation and the prison. Worth watching. 8 stars.",Shot Caller
6,deloudelouvain,Good gang related movie,7,29 November 2017,"Nothing beats a good gang movie at least when it looks like it comes straight from the streets. Shot Caller starts as an ordinary drama where a completely normal guy ends up in jail after causing an accident with lethal consequences. From then on the story takes a turn in hard prison life with the usual gang rivalries. I only knew Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau from the Game Of Thrones series as one of The Lannisters so I was pleasantly surprised he could play other characters. I thought he's even better in this movie than in the series. He's the main character of Shot Caller and he deserves this role. The rest of the cast was also very good in their respective characters. At the end I had some questions but they got answered at the complete end so for that I was this time not disappointed. If I were you I would give this movie a shot, you won't be disappointed.",Shot Caller

8,ThomasDrufke,Absorbing,8,14 September 2018,"After recommendations, several times over, I finally got around to watching Shot Caller. A brutally eye-opening glimpse into the world of an inmate in an LA prison. Telling the story of a regular man who, over several years, turns into a hardened criminal and of the most wanted ""validated"" California gang members. Although not based on a true story, Shot Caller presents a gritty and presumably realistic look at the ins and outs of being in prison. I loved the non-linear structure of it all to go back and forth and make for an experience more unsettling upon further viewing. The only thing I think the film could have used more of is showing the audience why exactly he chose to go this route in prison. I understand that he had to what he had to do to survive but I could have used an extra scene or two giving us an idea of what his family is going through and why he felt this was the only way. With that said, Shot Caller is an original crime film that serves as yet another reminder of the impressive talent that is Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. Boy, what a film this was.8.6/10",Shot Caller

It shows you brutally of what happens with a good person (seemingly) when he is thrown into brutal prison system. First he has to do all to survive himself. Later, well I won't spoil anything of what happens later.""Shot Caller"" is a strong movie with excellent performances by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (a pleasant acting surprise), an always entertaining and raw Jon Bernthal and other actors who did I think an excellent job.

Music at the end also was very good.Overall, ""Shot Caller"" is a pretty brutal movie that shows realities of what happen with a descent person who is being thrown into prison system.

11,cruise01,Great acting from Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau performance but slow and boring film,6,21 October 2017,"Shot Caller a crime thriller film about a family businessman Jacob (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), who gets sentenced to prison for 2 years for a dui car accident that left his friend dead and others injured. He gets mixed with the criminals that will test him on trying to be the big shot and being part of a gang. His choice on surviving prison in a gang will lead him to serve a longer term of 10 years for riots. Once, released his parole officer will be on his trail after his activities of continuing the gangs work. That is aided by shotgun (Jon Bernthal) and there activities of illegal weapons dealing. Shot Caller is a slow moving film. It can be boring within the first hour or so. Once, the non-linear direction of the movie ties the pieces together. It does pick up. The direction goes back and forth with Jacob being released from a ten year sentenced in prison to the events prior when he was a businessman and his encounters when he was in prison. There is a twist that works with the film which does leave you wanting to know more on Jacobs motives behind all his actions that he makes in the movie (without giving away spoilers). The plot is decent though. Nothing that will be memorable once it is over. Basically a criminal that is working his way to the top in prison and continuing the gangs work after he is release. The script is written and directed by Ric Roman Waugh, who also did 2013 film Snitched with Dwayne Johnson. Which has some identical plot concept as well. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau performance was great. He is known for playing Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones. Seeing him playing a turned gangster and sporting that mustache and being all tatted up is different for his acting. There are other good actors as well like Jon Bernthal that did decent. Which is starting to feel like all he plays is a bad boy attitude guy. Surprisingly there are other actors like Benjamin Bratt, Jeffrey Donovan, and Lake Bell that were all decent as well. Overall, Shot Caller is a fair crime thriller film. The acting was great. The concept was intriguing with Jacob, a businessman turned criminal and his motives behind his actions. The direction is very slow moving which can be boring. And the plot is nothing worth noting or talking about even with the twist. I rate the film 3 out of 5 stars. I only recommend the film as a rental and if you are bored and want to see a crime thriller film.",Shot Caller
12,Floated2,Gripping but missleading,6,3 June 2018,"Shot Caller has been somewhat praised by fans alike for its realism picture, and acting from the leads, especially Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. The film starts off quite interesting at first and remains such due to its non-linear storytelling (as we see the transformation from Jacob to Money is great acting) then somewhat lingers in the end where we wonder what the point is.Relatively becomes boring and confusing in the final part of the film, though the first half as to how the film is set up is quite good. Shot Caller is decent but most perhaps a film for a selective audience. It did not blow me away or left me wanted more like some reviews have stated.",Shot Caller

The tone is a dark one and we get besides the violence and crimes some emotional moments too. The only thing I gotta complain - I would have focused on the events leading to the prison sentence and after that on ""prison-life"" entirely. Those scenes ""inside"" are the strongest and most interesting parts of Shot Caller. The ""outside"" stuff is still good but rather standard, but anyway, Shot Caller is still a good one.",Shot Caller

Jacob is eventually released from prison, but must do an arms deal and his relationship with Kate and their son is torn apart. Jacob decides to do what's best for and protect them by staying away.

15,dworldeater,Made in prison,8,28 June 2020,"Nicolaj Costner Waldau, who is best known for playing Jamie Lanister from Game Of Thrones is superb as a stock broker turned career criminal after he spends some time behind bars after a car accident that resulted in the death of his friend. He ends up joining a white supremacist gang ""The Woods"" who are big on the west coast. To survive, he has to do what he has to do in prison, which has consequences that unlimitedly get him deeper in the gang life and also results in more prison time. This shows a serious character transformation that is very tragic. Shotcaller is very violent and gritty, very realistic in its presentation. The acting is very good and Shotcaller is a very powerful film that is recommended.",Shot Caller
16,valleyjohn,Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau is fantastic,8,30 September 2017,"The name Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau may not be the most recognisable name to most people but Game of Thrones fans will know him as  Jaime Lannister. I'm a big fan in GOT but funnily enough I don't actually think Coaster-Waldau gets to vent his acting chops too much in it. In Shot Caller he certainly does. It's the story of a banker , Jacob Harlon ,who is sent to prison for causing the death of his friend while drink driving. While in prison he realises that he has to leave his previous life behind and adapt to the brutality of his new surroundings in order to survive. But even after being released, he is still caught up in the prison's gang rivalries. This film was right up my street. I love the grittiness of it and the fact that the main character realised pretty quickly that there was only one way he was going to survive. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau is fantastic in it. You wouldn't recognise the pre prison Jacob to the institutionalised Jacob because he does such a great job and the rest of the cast a good too. Highly Recommended",Shot Caller

18,robertemerald,Brilliant example of a gritty modern prison drama,9,29 March 2019,"Shot Caller's structure is two part, a brutal prison drama and a flashback story of a young, handsome and very innocent professional (he's either a stock broker or an architect, this isn't clear) whom has life ripped away from him after a conviction for a lesser crime. If this movie is an indictment of how the prison system in America brutalises otherwise non-criminals, then it certainly succeeded. It's a hero movie. The writer has gone to great pains to establish the protagonist is the good guy. Too much I thought, stealing from the impact of the ending (though not the emotional impact, perhaps that was the aim), which is largely predictable. Yet this is a great movie. Sure, the theme is well known, but I sincerely doubt anyone has previously seen a prison movie quite like this one. The casting is superb. It's a big man's world. The soundtrack is lonely and modern, and dark where there are pressure points. It's well handled. Great sets too, which admirably avoid any sense of the prison side of things becoming clinical looking or claustrophobic. In fact the wideness of a lot of the more poignant scenes underlines the gravity of the one against the odds. Shot Caller is definitely destined to become a prison drama classic.",Shot Caller
19,RatedVforVinny,Hard hitting,7,12 November 2018,"Once you can can stretch your imagination to believe a city type, suited worker, could become the ultimate 'Gangbanger', which I find quite a large stretch, this becomes a very watchable and tense prison drama.

20,Easygoer10,"Touching, But Not Authentic",6,21 May 2020,"Those film has a very clean black & white view of what life if like living behind bars. It is so much grittier than is depicted. This died not surprise me. SABAN films is a lower middle class studio. In other words, they make good films; however you will never see a 1st class movie. Their highest budget runs in the $30 million territory. As such, they can get quite good scripts and casts. This film is a perfect example of that. Thete are no ""A List actors"". Theu ate all terrific; however you will not see anyone like a Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Colin Farrell, Matt Damon (etc, etc) level of headline grabbing actor in one of their movies. The sane goes for the screenplays and directors. All this noted, a much better watch (and more authentic) is ""Son of a Gun"" from A24 (2014). It is an outstanding film starring Ewan McGregor, Brenton Thwaites and Alicia Vikander; a must see true life story of the Australian criminal Brendan Lynch. McGregor is superb in the role.

21,shakercoola,A metamorphosis thriller which enthralls but only on a broad level,7,13 July 2018,"An American crime thriller; A story about a former stockbroker worker turned fearsome gang member,recently released from prison after a prolonged sentence, who finds himself forced into orchestrating a major crime with a rival gang.
This film has some very familiar themes at work: An everyman turns to gangster life to survive; Doing terrible things to sacrifice for one's family; A product of prison - the institutionalised man. Black vs white gangs, guards turning to corruption, and dedicated, no-holds-barred cops. While these themes provide some suspense and drama, the film's plot is its strength - a denoument deftly directed, a mystery gripping - yt never loses intrigue.
There are issues which critics rightly have rightly placed as central problems. One is the pacing - it runs too fast as a life tumbles into doom. The grisly things the lead character is expected to undertake are frankly hard to believe for a man put up as a good guy, whose only vice is being guilty of manslaughter and negligence. The implausability is magnified by the pacing. Up goes the brutality, down goes the emotional core. Not enough is given by the lead character to make three issues work at the same time: criminal, victim and good guy. We can try and understand how someone can be forced to murder but we need time and explication.
Nevertheless, Coster-Waldau as the lead is tremendous, showing a descent into thuggishness. We are drawn in and it never wavers until the end. But for a few false notes, this could have been a minor classic.",Shot Caller

23,arungeorge13,Surprisingly good! [+70%],7,12 August 2017,"'Shot Caller' is a film that sucks you in right from the opening shot. Cell #13, High Security Prison. A man writes a letter to his only child telling him not to follow his daddy's ways and move further ahead in life no matter what transpires.It's a quaint touch really, because the viewer is yet to know why the gangster is doing so. Writer/director Ric Roman Waugh unravels the story of Jacob 'Money' Harlon in a back and forth manner. There's the grim present, where Money is an established name in the world of South Californian gangsters and coaxed by fellow gang- members and leaders to supervise an arms deal, and there's the chronicle of his transition from a family man with a job that lets him don suits, into a prisoner acquitted on account of accidental murder and thereafter into a ruthless 'white-supremacist' gang member. The way the story unfurls is believably realistic and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau does an exceptional job playing the protagonist, ably supported by a talented ensemble who deserve greater appreciation than what they're getting right now. Lake Bell, Jon Bernthal, Jeffrey Donovan, Omari Hardwick and Holt McCallany all have well-nurtured characters to portray. Wish there was more to do for Lake Bell's character in the film (as well as more light shed on the gradual breakdown of their relationship). However, the writer/director does not delineate much into what urged Money to undertake some of the decisions shown in the film (like choosing life sentence over 18 months and so on!). While the proceedings steadily convert Jacob/Money into a really tough, composed character, it ultimately leaves him less credible for the viewer to side with. That said, the writing helps end things on a high. The twist at the end is a perfect example of good writing supplementing faultless execution albeit in true Hollywood fashion.'Shot Caller' is an intriguing character study that is well worth your time. This is a thrilling, no-holds barred tale of a human who eventually turns into an untamed animal just as the title of the book Money reads towards the dire end of the flick. Frankly, my two hours of viewing just whizzed by. Verdict: One of 2017's unexpected surprises!",Shot Caller
24,MR_Heraclius,I enjoyed this movie,7,23 February 2020,"It showed a lot of potential with the premise, but it spends most of its time hovering between wanting to be a smart character study of how a businessman can become a ruthless gangster through prison, and a violent action/thriller that focuses on gangs and how they operate. By not fully committing to either, some potency is lost. But is it bad? Not at all. In fact, with a captivating central performance of a complex character from Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and enough interesting ideas to hold your attention (particularly when it comes to the effects and inner-workings of a prison), it's still pretty entertaining.",Shot Caller
25,leftbanker-1,Solid Noir Prison Thriller,10,29 August 2017,"I don't know what it is about prison movies that attracts me like flies to whatever flies really like. I just think prison represents the ultimate test for a man, at least in fiction. The people in real life who rise to the top of this bottom of the barrel are probably the lowest form of life imaginable, which leads me to one of my biggest complaint about this film that I really liked.This was some gritty-as-hell stuff. My kind of noir. When I think of noir, the first thing to come into my head is prison. I wrote a story for a noir crime contest and the first thing that popped into my head was a prison drama. My story call Visiting Day was chosen (Noirville by Fahrenheit Press).I pretty much believed every one of the actors in this thing from the cops to the jailers to the gangbangers and in my opinion that is all due to good directing.I had very few problems with this film. They make a big deal about what a great dad, husband and human Money was before he went to jail, a successful stockbroker blah blah blah. I just think that rising up the ladder on the Aryan Nation hierarchy requires a completely different skill set than Wall Street of whatever. I just wish they had underplayed his past. Just say that he went to jail and he had a life before and a family. The less said the better, as far as I'm concerned.I feel that extreme violence in films such as this should warrant an X rating or whatever they call that these days. This was extremely graphic so if that isn't your thing then find something else to watch. Why would anyone under 18 be allowed to watch this hyper-violent movie? Kids can't watch porno but they can see this sort of graphic stuff? I don't get it.",Shot Caller
26,antoniotierno,seems like a series,6,23 September 2017,"There's an abiding sensation of inevitability running through the story, as if all the events that occur were predestined because of systemic rot. ""Shot Caller"" isn't the type of movie that would use the phrase ""prison-industrial complex"" but that works in the end to its advantage as its implications live in its bones. There's a casual brutality at play but it never feels grotesque. The actual mechanics of ""Shot Caller"" are not strong but in the end there's a clean and functional direction. In the end the flick shows a bloody story, a lot of violence and half-hearted climaxes that never once have any lasting impact whatsoever.",Shot Caller

It's a very polished production with a solid, believable plot and some excellent acting. The film has a very moody atmosphere and is well-paced, with the plot developments and twists timed for maximum impact. It is also very well written and is constructed in a way that keeps the audience compelled throughout.The film contains some fascinating and unpredictable characters, all of which feel convincing and properly thought out. Main character 'Jacob' in particular is intriguing and very difficult to read. The film is high on tension and, once it finds its rhythm, has no difficulty holding your attention until the final scene.

29,spookyrat1,Double Barrel Impact!,8,19 May 2020,"I knew absolutely nothing about Shot Caller before I saw it. Didn't even know, that it was primarily a ""prison"" film. But sometimes this is the best approach to have with a movie. I was pleasantly surprised. It is ostensibly about the transformation of a well-to-do family man into a hardened prison gangster, which he undergoes to survive California's penal system after he is incarcerated for his role in a deadly DUI car accident. But interwoven with this main thread, is a second storyline. Jacob (Money) Harlon, the former family guy, has to face the obligation of facilitating a weapons deal for his white supremacist jail gang, with a Mexican cartel, after he leaves prison on parole. Hanging over his head, is a very obvious threat to his family, if he fails to deliver for his"" jail family"", the gang.The narrative, as commonly occurs these days, plays out over 2 distinct time lines. This can be a really annoying device at times, but in the very competent hands of director Ric Roman Waugh, it's actually well used. The third act finale plays out so much tighter and in a more suspenseful vein, than if a straight linear form of story telling had taken place.Shot Caller is built around the central performance of Nikolaj Coster - Waldau and take it from me, he doesn't let anyone down in terms of the quality of his acting. He's really good. He really pours himself wholeheartedly into his evolution, from a fresh con off the bus, into an extremely jail-smart gang member, who works his way up the prison hierarchy into being a shot caller ( literally calling the shots) for his mob.The support cast are also fearsomely convincing in the main, though I still don't quite understand how or why Omari Hardwick as Ed Kutcher, Money's parole officer, spent virtually all the movie, running around with the cops, trying to solve crimes. I thought parole officers, even in North America, were a completely different section of the justice system. But I could be wrong. Writer/director Waugh certainly appears to know his way around the Californian penal system.While prison movies and films about criminals are hardly unique, the combination of the two in Shot Caller, showing the connection and how some one such as Harlon, can never really leave prison behind, is both an interesting and surprisingly emotional journey in parts. Sad to say (and I'd like to think I'm wrong) rehabilitation just appears as a fanciful Holy Grail element; virtually impossible to achieve.",Shot Caller

It's about Jacob's journey from clean-cut family man to a hard and violent gang member that shouldn't be crossed. This kind of movie has been done before but Shot Caller does an excellent job of getting you to feel for Jacob but at the same time being shocked by his actions. In this context, you understand why he did what he did but the depth of his transformation is shocking yet intriguing. The ending of the movie goes in an unexpected direction that is kind of take it or leave it but its about the journey and that's the most important part of Shot Caller. It's worth noting that Jacob has to join a white supremacist gang and the movie doesn't really comment on their policies. I don't agree with those policies but the movie is about Jacob and not this gang. If you want a movie that takes a hard look at the white supremacist movement, check out Imperium.The biggest reason you should check this out is the awesome acting by the cast. This is an amazing acting job by Coaster-Waldau, he's great on Game of Thrones but he hasn't had the same kind of mainstream success outside of it. He completely pulls off this difficult role and it's one of the best acting jobs I've seen this year. I really like Jon Bernthal as an actor, he's good in this but I was wondering why he thought this project was for him? He's almost too high profile for this. Omari Hardwick was decent as Kutcher, the parole officer. I wish Lake Bell was in this movie more but she really threw her all into this. She has some very emotional scenes. Jeffery Donovan and Holt McCallany make for intimidating villains as Bottles and the Beast respectively.The only negative thing I have to say about Shot Caller is that as the story went along, the plausibility of Jacob's actions became more and more outlandish. It's a stretch that he'd even be thrown in this facility but I let that go because the movie explained it. The farther Jacob is indoctrinated into the gang, the more violent and explicit his actions become. That's the point of the story, how he loses his humanity through this experience but I just didn't buy the extent to which he devolves. It didn't completely ruin the movie but it did damper my enjoyment a little.It's too bad that this movie hasn't gotten more attention. This is a good character piece on top of a solid prison drama and this is easily Waldau's best work outside of Game of Thrones. He works so well in this that to me it's award worthy. Shot Caller isn't boldly new but it absolutely achieved what it wants to and although it sidesteps some of the issues, it still hits hard. I'd absolutely recommend this to anyone who's interested in it.",Shot Caller

34,danielmanson,Wow. Hidden gem of a film,8,18 September 2021,"Well I can safely say I did not expect that film to be that good. It's absolutely outstanding. Amazing acting, brilliant storyline and the characters are so good. It's genuinely got the whole package.First 20 minutes or so I was a bit 50/50 on what was happening. There was 2 storylines and no real direction for either. Then it slowly starts falling into place and it gets better and better and better. And that's the only real negative I have to offer on this film. Maybe another negative is that I personally would have liked a little more depth on the 2 police officers. You are offered very little on them and it doesn't particularly take anything away from this movie, just would have liked to have known more. Like why is he so hellbent on wanting to catch these etcBut that's honestly nit picking because this really is a great film. The idea of the past/present storylines then merging was done absolutely brilliantly and best of all his character arc was simply superb. And to top it off it gives off a great message about people being institutionalised and what can happen to low offenders.For a film I genuinely never heard of before, this genuinely blew me away. The only reason I haven't gone higher on ratings is that I have given films like the the departed and shutter island 9/10 and I don't think it's on that sort of level. But I'd go 8.5/10 on this. Please give this a watch if you haven't already.",Shot Caller
35,bgar-80932,Very good,8,18 April 2020,"I'll start by saying this isn't an uplifting movie. It's about a normal guy who had a few too many drinks and got his friend killed and winds up in prison. He's not a bad guy, just made a mistake. In order to survive prison he has to join a gang and do terrible stuff including leaving his family behind. It had a great ending for me and showed this guy will do anything to protect his family even if he doesn't get to be with them. As a father this hit home. I'd kill for my son but to make him stay away from me to protect him is a hard decision to make. Great movie.",Shot Caller
36,stevenrotherforth,I will never look at Jamie Lannister the same way again,8,10 June 2018,"Shot CallerThis was one of those little surprises whilst flicking through available movie titles on satellite TV.
I vaguely remember seeing the trailer for this movie and thought to myself that's the one handed dude from Game of Thrones.
Indeed it is Nikolaj Coster-Waldau or Jamie Lannister if you're into your Thrones.Director Ric Roman Waugh has created a truly gripping prison drama with Shot Caller.
Ok it may follow some common cliches associated with the genre but for the most part this movie works.
It works because of the central performance by Coster-Waldau.
No longer can he be regarded as just the guy from GOT.
He really is of star material and able to carry a movie as gritty and intense as this.
Sure there's fine support from the likes of Jon Bernthal and Omari Hardwick but it is Waldau who steals the show.The story tells of Waldau's character a mild mannered family man who accidentally kills his best friend in a traffic accident when he carelessly runs a red light.
Finding himself in a prison with some real nasty criminals he is forced to become something else entirely in order to survive.
Waldau's character (Jacob) slowly descends into a life that will ultimately alienate him from his family.
This film shows the reality that prison doesn't always rehabilitate. In this case it breeds and nurtures a monster.
At heart Jacob is still a decent human being but he is pulled in so deeply into the gang way of life he is unable to get out in order to keep his family safe.What is most impressive is Waldau's transformation. From good to gone bad.
Not just his physical appearance of slick hair and suits to slicked back hair and Fu Manchu moustache.
He conveys the internal torture with a skill not seen from him before.Shot Caller has a good score to accompany the drama that helps suck the audience in.
A hyper violent thriller in parts Waugh has crafted a film where you can almost feel the blood and sweat.
It's not always a pleasant movie to watch but it is a truly engaging one.I was mightily impressed by this film but more so it's lead actor.
I'll never look at Jamie Lannister in the same way again.",Shot Caller
37,thomasjay-2201,Gritty and Great,8,20 August 2018,"Really surprising, had no real expectations for this and was almost blown away. Giving a realistic and brutal depiction of American Prison life this film was a good watch, at times it's oacing feels a little slow and it seems to lose its way but generally speaking it's great with fantastic action sequences and completely understandable motives with deep character the 'Shot Caller' is brilliant, I highly recommend",Shot Caller
38,saraccan,Nice Prison Movie,7,4 April 2018,"Not the best but definitly has a lot of good stuff. Directed by the same guy who did ""Felon"" which was also a pretty good prison movie.A normal family guy gets into a car accident, which results in someones death. Ends up in prison and goes deep inside the prison-gang game.",Shot Caller
39,thebricks,Ludicrous movie which ripped off Oz big time,5,31 August 2017,"Give me a break, so the lead starts out as a yuppie with a great job, great house and a family, goes out with friends one night, has some drinks, gets in an accident and gets a friend killed, ending up in maximum security prison?I've never been able to verify this is true, that you do get sent to Max for DUI manslaughter, but if you had to ask me, I'd think it was unlikely. I also would think it's unlikely someone would become a big crime lord while in prison, especially coming from a DUI manslaughter charge. Come on.Like Oz, I think this movie was solely aimed to scare middle class, rich suburban types to attract more attention to it. Some ex-cons have shared their prison experiences on some other sites and basically said it's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Many ex-cons also do not fit any sort of stereotype. For instance, looking at the lead coming out of prison with his hair and his shirt was hilarious. Got a huge red flag from that itself.",Shot Caller

41,flicklover,Not as good as it should be...,6,8 March 2021,"I had never heard of this film but saw some really good reviews on IMDB so when I saw tgat it was on NETFLIX I decided to give it a watch. I really went in expecting it to be really good. I really don't like to go with really high expectations but I did think this would be considerably better.Shot Caller is a crime/prison drama that follows the typical prison film tropes almost to a tea and just doesn't have the gritty feel that other much better films in the genre.The story is about a stockbroker in L.A. named Jacob that gets into a car accident with his wife and another couple after a dinner date. His friend is killed and the man that crashed inti his car is seriously hurt. He is arrested fir DUI and chooses to go to prison in a plea deal. This is one of tge problem with the film I feel. Of course a DUI is serious business but the scenes before tge crash there is no indication ge was even under tge influence. I get that you don't have to be fall down drunk to be arrested for DUI but even when the accident happens Jacob runs a red light because he looks away from the road to faist bump his friend in the back seat. But he gets arrested and chooses to go to prison too easily. I don't think that a guy in his position with a wife and son and his economic situation would choose to.go to prison so easily. Again, the accident and the fact it isn't even dealt with seriously just makes it a plot point to get him in jail.Then with Jacob in prison the film becomes a stock prison yarn. Jacob has to defend himself in prison to get respect so he shows that he can defend himself. Then of course we see that he goes into a gang and becomes a full fledged criminal in prison. All of this happens in a predictable way but his transition is just to quick. The supporting characters in the prison are just stock prison film characters. Supposedly, Jacob gets into the gang to protect himself but also to protect his family. He spends over 7 years in prison and of course his wife has moved on and divorced him. All of this is done too superficially. Jacob goes willingly to prison and becomes a cold blooded killer just like that? I get the whole loyalty to the gang thing and he is threatened by the gang leader that he needs to keep working for them in the outside because his wife and son would be killed. He has to maneuver between tge prison gang members, a cop that wants to bust him. The film is well made and tge performance by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is good but not as memorable as it should be.The film is violent but seems too polished to fit the grittiness that it supposedly wants to portray. There are better prison films that are more effective and gritty. American Me comes to mind.Not a bad film, but very average.One more thing.... Shot Caller is one of the worst titles in film history!!!!Grade: C",Shot Caller

44,shobanchittuprolu,Shot Caller is a one-time watch prison drama with neat performance by lead actor and engaging proceedings. My Rating 6.5/10,7,10 December 2017,"Shot Caller (2017): I have seen lot of prison dramas where lead actor lands up in prison for false allegations and in the prison,he meets up a new team and gets total bad-ass.Shot Caller also follows the same premise which stars Game Of Thrones fame Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau.So how is it? Plot: A newly released prison gangster is forced by the leaders of his gang to orchestrate a major crime with a brutal rival gang on the streets of Southern California.My Review: The film has a non-linear screenplay which made this clichéd screenplay in an engaging way.It intercuts two distinct time periods. The film begins with Jacob being released from prison after a 10-year term, then takes us back to his charmed life before he was imprisoned. These two time periods are intercut effectively throughout the film, and the editing allows us to appreciate the range of Coaster-Waldau's performance. He conveys a strong masculine presence in both sections of the film, and it is fascinating to watch his transformation from privileged family man to hardened con.The prison scenes are extremely well done. Jacob finds himself caught between rival gangs in the prison, and he has to join up with the white supremacist group for the sake of sheer survival.Shot Caller benefits from the presence of Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, the star of Game of Thrones, in the leading role.Supporting cast is decent.So,Shot Caller is a one-time watch prison drama with neat performance by lead actor and engaging proceedings.My Rating 6.5/10",Shot Caller

His transformation was easily the best part of the film.The movie did have some pacing problems regarding its second act.

Movies like this where the main character is essentially ""breaking bad"" in ways many of the audience cannot or will not understand have no such character. . However if you dig a little deeper what you are watching is in fact less a story about a good man becoming a bad one but instead the corrosive power of prison on a life and family. Waugh offers a poignant, if not violent and disturbing account of how normal people go from normal to indoctrinated into a gang's lifestyle and yet still maintains that shred of humanity in which he wants to protect his increasingly distant family from the life that he both chose and chose him. In the end its his choices that decide his fate and bring him deeper into the prison world a world he may never get out of because each choice he makes has a far reaching repercussion.",Shot Caller

Omari Hardwick plays a cop who is also Waldau's parole officer.

It is the past timeline that is the most gripping, showing us a drastically different man who made a mistake that led to a devastating, downward spiral of his life. But years in prison has not fully transformed Waldaucarefully hidden deep within the monster, there is a bit of humanity left.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Shot Caller"" is the scene when Waldau butchers a fellow gangster in the man's home. No fancy choreography, just someone getting stabbed multiple times until his life ends.""Shot Caller"" would have received a higher grade but for the shenanigans near the end of the movie. **SPOILER ALERT**Waldau hides a weapon in his anus, and from the time he is captured to the time he is sent back to his old prison, the weapon is still there?

Also, when Waldau attacked his boss because Waldau's family were threatened with execution, how does Waldau know that the hit wasn't already in place?

65,The-Last-Prydonian,Coster-Waldau excels as a man changed by one life altering event,8,20 December 2017,"Jacob (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) has is released from prison having spent 10 years in incarceration where and upon doing so he is to setup a crime deal involving a rival gang. Through consistent flashbacks Jacob's earlier life as a charming family and businessman are revealed and the tragic events that led to his arrest and conviction unfold. Now changed forever by his experiences he is forced to make hard choices in and out of prison that will have implications that may not just effect him but his wife and son. A film which encapsulate themes of sacrifice, revenge and yes perhaps even redemption, Shot Caller is also a poignant account of how one single incident in a person's life can not only alter the direction of the rest of there life, but there identity is an individual. Helmed by writer/director Ric Roman Waugh who's back catalogue of work includes similar genre movies much as Felon and Snitch, considering his past career as a Hollywood stuntman, he proves to have what would be considered by some an unforeseen aptitude for film-making. He has a keen ability in establishing mood as well as tension which compliments the content of his visceral script. Treated to a non-linear narrative, the movie consistently jumps back and forth between the former life of Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's Jacob as a mild mannered family man and his life in incarceration. A man struggling to survive on the inside and having to reconcile who he is as a man and what he must inevitably become and the lengths he must go to, to survive. It's a moral quagmire which Waugh does not sugarcoat with the choices he is forced to make extending the fractured relationship he now has with his wife and son. It would seem profoundly shocking as it is upsetting to see a man so dismissive of his family, as he turns his back away from them, and the emotional fallout punctuated no more so than when we are made witness to Jacob forced to face his now teenage son. It's also a moment that could have strayed in to melodrama were it not for the combined skillfulness of both actor's understated performances and Waugh's knack for reaching inside the souls of his characters and bring them expertly to the fore. For all the grittiness and unseemly aspects that would come with a story there is an unyielding cinematic beauty that is brought to the screen both aesthetically and spiritually. Jacob's situation is always dealt with compassion and understanding without glorifying his actions, and the remanence of the principled man he is are contrasted well by the irksome denizens of the criminal world. He exists now in a world of unseemly macho posturing and pseduo-loyalties that he now that he can lamentably never break free from. The standard of the acting performances is universally of a high level with Coster-Waldau quite simply nailing it with his sympathetic portrayal. His transition from white-collar businessman to hardened criminal is superbly rendered and he makes for an engaging on screen presence. The rest of the cast which includes Jon Bernthal of The Walking Dead, Punisher fame, Lake Bell, Holt McCallney, Jeffrey Donovan and Omari Hardwick deliver the goods and never once let the side down. If there are flaws it's that the movie's premise isn't entirely original while a brief subplot involving Jacobs parole officer, Kutcher (Hardwick) having to cope with the aftermath of being shot in the line of duty doesn't really lend anything to the story, reeking of unnecessary character development. All in all though Shot Caller still makes for riveting viewing and is unafraid to not make compromises,. The answers aren't always the ones we'd like but in the end when it comes to a quest for possible solace and maybe even salvation it's a a rites of passage movie in the unorthodox Hollywood sense.",Shot Caller

A man with a seemingly perfect life ruins it by getting in car crash that results in his best friend dying. Now in prison, Jacob (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) decides to join a gang on the inside to ensure his survival.SUMMARY REVIEW:
Holy sniff what is this movie? I don't even know how I should word the summary, because this film makes no sense to me. It doesn't seem to make sense nor does it have a purpose. I was slightly entertained for reasons unknown, but I couldn't even follow why this movie was made. There's a reason this film was not talked about by anyone and it's cause I think the film-makers had no idea what this film was really about. I'm in a weird spot where I feel I wasted 2-hours of my life while still being mildly entertained. I'm just writing this and thinking about the film at the same time and I don't even really know what I'm trying to say. That's this film. Right here.--------------------------------------BREAKDOWN-------------------------------------------DIRECTION:
What direction? IDK. There is simply no direction. Like, it was shot well, but where is it going? I couldn't even understand where everything started. I know Ric Roman Waugh tried to do something with this film, but I'm going to say it again, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT. It's not a popcorn flick, it has no substance, no direction- Holy fiesta I literally just had one of those ""A-HA!"" moments where I totally nailed what this film feels like. It feels like Season 5 Episode 7 of a show that has 8 Seasons and 12 episodes per season. That is literally this. Wow. I'm impressed with myself. Watching the film and you'll know why. Oh and yea I don't even care that these last couple statements had nothing to do with the direction. It's payback I guess.WRITING:
Also written by Ric Roman Waugh. *Copy and paste the ""direction"" description and add that the main character doesn't even become the shot caller until the end of the film and vital characters to the development of Money/Jacob just disappear with no explanation and certain characters appear afraid of him even though he's not in a leadership role and there seems to be no reason for certain characters to be afraid of him. Last, but definitely not least, add the fact that the main character doesn't become the ""Shot Caller"" until the very last scene of the film.ACTING:
The acting is quite good. Nikolaj (just going to go by his first name since he has an unnecessarily weird and long name), Jon Bernthal is one of the best actors today who never gets a real chance at a leading role and Omari Hardwick were the standouts. King Bach was in it for half a second and he was pretty impressive for the short screen time. There was one scene where Nikolaj was going to have a moment to show off some real chops in a moment with his son and it just ended way too quickly. Was definitely a moment to let simmer and let an actor act, but again this movie didn't really know what it should do so... K.",Shot Caller
67,vishnu-dileep08,"""A slow but watchable movie""",7,16 August 2017,It all starts with a man who was having a good family due to an accident ends up in jail and the things he does to survive there. He ends up joining with a gang and does drug deals as well as kill people for the reputation of this gang. After many years he is sent on parole that's when his gang leader gives him a deal to do and the police is behind him. So if he does the deal or not you have to find out by watching the movie I have not spoiled anything for you guys. The main hero I have seen him in game of thrones I have always known that he was a good actor and he continues that In this movie too and the walking dead guy he too does a classic acting. The movie has a slow start and it is slow in between I personally felt the movie was dragged in some places but as I said its watchable It had an OK story and an OK ending. I would say just check it out guys. Notable Acting Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau famous for his acting in the TV series Game of thrones and the movies Oblivion and Mama Jon Bernthal famous for his acting in the TV series The walking dead and the movies like The wolf of wall street and Sicario My Rating 7/10,Shot Caller

69,Exiled_Universe,THE BEST CRIMINAL PRISON MOVIE EVER!,10,29 September 2019,I cant even begin and i dont even know here to begin on this review. There is just so much to talk about and let out that i just dont know. First off the story is amazing and its one that iv'e never seen before. Also the fact that this kind of stuff happens in real life and its crazy. I also love the fact that the story in the first half of the movie changes between current and past and its nice because its different and it all makes sense at the end and also sometimes its tedious to watch but in this movie i kinda like it in a way. The cinematics and locations are amazing as well as the gore in some parts. The fights are cool as well as everything else. Not at one point was i bored and my eyes were glued to the screen the whole time and i didnt want to miss a second thats how good this movie was. This was a long nice movie that was something that iv'e never seen before so this movie really impacted me. I love the whole fact that in one part hes in jail and in another hes not in jail and it shows how people can easily change in jail because jail turns you into someone else entirely. I never even thought that this movie would be even remotely close to be this good and i was amazed with how this turned out in the end. I beg of you watch this movie it shows criminals and everything its crazy and its one of a kind. I need to hit this director up.,Shot Caller
70,o_s_k_r,does he really believe he's doing all this for his family?,6,15 October 2017,"Interesting movie. Yes it does linger after watching it.I can't help but feel that this character is not really that interested in helping his family. He doesn't seem particularly reluctant to join in with a brutal Nazi gang.It's a horrifying situation he finds himself in. Despite being done for a DUI manslaughter charge, he is thrown in a brutally tough prison. Straight up he gets sucked into this white-pride gang. Occasionally he looks wistfully at pictures of his family. But he really doesn't make much effort to avoid the gang violence in the jail. Does he really NOT HAVE A SINGLE BETTER OPTION than to become a violent murdering thug? Also I have to wonder what his end game is. He helps the police keep the guns from the street. But he doesn't seem interested in making any kind of deal. He's committed to becoming the uber gang lord. But what is he going to do after that? Is he going to start commanding the west coast Nazis to do go round celebrating diversity? Hmmm. Or just turn them all against each other?",Shot Caller
71,lale-ba,Dark (and) realistic,6,22 December 2017,"Some actors just get tangled up in a particular role and especially if that role is on the television, they tend to repeat it endlessly, without some serious stepping out on the big screen.
Nikolaj Koster-Waldau hadn't repeated those mistakes by making some important appearances in the Danish long feature production (''Second chance"") and also tries real hard to get away from the shadow of Jaime Lannister across the Atlantic. 
''Shot caller"" isn't his ''Scarface"", but still represents a decent modern day grim and slow pace bloody thriller about a family man that ends up in jail and must fight his way if he wants to survive behind the bars. On that road he becomes a ruthless prison lord, transforming both physically and mentally. 
Script doesn't tend to offer some memorable climax or conclusion, dwindling heavily in the last third of the movie, but Nikolaj manages to show us some decent acting and keep us on our toes during the larger part of the movie.
''Shot caller"" is a typical modern Hollywood thriller about modern prisoners filmed for the modern, blood and violence thirsty men.",Shot Caller
72,tuomas_86,"The movie ended too early and something was missing, what does it say?",7,20 December 2020,"Somehow I could expect something good from this. The topic was interesting and the implementation was successful. Possibly a smaller budget (so I don't know what size) allowed for the brutality that is part of the theme, even though there are more smoothed visions on the subject.
However, the depth of the film did not work. The characters didn't remember enough of what they would have liked. Maybe this would have worked better as some really long movie or a small mini series.The whole thing was working and the movie seemed to end too early, so what did it say?",Shot Caller
73,zadeereviews,Well overrated for me,4,23 July 2020,When I read all these reviews I thought it would be a great movie. But when I'm watching I slowly start to feel it isn't that great. I even got bored and fell a sleep in the middle some parts of it. May be it could've been shorter. The whole movie editing style doesn't really work. Good main character and back story but it really doesn't have much effect. The movie seems to do too much. But i didn't care for the other characters much. Ending was suppose to give big reveal but it wasn't much exciting to be honest. I felt like it could have been a good movie.,Shot Caller
74,caramia2002,Why Did NCW do This Movie?,1,3 December 2019,"Was it a different script than the final movie? Did he owe a favor? Was he THAT hungry to do a totally different role than GOT? I don't get it.The fake positive reviews are all over. The giveaway is ""best movie of 2017"". Even the most unsophisticated viewer would realize that is not the case. I'm rating it a bit lower than I might otherwise, although this film has little to recommend it beyond a 3.I'm not giving the rating I am due to the prison accuracy or that he ended up in hardcore (""regular""?) prison for manslaughter (not just a DUI), although you'd think someone without a record or a DUI, who is employed and privileged, would have been able to make a deal and stay out of prison. Like his bank/brokerage employer doesn't know any good attorneys or judges? I've never been in prison, so I have no idea about the various racial populations.But the script has problems all over. It is like the writer(s) just did whatever they needed to do to fix something or fit the schedule. The motivations are scant and the marginal plot not believable, from beginning to end. The acting, except for NCW, is mediocre to just bad. To ask someone to carry a movie entirely, with everyone around him bringing it down, is quite a lot to ask of an actor. He was great in GOT, but as part of a great ensemble. Not sure he's leading man material, although this cast and production was against him, so maybe that's not fair.I feel like this movie wanted to be and was inspired a bit by The Salton Sea (or tens of other ""he's not what he seems"" films). It's nowhere near as good as The Salton Sea and he's not quite the presence that Val Kilmer is, although Kilmer had a great supporting cast to back him up. Kilmer made his unbelievable character believable and the script and production made his actions sympathetic. This film does neither and I still have no idea why Money did anything he did, or why anyone around him did what they did.I really hope that NCW finds a vehicle with a script and production that will give him at least an even chance to carry a picture. He is a very capable actor and crafted one of the best series roles in GOT, ever (being a despicable, incestuous child killer (well, he tried) yet heroic and likeable is not easy!). I didn't know until recently that he is Danish, lives in Denmark, and has a decidedly Danish accent, not the American I thought he was. So he's got the skills and ability to morph into any role, I just hope he gets the chance before his film career goes the way of so many hit series' actors.",Shot Caller

While the stories differ, they do have some slight similarities. Both have to deal with hate and the violence that can come with it, and the consequences to that violence.

79,Info-340-323067,Top Notch Film. partially let down by a stereotypical Hollywood conclusion. Still 8/10,8,5 August 2017,"Right away, this is a very good film and eminently watchable. No qualms about that. The actors are above par with the exception of one inmate/later collaborator on the outside (part of the skinhead gang - the one who participated in the jail murder). That apart the first 70 minutes or so are taught and gripping keeping you glued. With me at least, after 75 mins or so the whole plan and plot of the film began to change from gritty and understandable, making the viewer empathetic of the issues, to a clear bog standard Hollywood revenge film. A film of two uneven halves if you like (two thirds/one third, not halves but you know what I mean) for me at least I felt a tad cheated when the film veered from gritty thriller to ""corny"" revenge thriller. Cliché revenge film type A - One man threatens another man's family = revenge at all costs for father of said family, a bit Bruce Willis et al. I feel that the first 75 mins deserved a far stronger, more developed conclusion. PS, No issues against Bruce Willis but the first 2/3 of this film promised so much more than a typical revenge thriller ending. That said still a good and firm 8/10 from me.

I definitely did not expect this movie to touch me in the way that it did.The Pros:- -It is so well edited that I had to recheck the run time of the movie when it ended. Two hours flew past like the wind.-The acting is great.-The plot will reel you in and never let go. This is simple story telling at it's best.-The dialogue will never feel boring and the prison scenes are shot in a way that will leave you in awe.-The score is one of the best I've heard in recent memory. Reminds me of Sicario, another great film. Some people said it could have been better but I disagree. The score had me wishing I can write music that good for movies. It had a certain twist to it, sounds of flutes or sounds of Arabian music undertones.The directing? All hail Ric Roman Waugh. I'm going to search for some of his other movies. If half are as half as good as half of this film, I might pass out with glee.The Cons: There are non I can think of.

I saw the trailer before the film was released and knew it would be something special.This film does a great job showing the personal conflict a man has when dealing with what life throws at him. The character is human and has flaws yet he does the best with what is in front of him.My only complaint in this film is that the technical work is not all there - dialogue is tough to understand all throughout and the film doesn't look nice at times. This feels like that one person is kind of attractive and then when you get to know them, you realize they are absolutely stunning.This film has so much heart and emotion, and really has something to say. Nikolaj gives the best performance of his career here and it is because he is a great actor, has great cast around him, and he is set in a world that has been masterfully created: a grimy world in which the strong survive.I whole heartedly reccomend this film.

I've given up trying to understand at this point. What I do understand however, is that Shot Caller is one of the most underrated movies in recent memory, a movie so mature, so raw, so honest, so uncompromisingly heartbreaking, that it honestly gets a little hard to watch sometimes. It is without a doubt one of the most realistic and intelligent prison movies ever made, and sheds a sorrowful gaze into a system which is designed to break men into pieces, men who enter as normal citizens, and either come out as monsters, or don't come out at all. Even when the character is out of jail it never actually feels like he's free; at this point it's all too late, there's no escape anymore. And through it all, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau truly shines as both a normal man who made a terrible mistake, and a man who's seen and done so much it's all without meaning now. He's truly breathtaking to behold, he's so in control of himself, and proves himself as one of the best actors out there, whether he's vulnerable, or covered in another man's blood, he remains fully believable. Shot Caller doesn't dramatize or glorify anything, neither the men nor the extremely unsettling violence, it just shows us the way things are. And even though through the entire thing you desperately hope for something of a happy ending; you don't get it. This movie is a true example of more than just entertainment. It's education.

I was pleasantly surprised!As pleasantly surprised as one can be at this type of film. As in 90% of my reviews, I avoid spoilers as best I can? And will do the same here. I will say several things about this film which I think stands out far above many and makes it unique in several ways.First, the acting was superb! I might add, from the entire cast. The story and plot, as well as the few sub plots all fit together like a nicely done puzzle.The film is violent and graphic. No doubt. However, I think it was so when applicable. There was not an overwhelming amount of gratuitous amount of violence just to please audiences that enjoy that type of film.The story of a good man who makes a fatal mistake, and pays for it with unjust consequences. The struggle of a man with a conscience yet a tremendous will to survive, and to do whatever necessary. Mostly to protect his family as the gang he is essentially forces to join constantly reminds him of how unsafe his family is, even when those who control his fate are behind bars.Unfortunately, I have a childhood friend serving life and in our many communications over the past 25 years, he writes of stories much like what you see in this harsh film.I am certain there had to be people who served hard time consulting on this film as its realism, as far as I know, is true to form. Of course there is an element of Hollywood thrown in as you would expect, however, this does not hurt the story.Overall, a very powerful and at times, difficult film to watch which I believe is an element and testament to the film makers and actors who did a tremendous job in putting a very realistic story together which exceeds the bounds of a typical jail house tale. 8/10 for me.....",Shot Caller

This movie was so much more. The main character from Game of Thrones blew me away. The change just in his appearance from stockbroker to hardened white supremacist gang member was amazing, I actually thought they were two different characters! Nothing in this movie was obvious, all the way to the end, and I was left with the thoughts what exactly was going on in his head? The motivations for his actions were slowly explained and believe you me the plot twist at the end was incredible. This movie deserves it rating of 7.5 out of 10. I gave it an 8, but compared to so much dross out there I could easily have given it an excellent 9 out of 10.

If the actors were not up to the mark this movie would've been a failure. But thankfully it wasn't. All of the key characters were played by very good actors who delivered performance worth remembering.This movie felt very realistic. Surely the audience will feel the pain and motivation of Jacob. The director did a superb job telling the story in that manner.The story is good but in some places I felt Jacob had better alternative choices. He easily could've got out soon if he was careful.

I almost couldn't believe how well he pulled it off. But nearly everyone around him minus Jon Bernthal was absolute garbage. C list actors who really ruined the atmosphere in countless scenes.The script was a huge letdown as well. Very basic and formulaic. It was a below average movie in all aspects minus Nikolaj + Bernthal. The way things went down were ridiculous at times. Meeting in a public area with a confident? Come on now.You need to turn off your brain to enjoy this but it's a thriller/crime so that doesn't work here. We need things to make sense and they didn't even try to do that. The only saving grace was it was enjoyable regardless of all these bad qualities.Worth a watch if you want to waste some time or if you're a diehard gangster movie fan.

That to survive in prison this man has no choice but to join a white supremacist gang. Seriously, that's the only option?3. That a man who supposedly loves his family above all would deliberately sabotage multiple attempts to mitigate his sentence and get back to his life, like making a deal on the stolen weapons.

108,pgaucher683,Wonderful performance by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau,9,29 July 2017,"I've been waiting for this movie from the moment i've watched the trailer, the story of this man who was a business man once and became a Aryan leader in jail to, in fact, only survive against all odds.N.Coaster-Waldau has made his break through with (Black Hawk down/R.Scott-2001)and i've been a fan ever since; His range in acting is so great to watch, he can be a teacher or a warrior,(we all know him, now, by ""Jamie Lanister"" in GOT) he can play everything; as you will see in Shot caller, when in jail or in the street in front of his bothers, he is ""Money"" a ruthless member of an Aryan brotherhood, but in private he is still the man who once killed his best friend, in a DUI accident and wanted to endure the full sentence to forgive himself. It's simply one of his best work so far.But he is not alone, it's a strong performance here for every actor, Jon Bernthal, O.Hardwick, H.McCallany they all fit their characters really well, their is no compromises they have, all, nailed their parts. The scenario from director Vic Roman Waugh,(after Felon (stephen Dorf/Val Kilmer)or Snitch with Dwayne Johnson/Jon Bernthal ) is really powerful, i've also found that, this one has a Michael Mann feel/influence in it, the way he uses the lights, close ups reminds me of (Collateral-2004 for ex.) and made it more raw and brutal. Finally,special mention for Michelle Tesoro's editing. As you can see, the movie didn't disappoint at all, for me it's one of the greatest movie of 2017 and i would recommend it to anyone.",Shot Caller

The entire premise of an upper middle class man going to a maximum security prison for a DUI which kills someone is silly especially after him taking a plea deal. Add to that him not being overwhelmed in prison but fitting in and fighting quickly just seems ridiculous. The acting isn't terrible but the stereotypes are and the ending is completely absurd.

118,MaxximizeRecords,First IMDB review for the movie '' Shot Caller '',10,22 April 2018,"After watching the movie '' Shot Caller '' , I check out Ric Roman Waugh's first prison movie '' Felon '' and it's also good , So i became a fan immediately and addicted to those prison movies . I think the reason we love watching prison movies is because jail really sucks and not a single normal person want to stay in jail for one day . Prison is a place not only just take away people's freedom but also concentrate the worst human being all together. If you are a harmful person , prison is exactly where you should stay and that's how social community works and evolves , cause no one can help to change your destiny
and essence which i consider it's misfortune and unfairness of life . If you are an ordinary person or even a kind person , then you are probably not doing the crime initiatively but passively , that means you don't want that to happen to you , and that's what this movie about . When a good guy gets his friend killed accidentally and he will go to jail for manslaughter crime according to the law , first he learns that he needs to be strong or he will be bullied , and he quickly joins a gang as a nobody , he takes a risk to do whatever his ringleader requires but soon he gets caught in a surveillance camera for stick a man with a knife . As punishment , he will stay longer in prison and that also gives him more experience to become a gangster leader which also called '' Shot Caller. ''",Shot Caller

Being over 2 hours long and just kept me wanting more toward the end. I rarely like to give 10/10, but for this one I just had to. It couldn't have been much better.

Plus the character development feels lacking whick makes you feel a lack of investment throughout the film.

130,dannyloeper,Shot Caller - Superb acting and storyline!,8,15 February 2020,"This for me feels like a hidden gem, as i remember once seeing trailers and teasers for it but never actually saw it. I feel like i have never experienced a movie that both demonstrates anger and violence paired with the sentiment displayed in Money's story.One of this movies greatest accomplishments to me is the pacing and timeline, as the constant back and fourth of the past and present is done is a way that you never lose track of the main story, while still learning about how Money adapted to the gang that he joined. Seeing him transition from a regular business man with a family to a gang member, doing things he never imagined having to do really emphasizes the struggles of trying to survive in a prison such as this. We even see early on what happens if you don't get affiliated with the right people, seeing a new prisoner silenced and stabbed on his first night in.Seeing Money forced between the 2 realities of his life outside of prison is really taxing, especially the scene of his son trying to help him escape this gang life, but him knowing that there is no true way out, but to become the leader.The end of this movie is done so well. In a way i thought we were gonna get a cliche ending of some sorts, but seeing Money adapt to this life and manipulate his way into getting to the leader just to kill him is amazing.The last note i wanted to speak on is how the fights and deaths were played out. One thing i always fear going into a more violent movie is that the fights feel so out of hand and wacky, but the way Ric Roman Waugh handled the deaths, especially shotguns are almost beautiful. Money never wanted to kill him, but in this world, everyone knows that if you distrust your group you will pay. I guess in Money's case, you can lie and throw them under the bus, but then just respond with taking a razor to Beasts neck.Please go see this movie, its so incredible!",Shot Caller
131,medelste,Best prison movie since Shawshank,8,31 July 2017,"Like most reviewers on this site, I slog through dozens of mediocre and plain-old awful VOD films every year just to find that one decent horror or action thriller hidden in the haystack. Maybe twice a year I'll hit the jackpot, usually when I least expect it. Thus far in 2017, ""Shot Caller"" is that film. After decades of dreary knockoffs, I've found that zombie films and prison films are two overdone genres I usually skip out of habit. But for some reason I chose ""Shot Caller"" off the slush pile this weekend. Within ten minutes I knew I was watching something really special. What the heck is a film this good doing on VOD and bouncing around the interwebs? I'm no actor or film studio, but I'd like to think that if a screenplay this thrilling landed on my desk I'd jump at it. It employs a 'dual-narrative' structure, in which two distinct temporal threads from past and present converge later on. (If you've seen William Katt's ""House"" from 1986, you'll know what I'm talking about.) The story's back-and-forth is never forced, and both perspectives ('Money' the protagonist's trial and entering prison; then his parole and what follows ten years later) are riveting. The snapshots of prison life are frighteningly medieval, and totally believable. Some reviewers have questioned the logic of Money's actions along the way, and their point is taken. But the man is confronted with two stark prison alternatives: survive or die. For me these were just interesting plot twists with a mostly satisfying resolution at the end. I was reminded of Edward Bunker's realistic prison novels, which were so realistic because he was there.Now for the performances. Heck, I don't even watch ""Throne of Games"" (sic), so I didn't realize who Nikolaj was. But ""Shot Caller"" is packed with A-/B+ list stars who deliver phenomenal performances, and Nikolaj doesn't disappoint. His transformation from sweet family man to brutal gangster convict is something to behold. These are human beings turned into animals by necessity, although they prefer the term ""warriors"". There are also plenty of second-tier actors from films such as ""Avatar"", ""Fury"", and even ""Hitch"" that you'll recognize as well, every one of whom is utterly convincing. As for the cops, they're realistic and believable as well. Too many prison films involve sadistic wardens and guards mistreating prisoners, to the point of cliché; by contrast ""Shot Caller's"" cops are like lion tamers just trying to do their jobs, because the prisoners are scary enough all by themselves.You're seeing all of these glowing 90% positive reviews here for a reason. Give this underground thriller two hours of your evening, and you'll understand why.",Shot Caller

133,californiarecordshop,Some Realistic Portrayal of Prison - Some obvious flaws.,8,1 November 2018,"This is probably the closest to the real thing I've ever seen. Except for the Obligatory rape scene. As someone who spent 4 months in West Block San Quentin in 2007 - I never once feared that I would be raped. So, I'm a little tired of the Hollywood, TV portrayal of prison rape, because if you're a stand up person, it won't happen to you (in most cases, I'm sure there are exceptions). But I knew the woods had my back, and I had there's, the scene where he's hearing a rape happen in the large dorm, would never happen, there would be about 100 people getting up and saying WTF?!? and sh*t would go down hard (no pun intended). And speaking personally of West Block, you're in there with 500 other guys that don't want to get raped either. So, please Hollywood, back off of the prison rape stereotypical drama. The movie is a bit sensational, but they really nailed the prison experience (Hollywood required rape scene, not withstanding). Since I never had an unpaid dope debt and wasn't a snitch or a rapist, I didn't have anything to fear, prison is just a big jail. I'm not particularly big either, but I am a crazy and tough, so I carried myself. It reminded me how you have to walk the line in there, you have to be willing to do whatever it takes to stay alive, even if it means killing your celly, that's just the way it goes down, you can't stop to think ""will I get more time for this,"" I had to put a big biker celly in his place (bigger than me at least - I'm under 6'), and smashed him good, I would have knocked him out but I destroyed him in about 2.5 seconds. He was really surprised and wasn't expecting it from nice little me. I'm usually a very chill person, just don't get on my bad side. I was in there for not pulling over, and a chase... no drugs or violence either. The system is totally crooked, some Meth-head - same exact charge but with a bag of meth, while I just ran, I got 2 years in prison (no priors) he got (1 prior chase conviction - so his second time running) a month long drug program. Disgusting... but that's how messed up the system is, its completely corrupt, people are surprised because they are brainwashed by 'Law and Order' and no, its not like that the DA and cops are going to lie / cheat / steal / torture / break any law because they can, and they will get away with it. Believe that. No ever talks about the 'GREEN WALL' - the Quentin guards caught bringing a brick of heroin and cell phones into San Quentin, never got any charges, and that's the way it will go - forever. Don't think it will ever change... because its always been like that, and as long as the major non-prison population holds the pigs in such high regard, they will continue getting away with literal murder, they don't follow their own laws, the hypocritical nature is shown good here, I got off topic a bit, but this movie shows some of the corruption that is regular to all law enforcement, not just prisons. Its amazing what one can get used to... a stabbing would occur on the yard, and all it meant to me was that I wasn't going to the store and getting my ice cream that week. I never gave anyone a reason to want to stab me, but I was fully willing to destroy anyone that crossed me wrong, that's the only way you will survive in a place with total anarchy (Quentin doesn't follow their own Title 15 at all). The movie did a good job showing how someone has to man up and walk the narrow line. Don't get me wrong its a gladiator school, no question about that, but I always knew the woods had my back and vice versa. Best advice to anyone in prison is to keep your mouth shut and your eyes and ears open at all times. Unlike the Roger Ebert reviewer, I thought this was right on the money, a bit sensational, but it is a movie afterall, but its the closest thing I've ever seen to what it really is like in prison. I didn't have to put any 'work' in..., but I also had instant status because I never ratted on anyone, and my jacket was clean, people knew I did my jail time and that gave me some instant cred and sympathy. The whole time I was there the docs said I had scary high blood pressure, they were afraid I was going to pop. Like this movie does, , put a basically 'normal' person in a war-zone and that's what you get, its as close to being in a war that I can see, you have to be aware 24-7, any second things could pop off, and people are always watching to see if you were slipping, some 'Toad' - like the movie said, took my cup and I had to show the entire group about 5-6 'Toads' that I was willing to stomp every single one of them by myself if necessary, if they confessed to taking it, but no one would because of just that reason, you cannot let a single person get over on you, the second you're a 'b*tch or a punk' its over for you. If you don't handle your business shot callers will put a 'green light' on you and you might die. At the same time you can't be termed a 'trouble-maker' either, that can also get you hurt, people (like my ice cream) don't like their 'program' messed up. Always a fine line to walk in prison. I always handled my business. Never had to stab anyone, thank God. But I would have if it came down to it... that's the way you have to roll, ain't no consequences except if it isn't clear to others that you're willing to take it as far as it needs to go, you're also finished. Believe me, who wants to turn 2 years into 30? Not me. But it so easily could happen... too easily really. All the cops have to do is put the bad guy in your cell and its you or him. They know the politics, they play the 'game' .But if it came down to it, you have to choose them or me. I choose me. Damn guards kicked me over to cold-ass yard side, because I was getting to much juice on the Bay side, I would give sodas, even to blacks and stuff, so I got hella juice. Its okay to give a sealed soda, you just don't drink off someones tray that is. This movie shows the true brutality of the mind-set of prisoners in the most realistic portrayal I've ever scene (tired Hollywood 'rape' stereotype aside - there is a word for it, but I just can't remember now, its driving me crazy, tip of the tongue...). I knew who not to give drinks to also, some big bulls on the level 1 yard at Soledad, where I ended up - no more high blood pressure / gladiator / killing school, (whites but probably giant gay dudes) asked me for a soda, I just told them I was 'taking care of mine' because all of a sudden you now have to give them a soda every time and will probably get beat up or raped ""What no soda today? We got a problem or something?"" - So I knew when to stick to my guns, they couldn't fault me for 'taking care of my people'. Whereas I give them a soda once, I better be ready to give one every time or there will be problems. Excellent movie, glad to finally see a somewhat realistic version of prison, besides the stereotypes and obvious flaws. Some Ebert reviewer was saying how formulaic it was, I don't agree, that is exactly how it happens, one second your life is rolling along, next second your facing someone in prison yard trying to kill you...It can happen to anyone, its easy to be falsely accused, it happened to me; the corrupt cops don't care if your innocent or not. That's not their job, and people find themselves banging their heads against a wall because they've been brainwashed by 'Law and Order' and similar propaganda, to believe that any such thing other than the truth exists: that the gang and the government are different. The gang and the government are exactly the same.",Shot Caller

Coster-Waldau (Jamie, Game of Thrones) owns the lead, his understated portrayal of a man caught in a downward spiral rich & nuanced. Add to that Jon Bernthal playing a wigged out white supremacist like the role was written for him, he never disappoints.Yes, it could move along a little more briskly and yes its chalk full of clichés.

135,lubegiant,"Learn to stab people correctly with this great story enacted by stellar, yet inexpensive cast!!",8,29 July 2017,"Here's what's important to know before you spend time on watching this movie. It's no docudrama, and whatever you think you know about the US penal system, remember that most likely you became a penologist watching ""Heat"", ""Oz"", ""Ornage is The NB"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Scarface"" etc. I, for one, know that they don't search cons on CDC before yard, so it doesn't take a butt stash to carry a wad of drugs from the dorm outside. Strangely, in ""Shot Caller"" this exercise is used as a test of a new fish by a gang. I know that targeted gang-affiliated prison killings are rare, carefully orchestrated and, most importantly, are NOT entrusted to ""tourists"" from the general population. In fact, you would have to earn the right to kill on gang's behalf. And if a white money boy would be cliquing with a gang, they would certainly not use him as a yard thug or an ass-mule, as we've learned a long time ago from the great Shawshank saga. Also, I do know that a white investment banker in CA would have caught a break, no matter how badly he's done.You know where I know all this from? The previous Ric Roman Waugh's work called ""Felon"", a great 2008 film (except for the white investment banker thing, this one's from CNN), which could actually pass for the ""Shot caller""'s prequel. To the extent that Waugh has used the actor Chris Browning in the exact same capacity in ""Shot caller"" as he did in ""Felon"" - an AB key holder. Do yourself a favor and watch ""Felon"", appreciate Val Kilmer at his very best.Anyway, I'm not complaining! The movie's awesome, watch it, re-watch it, learn how to put things in your anus, how to stab people in different settings, how to use burner phones, what to say to cops before being sent to death row and how to tell a snitch. Who knows, perhaps, some of those skills you'll find useful in real life.",Shot Caller

144,MrMowji,Overrated,4,25 September 2017,"They try to kill Money in a party! Why? Just wait for him to be alone then get the job done. What's the point of getting him murdered in a crowded area? It didn't seem that they (Shotgun and Herman) would be the first suspects if Money gets killed.Jennifer sues him, but their families seemed very close to each other.The lawyer knows about that prison and its dangerous situations. So, the guards, manager and ... must know it too. And yet, no one seems to care.The scene in prison where he kills the snitch was weird.In the riot scene, how they've got those long blades? Did they do it like that balloon? Why did he save Herman Gomez? Why did the sniper shoot to the head? I think firing to the sky or a leg would be sufficient too. See, this is a prison where they put him in. Why? The whole riot idea was wrong. Why would you riot when you know that some/all of your guys might get killed or be seen by cameras? What's the point? Where did this obsession to kill other guys come from?How did he figure out how to open handcuffs with that thing?At the end, he receives a letter from his son. He says ""I will learn from your mistakes."" What mistakes exactly? Driving carelessly?Emory Cohen's character (Howie) wasn't convincing. He looks so naive to decide and plan this deal, find contractors to move guns to America, and get involved with gangsters. Even by cooperating with his friend in Afghanistan, it seemed strange.So, criminals in a gang follow someone who kills their current boss. The new boss just needs to claim it.Character development wasn't OK.There is almost a loop in background music.Perhaps with some changes in the script and characters this would be a great movie. But it's not.",Shot Caller
145,JamiroBontes,A very well realized gang movie!,6,1 September 2017,"Shot Caller is a gang, prison movie were we see Jacob who is in prison because of a terrible accident that I am not gonna spoil for you. We see how Jacob climbs the ladder of the gang world, and every decision he makes is to make sure his ex-wife and son don't get into trouble. It's told over a time spend of 10 years.The stand out in this movie is definitely the lead roll player Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, who really understands what his character goes through in these years and how it chances him not only as a person but as a father. All the performances are great. But were this movie loses steam a little bit is the run-time, this movie is 2 hours long but it feels like it never ends. Because of this some parts you find yourself checking more what time it is than the movie itself. But the movie wins me back with it's great performances and great story.I think it's worth a watch if you really like prison gang movies, but I warn you it definitely is a slow burn. I am interested to see what Ric Roman Waugh the director does next. Shot Caller is a good character movie with a good story, good direction, good performances and some boring parts.

148,catimeup,Jamie Lannister doing it again.,9,13 November 2018,"The movie driven by a one man performance, and some solid writing and assisted by a cast and crew that did their job well.
I thought it was going to be one of those b movies, but instead was a very easily missed A movie.
It was less well known and that I believe is the greater crime. Brawl In Cell Block 99 also had that same problem. Both great prison movies, both well made and acted and yet both were dark horses in the A movie category.We were painted with the idea of prison as being a club med being able to walk in and out without gang assistance. Many prisons can be like that, but some correctional facilities are meant for the cream of the violent crop. With this movie we saw once again they were placing the main man in an environment where he had no real choice. Yes we wanted the main character to be back with his family with his minimum term, but we are thrown into this chaos because he was placed in a prison of hardened criminals and not your usual run of the mill average criminals. You are lined up and ready for your meal next to Jacob when it first started, but you start to see how his reality is shaped evermore by his environment where his only choices are pain/death or survival/persecution.I thoroughly enjoyed the film going back and forth between past and present. It felt smooth and even if the character took a drastic turn, you feel step by step he was always making the choices about others and not for himself, always keeping a level head even when he looked scared out of his mind.I really think this movie deserves a wider viewing audience, because I stumbled upon this one accidentally. I was glad I checked it out, and it definitely exceeded my expectations.To anyone who reads this review...please watch it. You will be entertained.",Shot Caller

Since he was a Wall Street banker of some sort, he would've had a better lawyer in real life. Some of the prison scenes were brutal, though, no problem with believability. Death scenes were raw, especially Shane's, I mean, Shotgun. You would think he would want to alter his appearance just a tad after being paroled! I guess the whole idea of him wanting to give up his family and freedom for prison life, I don't buy it.

152,kylemcdavid-27399,"Quite Overshadowed by other films of this year, but yet a powerful and an entertaining/interesting filck",7,24 September 2017,"Now this particular film plot is something I've been honestly want to see for like a year, and it like my wish surprisingly been Granted. For a year now, I been resourcing about Peckerwood gangs such as the ""Aryan Brotherhood"" and the ""Nazi Lowriders"" and the whole subculture of Peckerwood's life, and wondering when they will ever make a movie about this, like a guy who became part of this life, went to Prison, began following the several roots of Neo-Nazism, and had continued to be a part of it in the free-world with Street Gangs, this was pretty much all of that, and man it doesn't disappoint me at all.(Spoiler Alert) Basically the film is about a ordinary White Citizen with a perfect family who is sent to prison for DUI and decide he must protect himself by merely joining one of the prison's most notorious Cliques, the ""Aryan Brotherhood"" so he won't be either a rape victim or a murder victim of any of the Non-White Inmates, despite refusing once about joining due to the gang's use of racism, being well-fueled with Methamphetamine, and shelled be willing to kill, he joins anyway by beginning to help them out with their Drug Trafficking and even kills a Member that is no-longer worth to be one of them. This soon went to a end for him, as he was then sent to a Maximum Security Prison after being found with a assault charge within another riot at his previous one, where he continues his White Supremacist roots and became a full-fledged member of the Brotherhood, despite being lock-up in a cell all-day, everyday. Soon he was released recommended by his Unit Manager to the Parole Board due to being a lesser convict. Upon his release, in the outside world, he quickly met-up with his founder to the gang, who is also paroled, and a young new comer who admits he wants to join them. However, things began to be a personal struggle between the gang and his family, as he then in the first time in years, encountered both his wife and son, who are disappointed by what he becomes, and both know he will be back to Prison, this then lead him to a series of thinking that he could either continues or given-up this life, so he can be with his family. Now this is how far I can go, as it seems this is what it all about.Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau role as the main character was well-doned, he shows just good emotions when he either Happy, Sad, or Angry, especially when he's talking serious with the young member, this just shows that he been to a rough place before (Prison) and that he's no Clown. The young member was alright, just wondering (Spoiler Alert) what happens to him upon our character second arrest for both 1st degree Murder, Arms Trafficking, and Parole Violation, he was shows disappointed at his buddies' arrest, and was then never showed again nor even mentioned, I guess it would good they didn't want to have a young character being arrested into something that he actually did admits earlier he didn't want to be part of, as it was all just a upbringing pretty much. The rest of the cast I can't really say much, except the Mexican guy who is surprisingly allied the White Supremacist Street Gang, and the Brotherhood, he was a-little bit of a cool character, but they should've shows more of him in the film, and shows more of his relationship with the film's central-protagonist, but oh-well. I would like to point-out that Omari Hardwick as the Parole Officer did do a amazing job, especially his interactions with Coaster-Waldau's character despite his beliefs.This film I would probably describe it as the ""American History X"" of the decade, as it quite emotional, especially the ending which I thought was a good way to end it, and they did a brilliant job focusing on the peckerwood's gang life in both Prison and on the Streets, although they would probably do something like showing the main character suffering from a Meth addiction, but hey I kinda understand why they would show something like that, because that would be too much, but still I recommend this movie to those who likes American History X and general prison films like Lock-Down or TV Shows like Oz or Prison Break. It is most likely a overshadowed film by other ones coming out this year, but definitely would not be forgotten, better than the crappy ""All Eyez on Me"".",Shot Caller

154,thenza,INTERESTING AND WELL THOUGHT OUT,8,26 February 2021,"Shot Caller is one of those movies that makes you think about your own moral code and personal sacrifices for survival. How far is a man willing to go to survive inside prison and how far is he willing to go to turn up clean on the otherside. I felt strokes of breaking bad but in truth this movie gets more interesting as it goes on and the character development and portrayal is well played by the leading role.
My only objections are the beginning story premise and the epicness at certain parts how those things were pieced together was a bit of plot seaming otherwise after the first half hour you can respect the dialogue and the tone of the movie.
It definitely deserves an engaging watch and maybe you will pick up on more subtleties on the second viewing if you dont like prison gang violence, or intense strategical thrillers then watch it when you do.",Shot Caller

It didn't look boring, but nothing about the plot really piqued my interest. Ultimately, it was the lead actor who drew me in, famous for his role as ""Jaime Lannister"" in Game of Thrones.Only during the credits did I find out that this movie was written/directed by Ric Roman Waugh, who has made several other Prison-based movies. If you've seen his works like ""Snitch"" or ""Felon"" (and enjoyed them as I have), you'll likely enjoy this movie too.The cast of this film was impressive. There were a fair amount of big/recognizable faces even for smaller parts, which was appreciated.Largely, I appreciated that the plot wasn't heavily focused on the main character's time in prison. The movie begins with the protagonist, a hardened man being released from prison. We see character development by means of intercut flashbacks, showing significant moments in his life.As a result, the movie carries great momentum and keeps the story suspenseful to the end. I can say that it's rare, if not refreshing to have an ending that is: Unpredictable, plot-resolving, plausible, and remaining in line with the characters' core beliefs. I think Shot Caller accomplished that.8/10*

Possible.But, that the main character from day one is strong enough to change from a ""man in suit"" to hard; rough guy, getting friends with criminals and for 2 years effective prison, ruins his and family future is too much. That later he wants to protect his family I understand, not his ability an to kill and choices.If there was an evolution of his character, what got him there, that he had no other choice (the rape of the black man is not a reason to change your personality overnight), but no, he becomes the tough guy, like he was raised in criminal surroundings.Then nothing works in this movie.

I was an hour in and my wife comes downstairs and catches a few scene's and guess what... ''this looks good'' damn right it looks good! Normally i would have finished the movie but i loved everything about shot caller that i had no problems with rewatching this movie.so shotcaller,I loved it. The story, characters, actors, setting and music were top notch. It was very interesting and emotional to how Money turned from an upperclass working guy to the guy with the keys. His choice to join the AB was the worst choice he could have made. Every action he took was to protect his family yet every action drove him further away from them until there was no turning back. Imagine how that must feel, you love your wife and kid and you are forced to do horrible things to keep them save, but if you do, you will never see them again, dude that goes right into the feels. I'm a dad myself and i can't imagine how much pain and suffering money feels inside. The scene where he has to kill a ab snitch was powerful, he didn't want to do it but had no choice.

164,slippersofagility,One of the best prison movies with a gripping story,7,10 February 2021,Jacob is a respected family man who is at his peak of success with a great job and a beautiful wife with a son. Unfortunately things take a U-turn when he he is engaged in an accident with his car resulting in his best friend's death while driving under influence. In order to minimize his jail time he pleads guilty at court to serve 2 years in prison. He soon finds out that his problems have just begun and during his time he must make tough decisions in order to survive prison and protect the ones he loves. Shot caller is by far one of the best prison movies of all time. It is brutal yet entertaining with its raw style and dark tone. Don't expect a fairytale where everything will go as planned with a happy ending. Nicolaj Coster - Waldau from Game of Thrones does a remarkable job of making us believe that a family man can go rogue inside a prison. Direction is almost perfect going back and forth to what happened inside the prison and the reason behind Jacob's change of character. The movie is quite violent as you expect from a prison movie but it makes you think how far you would go to protect the ones you love. It has its flaws since in my opinion the move is way longer than it could have been and some characters decisions inside the jail seem excessive but I guess otherwise we wouldn't have a movie. Overall the movie is one of the best of 2017 and if you love crime movies about prisons then this is an absolute watch.,Shot Caller

Yes but no more unlikely than 95% of the movies that get made. Is the movie flawed and some of the characters flat or poorly developed? Yes. But a good bit of the movie is well done. Nikolaj Coster does a good job and going with Lake Bell as the wife, rather than a hot but fake-ish yuppie type, was also a good call. By the end of the movie, I really felt Coster's love for his family and that would have been hard if he had a flashy wife.The ""in the gang for life"" and ""you do what you're told if you want to get out of here alive"" mantras are spot on.Overall, watching this was time well spent.

Charged with years behind bars with hardened criminals, he joins a gang to protect himself. Through a series of poor choices and unlucky circumstances, he finds himself fighting for the life of himself and his family.In his typical beautiful beefcake style, Nikolaj brings a lot of eye candy to a serious and stoic role. I found his physical presence to be largely believable, which surprised me since he looks more at home in GQ magazine than in a California desert repping white power tattoos. Without a doubt his best role since Game of Thrones.I scrolled past this many times, thinking it was going to be another sorry excuse for Sons of Anarchy: too many try hards spending 90% of their time in letter jackets hugging. This was a brutal film about difficult and poor choices, that was hard to get completely on board for. The character transition seemed too stark for me to entirely believe, and I needed more before Nikolaj got into jail about who he was other than awful basketball player with long sleeves on indoors, and Schmidt's friend.That being said, I was glued to the screen which is unusual since I watch a lot of films. If they nailed the transition from softie to hard man a little better, I would have given this 10/10.

I'm not going to elaborate anything here, if you're really reading this. You got to see this movie, there's no better way to put it. I never had slightest of doubt in Nikolaj that he can do any kind of role, I think, really anything. The script was just mind blowing, you cannot guess (that's the biggest thing.)

It goes to show that when you support a "" correctional "" system that forces you to choose side between ruthless gangs in order for you OR Your family to survive, how can you expect anything but a dehumanizing process to happen... that system may soothe a victims family short term that same way if you wet your pants on cold winters day, but society in general looses. Great movie and a lot tougher that most 'cause it feels so authentic",Shot Caller

Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau - who plays Jamie Lannister in Thrones - puts in a damn good performance in this engaging crime drama as a well-liked family man with a perfect life who accidentally kills his best friend running a light and becomes churned up in the prison system, forced to mix in with really bad people in order to survive and protect his family. This barely got any promotion and will fly under almost everyone's radar, but those who seek it out will be rewarded with one of the year's best, most engaging thrillers.",Shot Caller

Totally worth the watch, you'll not expect or know what's going to happen. The main character reminded me just the tiniest bit of Gerard Butler's in Law Abiding Citizen, and that's not a spoiler alert or anything so don't worry. Just a tiny glimpse of humanity and our need to protect our own at any cost, who can't relate to that?

Shot Caller is one of those film you haven't heard of, have no expectations prior to watching, and end up happy in the end knowing that good scripts are still being produced.

I was expecting an average at best prison gang drama thing, but was left with a great character piece. A believable cast, story and general tone is what really makes this film worth the watch. This film showcases the hardships of 'Money' and his forced path into violence.Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is probably one of the most underrated actors at the moment. His Game of Thrones Character kind of overshadows his true ability.(And don't get me wrong I love The King Slayer!) He's someone I'll be looking out for in 2018. I would personally nominate Coster-Waldau for best actor, not that it was the best acting this year but at least be recognized. Jon Bernthal was yet again fantastic, no matter the size of role he always brings his A game. The overall tone and pace of the film kept me from hitting the pause button. Very enjoyable and worth the watch. This is underrated and not talked about enough.",Shot Caller

The personal story is dramatic; you can't help but feel pity for Jacob Harlon and his family who used to live a peaceful and comfortable life up until recently. At the same time it makes you feel helpless to witness how a second's lack of attention can turn one man's life upside down and makes you realize how all our possesive boastings are in vain.Maybe a bit more effort should've been put into explaining and developing the psyche of the main character; things are moving really fast and we're having trouble in grasping how an ordinary white collar man became a gang leader in such a short time. Yes, poor fellow finds himself trapped in this situation, but at the same time he seems to have adapted to it too easily. Did he always have that in him?",Shot Caller

This film will have you rooting for the bad guy. Shot like an independent movie, light grading with a blue tint, simple tight shots apart from 3 scenes. Also, film has multiple scenes of graphic violence, which reinforces the power of the story. Which allows you to reflect on the main character evolution. So not for the weak hearted.This movie is all about the script and your emotional connection to the main character. Which leaves the supporting characters looking and feeling a bit flat. The problem is time, is not enough time to build the other characters up and give them depth.The script is hard and most definitely keeps you engaged. This is not a quick watch. So prepare yourself.

It felt like they were overly explaining the prison gang life to the stupid viewers.
I don't get all of the 10/10's on here. Seriously? It was a perfect movie? When I think of a movie, where a money man ends up in prison, that was a 10/10, I don't think ""Shot Caller""... I think Shawshank Redemption. And this movie is definitely no Shawshank.",Shot Caller

It starts out kind of bland and seems predictable, but after 30 min I was deeply invested in finding out what happens to the main character. So many movies for the past 20 years are so confusing and just CGI effects. In this movie every scene made sense. I never got a ""who is he fighting now, where is he going and why"" sentiment like most other films. All the supporting characters are interesting as well. I know this movie is good because I keep thinking about it after 2 days. It's the kind of movie that you can relate to, simply because it could happen to you. Get thrown in prison for causing a car accident that results in a death after 3 beers. It could happen to anyone. Don't drink and drive.

I'll quote a line from the movie : ""The fact is we all started out as someone's little angels and a place like this forces you to become warriors or victims"".This is what the movie is all about. It's about a decent man who finds himself in prison. A tough situation where he either rolls the dice and guarantees the life of a warrior Or he sits back and guarantees the life of a victim . He rolls the dice and things get messy !Great grimy dramatic soundtrack .Amazing cinematography. Addicting... You don't know where the story is going. The movie reflects realistic aspects of Crime...the ugliness of crime life and the loop it draws you in. The choices you have to make. This movie reminds me a lot of American History X for some reason (Different story entirely). This movie definitely belongs in the 8s. 8/10 from me!Might I add Jaimie Fking Lanister!

227,zekakhan,Thin Penitentiary Line,8,2 November 2017,"I have seen this movie a week ago and the rating of it still fluctuates in my head. I have been considering 7 and then again, sometimes even 10. Like an old-school professors, I have decided it to be 8, so I could point out the importance of seeing this movie and still, not let the student relax. Keep up the good work Ric Roman Waugh.Now. Ric Roman Waugh? Common. ""A stunt-man-turned-director's""? You have got to be kidding me?! That is all I could explore about this man by simple googling. Of course, by seeing previous works, it is obvious that a man knows a lot about the penitentiary system in the USA. But I have no idea how...I have never personally been in touch with the USA penitentiary system (thank God, not yet) but reading and seeing all the documentaries and commenting with my colleague attorneys, it is not a secret that so harsh prison sentences from multiple years of prison up to life sentences for more or less regular people definitely equals to being send out of space. Never to return...even worse, in 21st Century where a year is less then a year and a man is not a social unit anymore, this presents a social, family and economical death of a man.Now, naturally, one of my favorite movies of all time (as well as millions worldwide) is ""The Shawshank Redemption"". As far as I am concerned, just mentioning this movie in the same text as The Shawshank Redemption presents an honor and a proof of accomplishment. However, I would not compere these two, but the obvious connection of themes forces me to point out two additional parallels - strong acting and powerful ending. The acting bravura in Shawshank is beyond any comment, but that should not diminish the acting skill of Nikolaj Coaster-Waldaum in this one, on its own level of story. These days of hyper production make it practically improbable for a movie to stay in focus longer then a month, even with a blockbuster marketing. Anyhow, the Shot Caller is not to be underestimated, for it opened a couple of important issues on the table:Protection or neglecting the existence of criminal groups inside the penitentiary institutions; - Non-selective or non-satisfactory selection of prisoners within institutions comparing to the type of crimes they committed; - Non-adequate facilitation of family support to a convict committing crimes with lower levels of intent.Since I do not like spoiling the movie by analyzing the particulars of the plot, I would just add one additional, final comment: This is a masterpiece of a kind, keeping a viewer's attention and simultaneously succeeding in making one infer that the penitentiary system of USA is unnecessarily cruel and unfit to a civilized man.",Shot Caller

Coaster-Waldau plays the protagonist ""Money"" and we follow his journey through the prison system interwoven into a plot about an impending deal between two criminal gangs.The acting is quite good, camera is decent, score was a little on the dramatic side for a movie like this. for me it all comes down to the poor story. To me it felt like an Antoine Fuqua kind of movie, but without a good story. Some plot points feel unresolved and parts feel like they could use some more attention.Some might like it, some might not, personally i have a hard time recommending it though due to its length and lack of any real plot. i think i get what Waugh was trying to say but sadly it falls flat.",Shot Caller

Well acted, lots of action, a lot of thinking and ""what if"" went into this movie. I actually thought it should've been longer! This actually happens, and it's sad really, good people make a stupid mistake and their lives are ruined. Sometimes it's not fair and this movie hits that hard.

It is a very powerful, engrossing story and performance by all involved.

261,draftsorspam,It's a good movie but a boring premise,6,11 July 2020,"This is like watching your normal schema of war movies. Protagonist is plunged into violence only in the end to redeem himself for all his mishaps for some moral virtue like saving his family. It doesn't strive for any realistic story angle, just we have our main character get the most minor of offenses coupled with a tragic outcome (DUI .08 and then car crash that lands him in prison) then rising through the ranks of leadership to the top of a white supremacist movement. Kinda like how Grandma and Grandpa perceive criminality or anything on the FX channel. Simultaneously it seems trying to convince the audience he does it for his family as well as maintaining power. I mean the entire premise is absorb. It could beg the question, what do you forgive? But it doesn't land a believable foundation to begin even diving into that sort of philosophical conundrum cause it's such drivel writing.That said it is well acted and entertaining. If you watch it, and don't think about it, then yeah it's not a bad movie. I hold no grudges with the actors. But the story line is moot and the plot is trope. I would actually recommend it for mere entertainment. But if you worried about someone who is remotely impressionable, this movie is not to be recommended.",Shot Caller

263,williamsw-1,This is NOT a feel-good movie,9,2 January 2019,"...but make no mistake, it is good.There is so much choice nowadays that one simply can't watch every movie that catches your attention, so it helps to read a couple of reviews before making that decision. The reviews of Shot Caller, while favourable, were not particularly compelling. I was looking for something in this genre and, as nothing else caught my fancy, decided to give it a shot. None of the reviews I read did it justice, so I decided to write one of my own.Shot Caller had a decent plot and all the supporting characters turned in quality performances. However, there were three components that lifted this from an average prison movie to classic worth watching more than once.Firstly, Coster-Waldau's performance was compelling and nuanced, keeping one riveted to the screen eager not to miss even the slightest detail. The transformation of outward his outward appearance from white collar stock-broker to white supremacist is placed in stark contrast to his internal struggle.Secondly, filming was tight and lean, keeping only what was necessary for the plot and keep the story moving at a brisk pace to its conclusion. Very little was spoon-fed, with the viewer often being given small grains of information and then left to draw one's own conclusion.Thirdly, and most importantly, this is a movie comprised of several layers and communicating more than one message. I was amazed that none of the other reviews I read made any mention of this and have to wonder whether these reviewers were playing games on their phones or updating their social media while watching, or whether they simply didn't get it.Apart from the obvious plot, Shot Caller questions the structure and effectiveness of the US prison system. It questions the logic behind putting someone who has been convicted of a non-violent crime in the same general population with violent repeat offenders. It also implies that imprisonment in this system is more likely to lead to recidivism than rehabilitation. Granted, it doesn't offer solutions, but at least it is asking the questions.Yet a further layer deals with guilt, remorse and personal sacrifice. I won't go into further detail as this is central to the movie and I don't want to spoil it for anyone that may read this.",Shot Caller

All three acts are played with tension and majestic acting by the part of the main characters, especially Nikolaj Coaster(main character) and Omari Hardwick(agent).

He was full of regret, remorse and finally acceptance.The acting was great. I loved my Jon bernthal he is always a wildcard that man!
Sad story though that is true to real life. Non violent crimes being punished so harshly. Completely ruining a family over a terrible terrible accident.

The gang know that he betrayed them. The mexicans and cartel know that also. Still he will be running things! And that would secure that his family was safe. Instead of one gang threating his family in my mind it would be three after his despection making them all lose money.3. He could just left Shotgun alone and let him be the fall guy to the gangs and be arrested the same in the bust. Then he also could done the same and point 2 would not matter.4. He was a former business man outside prison who was in for a car accident. With no criminal experience at all from the street. Why would the boss give him power of a deal in this magnitude?5. He seem to like fighting and killing in prison. So why even question what his boss demanded. Live the life of a criminal on the outside also making more money for them until he was put back again. That had made both richer and the protection of the gang.But still very good acting especially by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.,Shot Caller

If we talk about technical proess then this movie has a decent display and a few shot's choices that I really enjoyed. If you pay close attention to the color palette through the entire film, you will gladly notice how the scenes that are taking place in the present are very dirty looking, all of then floated with yellowish imagery representing the social persona this guy (our protagonist) has made up for himself. However, whenever we find ourselves into the past's scenes (or the flashbacks) there's a comforting blue aura around what we could've called the more innocent part of the character arc. At last, this two tones start mixing up each other reflecting the change this character was going through and I think it did well recreating that with the help of the hairstyles and facial hair.Unfortunately, this leads me to the things I didn't like. The story is told with a back and forward structure and although a don't think it would've work any other way, I do believe that the film didn't do it's best to deliver this plot in the most compelling way. The story is plagued with flashbacks and explanations that look like flashbacks, and any of you may agree with me are kind of a downer. The portrayals in this film are pretty solid, with Jon Bernthal's character and Juan Pablo Raba's minimally standing out. There isn't much else to say about this subject, other than it is true Bernthal was playing a more gangster version of his default character. Not saying he isn't a good actor, I actually like him quite a bit, but he has a constant play of mannerism that almost every character he portrays has, so this time is not much different. Regarding to Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau's main lead role, his performance was filled with ups and downs, giving to me a solid 6-7 when he was in the present, but a 4- 5 when he was in the past. I can't completely blame Waldau for this, but that added to the fact that past-Waldau had horrible dialogue between him and his wife made me go ""wtf"" a little every once in a while. The photography could've been better, the sound design or the score for that matter weren't that big much of a deal, with the exception of a really well placed song near the end. The plot even tho very interesting had it's low points when I found myself saying ""really? are you telling me this actually happened?"" and it has a few cliché moments that pulled me out of the experience, but to be honest there were not much more than a couple.Overall, a decent scope to the duality this main character was living and a cool film, and I'm giving this one a 6/10.",Shot Caller

I mean after all these years and different ideas taking the chance to be in pictures good directors and writers are having 2-3 years gap between their movies/screenplays to find an unique set of story to get to the viewer's bones.and at this time A director like this rises with previous prison movies which is a great obsession cause there are a lot going on in the prisons even in the most civilized countries, Ric Roman Waugh proves that even with a low budget and efficient use of resources you can make a masterpiece of the genre,in writing specifically screenplays its not only about plot its mostly about story telling I mean if good plots like inception would be cheap in story telling the whole plot could be ruined too.Shot Caller lacks the extraordinary plot but covering it masterfully with story telling which shows Ric Waugh is stepping in the right way.Oh and of course we get to Nikolaj Coster Waldau,which before this movie were mostly cheap movies kinda guy except for his Game of Thrones TV career and again another surprise he handled this role real nice,too nice that we might say we cant ever imagine someone else playing Money.He proved to be good even as a main role character hope we see him more often.",Shot Caller

It's also unlikely that his commitment offence and his background would land him in a level IV prison. The pressure that the gangs put on people is real. As long as you're not a rapist, child molester, R.A.T., and a few other crimes they won't tolerate....you will put in work or you will have to PC up. (Protective custody). So it's possible to enter prison with a small sentence and wind up with life. His path to being a shot caller is a little...ehh, I mean it's possible if you're intelligent and ruthless but not entirely probable. The scene at the end....no. Most of the big gangs don't have a single leader either. Oh and why does every single prison movie absolutely have to have dirty ""guards""?

But how am I supposed to believe that a high power financial advisor with a fancy lawyer wouldn't have gotten a better deal or the case dismissed?2) And even if he still got jail time are we really supposed to believe he wouldn't end up in a really nice prison???3)Jacob has never been in a gang outside of prison. So I'm supposed to believe the day he gets out of prison he knows exactly how to be in a gang on the street?

The depiction of prison life, segregation, victimization, and corruption was perfectly accurate, though a bit dramatized. The acting was surprisingly good, in my opinion. The only thing lacking was a bit more character development. There was a lot of story to tell in a relatively short time span, so perhaps some patience is warranted. An excellent story. Well acted and written. As someone else suggested the score could have been better and not quite as dark. But the direction had shades of Michael Mann, and it worked well. It's hard to imagine anyone being disappointed with this film. It's a sleeper.",Shot Caller

302,mark_oliver-365-44747,Worth a watch 10:10,10,1 May 2021,I have never heard of this film of the actor. I was surprised as it was such a cool film and after so well. All the actors were engaging and genuine. Lead role was sublime. I will be looking out for him more as well as other actors in this great film.,Shot Caller
303,byrnsey93,Breath of brutal fresh air,8,11 August 2017,"What a refreshing movie. A brutal look at how prison life can transform a man. I'd first like to acknowledge the cast. Brilliant performance from Nikolaj Caster-Waldau, outshining his performance in Game of Thrones by a long shot. Delivering a strong lead performance leading us to sympathize with his unfortunate character. The film's pacing is great never feeling as though there's a slow moment but continually building suspense all the way up to end. Brilliantly directed and brilliantly written I found this to be an extremely captivating story. It's nice to see a movie being made that's not a reboot or based on a book. The violence is exceptional and the brutality is absolutely golden. Told through a series of flashbacks and current goings on we see Jacob ""money"" Harlon navigate his way through both prison life and gang life on the outside. Highly recommended for fans of American History X.",Shot Caller
304,williamrepik,I can't believe I haven't found this film sooner,10,22 June 2019,"Not only was I a fan of Nikolaj from Game of Thrones, but had I known that this film was going to be so good I would've watched it sooner. I truly believe that his versatility as an actor made this film. Along with brilliant writing and cinematography. My father was an ex con and was telling me the whole time that this was one of the most accurate representations of prison in California he has ever seen. Minus a few quirks he found that had nothing to do with the story (like sealing an envelope in prison which apparently isn't allowed). Either way I give it a 10. I can't recommend this film enough. I beg every friend I hang out with to watch it. It is just that good.",Shot Caller

If you have seen and enjoyed FELON then this film is for you(same writer and director). I stumbled upon this film and watched it straight away back in 2017 and I thought it was brilliant, one of the best films of 2017 along with Brawl in Cell Block 99, so I just watched it again and decided to do my first Review, Brilliant performances, Great Writing and Great Directing.

It is so unpredictable, high sense of sacrifice, and so so deep. It has some action, drama, and thrilling. You will have to sit until the very end to really know what's going to happen. And then, it is something you wouldn't expect. It is so deep and touching that could cause some tears in your eyes as well, be ware.",Shot Caller
310,hittlex,"Wow, compelling storyline",9,8 July 2019,"The method to build characteristic of the main actor is so amazing. From the accident to the jail, the main actor changed from a normal man to the beast in prison. All changes are fast and those things make the film fascinating from the beginning to the end.
The progress of the story makes the viewers easily to understand and catch the meaningful message of the movie ""A man always does the best thing for his family.""",Shot Caller

315,miliahasan,Good story told brilliantly.,9,16 November 2017,"What a masterfully told story. It builds towards such an emotionally riveting climax. The past events are presented brilliantly through costume, makeup, and change in the hairstyle of the actors. Ser Jaime Lannister sure as hell sold the character of the emotionally damaged cold-blooded gangster built in prison, hiding his true self of a loving father and husband. Overall a very enjoyable watch.",Shot Caller
316,mochanmishra,the underdog of brilliant proportions,9,29 July 2017,"this is the best organised crime movie of this year yet, and on top of that it has got good thriller and suspense elements, and on top of that it has got emotions too. watch it too believe, best underdog of this year yet. the drama and action is kept minimal which totally suits persona of this movie.",Shot Caller
317,eliseisabella,Wonderful under rated movie,10,11 December 2019,Movie is an excellent portrayal that even the best of people can do the worst of things when being out in a difficult situation. Never have I seen a movie before where I was rooting for a criminal the entire time until this. Director and actors made you put yourself into the actors positions and kept you on your toes until the last minute.,Shot Caller

The story is clever and believable and really makes you believe it could happen ! 
Nikolaj plays a great part and makes you believe that one mistake can lead to the life it turns into.
Even if it is not your usual genre I promise you working t be disappointed !",Shot Caller

321,luke_hedges,A Dark Horse,9,12 September 2017,"After watching the trailer for this film my expectations were fairly low. Not much is given away except a few snippets of violence and occasional flashbacks. I was expecting a B-rated movie.However i was mistaken. This film had me gripped from start to finish! The story line held together well and the small leakage of past events tied in nicely with the present day story. It was well constructed overall. The cinematography was good too, and the acting was believable. The reason it's not getting 10 stars is due to the film at times having lulls of not really that much happening. Potentially they could have made the film slightly shorter to prevent this.Summarising, this film is well worth a watch.",Shot Caller
322,godpile,Best movie I've seen all year,10,14 July 2017,"Intrigued by the trailer, I was expecting, as usually, to be let down by the actual movie. Didn't happen.I really liked it's non-linear progression, which managed to not be annoying and made sense. But didn't give the whole game away either.The pace was engaging - not too fast to where it's just bash-bang- boom and no time to pull you along on the journey and not so slow that you're staring at characters .Also, a big question in the movie is the main guy's motivation for his actions - various characters wonder and ask him directly. While typically the reveal would form a big emotional piece of the plot or would do a 4 second cutaway to a simple explanatory scene, the makers of this movie managed to resist the easy answer and instead left us guessing as well. Thus, making the guy seem even more of a mystery and making the mystery of his motivations itself a theme.Even the relationship with his son - an unavoidable theme - was surprising and seemed fresh.It was also interesting to see the idea of how a good guy turns bad and enters the underworld in such a compelling way - the wannabe psychologist attraction.",Shot Caller
323,vmatheboss,A must watch for crime/prison movie lovers..,10,26 July 2017,"I normally don't have time to review or even let alone use IMDb, but this is definitely one of my favorite movies out for 2017 and I HAD TO REVIEW THIS hoping more movies like this comes along. I haven't had any films which kept me interested throughout the entire movie like this in a long time. If you are into movies which brings the feelings of how it would feel like to be in prison and to be in dept of ""prison politics"", this movie is a must watch. The main character ""Jacob"" played his role very well, from a business man to a full blown convict. It might looks crazy, but there are people out there who are really living that lifestyle. I was surprised there were so many familiar faces in this movie I'm sure viewers will recognize, they all pretty much fit into their roles.Over all I would recommend this to everyone looking for that prison experience film. The details with how prison life is so detailed and correct. Everything from the dorm rooms to prison gangs and politics. The only other one like this was a movie called ""Felon"" back in 2008 (but this movie Shot Caller has more action) I was hoping for another one just like it, and this one satisfies me until something similar and better comes along in the near future!",Shot Caller
324,mgruber-19659,intense !,9,30 July 2017,"I am not a ""movie technician"" so i am just going to go by my gut feelings. it's been a while since i walked out of a cinema and said "" wawwww!!!! I would not mind watching that one again "" But for Shot Caller, I did. Not a dull moment, the story unfolds neatly , no over-complicated twist or deep introspection. Just the story of an ordinary man whose life goes wrong after an accident. Placed in extraordinary circumstances, there is no time for doubt or remorse: it all comes down to survival. He does what he has to do, sticks to his words and pays the price for it... it reminds me of another movie ( a french one )called ""A prophet"". My advice : go and watch it, you won't be disappointed. Enjoy !",Shot Caller
325,lmlmacedo,Greatest Movie of 2017,10,3 September 2017,"After seeing this movie for the first time this Friday, I immediately felt compelled to watch it a second time in a more thorough way (which I did the next day). The movie is so well structured, with perfect dialog, great cast (perfectly suited for their roles), outstanding tempo and content density, excellent cinematography and an amazing performance from Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, that I feel forced to claim this is the best movie of this year. Really Oscar award material. The IMDb rate so far is completely understated (7.4 at the time I write this review). A MUST WATCH.",Shot Caller

This is my first time reviewing a film at all but I just had to do it with this movie.This movies shows how a normal citizen can turn into a brutal gang member.

You don't look at the credits, you just close everything and go on about other things.And there's the movie that lingers. The one that glued you till the very last scene, and then it cuts to the credits and you watch all of it. Shot Caller is the latter. Stuntman turned writer/director Ric Roman Waugh signs here a beautiful, poignant and powerful movie. The story is compelling, easy to understand. It shines in its simplicity, with a cast that leads the narrative like masters. I highly recommend you watch it.",Shot Caller

This is an anti hero movie where you're hoping for a happy ending or something that will make you feel alright when you go to bed at night.

343,arildoaim,"Good, but could have been Great (minor spoiler)",8,28 July 2017,"I, like the fans of the streetwise and realistic style of the likes of David Ayer will applaud this movie. It can somewhat be seen as a spiritual prequel to the directors former great movie Felon (2008). This movie is just as good, and even feels like an epic at times. If the movie was set in the 17 century or the roman empire, many of the same themes would apply. I don't need to praise it more, others have already commented the superb cinematography and acting. While movie is good, it is sadly not flawless. The motivations of main character seems at times unreasonable. The screenplay should established a stronger motivation from the start. Why choose the impending life sentence over 18 months, if your main goal is your family well being? The dangers of not being in a gang should be more explictly adressed. It almost seems like he have a choice in the beginning, and could have been fine on his own. He wasn't particularly ""unlucky"" either, resulting in inevitable gang membership. And as a result of the unclear motivation, the plot then seems less tight. With some minor tweaks this would have been fixed. For all i know, i might been trimmed away in the editing room.",Shot Caller
