0,MartinHafer,Amazingly underrated,9,1 October 2007,"Sandra Bullock plays a lonely lady who works in a toll booth for the elevated train in Chicago. Her life is so empty that she begins fantasizing about having a relationship with a handsome customer. One day, this customer is robbed and thrown onto the track as a train is coming. Sandra pulls him off the track and accompanies his to the hospital, as he's in a coma. Through a funny mistake, the hospital staff thing she's his fiancée and the problem quickly snowballs when his family arrives and they, too, think she's engaged to their son.This is a lovely romantic comedy--one of the best of the last several decades. Also, despite this very simple plot, the film does a great job of setting the mood and creating characters you will love. It's very engaging and sweet and I enjoyed it significantly more than SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE (another fine film)--mostly because the film has such a great sense of humor. Oddly,despite having so much going for it, the rating for this is surprisingly low her on IMDb AND Leonard Maltin's guide also gives it a pretty low score. While I may sound like a fathead, I really can't understand why the score is so low as the writing is so clever, the acting excellent and the ensemble supporting cast so sweet while not being saccharine.A wonderful and nearly perfect film--a terrific date movie or just a film if you could use a laugh or smile.",While You Were Sleeping
1,SnoopyStyle,Sandra Bullock is American's Sweetheart,7,28 December 2013,"Lucy (Sandra Bullock) is a train token taker without a family. She pines for frequent commuter Peter (Peter Gallagher), but never speaks to him. Then on Christmas, Peter gets pushed off the platform, and she rescues him. In the hospital, the family mistakes her for his fiancée. While he's in a coma, she and his brother Jack (Bill Pullman) slowly falls for each other.This is a perfectly harmless Sandra Bullock rom-com, and she's so great at it. She can make any preposterous situations work. This movie is about Bullock's vulnerable charm. The biggest problem is that Bill Pullman doesn't get in the movie until almost 30 minutes in. They need more time together to develop the chemistry. I don't know why he doesn't get in right from the start.",While You Were Sleeping
2,classicsoncall,"""I'm so glad he found you.""",7,23 July 2018,"The irony in my summary line above is that Lucy (Sandra Bullock) was the one to find Peter (Peter Gallagher), and not the other way around, and then, as things progress, she winds up finding Peter's brother in a film filled with clever second guessing and imponderable coincidences. The cleverest was the 'one testicle' scenario. I wondered how the script was going to pull off that little conundrum and the screenwriters did it with style. So here's a romantic comedy that works without getting sappy. Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman affect a low key chemistry in the story that allows them to ride out the controversy of a phony engagement made all too real through a series of misjudgments. You really have to give the screenwriters credit here for making a believable story out of a set of unbelievable circumstances. The only thing that might not work here is the idea that someone who looks like Sandra Bullock wouldn't have eligible guys lined all the way up and down the block from her el-train cubicle to ask her out on a date. That aside, the story comes together in a charming way to make this not only an engaging chick flick, but an entertaining family film as well.",While You Were Sleeping
3,gavin6942,Sandra Bullock's Finest Role,7,1 May 2015,"A ticket-collecting romantic (Sandra Bullock) pretends to be engaged to an unconscious man (Peter Gallagher) but cannot fool his brother (Bill Pullman).Romantic comedies are judged pretty harshly. And they probably should be, as they are generally sentimental, unrealistic fluff. But this is one of those rare good ones. Is it sentimental? Yes. Unrealistic? Yes. Fluff? Yes. But it really cemented Sandra Bullock as America's Sweetheart, and may be her finest role. Well, this and ""Speed"". She is going as strong as ever twenty years later, and it should be no surprise.Peter Gallagher is a bit off, but Bill Pullman really succeeds as a romantic interest. Odd, but he does it. And the supporting cast is excellent, from Peter Boyle to... well, everyone.",While You Were Sleeping
4,jboothmillard,While You Were Sleeping,8,9 January 2008,"Just a year after her role in Speed, the leading actress came out with this charming romantic comedy, and I adore it. Basically Lucy Eleanor Moderatz (Golden Globe nominated Sandra Bullock) a lonely ticket seller, and one day she sees the man of his dreams, but she also sees him get mugged. This mugging sends this man, known as Peter Callaghan (American Beauty's Peter Gallagher) into a coma, and when she goes to hospital to visit him, the nurse tells his family that Lucy is his fiancée. Lucy cannot get the courage to tell the truth, and the family, including Peter's father Ox (Peter Boyle), his mother Elsie (Glynis Johns), his godfather Saul (Jack Warden) (the only one who finds out her secret before everyone else), and his brother Jack Callaghan (Bill Pullman), have all taken her in as a (new) member of the family. While spending a lot of time with the family as Peter is still in the coma, Lucy is falling head over heels in love with Jack. Peter does eventually come out of his coma, and Lucy doesn't know what to do because he doesn't remember her, except go along with the idea that he is suffering very mild amnesia. Eventually, it seems Peter does accept that there should be a wedding, and he can see himself falling in love with Lucy as the years go by. So the big day comes, Lucy knows she truly loves Jack, but she doesn't know that before his coma, Peter proposed to another woman, so this is when Lucy confesses all, but says she fell in love with the family ever since the ""engagement"". She does eventually get her happy ending, where she finds a new husband in Jack, and a new loving family. Also starring Michael Rispoli as Joe 'Joey' Fusco, Jr., Jason Bernard as Jerry Wallace, Micole Mercurio as Midge Callaghan and Ally Walker as Ashley Bartlett Bacon. With some good giggles, and a good message that love can be at first sight, but getting to know someone is the much better idea, this is a film you can't help but enjoy. Very good!",While You Were Sleeping
5,moonspinner55,Hard to believe a cutie-pie like this wouldn't have men lining down her street!,6,15 April 2006,"Sandra Bullock is adorable...but as a mousy working girl with no real romantic opportunities? Bullock is so charming in this film that she's a little miscast. She seems to have no real friends, no family of her own; a person this bubbly and sparkling would not be a house hermit. But, to buy into the situation as is means to be carried away by Bullock's performance--and that's an easy task. She lights up the screen, but in a quiet, easy way. There were few chances for her to really be easy and natural in ""Speed"" (although I liked her worried line to the passengers, ""Are we dragging him?"" when Keanu Reeves was under the bus) and her brief appearance in ""The Vanishing"" was just what that doom-laden movie needed. This picture seems to be tailored to her low-keyed effervescence, and Sandra's chemistry with Bill Pullman is exactly right. She becomes friends with a loud, jubilant family here, her face lighting up in surprise at her own enjoyment, and in these moments I couldn't have cared less about the trite set-up of the plot, the hectic finale or some of the wobbly writing (as with a bad caveat about a character having one testicle--not good material for a comedy). But, the movie is quite enjoyable and romantic and it works the audience over gently. With Bullock and Pullman in the leads it can't hardly miss. *** from ****",While You Were Sleeping
6,BandSAboutMovies,A favorite of my wife,6,23 December 2017,"This is one of those movies where she waits for me to get emotional. But I had steel resolve, holding back any tears or emotion. Sandy Bullock, you won't break me. You won't.",While You Were Sleeping
7,preppy-3,Sweet romantic comedy--Sandra Bullock's breakthrough movie,8,16 July 2001,"Bullock plays Lucy, a lonely Chicago transit worker.  She falls in love with a man she's never talked to Peter (Peter Gallagher), but sees every day at the train station.  One day she saves his life, but he slips into a coma. His family mistakenly believes she's his girlfriend and she doesn't have the heart to correct them.  Then she meets Peter's sweet, soft-spoken brother Jack (a wonderful Bill Pullman) and falls for him!  Then Peter wakes up... You can figure out the rest.  Utterly predictable but totally charming.  The script is funny, the film looks gorgeous and Bullock and Pullman have wonderful chemistry together.  Well worth seeing...a perfect date film.  One small complaint...it goes on a bit too long.  Still, well worth seeing.",While You Were Sleeping
8,grantss,Surprisingly decent,6,4 June 2020,"Lucy works as a ticket booth operator at a Chicago train station. One day she saves the life of Peter, a passenger she has a crush on. He ends up in a coma and due to an error at the hospital she is identified as his fiancée. At the news of this his family take her in and treat her as one of their own. Things gets complicated, however, when she meets Peter's brother, Jack.I had fairly low expectations for this film, figuring it would just be your usual schmaltzy, empty romantic comedy. However, while it has many of the irritating elements of romantic dramas and rom coms, it is reasonably enjoyable.What makes it work is the light, buoyant tone, the humour and the performance of Sandra Bullock. Some great one-liners and interesting characters make for an engaging experience. Bullock is great as Lucy, playing her usual independent woman-type role but here with more vulnerability than usual, making her character more accessible.As mentioned, there are still many of the negative elements of rom coms in the film. The plot is far-fetched and much of development quite silly and farcical. Minor things get misunderstood and turned into major issues, impeding progress. There's the usual, worn out scenario of she loves him and he loves her but neither tells the other so nothing happens.Overall, not great but good enough.",While You Were Sleeping
9,evanston_dad,Sandra Bullock Charms Bill Pullman's Pants Off,8,18 May 2009,"It's a shame that this movie has such a low rating at IMDb, because it deserves better.""While You Were Sleeping"" is the kind of film that must be hard to pull off, because there aren't many of them: solid, well-written and consistently funny romantic comedies.Sandra Bullock exudes buckets of charm and a whopper of a comic presence as the heroine of this particular romance. She ably carries the movie, even when surrounded by veterans like Jack Warden, Peter Boyle and Glynis Johns.Those who are familiar with Chicago will have fun with this film, as that's where it was filmed, and you could make a game out of spotting the inconsistencies in the movie if you actually know the city it's set in.A fun movie to pop in here and there during the holiday season.Grade: A",While You Were Sleeping
10,Uriah43,A Cute Little Romantic-Comedy,6,15 July 2016,"After her father dies ""Lucy"" (Sandra Bullock) is left all alone with no family and nobody to share her life with. So day after day she goes to work for the Chicago Transit Authority and collects tokens in a small booth while everybody else go about their busy lives. Then one day she sees a handsome young man who helps old ladies get on the subway train and she falls head-over-heels in love with him. The only problem is that she doesn't know his name and he doesn't even know she exists. That changes when he is pushed onto one of the tracks and Lucy manages to drag his unconscious body off of the rails just before an oncoming train goes rushing by. Worried about his health Lucy then goes to the hospital but is told that since she is not part of the family that she cannot see him. However, during the confusion she is introduced as the young man's fiancé and since he is in a coma nobody is able to dispute the fact. So the family welcomes her as one of their own. But things don't exactly work out like Lucy and everyone else expect. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a cute romantic-comedy which should appeal to most fans of the genre. Likewise, those who like Sandra Bullock will probably have no reason to dislike this movie either. In any case, I enjoyed this film for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",While You Were Sleeping
11,morrison-dylan-fan,Wake up.,7,4 August 2010,"I remember a few years ago,my dad telling me that he was going to trade in ,what looked to be a romantic comedy the was in a very mucky big-box Ex-Rental case.Partly due to how nasty the case looked,I said to him the that was fine.Jumping a few years forward...And,I am searching on Amazon for fun looking romantic comedies,that are being sold cheaply on DVD.When I got to the end of one of the many pages,I suddenly spotted this film among them all.I felt,that,since I had missed seeing it on my first chance to,plus the fact that it had two very good lead actors,and a pretty good director,the it was worth giving the film a shot.The plot:A long-time working subway worker called Lucy,has a crush on a very pleasant-looking commuter (Peter),though she is sadly unable to get the confidence to go and chat to him.One day,whilst he is waiting for his train to arrive,he gets mugged on the platform by a gang,who push him on to the rail line.Luckaly for Peter,Lucy is working there and she is able to bravely get him off the railway track alive.When Peter is taken to hospital,it is revealed to Lucy that Peter is now in a coma.When his family arrive,they are all understandable,very upset,but are all really hopeful that he will come out of the coma.With Lucy having been extremely sad since taking Peter to the hospital.The family ask that,due to how sad she has been,if she is engaged to him!!.With wanting to give the family something that can hopeful make them smile for a little bit,she decides to say that she is engaged to him.Thought as she gets to know the family more,Lucy stars developing feelings for Peters very sweet brother,Jack.Sadly for Lucy,questions are about to be asked,when Peter wakes up from his coma...View on the film:The main thing that I feel made the film a lot more enjoyable than I was thinking it would be,were the great performances from Sandra Bullock,and,the very under-rated Bill Pullman.Each of the actors make their friendship/relationship feel very charming and they have some very natural chemistry in all the scenes that they are in.When looking at the supporting cast,it has to be said that the people the play Peter and Jacks family,give the film a huge warming hearts,that even warms up the very chilly Chicago,that director Joe Turteltaub has,smartly chosen for the look of the film.Writers Daniel G.Sullivan and Fredrick Lebow wisely decide to not make the story into a grim TV-Movie-of-the-week,but instead,to give it a very Innocent feel.The only downside with the screenplay,is that the ending is just a little bit too rushed,which makes the last 15 minutes of the film feel like it is trying to fit into Cindellas slipper.Final view on the film:A engaging romantic comedy,with a well-written screenplay and charming performances from the whole cast.",While You Were Sleeping
12,anaconda-40658,Stay Awake For This.,9,4 June 2015,"While You Were Sleeping (1995): Dir: Jon Turteltaub / Cast: Sandra Bullock, Bill Pullman, Peter Gallagher, Jack Warden, Michael Rispoli: Wonderful treasure suggesting the happenings one doesn't realize. Sandra Bullock plays Lucy who works at a subway where she looks forward to the appearance of one guy. After he is pushed on railway tracks by muggers she rushes to his aid and saves him from certain death. Due to a misunderstanding his family believes her to be his fiancé. She wishes to tell them the truth but complications arise especially when she falls for the victim's brother. Predictable but warm hearted with grand humour. It isn't littered with lame cheap sex scenes but rather it concentrates on the relationships. Directed by Jon Turteltaub in what appears to be a homage to the classic Audrey Hepburn films. Bullock is endearing in her dilemma. Bill Pullman is charming in his retrain. Peter Gallagher is hilarious as the coma victim who awakens to a life he doesn't recall. Jack Warden plays the family godfather who knows Lucy's secret but his attempts to set things straight are often botched. Finally Michael Rispoli adds a great degree of hysterics her landlord's son, a slob with good intentions. A beautiful portrait of family that gives the indication that while you were sleeping through the likes of Fair Game, Turteltaub was busy with a film that is worth staying awake for.

13,AaronCapenBanner,Awakening To Lucy,8,9 December 2013,"Jon Turteltaub directed this sweet romantic comedy that stars Sandra Bullock as a beautiful but lonely subway worker named Lucy, who is smitten with a handsome stranger named Peter(played by Peter Gallagher). One day to her amazement, he is mugged and knocked unconscious on the rails, and she saves his life, but he is in a coma. At the hospital, when she meets his family(played by Peter Boyle, Jack Warden, and Glynis Johns) she blurts out that she is his fiancée, and so begins a romantic comedy of errors, though his brother Jack(played by Bill Pullman) isn't convinced, even as he and Lucy find themselves falling in love... Modern-day classic comedy is both very funny and charming, with a wonderful cast and smart screenplay. Bullock is radiant throughout, and ends exactly as viewer was hoping.",While You Were Sleeping
14,SimonJack,Great plot for this warm situational comedy and love story,8,4 January 2019,"""While You Were Sleeping"" is one of the best situational comedies of modern cinema. That is, of the last decade of the 20th century and well into the 21st. It's also a very good comedy romance. Since her debut in 1987, Sandra Bullock had been in over a dozen films, but this was the first role for which she received critical notice. She was nominated for a best actress Golden Globe for her performance as Lucy Moderatz.The plot for this comedy romance is refreshingly different, very interesting and ripe for lots of humor. This isn't a sidesplitting comedy but one of warmly funny situations. The romance is the slowly developing type that evolves into a nice love story. It's a wholesome story that isn't ruined by the all-too-frequent gratuitous sex that Hollywood wants to promote as the norm. And that gives this film a tinge of honesty.Believe it or not, there are many relationships between couples that develop without their jumping into bed. Yes, even well into the 21st century. The writers got a little dig in here to that effect. A co-worker of Lucy's seems amazed that Lucy wasn't sleeping with her boyfriend.The film treats religious beliefs with some slight humor in a couple of places. Ox and Saul (Peter Boyle and Jack Warden) are nominal in their Catholic and Jewish faiths, respectively. And, that's an accurate portrayal of many people as well.With Lucy having no other family, she takes immediately to the Callaghan clan. She enjoys all the members, who display varying degrees of kindness, warmth and wackiness. It's the family that she never had but misses. And this setting is pitched against the glamorous but empty life of the wealthy party people of Park Avenue.This is a fine film that the whole family should enjoy. Here are some favorite lines. For more dialog, see the Quotes section under this IMDb Web page of the movie.Jerry, ""Lucy, you're born into a family. You do not join them like you do the Marines.""Lucy, ""You have to tell me what to do."" Jerry, ""Pull the plug."" Lucy, ""You're sick."" Jerry, ""I'm sick?

16,theowinthrop,A Charming Movie About Misunderstanding,9,25 September 2005,"Sandra Bullock is a working girl who wants to travel. She has no family, and is usually stuck doing holiday shifts in the Chicago transit system (as a toll booth clerk on the elevated railway). She has noted one man who uses the station all the time (Peter Gallagher), and rescues him when he is thrown onto the train tracks just before a train comes into the station. Gallagher is in a coma and (due to a well-intentioned nurse) Bullock is introduced to the family of Gallagher as his fiancé. She tries to tell them the truth, but when she learns his grandmother (Glynis Johns) has a heart problem she hesitates. Soon she is treated as a member of this nice family as a member (well, she did save Gallagher, and she is thought to be his fiancé). Only his brother (Bill Pullman) has real doubts, and keeps mentioning them (and keeps apologizing for them. Bullock and Pullman find that they are also growing more attracted to each other. The film shows how these problems are resolved. And it is all done in a most charming manner.This is one of those films that would take only a few minutes to quickly resolve in the real world, where Bullock would have told the truth early on. But the audience is allowed to suspend it's disbelief because the characters are uniformly likable. Although Jack (Pullman) is constantly questioning Bullock's story, each time she gives a plausible explanation of what is going on, and Pullman likes her enough to accept these explanations. The only one who knows the truth is the family friend Sam (Jack Warden) and he too feels that the news has to be broken carefully (he loves the family and doesn't want them hurt). Oddly enough his one effort at meddling almost screws up the situation in the film for Bullock, Pullman, and Gallagher. Pullman also faces the truth and explains to his father (Peter Boyle) that he doesn't want to continue in the family business. Boyle's reaction becomes important too.The performances are flawless, and one finds oneself rooting for most of the cast (the sole exception is the actress playing ""Ashley"", Peter Galagher's actual girl friend). Her opposite number, ""Joe Jr."" is too comic a figure to dislike (in fact, at one point he thinks Pullman is annoying Bullock and offers to take care of him - not the act of a rat at all). For a sweet, lovable love tale WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING is hard to top. In the last decade only WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, WORKING GIRL, PRETTY WOMAN, NOTTING HILL, SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, and YOU'VE GOT MAIL are on par with it, but the family becomes so important to Bullock in the plot this has a special warmth in it that is quite is different from most of the others.",While You Were Sleeping
17,inkblot11,"While you were waiting, someone DID make a very nice romantic comedy for you!",8,15 March 2007,"Lucy (Sandra Bullock) lost her father a couple of years ago. Since her mother is also gone, Lucy lives alone in an apartment with her cat. She works for the Chicago transit system and, generally, feels very alone in the world. One day, a handsome gentleman falls on the tracks near her ticket booth. A train is rapidly approaching. Lucy jumps onto the tracks and pulls the man to safety. However, he hurt his head in the fall and is in a coma. Rushing to the hospital to see him, Lucy is mistaken for his fiancée and allowed into his hospital room. But, oh no, here comes his big family, including mother, father, sister, grandma, and a close neighbor. They are intrigued that their relative, Peter, never mentioned that he had become engaged. But, they also welcome Lucy with open arms, a welcome so big that lonely Lucy does not have the heart to tell them she is an impostor. But, what will happen when Peter decides to come out of his coma? And, when Lucy meets Peter's brother, Jack, is he already suspicious that she is not Peter's type? This is a lovely, lovely movie with a great cast. Bullock is very fine as the lonely lady, although, with her winning looks and personality, one could never imagine her being without a bevy of friends. The rest of the players, including Peter Gallagher, Bill Pullman, Peter Boyle, Jack Warden and Glynis Johns, is an absolutely marvelous ensemble that contributes highly to the film's enjoyment. Then, too, the script is quite clever and unusual, the costumes are well chosen, and the production values are top notch. Everyone who loves romantic comedies will not want to miss this one, no doubt. But, even those who think they can not stomach a ""chick flick"" will be enchanted by this loving and very funny movie.

18,vincentlynch-moonoi,That once in a while romantic comedy,7,22 March 2013,"Over the year there's been no shortage of romantic comedies. Occasionally one comes along that stands out, as this one did, as evidenced by its tremendous box office appeal.I had never noticed Sandra Bullock until the film she made just before this one -- ""Speed"". Not my type of film, really. Then she followed up with this film, and she suddenly was pretty high on my list of favorite actresses.This film is utterly charming, without being sweet. Bullock brings an innocence and sense of being lost to the screen without one feeling sorry for her. Then, through a series of misunderstandings, people begin believing she is the fiancée of a man in a coma...a man she has long had a secret crush on. Will they get married? It seems like the film is heading in that direction until she falls in real love with the brother of the man in the coma. One of the most special things about this film in the sense of family, even though the family is a bit odd.Bullock is tremendous here, and this may be her best film. Peter Gallagher has a key role here as the man in the coma, yet his role is not a strong one. Bill Pullman, not a favorite of mine, actually has a very good role here, and does exceptionally well with it. Micole Mercurio as the mother of the two men is very good, as is Peter Boyle -- another actor who was never high on my list. Glynis Johns is a hoot, though again, she's not one of my favorites. And perhaps the best supporting role in the film goes to Jack Warden -- a godfather and friend of the family, who becomes Bullock's friend, as well.If you like romantic comedies, you'll probably love this film.

This is a good film, I think it's one of Sandra's best and She & Bill have great chemistry. I recommend this.",While You Were Sleeping
25,lisafordeay,A very cute romantic comedy starring my all time favourite actress Sandra Bullock,10,20 February 2014,"SO I was watching this movie last year(Dec 2013) on TV during the Xmas season and I had to do a review on it so here it is.While You Were Sleeping is a 1995 romantic comedy about a lonely woman named Lucy(Sandra Bullock)who is unlucky when it comes to love and men. As she is working in a booth at a train station in Chicago she meets a handsome man called Peter(Peter Gallagher) who is taking a train journey and she develops feelings for him as he comes by everyday to get a ticket from her booth.But when two teenagers thrown him off the train station,Lucy saves him from a train coming on the train tracks by jumping into the tracks to get him out and he goes to hospital.While she is there at the hospital she blurts out ""And I was gonna marry him"" and the nurse mistakes her for Peter's fiancé!! so Peter's family visit Peter at the hospital and from here on in they presume that Lucy is Peter's fiancé.As Peter is in hospital Lucy spends some time with his family and later meets Peter's brother Jack(played by Casper star Bill Pullman). But then she starts to fall in love with him and must decide how long will her facade with Peter end and which man does she love more Jack or Peter?Bottom line I loved While You Were Sleeping,similar to the 2009 film The Proposal where Bullocks' Margaret made out she was engaged to Andrew but later falls in love with him for real, I really enjoyed this film.Sandra Bullock was really good in this movie and her chemistry with Bill Pullman as Jack was so cute.I wish I could buy this on DVD but its impossible to get it only online but the next time its on TV I will definitely be recording it on VHS.Overall While You Were Sleeping is a thumbs up and a great film to watch at Xmas time as its always on TV at Xmas.Also without giving too much away the ending was so adorable but my only concern is the movie poster,its kinda making the film predictable as you know what man she chose in the end judging by the picture but still I loved this movie.They just don't make movies like that anymore only know and again.10/10Ps I finally got it on DVD and I really loved this movie.",While You Were Sleeping
26,robert-temple-1,A perfect romantic comedy,10,30 April 2015,"I thought it was time to see this again after all these years, and it is just as fresh and wonderful as it was when it came out, like the smell of bread just taken from the oven. It is an exhilarating and essentially perfect romantic comedy. It comes off so wonderfully because of the central casting of the irresistibly charming Sandra Bullock. Whatever she lacks in Vogue cover beauty, she makes up for in tsunamis of personality. Who could say no to her? All she has to do is just smile or just look at you. Well, Bill Pullman certainly can't resist her in this film. And neither could his family. This film is so famous that most people know the story, which is the ingenious notion that Bullock saves the life of a handsome young man, played by Peter Gallagher, who is mugged and falls unconscious onto an overground subway track in front of an oncoming express train in Chicago. Bullocks leaps down, rolls over with him, and they just make it. She goes with him to the hospital but they won't let her follow him in because she is not a family member, so she pretends to be his fiancée. Then the story takes place while he is sleeping. i.e. in a deep coma, where Gallagher's family accept him as his fiancée and she is in countless comedic situations of having to pretend to know all sorts of things about him. In fact she had been in love with him for a long time, but they had never really met. It is a great idea, and it works to absolute perfection. There are many, many laughs. The film was magnificently directed by Jon Turteltaub (which means 'turtle dove' in German, just in case you wondered), who came from the unlikely background of having previously directed (gasp, gulp) 3 NINJAS (1992). Believe that if you can. This film is the only listed writing credit for Daniel G. Sullivan and Fredric LeBow. What happened to them? Surely they should have gone on writing stuff of this calibre. Did a hole in the earth open up and swallow them? The story and script are absolutely brilliant. Bill Pullman is also perfectly cast as the brother of Gallagher who falls in love with Bullock but nobly refrains from doing anything about it. Jack Warden provides heavyweight backup as family friend 'Uncle' Saul. The dotty family are all marvellous. Everybody is marvellous, everything is marvellous, the film is marvellous.

27,smatysia,Charming '40's style romantic comedy,7,30 July 2001,"While this film was utterly predictable, it oozed charm from every pore, definitely enough to make one overlook its faults. This was the first Sandra Bullock film I have seen, and her charm and ""regular girl"" beauty are really something. The director made some good moves, contrasting Sandra/Lucy, often seen alone, to the family of Peter, usually sweeping into a scene four or five at a time. But the main attraction of this film is, of course, the winsome Sandra Bullock. I will have to see some more of her work. Grade: B+",While You Were Sleeping
28,juneebuggy,What's not to like.,8,27 April 2016,"This is a very sweet movie, really there's not much not to like here. Its also one of those rare films that gives ""formula"" a good name, as its about as predictable a romantic comedy as it gets but also well made, with a great cast and just so darn likable.Sandra Bullock is Lucy, a lonely subway cashier who finds herself admiring high-class businessman Peter Gallagher from her turnstile. Secretly in love with him she is forced to come to his aid one morning right before Christmas after he is mugged and then pushed onto the train platform.Later in hospital through a series of (romantic comedy) misunderstandings Lucy is mistaken for Peters fiancée and while he lies in a coma his loud, rather dysfunctional family take her into their fold.To complicate matters Lucy finds herself drawn to the patients brother, Bill Pullman and (the lovely) Uncle Saul (Jack Warden) may have just learned her secret.Although the ending is a bit weak this is a totally enjoyable movie on just about every level. Special mention to Michael Rispoli as Lucy's neighbour Joe Jr, who is scene stealing hilarious and also randomly that bit with the paperboy wiping out on his bike really made me laugh, I smile now just thinking about it.3/27/16",While You Were Sleeping

If you ask me, the way that Lucy (Sandra Bullock) and Peter (Peter Gallagher) met was very romantic. Also, in my opinion, Joey (Michael Rispoli) was a little crazy. This was because he just couldn't seem to leave Lucy alone. In addition, to me, Jack (Bill Pullman) was a really cute guy. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""If you like romantic comedies or movies where people meet by chance, I highly recommend WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING!""

31,gcd70,Delightful Cinema,6,15 February 2008,"For simply delightful cinema one need go no further than ""While You Were Sleeping"". Jon Turtletaub's film is far better than Nora Ephron's recent hit ""Sleepless in Seattle"". There is no blatant predictability nor obvious contrivances, and this picture has considerable wit, being oft times hilarious.Turtletaub has turned the everyday, and the not so everyday, into a collection of very funny situations with apparent ease. While keeping the whole story very close to home, he has graced the movie with enough off beat moments and quirky characters to really guarantee the audience much enjoyment.Essentially though, this is romantic-comedy at its very best. ""While You Were Sleeping"" is most definitely romantic, and successfully deals with personal ideals and the awkward reality of love, and of course it's heartwarming in its humour. But what really makes the whole film work so successfully are the endlessly likable lead players.Sandra Bullock is totally charming and adorably lovable, and is just beginning to show some real versatility following her role in the action blockbuster ""Speed"". The homely good looks she possesses mean that Miss Bullock has no trouble winning hearts with a mere smile. Equally agreeable is Bill Pullman, who plays second fiddle to the lovely Miss Bullock, an unsung actor who was well overdue a chance to play a lead role, after a string of impressive support roles including ""Ruthless People"", ""The Accidental Tourist"" and ""Sommersby"".Perhaps this picture does become a fraction contrived in the last ten minutes, though it still remains an absolute joy over all.Friday, June 23, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood CinemaAgain one of the most likable films of the year from director Jon Turtletaub. The film's simplicity is a big help, with an amiable script telling an easy tale of love at second sight.The movie's best asset is the very enjoyable cast lead by every girl Sandra Bullock, whose 'girl next door' charms will win your heart with ease. With no outstanding performances, support cast back up Miss Bullock most admirably, with Bill Pullman especially enjoyable as the love lorn Jack, who has fallen head over heels for the slightly nutty Lucy.The comedy is marvellously handled by all concerned, making the very most of this humorous pic, peopled with eccentric characters as it is. But it's the romance that will win you over in the end. Best romantic/comedy of 1995.Saturday, March 23, 1996 - Video",While You Were Sleeping
32,EUyeshima,Bullock's Auspicious First Starring Vehicle Still Retains Its Charm...So Does She,8,30 October 2006,"Even though she showed a deft touch for racist vitriol in Paul Haggis' ""Crash"", Sandra Bullock will forever be etched as the lovable girl-next-door from this winsome 1995 romantic comedy directed by Jon Turteltaub. In a vehicle that was written originally for Demi Moore by Daniel G. Sullivan and Fredric Lebow, Bullock shines as Lucy Moderatz, a lonely token collector at a Chicago L-train station. The plot focuses almost completely on Lucy and how she becomes involved with not only Peter Callaghan, the object of her romantic fantasies, but his loving family as well. It all turns on a train platform incident where muggers have pushed Peter onto the tracks at which point Lucy saves him from an oncoming train.The seemingly innocent deception begins when a hospital nurse assumes that Lucy is Peter's fiancée. Since he is comatose and she is smitten with the man she thinks he is, the charade gets bigger as the Callaghans welcome her with open arms. However, the inevitable complications ensue when Peter's brother Jack enters the picture at first suspicious but then...well, you can figure out the rest. There are definitely some narrative lapses that make this film less than logical, for example, the Callaghan's somewhat blasé attitude toward Peter's comatose state once they meet Lucy. Regardless, Turteltaub manages to make the lightweight film feel like a throwback to an earlier era of romantic comedies.Bill Pullman makes a nice, casual leading man as Jack, and there is genuine chemistry between the two stars. The rest of the cast is sharp and funny, in particular, Peter Boyle as the Callaghan paterfamilias, a far warmer variation than his ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" curmudgeon; Glynis Johns as the dotty grandmother, not that far removed from her maternal suffragette in ""Mary Poppins""; Michael Rispoli as Lucy's persistent suitor and wannabe cross-dresser, Joe Jr.; Jack Warden as understanding Uncle Saul; and Peter Gallagher nicely underplaying the less-than-ideal Peter. But it's Bullock's show, and no matter how many times she has recycled her persona on lesser comedies since then, it's her sincerity, self-deprecating manner and plain-faced beauty that makes this movie one of the better studio confections of the 1990's. The 1998 DVD has no extras.",While You Were Sleeping
33,Boyo-2,Enjoyable fluff (Includes spoilers),5,9 April 2001,"I am not fond of movies where the entire plot is dependent on a silly misunderstanding.  This is the case here, when Lucy (Sandra Bullock) saves the life of a man she has a crush on and is mistakenly thought to be his fiance by his family.  Not of the family is convinced that she is who she says she is, especially Jack (Bill Pullman), who has designs on Lucy for himself. Through some funny, dramatic and painful moments, it all has A Happy Ending.Don't dwell too much on anything going on or question it.  It will ruin whatever enjoyment this movie holds.  Concentrate on the comedic turns by Glynis Johns, Michael Rispoli and Ally Walker.  Bullock is adequate to the movie and is believable in her big monologue when she explains why she did not come clean with the family. The character played by Peter Gallagher, who is in a coma for at least 3/4 of the movie, is the least appealing - he has pictures of himself in his wallet and in his apartment - what kind of guy does that, unless he's completely self-involved?  Don't worry, Lucy ends up with the other guy.",While You Were Sleeping

35,triple8,Works because it combines feel good romance with great character development with the occasional fall down in your seat funny scene,7,11 March 2005,"I'll admit I have a soft spot for romantic comedies that Sandra Bullock stars in. I think that's probably because she really is the queen of romantic comedies and can do the feel good stuff in a way other actresses don't. While You were sleeping was one of her early ones and although it drags on a bit, is really a genuinely warm fun movie mainly because it combines three great things. One, it has romance-and plenty of it. Two, the characters are both fun and funny and very human in a way that many characters in movies such as this aren't. The people in While You were Sleeping are all so adorable without being larger then life or unrealistic. I liked that.Third, this movie is wittier then you might expect and every so often a line would be thrown in that actually had me roaring, which I didn't expect. I knew this would be complete feel good stuff just from the previews but I didn't expect the wit. And the funniest lines come so unexpectedly. I like romantic comedies that can do witty and feel good simultaneously. I also like screwball comedies much more then slapstick and this movie is built around that so it appealed to me.The movie is predictable as anything but interestingly even those I know who don't like romantic comedies seem to be charmed by this. I'm not sure why that is except maybe because there's such a likability about everyone in this movie and the premise was so original and Pullman(who I really like a lot as an actor) and Bullock are so natural together that the movie just appeals to many, even many of those who don't normally like romantic comedies.I was drawn to each and every character and liked the way everyone was developed-even Peter for the brief time he actually wasn't sleeping managed to have a developed personality and some really funny scenes. This movie isn't going to win any Oscars but for what it is, it's very much worth watching and a strong 7.5. Bullock's very good at doing these types of movies and this is one of her better ones.",While You Were Sleeping
36,Kamurai25,"""Family Secret""",7,21 September 2020,"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.This feels like a classic watch, like a movie that started a trope...but I can't think of a single other movie that did what this movie does. Sure there are movies about comas, amnesia, lying, but they don't do it in the same way, and I honestly believe it's because this movie did it so well that no one wants to risk copying it and do worse.This is also a great example of good situational comedy without bleeding over into abuse humor: at no point is she ""suffering"", she's not attacked, or wronged, but she's in a difficult situation that doesn't lend towards pleasantness in a ridiculous fashion, mostly because the family is insane, in the best of ways.Every single actor in this really brings it too. There are plenty of notable names, but as much as Sandra Bullock elevates the quiet, reserved character of Lucy, there are so many other good actors and characters throughout the movie, it feels extremely balanced, despite all the different story angles happening.The other thing happening is that this is sort of a reverse mystery. Instead of information that other characters know being hidden from the audience to be revealed later, the audience is almost the only one to know the truth until aspects are slowly revealed to the rest of the cast.If you haven't see this yet, put it on your list, I promise it still holds up: even if there are no smart phones yet, you'll barely notice.",While You Were Sleeping
37,philip_vanderveken,"A perfect alternative for ""The Sound of Music""",7,6 September 2005,"Even though I'm not the biggest fan of romantic comedies, I do like to watch one occasionally. As long as they are at least somewhat original - which sometimes seems harder to find than you would like to believe - I really can have a good time with them. But for some reason I feared that this movie wouldn't belong to that category and that's why it took me almost ten years to finally watch it. Now that I did, I know that I shouldn't have waited that long.Lucy is already in love with Peter for a very long time. The only problem is that she has never really spoken to him and that he probably doesn't even know of her existence. He's a commuter to who she sells a ticket for the metro every day. When on Christmas Day he's attacked by some muggers, he falls on the rails and lies there unconscious. Lucy doesn't hesitate, but immediately goes after him and saves him from the oncoming train. Then he goes into a coma and is transported to hospital. And that's where all the problems start. The hospital staff confuses her for his fiancée, which they also tell to his family. They immediately welcome her into the family and Lucy, who isn't used to so much family happiness and warmth, isn't able to tell them that she and Peter haven't got a relationship. To make things even more complicated for her, Peter's brother falls in love with her and when Peter himself wakes up, he too believes that she is his fiancée...Even though the story feels a bit like all other romantic comedies, I must say that I like the new approach of a man in coma as the subject of affection. Even though he plays a very important role in this movie, his performance only consists of lying there with his eyes closed. And somehow that feels more OK than seeing yet another clumsy guy who is able to win the heart of the woman of his dreams. But not only the story is OK, so is the acting. Sandra Bullock, Jack Warden, Bill Pullman,... were nice to watch and even though Peter Gallagher didn't really have a difficult part, he too did a good job.I guess the only 'problem' that I had with this movie was that it was situated during Christmas time, while I saw it in the beginning of September. I'm not saying that I wasn't able to get completely involved in it, but somehow it felt a bit weird to see snow and to see them decorate the Christmas tree. That's also the reason why I believe that this is a perfect movie to play in that time period instead of THE Christmas classic: ""The Sound of Music"". You're already completely in the right mood then and I'm sure that such a movie would only add to that perfect feeling of family happiness. But than again, it's not that you can't watch this movie on another day either.All in all this is one of the better romantic comedies that I've seen lately. I had some good laughs with it, the romance was a bit weird but believable, the acting was good and the story original. What more can you expect from such a movie. Not much if you ask me and that's why I give it a well-deserved 7/10.",While You Were Sleeping
38,valadas,Such nice people,6,6 February 2003,"At the beginning this movie looks like another silly watery pseudoromantic one with that unplausible story of a girl saving a man of being killed by a train after having fallen to the railway line and then trying to pass for his fiancee in the eyes of his family while he is in the coma at the hospital. But as far as the plot develops itself we become conquered by the girls simple and naive behaviour and her display of nice sentiments. We become also conquered by the wonderful family of the man in the coma who are such nice people that make us also wish to have had a family like that. Well after little time the story changes direction and takes a somewhat predictable one which is mildly interesting to follow and which I won't reveal here of course. The end is also predictable but it will be dear to very romantic hearts. Well this is not a great movie because the story is too simple for that, the characters are merely sketched and there is no deep insight of minds and behaviours. But it will remind you of those old movies in which everyone was good and nice and there were neither villains nor violence of any kind.",While You Were Sleeping
39,MartianOctocretr5,"Great Cast, Fun Movie",9,18 February 2006,"This is an entertaining, feel-good romantic comedy featuring a wonderful cast that work together to perfection. Sandra Bullock does this kind of movie as well as anyone, and she has Bill Pullman, Peter Boyle, Jack Warden and others along for the silliness.The plot has a wild premise, but this great cast makes it work. The story navigates through constant misunderstandings between characters, driving the plot forward with more and more chaos ensuing as the movie progresses. Bullock and Pullman, as the lead characters Lucy and Jack, have both comedic and romantic chemistry. Everybody in the supporting cast is delightful in their roles, as well. Two of the most hilarious characters are Lucy's neighbor and Jack's great-aunt.Like any romantic comedy, sentimental moments are interspersed with the craziness. My personal favorite is when Lucy joins the Callaghan family for Christmas. The close-ups of her while Christmas music plays in the background, along with the family's banter, is endearing.It's a great popcorn movie, and a great date movie. Highly recommended for those who like romantic comedy and for Sandra Bullock fans.",While You Were Sleeping
40,RNMorton,Essential Bullock,8,21 August 2004,"Warm and gentle comedy that shows Bullock to her best advantage, in her favorite role of shy closet beauty. Bullock obsesses about a man she sees briefly every day; when he is knocked unconscious she claims to be his fiancée. Then sparks begin to fly with the brother. Wonderful turns by Boyle and Warden as older family members. There's a great line by Boyle in this movie, something like you always imagine you'll have these long golden moments in life and then when you get there it lasts about a minute. I think Bullock was never better than in this movie, in later productions her shy modesty seems a little artificial. She and Pullman have just enough chemistry together to pull this through.",While You Were Sleeping
41,jhclues,"""Ephronesque"" and Endearing",10,8 September 2002,"A sweet and gentle, romantic film about how love sometimes slips in through the window rather than coming straight in through the front door, it's the one that put star Sandra Bullock into contention with Meg Ryan for the crown of America's Sweetheart.  And with good reason, because in `While You Were Sleeping,' directed by Jon Turteltaub, Bullock emerges as the epitome of the modern day `girl next door,' in the best and most sincere sense.  This is a film that explores one of the basic tenets of the human condition, the need to love and be loved, and makes no bones about what it's trying to accomplish along the way.  Clearly, the filmmakers want to make you feel good and entertain you at the same time.  And they succeed on both fronts.Lucy Moderatz (Bullock) lives alone in Chicago, where she has an apartment, a cat and a job with the CTA as a token taker for the train.  Her life is fairly uncomplicated and uneventful (read:  Dull), and the one thing she looks forward to in her daily grind is seeing a certain young gentleman who rides the train everyday and always passes through her toll booth.  She's doesn't even know his name, and they've never exchanged so much as a `Good morning,' but in her mind he's become the Prince Charming she's always dreamed about.Then on Christmas morning he passes through, but while waiting on the platform for the train he gets mugged and falls onto the tracks, unconscious.  And a train is coming.  Lucy runs to his aid and saves his life, but the severe head trauma he's sustained has put him in a coma.  At the hospital, they refuse to let her in to see him, as that is a privilege reserved for family members only; so in desperation she tells them that she is his fiancee, which does the trick.  But when his family-- his rather `large' family-- shows up, her ruse creates something of a sticky wicket. Everything is moving so fast and becoming so emotional that Lucy simply can't get in a word of explanation.  The next thing she knows, to the family she is their beloved Peter's (Peter Gallagher) intended (even though he's never said a word to them about her), and because the situation is so frantic and there's such concern about Peter, besides which it's Christmas, Lucy can't bring herself to tell them the truth.  So in an instant, her life is suddenly changed; she's surrounded by `family,' and she's `engaged' to her Prince Charming.  Even if he is, well...in a coma.Turteltaub has crafted and delivered a thoroughly engaging film in the tradition of Nora Ephron's `You've Got Mail' (the second best romantic comedy ever made) and `Sleepless In Seattle.'  He sets a perfect pace, and presents his endearingly eclectic assemblage of characters in the best possible way-- he makes you feel at home with them.  Most importantly, though, Turteltaub manages to make this a `sweet' film without being `saccharin' about it, which would have sunk it quicker than a deflated rubber raft in an undertow.  Instead, he pulls out all the right stops to make his film entirely Ephronesque and entertaining, and it works beautifully.  The humor is warm, and as the story moves along he builds upon that strong sense of `need' that is universal, then triumphs by satisfying that need in the end.Sandra Bullock has never been more winning or winsome than she is here; there's a special quality about her Lucy that makes you want to reach out to her.  She is, without question, the most vulnerable character Bullock has ever played.  There is very little of Annie (`Speed') or Gracie (`Miss Congeniality'), for example, about her; the closest to Lucy of any of her characters, in fact, would be Birdee in `Hope Floats.'  That is not to say there is anything `weak' about Lucy at all-- quite the contrary, in fact. There is a decided strength in the very benevolence of Lucy's nature, even in the way she wears her heart on her sleeve and especially inasmuch as she is not afraid to admit to herself what she really wants and needs.  This is an independent woman who accepts and meets any and all challenges of life, but keeps an open mind and, above all, an open heart.  And that is what makes Lucy so endearing; she's the one who brings a cake to the office to share with her co-workers for no other reason than the fact that it makes the world and everybody in it a little bit better.  That's what Bullock brings to her performance here, and it's what makes Lucy one of her most enduring and memorable characters.As for sliding in through the window rather than coming through the front door, that's exactly what Bill Pullman does with his portrayal of Peter's brother, Jack Callaghan.  He's the one who shows up after the fact, as it were, but very quickly makes a connection and ingratiates himself with the audience.  Initially, Jack seems to be playing the role of devil's advocate, his suspicions aroused by the fact that Peter has never mentioned Lucy to him; but that begins to change with some very subtle undertones that prove to be extremely effective.  And Pullman does a terrific job of developing his character in real time, which makes Jack convincing, and a piece of the puzzle that fits in perfectly.  A `character actor' type leading man, Pullman has a resume filled with varied and colorful characters, but Jack is his most engaging role ever, and he succeeds entirely with it.
The wonderful supporting cast includes Jack Warden (Saul), Peter Boyle (Ox), Micole Mercurio (Midge), Michael Rispoli (Joey) and the wonderful Glynis Johns, as beautiful and charming as ever as Elsie.  Warm and poignant, `While You Were Sleeping' is one to savor; this one's a keeper.  (BTW, the #1 romantic comedy?  Bonnie Hunt's `Return To Me').  10/10.",While You Were Sleeping
42,Mister-6,Love and laughs...,9,9 February 2000,"This is such a good movie on so many levels that you can't help but fall in love with it.  ""While You Were Sleeping"" came out a little after ""Sleepless in Seattle"" but holds onto the same old-fashioned story of love, romance and starry nights while mixing them with sentiment, smiles and big laughs.  And there are lots of all of these qualities here.Sandra Bullock....  Ahh, is there any red-blooded American man who can help but fall for her?  She's beautiful and strong-willed and just as confused about love as the rest of us.  Here she plays Lucy, a single subway attendant whose only wish is to see the world... and to catch the attention of a handsome man (Gallagher) she takes a subway token from each every morning.Then, in circumstances too myriad to get into, he falls into a coma and everyone, including his family, believes Lucy is his fiancee.  Then, her lonely life is changed forever by her adopted family and by the ""Vegetable's"" brother (Pullman), who suspects something fishy is going on but doesn't let that get in the way of his feeling strongly for Lucy, too.The whole cast is strong right down the line, including Boyle, Warden, Johns, Bernard, Rispoli (who is hilarious) and even Walker as Gallagher's ex-girlfriend: who expected this kind of comedienne in TV's ""The Profiler""?As far as its comparisons to ""Sleepless"", it's justified to be sure, but for comedy quotient, ""Sleeping"" is the obvious winner.  Just watch when Gallagher comes out of his coma to see misunderstanding brought into a whole realm of comedic bravura all its own.Of course, true love wins out in the end and all is well with the world.  As if there were any doubt.  And Bullock becomes the love of every movie-going male's life.Nine stars for ""While You Were Sleeping"", for the incurable romantic in all of us who also likes a good laugh once in a while.",While You Were Sleeping

As her true identity couldn't be verified by anybody, everything seems to be well, until his brother shows up, whose character is about to play a very important role in the upcoming events.It's a lovely and romantic comedy, set in the heart of the winter holidays, which tells an improbable love story about two complete strangers who fall in love without their will and as much as they try to resist, as close they eventually become. It creates a warm and enjoyable atmosphere which lasts until the end. The actors play their roles very convincingly, making you care about their characters while keeping you eager to find out what will happen next and how it's going to end.

44,Atreyu_II,Romantic comedy with some charm,7,14 August 2007,"I am not really a fan of romantic comedies. I tend to find them lame most of the time. However, this one is not bad. There's something about this one that sets it apart from others of its genre. It isn't boring, lame or mushy stuff. This one is original, fresh, funny and romantic. Plus, it takes place at Christmas time. Actually, it captures the Christmas spirit and it shows us houses full of lovely Christmas decorations and lights.This movie is naturally more recommendable for those who like ""sugary"" stories or romantic stories and even for those who still believe in love. Yet, it is a reasonable choice for those who are unhappy in love or bitter about it.The soundtrack is quite good. One of the movie's best songs is Natalie Cole's oldie ""This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)"". The opening credits combine expressive and beautiful sights of Chicago with Natalie Cole's old classic.The actors are generally good and portray generally likable characters. Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman form a perfect couple and their chemistry is faultless. The rest of the cast is not bad too: Jack Warden, Peter Boyle, Jason Bernard (he's hilarious in this movie) and Glynis Johns (best known as Mrs. Banks from ""Mary Poppins""). The role of Lucy Eleanor Moderatz was originally for Demi Moore, but I'm glad that it went for the beautiful Sandra Bullock instead. Sandy is perfect for this role. I don't see Demi in this role.There are many funny moments during the movie, including a hilarious one with a newspaper's boy falling off his bike. Then again, the movie is, in general, fun and amusing, aside some ""humor"" of discussable taste.",While You Were Sleeping
45,Tito-8,Brilliant romantic comedy,10,31 March 1999,"First off, I can't believe that it has taken me so long to write something about this film, since it is EASILY my favourite romantic comedy of all-time, and one of the best films of any genre that I have ever seen.  I don't think that I've ever seen a film that I have liked so quickly and totally.  I mean, this film had me smiling less than a minute in, and I don't think that the smile ever left my face for the remainder of the picture.  I just found everything about this film to be completely irresistible, especially the devastatingly charming performance by Sandra Bullock.  In all fairness, the entire cast is great, but this is Bullock's film and no one else could have possibly done as great a job as she did. This film is undeniably formulaic and predictable, and yet, I loved it anyway.",While You Were Sleeping

After she saves his life she is mistaken for his fiancee as he lies in hospital unconscious. Suddenly luck finds herself in the welcoming Arms of the man's family and might be in love with Peters brother Jack in but when Peter wakes up lucy finds herself in the worst possible predicament of her life the acting is fun and story is charming please enjoy the film.,While You Were Sleeping
47,Bogmeister,A Sleepy Little Slice of Bullock,7,22 September 2005,"This was the picture which proved things could be all about Sandra Bullock. ""Speed"" - one year earlier - showed this. This picture proved it. A lot of people nowadays make fun of a typical Bullock picture and speak of her as negligible in this day and age. They probably forget or were never aware that she was hailed as America's new sweetheart back in '95 and it was no idle chatter. There are very few actresses who can carry a picture on their own slight shoulders - I mean, really make it a success. Sure, Bill Pullman helped, but this really was Sandra all the way, in a sappy, soapy, cliché-ridden slight story of sudden romance usually very hard to buy into. But because Sandra is there on the screen throughout nearly every frame, it all works out, and you're rooting for her happiness in the final few minutes even knowing very well what is about to happen. It's like you've seen it all before, but Sandra makes you want to see it again. We are all very fortunate, those of us who have seen this story, that it was Sandra in the central role and not someone like (shudder) Demi Moore. And if a guy is really fortunate, he may meet someone like Sandra in real life.",While You Were Sleeping
48,famousgir1,A Great Love Story!,4,14 July 2001,"Sandra Bullock stars in this great love story about 'love at second sight'. Sandra plays Lucy, a lonely woman who works at a train station. For a few weeks a certain customer comes to the train station, she doesn't know him or anything and they have never spoken before but Lucy has fallen for him in a big way. One day, on Christmas, Lucy has to work and her dream man, (Who's called Peter, by the way.) comes in and is suddenly attacked and then falls on to the train track, which leaves Lucy to save him. When he taken to hospital he is unconscious. The whole family then seem to think that Lucy is Peter's fiancé. Lucy can't bare to tell them the truth so the the rest of the film follows with everyone thinking Lucy is Peter's fiancé. When Lucy meets Jack though, (Peters brother.) he doesn't think Lucy is all she seems. While You Were Sleeping is a great and very funny film and Sandra Bullock is wonderful as usual. I give the film a 20/10.",While You Were Sleeping

50,Rammstein-2,Cheery and funny,6,7 September 2000,"Well...a funny film, cheery and warmhearted, but without any depth. And that's just what it's about. It is entertaining and sometimes very jolly - the scene where Peter sings the alphabet song to see if he really has amnesia, or the paper boy who falls on his bike.However, the probability that someone looking like Sandra Bullock works in a subway station booth and spends her life alone is very low indeed.",While You Were Sleeping
51,Didier-Becu,NEVER MIND THE BULLOCK,4,3 August 2003,"I hate romantic comedies, first of all they're not comic at all and secondly you just know that the girl will have her prince at the end. Am I the one to blame? Perhaps but certainly not in the case of this vehicle. Problems enough here... Sandra Bullock looks pretty but she can't act, how else would you explain that she only will be remembered for Speed. Bill Pullman has the same appeal as the role he plays....exactly a carpenter! And then the scenes... First of all do they miss all sense of reality...girl who works in the metro sees a rich advocate who's beaten, he fells on the rails (no signs of any danger to be electrocuted!) and Sandra Bullock pushes him in pure Indiana Jonesstyle on the other side. Well, we saw scenes who were more stupid but at the hospital, some nurse introduces madame Bullock as his financee because otherwise she has no right to visit her prince charming. Don't ask me why but I still decided to watch further, perhaps I was in for torturing myself as the story goes on and on and gets more ridiculous...at the time the poor man is in coma (which is a good thing as Peter Gallagher is one of the most horrifying actors to look at) the family believes it all and poor Sandra becomes part of the family. But not her so called brother in law as he starts investigating if she's the real financee or not and look what happens...Sandra Bullock falls in love with mister Pullman. Okay no further revealing from plots (well if they can be called like that anyway) but the movie gets sillier and boring (and knowing the start was already terrible). This can be perhaps the ultimate movie for desperate women who wanna have their dose of romantic but for chrissakes : get a life....",While You Were Sleeping
52,trpdean,Completely charming throughout; very often quite funny,10,28 May 2005,"Almost all of my favorite comedies were made in the 1930s or 1940s, but I adore this one. Some of the striking things: how well the plot continues to work after Peter Gallagher's character goes through a change; the real chemistry between Bill Pullman and the delightful Sandra Bullock; the wonderful acting by Peter Gallagher as someone who comes to realize he's really NOT had a good character in his life so far (he's charming while also discovering this dismaying truth).Most of all it's the modesty and naturalness of Sandra Bullock - as a poor, lonely, still missing her late father, terribly sweet yet never coy, completely lovable, utterly sympathetic. We are WITH her in every frame. We want her to gain everything her heart desires - and we really LIKE Bill Pullman too.It seems to me that any romantic comedy rests largely on how likable the characters are - we must completely sympathize with them, feel with them - they can have difficulty deciding between love/career or love/location or between two people -- but we can't have difficulty deciding whether we yearn for them to be happy.In some respects, Sandra Bullock does seem a throwback - I could easily imagine this movie taking place during the Depression - though it would be a role reversal (in screwball comedies - which this really isn't - the woman are wealthy and the men are poor).There's an innate decency in the character played by Sandra Bullock - in that respect, it reminds me of the somewhat more genteel characters played by Irene Dunne in comedies like The Awful Truth or My Favorite Wife or Penny Serenade - you are watching a genuinely kind and thoughtful person when you see the characters - and it draws you in. (It's why I find it hard to imagine that Demi Moore was originally slotted to play this character - she has a toughness of heart that I cannot imagine for this character).This movie was written so well that I looked to see what else the screenwriters had done - nothing is listed! You can't go wrong with this movie - one of the top several movie comedies in the last half century.",While You Were Sleeping
53,trpdean,"Very funny and heartfelt, utterly charming and sweepingly romantic",10,26 February 2018,"I love this movie - if you've ever wondered why comedies made in the 1930s or 1940s were far better than anything in more recent decades - it was really the writing. Well, this film is written as well or better than any comedy in the last half century - the overall plot is wonderful - the actors perfectly chosen - and all the small steps each character makes are entirely believable, consistent, revelatory of character, and gently leading - inevitably - to what a resolution viewer wants to see.This will stay in your mind - you'll want to see it over and over - you'll want to tell your friends - you'll want a sequel and a prequel. You'll want to remember each line of dialogue, to replay scenes, to make sure you have the quotations you tell your friends exactly right. 
 
Seldom mentioned in these reviews is also the beauty and feel for Chicago. It's underplayed - but there throughout - the Els, Lake Michigan, the Chicago River, the bridges and the skyscrapers and the lovely houses in the residential neighborhoods. Nothing is said about them - they're the background - but so well chosen. I would love to see a sequel - now 23 years after the film was made. Bullock and Pullman as a middle-aged married couple - Peter Gallagher's continued quest for the perfect woman, the sister Mary - and the reminiscence of the passing of the previous generation - of Boyle and Warden, Glynis Johns, and the others. The strange thing is that the two brilliant writers of this film seem hardly to have written ANY other film before or since!! Is it possible they used pseudonyms for this one? I would beg them to write a sequel for these characters. Don't doubt my review - this will become for you a beloved movie you'll never forget",While You Were Sleeping
54,macpherr,Bill Pullman and Sandra Bullock go together like a wink and a smile!,10,27 March 1999,"Lucy, Sandra Bullock (Hope Floats) works in the metro station in Chicago. Lucy is a really adorable character down to earth, nice. She has a platonic love for Peter, Peter Gallagher (To Gillian on her 37th Birthday), who comes every day to the train station every day. She knows nothing about this guy, except that he has a nice coat!  She has no family. Something happens and she ends up meeting his entire family and falling in love with the entire family, specially Jack, Bill Pullman, (Sleepless in Seattle, Casper). Jack is the nicest guy around. He instantly falls in love with Lucy. His face lights up when they meet. He glows like Annette Bening did in The American President. The chemistry between Pullman and Bullock is unbelievable. They should make more movies together! The family has this friend Saul, Jack Warden (Mighty Aphrodite + 97 other movies),  a guy that any family would like as family friend. He is like  part of the family. Michael Rispoli, plays Joe Fusco Jr., is the most lovable jerk you will ever meet! He is really good at this part. Ally Walker(The Profiler, Singles)  plays  Ashley and did a good job as wicked woman! My favorite scenes: the newspaper boy falling off  his bike; Lucy and Jack carrying the couch; Jack fainting as he donates blood; the family conversations at the dinner table such as: ""those mash potatoes are so creamy, Dustin Hoffman was 5'5""..., Jack likes brunettes, and Jack says: ""blonds,  chubby ones;"" the ""leaning"" conversation where Joe Fusco Jr., comes up say: ""that is leaning!"" Jack going to the train station and giving Lucy  ""a token"" to go inside the station. Overall this is a really enjoyable movie. This movie talks the language that women like and it is a great chick movie.",While You Were Sleeping

All names I liked to watch and still do. 3 out of the 4 have since passed.This movie showed the world who Sandra Bullock is, as if we didn't already know after Speed the year before.Some people probably find this movie a bit sappy, but for me it is a pick me up movie that I watch it regularly, along with a handful of other movies that just make the world a better place for a moment.An easy 8/10, and a must watch at least once.",While You Were Sleeping

57,ArizWldcat,Sandra Bullock shines,8,11 July 2005,"Sandra Bullock is at her best when playing this kind of character. She's lovable, vulnerable, and real. She seems like someone you'd know instead of an impossibly glamorous movie character. We own this DVD and watch it over and over again. The supporting cast shines as well; Peter Boyle, Micole Mercurio, Glynis Johns, Monica Keena, and Jack Warden make the Callaghan family so endearing that it's easy to see why Lucy (Bullock) would want to be part of it. Peter Gallagher is great as the self absorbed object of Lucy's affection.This isn't a movie that's deep or thought provoking; it's just a lot of fun and sweet. Another of those rare movies that you can watch with your family (there are a couple of questionable instances regarding breast enhancement and accident involving a pencil; the movie would not have missed them had they been omitted, but there is more good than bad here).",While You Were Sleeping

She plays Lucy, a lonely ticket sales girl at a railway station who falls for a passenger she has never met. One day she witnesses him being mugged and while he is lying unconscious she alerts the emergency services and is somehow mistaken as his fiancée, his family get involved and she still plays along with the lie, that is until his brother (Bill Pullman) becomes a little suspicious!.

Even though I'm not really a Sandra Bullock-fan, I thought she was pretty good and perfectly suitable for this role.""While you were sleeping"" is a fine romantic comedy, not as good as for instance ""Nothing Hill"", but much better as ""Alex and Emma"".

Compare While You Were Sleeping, for instance, with Must Like Dogs. While still hewing to the traditional rom-com plot arc, the latter has subtlety, wit, depth, and a delicate touch. While You Were Sleeping Does not.Everything about this movie is predictable, including Bullock's performance. It's interesting to see the earlier work of someone who's been in the business for over 15 years. In her case (as is the case with the bewilderingly overrated Julia Roberts), Bullock seems to have developed a set of pat reactions early on and not strayed too far from them.The only redeeming feature of this picture is that it's not *completely* insulting to our intelligence.

But then she falls for his brother..... whilst the brother seems quite hostile to her. A friend of the family who's guessed the truth promises to tell the family the truth but unfortunately he decides to meddle and instead persuades the accident victim when he's out of his coma to ask his saviour to marry him - the very last thing she wants now she's keen on his brother. The brother, attracted but completely confused, avoids the girl so she accepts the proposal. How this resolves itself I'd better not say.I felt the script was rather weak at times - the fencing between Bullock and the confused, attracted brother convinced this girl is a sponger could have been better and the actor is not I'd say entirely right for the part.

73,jehaccess6,Delightful Romantic Comedy.,8,25 October 2008,"Sandra Bullock has redeemed herself in my eyes. I watched part of 'The Net' in a theater, but walked out in disgust. She is much more appealing in this film, which I have watched repeatedly.The plot is somewhat thin underfoot, but the cast overcomes this with some of the greatest efforts I have ever seen. Sandra is luminous as Lucy Moderatz, a woman who has suffered a great deal of loss in her life and seems doomed to a lonely life alone. Lucy eases her heartache by dreaming about wedding the handsome man who buys a token at her booth every weekday morning.When an improbable collection of circumstances result in Lucy being accepted as the fiancée of her dream man who is in a coma and in no condition to refute her claim; she gains the warm, loving family she has so long desired. Lucy makes such an instantly positive impression on the family of her supposed fiancée, they are delighted to make her part of the family. When her 'fiancee' wakes from his coma and fails to recognize Lucy, the family covers the gap by presuming amnesia rather than suspecting some subterfuge on the part of Lucy.I enjoyed many parts of this film. The best part was where the family gathered to exchange Christmas presents. Lucy had her name on a stocking and a present from Santa. The look on Lucy's face as she savored these moments was priceless. The next morning, Lucy meets Jack her 'fiancee's' brother and sparks immediately fly.This film really illustrated how deprived Lucy has been. When she needs personal advice, she has to rely on her boss at work. Basically, her fellow workers and her would-be boyfriend at her apartment complex are her only human contact. It would seem logical that Lucy would join a church or find some other social outlet.All the supporting cast is great here. The performers fit into their roles perfectly. Bill Pullman and Sandra Bullock really bring their characters to life. You find yourself rooting for the inevitable victory of true love over circumstances.This is movie entertains without the need to appeal to the baser instincts. It was grand to see an intact, functional family for once. We need more efforts like this to show that a great movie can be made using wholesome themes.",While You Were Sleeping
74,tallguy62,"Fabulous, Thoughtful, Engaging and Funny",10,9 July 2007,"This is the film that really made Sandra Bullock a star. I believe Speed came out just before and it got her noticed, but this was the movie that really made her career. It is too bad she has had nothing quite as good as this since.The dialog in this film is extremely clever. The humor and the musical soundtrack are perfectly orchestrated with each other. It is true that the family that Sandra's character meets is rather silly -- but they are SO endearing, it is impossible not to appreciate them. Glynis Johns and Peter Boyle -- what great character actors they have been over the years. They were delightful.Sandra's character sneaking to the back entrance of her Chicago apartment to avoid her scrungy, icky neighbor; her accidentally letting the Christmas tree fall out of the window; the music at the party stopping at a VERY inopportune moment for Bill Pullman; Sandra's character saying hello to her ""boyfriend's"" cat for the first time; there are several comic moments in this movie too numerous to mention.What ties the whole movie together is, however, the thoughtful parts of the script. Sandra's character is lonely and for some reason, it comes across as being very human; many of us can relate to her, and that is why I suspect that this film was held over in theatres for as long as it was. I saw it 5 times in the actual theatre and enjoyed it all 5 times. She wanted a family for Christmas and not to be alone. I know this sounds so cheesy, but it is portrayed brilliantly. Hats off to the marvelous people who wrote this screenplay. They know their craft well.It is EXTREMELY sad that Richard Roeper has bad-mouthed this movie as an ""obnoxious"" Chicago movie. Nothing could be further than the truth. There are MANY obnoxious movies set in Chicago, but this is definitely NOT one of them.GREAT SCRIPT, GREAT SOUNDTRACK, GREAT MOVIE.

I do study film and film history, as a hobby. I had never watched this movie until today. It had high ratings and I thought I would give it a whirl.Oh dear...this is very formulaic, very predictable stuff. Do you really believe that someone who looks like Sandra Bullock and is nice to boot, would be stuck with that boring job, if she wanted something else? Would she really be alone with a cat? No one dating her, no close girlfriends even? It is hard to believe.Sandra's character is dishonest throughout almost the entire film. Even if you get past THAT, the family that takes to her under her false pretense is a vehicle for comical facial expressions and punchlines. The family members do not seem like real people and the son's crisis with his dad is solved in two seconds. Trouble is, the writer of the father-son scene is NOT Neil Simon. At the end, Sandra declares her love for the Bill Pullman character who is in love with her, too. He just lets her walk out of the aborted wedding service? Like, you dont know if he will want her after she has lied to everyone? of course you know! In fact, there is nothing surprising in this whole movie. I guess I have just seen too many good romcoms. Clever, witty, edgy, not totally predictable. A far better romcom is Sunday in New York for example. Another one is Pillow Talk. I didn't find ""Sleeping"" funny, just trite, all formula.

80,MicheBel,Swooner Set in Chicago,10,20 January 1999,"The casting director for this film deserves a medal. Every single actor in it is perfect.  Who could imagine a better handsome, clueless rich guy than Peter Gallagher? Or his equally handsome and very sexy brother Bill Pullman? And America's Sweetheart, Sandra Bullock, in her finest moment so far, makes every line believable. Even that falling on ice bit... Everyone in the supporting cast is great. And memorable. The shots of Chicago are incredible--it's quite possibly my favorite Chicago movie. True love, of course, conquers all. All right, everybody swoon...",While You Were Sleeping
81,Caledonia Twin #1,Guaranteed to chase away the blues,9,31 January 2001,"This film could easily be recommended as an over-the counter prescription against depression!  It is quite simply charming.  Before I saw it, I admit I was not the greatest Sandra Bullock fan; ten minutes into the film, I had more than changed my mind and made a complete 180 degree turn in my opinion of her.  Sandra Bullock is truly endearing in this hilarious case of mistaken identity romantic-comedy; it's easy to see how she has become a household name after it--there is really something fresh, sincere, and approachable but also compellingly vulnerable about her character Lucy Eleanor Moderatz.  Yet we cannot help but admire her integrity, her battle of conscience against continuing to deceive Peter's family, and wonder--""Why *should* she be lonely?  Why is it so wrong what she's doing, since she's clearly come to love this family?""  The interesting, unusual view of a typical Chicago winter and delightfully quirky writing in ""While You were Sleeping"" as well as the fine performances of the supporting cast, are also an integral part of the overall success of this film.  Bill Pullman's character Jack, the hard-working Everyman, is not presented in a patronising light, and I found this ordinary hero refreshing.  So many more patrician films tend to praise the likes of his elder brother, the highly successful, power/wealth-driven businessman Peter, and portray the hard-working everyman as nothing more than a crass boor with few, or with obscure ambitions. Moreover, Sandra's portrayal of the sweet but unglamorous, next-door girl turned heroine Lucy, shines among a plethora of more common female performances in films (such as ""Pretty Woman"") which more directly resort to an overt Cinderella storyline.  ""While You Were Sleeping"" is among the best romantic-comedies of all time.  Anyone with a sense of humor could not be disappointed by it.  My rating: at least a 9/10",While You Were Sleeping

If I could figure out a way to contact the hair stylist,Eliana P. Shulman, I would ask her if she would tell me why 'Lucy' was made to look so shabby, when the story line presented her situation with perfect clarity.Look at her apartment. It is very well-decorated, and has wonderful hues. There is no way that 'Lucy' would leave the apartment house looking as she does. For that matter, the other employees of the Chicago Transit Authority would have ragged her about making THEM look bad. Very very peculiar.",While You Were Sleeping
83,Seersha1,Fun and enjoyable and lovely,6,8 June 2010,"I have often wondered why Bill Pullman didn't become a bigger star than he is. He's played the romantic interest in a few films, starring opposite two of the romcom queens – Meg Ryan and Sandra Bullock. He was even great in Independence Day. And he is great in this film too, with enough charm and likability for viewers to understand why it is Lucy falls in love with his character. Sandra Bullock does well in her role, too. It's not an outstanding performance, but as an actress and person she is so likable that really all that matters is that she's cute and easy to watch on screen.

84,Petunia-2,Bullock becomes America's Sweetheart,8,10 October 1999,"""While You Were Sleeping"" was the movie where Sandra Bullock stole the tiara of America's Sweetheart from Julia Roberts' head.  America fell in love with Bullock who portrayed Lucy, a young woman, orphaned and alone in the world. She works at the rail station, taking tokens from the commuters, one of whom is Peter Gallagher (Peter Callaghan).  Seeing Peter enter the turnstile each day, Lucy develops a crush but is too shy to even speak to him.  Lovingly watching him one day, she witnesses Peter being mugged and she heroically saves his life.  Accompanying him to the hospital, she is mistaken by a nurse as his fiancee.  When his family, the Callaghans (each actor in this ensemble was absolutely loveable), burst into the hospital room, it is obvious that they don't see comotose Peter (a highly successful professional in the big city) often and they eagerly believe that Lucy is Peter's fiancee.  When Lucy tries to protest, then witnesses Peter's grandmother having a ""weak heart"" spell, she goes along with the lie.This is a heart-warming story that your entire family will love.  Bullock is so lonely yet so adorable, that you want with all your heart for her to marry into the wonderful Callaghan family.  Will her mistaken identity be revealed?  I won't tell you but I will tell you that this movie, with a Christmas-time setting, has joined my collection of videotapes that I pop in the VCR for family on Christmas day, along with ""A Christmas Story,"" ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" etc.",While You Were Sleeping

I wish I could come up with a new complement to describe Sandra,but; they have all been used. I believe what you see is what you get. Oh sure I'm sure she has her bad days and her crabby times. We all do. If she isn't the sweetest lady to hit the big screen I'd like to know who it is? When Saul says ""you jumped on the tracks."" I lose it for a moment every time I see it. This has to the best romance/comedy of all times. One would have to feel sorry for Jack. When he first meets Lucy she bats her eye lashes at him. Doesn't he know what that means? Then she tells Jack she doesn't have anyone. Hint hint. At the dinner she gives him the ""I love you look."" He still doesn't wake up. Then she asks him if he can give her a reason not to marry his brother. This guy is nice but dense. Oh well somehow he wins Lucy at the end. Who would have thought?",While You Were Sleeping

You'll love the family dynamics. The loving mom, sassy, yet endearing grandmother. The loudmouth, yet caring and protective dad.

I am 68 years old and this story takes me back when I was in my 20's and 30's. I watch this movie every day, when I have time. Jack Warden is a wonderful actor. ""Jack"" is the very best! I can't say enough about him. He is romantic, funny, good looking, ( he is the age of my oldest daughter). The story he tells ""Lucy"" about what leaning means is so impressive I could cry. No other actor could have put it over as well. I think he must be a very underrated actor, because I never hear anything about him. I am going to check out the names of the Mother, I know Peter Boyle is the Father, the sister is wonderful. The actor who played Joe Jr. is excellent. I have never seen him before.

The brilliant comedic timing of the ensemble cast. The chemistry of the lead characters. The lovely background score which adds greatly to the feel of the film. ""While You Were Sleeping"" was an instant hit at the box office and remains an absolute classic 25 years later. I was shocked it only had a 6.7 rating on IMDb as ONLY a rating of 9 or 10 would be appropriate. Also in reading the trivia section I could not envision any of the other actors playing Lucy... Sandy Bullock was the perfect actress for this story, and this was the vehicle (pun intended as others think it's ""Speed"") that truly propelled her to super stardom.

96,FlorianSchirner,A great romantic comedy which is underrated,7,2 June 2008,"The genre of romantic comedies may not be a genre producing depthful insights, dramatic acting or meaningful morals....but it centers about the two most warm and nice emotions, humour and love. There can't be nothing wrong with this. Now many movies of this genre are just what you expect, they are cheesy, diabetes-inducing sweet, shallow movies. Sometimes the Humour outweighs the love so much it becomes intolerable, sometimes the love aspect is so heavy you are forced to vomit. Then many movies make the mistake of mixing love with lust or even replacing them. That does not go for romantic in my opinion. So the moviegoer is left with only a few notable movies, which make your heart glow: There are PRETTY WOMAN, NOTTING HILL, WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, YOU GOT MAIL, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and of course WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING.Unlike some others in my listing, this movie sets his characters in a real normal life. They are all average people, who could live next your door. That's one point in making this movie memorable. Because if such a sweet love can happen to those guys, it can happen to you as well.The story may seem to be a bit far fetched (girl saves guy, gets mistaken for his fiancé, family invites her over for Christmas, she falls in love with the brother and so on) but it is not as far fetched as a millionaire falling for a prostitute, a journalist falling for just a boys story and drives through the US to Seattle or a movie star just walking in a normal bookstore...The humour is great, soft and loving instead of cynical. The only cynical remark (if you fit in my pants, I'll kill myself) is like you are kidding around with your friends. The love is also sweet. It never becomes sexual or lust-laden. Just pure love. Unlike all the aforementioned movies, here another love is playing a role, the love for and of a family. Anyone who, like Bullock's character, has lived without any family for some time knows what I speak of.The acting is good. Not great, as I said i don't expect that in a romantic comedy, but better than in most other movies of that genre (and many other genres as well).The last great point for this movie are the characters. The movie makes no point in creating a despicable, mean character. The family Callaghan are so nice and warm, even Peter (who the viewer gets to know only a lot later in the movie) seems to be able to leave his playboy life and settle with Sandra Bullock. Also heartwarming is the role of Joey Fusco. He seems to really love Sandra Bullock in his own way. He tries to protect her and be a real friend, though he is obviously not her type. Even the ""real"" fiancé of Peter Callaghan, Ashley, does not come evil just shallow and possessive. Her appearance lasts only a few minutes, too.All in all, if you're looking for a great movie to make you feel good, get this one.",While You Were Sleeping

I don't think it would work if it were in reverse.  Maybe if they make a few changes, it might.  Two sisters instead of two brothers?  What do you think?Anyway, since watching this film four years ago, and many times since then, I try to equate every romantic comedy I watch with this film.  Nothing could ever surpass it, in my opinion.  The nearest one is ONLY YOU starring Robert Downey, Jr. and Marisa Tomei, and a distant third is MRS. WINTERBOURNE, starring Ricki Lake, Brendan Fraser, and Shirley Maclaine.  Another one would be THE CUTTING EDGE, starring D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly.  So far, not even HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN TEN DAYS, MAID IN MANHATTAN, and even PRETTY WOMAN can come close.  I've yet to find the next best romantic comedy.It's a good thing the Mr. LeBow and Mr. Sullivan took five long years to write this screenplay.  No wonder it became a hit, because they thought about it carefully.Bill Pullman is wonderful in this film!  I would love to see him so more romantic comedies in the future.  He has great comedic timing.  And Jason Bernard, who played Jerry, Lucy's supervisor, was unbelievably hilarious! It's too bad he has already died.  He was a great talent.  I love the eccentric Callahan family, and the crazy neighbor (Joe Fusco, Jr.)  I would love to see a sequel (though, that's unlikely). I would love to know what has become of Lucy and Jack and Peter and even Ashley.I can't wait to see this film again.

113,ivona021,Bullman & Pullock are treat gogether,8,25 January 2005,"This is a very enjoyable movie from start to end. Even the cliché'd parts are cute. I might be childish but I do like the message -- dream men are sometimes very shallow and clueless, and their less charismatic, less perfect brothers (or friends or neighbors) are oftentimes much, much more inspiring once you get to know them. Fortunately for girls, the handsome clueless bunch usually spends a lot of time sleeping or otherwise misplacing or misdirecting their charms.The movie relies on a silly premise that a good-natured lie won't be discovered, and when discovered, it won't be ridiculed. However, this premise is treated fairly. The viewer doesn't feel stupid, as the lead character, Lucy, has a silly idea which leads her to the silly lie; so it isn't only the audience who is duped -- the audience is just asked to engage in Lucy's silly idea, and explore it as if it was just a dream. And at the end, it's all good for real - since Lucy doesn't need her silly idea anymore, you feel relieved of the whole silly premise.There is plenty of chemistry between lead characters which makes the romance believable.Who is this movie for?

And while I'm sure they have done bigger things, I am so grateful that they leave this great movie behind so we can enjoy them together in such a heart warming movie. Every person in this movie is just so lovable and endearing. Granted, there's nothing here to be taken seriously, but that's okay. It's sappy, Hallmark-y, only slightly plausible, and highly unlikely that everything would align so comically in real life, but it's a quirky comfy, warm and fuzzy escape for just under two hours with a family you will fall in love with. And I wouldn't have replaced a single actor anywhere in it.",While You Were Sleeping

Yet they did a wonderful job of making this believable. The chemistry is amazing between Sandra and Bill Pullman. Peter Boyle was perfect. I liked him so much in this role; he was lovable and has some lines in this movie that were memorable. The scene at Mass was so funny.I now watch this every Christmas. It is romantic, warm and funny. The family was kind, silly and loving toward one another. Lucy sees the value of family and the film does a great job of relaying this to the audience. It will make you feel warm and tender about those you love, and you will smile.The music is classic! It fits the story perfectly.I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!",While You Were Sleeping

Of course, the performances of both Pullman and Bullock are great. However, after a couple of times of watching this movie, I notice more details, like the music. The next time you watch this film, try listening for the music score: music sometimes tells you more than the actors on your screen. The music to this movie is humor itself and reflects the atmosphere (the tensions between the main characters, the misunderstandings, etc.) very well!",While You Were Sleeping

She could make an hour and a half long video of herself trying on different outfits and I would buy it in a heartbeat! While You Were Sleeping is Sandra at her sweetest and loveliest! It has become one of my favorite Christmas movies. I didn't care for Bill Pullman in his roll as the brother/love interest. Pullman makes a great clown, as in Ruthless People but should leave more serious roles alone. I think it's that silly toothless grin of his- he comes off too uptight. The hardest thing to believe about this movie is that Sandra wouldn't have anyone in her life! I could maybe imagine her working in a token booth. I've known other attractive women in real life who take on jobs that might be considered beneath them. She explains in the movie that she had to drop out of school when her father got sick and go to work for the Transit Authority. It just makes her more human and obtainable which I find irresistible!",While You Were Sleeping

Of all the actresses in the world... Demi Moore???  She shed her innocence & sweetness when she made movies like ""One Night Stand"" (is it the correct title?) with Rob Lowe.  It's like seeing Rosanne Barr/Arnold as Lucy in this film.Great comical timing between Sandra & Bill.  The scene where they walk back to Lucy's apartment is especially brightens your day.  Of course, who can forget the whole Callaghan clan?  It's rare to see such a close-knitted family in US anymore.  It's heart-warming & touching & sweet & lovely & just terrific.This movie reminds me not to fall in love with a person just because of the looks.  Lucy was ready to marry Peter but didn't know that he was so self-obsessive (all HIS pictures in his wallet & home) and who would hurt squirrels & save them?  I'm on Jack's side when I say ""ye-wo"".  Look at the soft spoken, sweet Jack who puts family first (remember his rocking chair?) & is more down-to-earth.Agreeing with the rest of the audience here who had posted their comments, this is THE movie to see when you're feeling a little blue, a little lonely, or just want to get out of reality for a few hours.Well, I'll be waiting for my Jack Callaghan now.  Wish you all enjoy the movie experience.",While You Were Sleeping
122,benraddon87,"Hey Luc, nice...sweater.",2,27 November 2018,"This is a really annoying and tedious movie, from the characters to the soundtrack, it's so typically 90s. So many moments that made me cringe in this movie. That short, annoying piano score which constantly plays through the movie, ugh.The plot is fairly original but also frustrating, as it revolves the whole family (who are one of the most annoying families in a movie or TV show period) not knowing that one of their sons, is in a coma through most of the movies runtime, and is already engaged to a woman who is pretty much a mystery, you don't really care about her, and because of one thing overheard by a nurse but misinterpreted, the character Lucy played by Sandra Bullock has to deal with being pushed into their nuthouse. The funny thing is, all Lucy has to do is tell them it's all a big misunderstanding, and we could have avoided all the frustrating stupidity that happens after. Why doesn't she tell them it's a misunderstanding? It's simple, because then we wouldn't have this dumb American movie.Also, because she doesn't bother to tell them about the misunderstanding, she almost ends up marrying a guy she doesn't even know because she doesn't say anything, and because of infatuation, also because the dumb family push them together. Oh, and she's also fallen for the other brother by the time the (horrible) and unromantic wedding comes. Honestly, even if you were attracted to someone, if you didn't know them at all, would you let others keep thinking you're engaged to them because of a misunderstanding, or would you think 'I should probably tell them what's really going on before this gets out of hand?' I know it's just a movie but come on.Sandra plays her usual and typical character in this. As for the side character Joe Jr (seriously, they couldn't give him a better name?) who also keeps trying to get Lucy's attention, poorly I might add 'Hey Luc, nice... sweater.' That's where I facepalm, he tries too hard to be cool but fails miserably. As for the families annoying teen who tells the family some major news about Lucy which isn't true because she doesn't get her facts straight first, well she's a typical and annoying teen. Despite a few sweet moments, this isn't a very good movie. This is a movie which hasn't improved with age. Also a movie that shows infatuation isn't smart.I'm not against romantic movies, but at least make the script good and give me characters who don't make me want to shoot myself.",While You Were Sleeping

The dialogue is witty, Sandra and Bill are sooooo sweet together and the best thing is that even after watching it over and over again, you don't get bored of it!!A great movie to watch with those you love - it makes you think about family - and especially good during holidays or when you are feeling down.

I've seen this movie twenty times, so I obviously love it. Generally I save it for rainy Sunday afternoons. Sandra Bullock is at her most adorable and there are some scenes where you just want to jump into the screen and hug her. The support cast is great (don't you hate it when some small role is so badly acted that you loose your thread in the movie) and the plot is simple, if predictable (as it should be in a romantic comedy). What I love about this film is that it doesn't clog up the plot with unfaithfulness and over the top gross hummer. It's all nice and sweet and simple, and you just want the girl to get the guy.

The main character, Lucy, is a lonely, dreaming romantic, with whom I can easily relate. The Callaghan family, which she is suddenly and rapidly becoming a part of, is portrayed as the very opposite, though in a warm and loving manner. Maybe that is what appeals most to me in this movie; the romantic dream becomes a wish for a caring environment rather than for a perfect life.Watching this movie, one may find it unrealistic that a person as likeable as Lucy would ever need to be lonely, but the truth is that there are lots of real people just as likeable and just as lonely. This movie may give some hope.",While You Were Sleeping

134,ic_kewl,Not only am I in love with Jack Callaghan...,10,22 November 2015,"but I am in love with the movie.I'm kicking myself for watching this movie just recently. I was quite young when this movie was first released but that is not an excuse for overseeing this movie for so long. I am so glad I watched it. And I'm going to keep watching it over and over...I am a sucker for romantic comedies and a lot of them are disappointing. It's very rare to fall in love with a movie, and 'while you were sleeping' has that effect on me. The key to the Lucy and Jack's romance is chemistry, and boy did they have chemistry. The element to a great story, whether it is reading or watching is to show not tell. And that's what exactly what it was. The looks that you see Jack and Lucy give each other, their body language, the deep conversations they have, the way he describes her, and how she's head over heels for him. The tension they create when put together wasn't anything sexual; it was something much, much deeper. Something that will last a lifetime. The other key factors to this movie are the Callaghans and Saul, and everyone else. They bring out the comedy side to the movie. They are a hilarious bunch, and are not a tad annoying, not even the real fiancée or Peter; just really, really funny and fun to be with.Put two and two together, and they have formulated an almost perfect Romantic Comedy.

Very well acted by all that were involved, especially Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman. At the ending of the film i almost shed a tear with happiness.

For all the new-in-love couples I will say- run to the nearest video-shop and rent it now!This is in my eyes the best movie-performance Sandra Bullock ever have done. I don`t love any other movies she has acted in. No. Bill Pullman also do a great performance in the film as the man she fall in love in at second sight...:)For the people who don`t like this film I will say..It`s okay, not everyone can be romantic, because if you doesn`t feel anything while you`re watching the film you can not be a romantic person.

( ""a,b,c,d,e,f,g.."" he tries to find out whether he lost his memory or not) That's one line, that popped into my head. When you look at this film, you feel the 'love' that is growing between Sandra and Bills characters. Their charisma is sparkling together!

Maybe the negative reviews are further down... but what's not to like?

However, I (and my wife) found that the script simply lacked humour, using contrivance to make any progress (the ice scene is pure klutz) while potential resolutions or critical events were chopped or ignored as if the audience were expected to have its collective brain in neutral. Of the main characters not even the mostly comatose Peter seemed plausible in his role. Even the ""other woman"" was eventually rendered silly and pointless by the scriptwriter despite a promising start and enthusiastic approach by Ally Walker.Perhaps Julia Roberts should have taken this role and brought her scriptwriter with her. Her lightest comedies such as Runaway Bride are still better than this. I would not see this movie again nor recommend it but then, it will probably do you no great harm to see it for yourself when at least you can make up your own mind.

And especially after watching it more than 3 times, the jokes are really naturally put and better understood and makes the show even more worth watching. This movie must be watched.

She falls in love with a man (Peter) who she has never even spoken to but who she sees everyday waiting for a tube on the Loop.  He falls, she saves his life, and the nurse at the hospital gets confused and thinks that Lucy (Bullock) is his fiancee.  All through you keep thinking 'why on earth would she fall for a man like Peter in the first place especially when you see his brother Jack who is just sooo lovely'.But it all turns out well in the end when Lucy (Bullock) admits at her wedding to Peter that she can't marry him as she is in love with Jack (Pullman) who in turn is also in love with her.",While You Were Sleeping

The actors breath life into the characters to the point you could almost believe they are real.  For someone who doesn't like admitting to liking romances, this is perfect.  It has just the right blend of comedy and romance.  Peter Gallagher even does as much with his character, the mostly unconscious brother, as possible and the small appearances of Ally Walker as Ashleigh give the movie what it needs to seem believable.So, forget reality for a couple of hours and watch this movie on a lonely day.",While You Were Sleeping

Although a simple romantic comedy, it's set against the backdrop of THE  HUMAN CONDITION (loss of a loved one which happens to everybody) and shows the triumph of the indomitable HUMAN SPIRIT (portraying people who not only can but do cope).

159,DVD-Justin,The perfect holiday movie,10,25 October 2001,"Sandra Bullock stars in what must be the perfect winter holiday movie of our time, While You Were Sleeping. With some great laughs and an adorable storyline Sandra and Bill Pullman pull off one heck of a combined performance. I was also in tears near the end when it got more emotional, and the GF was getting a little misty as well. Great movie, that's all i can say. I would without hesitation recommend this film to anyone.",While You Were Sleeping
160,Texasextra,A wonderful film!,9,31 December 2002,"I love this movie!  It is my absolute favorite and my family's favorite too.  We watch it at least three times a year, especially at Christmas time. I laugh and cry every time I see it.  While many people quote Austin Powers and Tommy Boy, my sisters and I quote this movie (""Nice . . . sweater,"" ""Know her? I'm dating her"")  But all personal bias aside, the thing that makes this movie so enjoyable and memorable (and something that other moviemakers should consider) is the development of all of the supporting characters.  From the paper boy who falls off his bicycle (which many movies copied after this one) to the snotty hot dog vender to the sweet well-intentioned nurse--each adds something to the plot, to the main characters and to the overall humor.  Many of the funniest lines are said by minor characters (the hotel doorman, Joe jr., Peter's hospital room buddy). I look for this in other movies and don't see it much these days. Jon Turtletaub is a wonderful director.  Another one of my favorite movies that he directed is Disney's The Kid, which also has some great supporting roles.  I recommend that one too. This is Sandra at her best.  See this movie!",While You Were Sleeping
161,e_jessika,MY FAVORITE SCENE,10,10 July 2003,"I just love the scene when she's about to marry Peter and after she objects. How much do you just love when she says, ""I'm in love with your son...not that one...That one..."" She looks so adorable when she kind of curtsies as she points around Peter to Jack! I just Love, Love, Love that scene and the adorable look on Jack's face upon hearing her words, too! It's got to my in my top three of Best Romantic Movies Of ALL Time!! :):) Hey, but maybe I'm partial. I love Sandra Bullock and I love Bill Pullman, too:):)",While You Were Sleeping
162,sanjecards,My Favorite Movie,10,29 June 2004,"This is my favorite movie EVER. I can see it over and over and I still laugh my ass off. The table scene where they have 10 conversations about one thing going on is just hilarious. The parents are sweet and yet they are just insanely funny! It also has a great love story and family storyline. Watching this movie warms my heart. I know I'm just a wimp but I cried when Bill Pullman gave Sandra Bullock the snowglobe. The landlords son is great too. I love the ""leaning"" story. There are so many things in this movie that we used in our conversations for years after seeing it. These mashed potatoes are so creamy. I don't drink any less either.",While You Were Sleeping
163,bults-356-93740,Semi parody of the genre that moves at a cracking pace,8,14 December 2013,"Despite the opening song number being one of my own personal pet peeves, this is one of my favorite films. It is a genius parody of the romantic comedy genre that plays with your expectations. Now, this film has almost as many holes as the Dark Knight Rises, and more coincidences than the complete works of Charles Dickens, but the likable characters and the spot on comedic timing more than make up for any and all failings.This film looks at all the tropes and clichés of chick flicks and exploits them for well earned laughs, including one of the funniest breakup scenes of all time. All the humor lands perfectly and hits its mark. The only problem I can find would be the product placement. Dunkin Donuts, bringing families together for years, America runs on Dunkin.All in all, its an enjoyable film that will play around with your expectations and moves along at a perfect pace. This is a film you can just pop in and watch any time, you could watch it multiple times in a row without ever getting tired of it. The problem though, and the reason, I believe, for the 6.5 rating, is that people go in expecting a straight romantic comedy and see only the film's weaker aspects. I say, take a look.",While You Were Sleeping

165,lilaamoi,"Lovely, feel-good underrated Rom Com",8,4 November 2015,"Let's make it clear, this is a pure rom-com. But a cleaver, funny and not too sweet one. I watched it by ""accident"" and because I like Sandra Bullock. It is really nice, well written and with great supporting actors. The main character (Bullock) works in public transport, has no family and is secretly in love with one the customers she sees daily at work. When she saves his life after he fell on the track one day, she goes to the hospital to get some news; she gets to meet the family, which has some hilarious characters, and kind of gets adopted by them while her love interest is in the coma (""while (he) was sleeping"") Nothing philosophical. It just makes you feel good, and that is already a lot.",While You Were Sleeping
166,usted_no_me_puede_ver,The Only Movie I've Liked Sandra Bullock In!,10,8 January 2006,"Okay, I can't stand Sandra Bullock but I could watch this movie a hundred times. I own it. It is romantic and hilarious. The Callahan family is so funny! It's non stop laughter from start to finish. Plus it adds in a little ""moral of the story"" about living what you dream and how family is so important. A must-see for the hopeless romantic. Basically, the story goes like this: On Christams morning, Lucy (a family-less woman) saves a stranger's life, but he still winds up in a coma in the hospital. The hospital staff won't let Lucy see him since she's not family. So by some strange misunderstanding, word gets around to the doctors that she is this man's fiancé, even though she's never spoken to the guy before! She stays by his side in the hospital and is accidentally introduced to his whole family as his fiancé. And that's just the first 15 minutes or so of the movie! And that's where the real fun begins! As for the rest of the story... you'll have to see for yourself!",While You Were Sleeping
167,minrinshin,I love this movie!,8,12 October 2019,The storyline is quite predictable but I can actually enjoy the movie. I feel warm just by watching this movie hahahaha. This is really a good movie to watch with your family or significant other.,While You Were Sleeping
168,kran,Gets better each time!,9,4 August 1999,"I just saw this movie again, and I still love it. Sure, its ending is predictable like almost any other Hollywood romantic movie, and the Callagher family is a little too idyllic, but that's where any similarities to other movies in this genre cease. In themselves, all of the characters are believable and fun, and the chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman is unique. Michael Rispoli's performance is also commendable. He manages to make the Joe Jr. character very funny and at the same time lovable. There are countless scenes in this movie that makes it suitable to be seen over and over again. The plot, the lines, the atmosphere... It's a ""feel good"" movie, and I give this movie my best recommendations.",While You Were Sleeping
169,Riograce,"A grin-from-ear-to-ear, hug-yourself movie!",9,13 February 1999,"This is a great movie to watch when you're feeling low.  It's fun to watch Lucy and Jack slowly fall for each other while trying to do the right thing by poor Peter, the comatose ""fiance.""  I'll just add that if you're looking for a movie to watch with your mom and dad, this is it!  No embarrassing sex scenes or unnecessary vulgar language, and it *still* manages to be a great time at the movies.  Now fancy that: a clean movie that entertains!  _While You Were Sleeping_ restores my faith in moviemakers.  :-)",While You Were Sleeping

I think that Sandra Bullock is wonderful, as is Bill Pullman.  The ending was a little predictable, but I don't care.  I think it is great because it makes me feel good about myself when I have watched it.",While You Were Sleeping
171,MCL543,My all-time favorite!,10,2 August 1999,"While You Were Sleeping is my all-time favorite movie!  Sandra Bullock was perfect for the role of Lucy, the endearing character whose confession at the wedding makes me cry every time I see it.  The whole cast really brought the charactes to life and made it easy to feel the emotions they display. I love the way Lucy begins the story by telling us of her one true love and ends the story by telling us,""Thank goodness my father was right.  Things don't always turn out the way you plan.""  She had planned on Peter, but Jack was the only one for her!  He gave her the one gift she wanted so badly---a stamp on her passport!",While You Were Sleeping

175,slainte01,While You Were Sleeping describes me at this movie.,1,9 July 2001,"While You Were Sleeping describes exactly what I was doing through parts of this movie. The plot was more predictable than any other movie I've seen, and the acting in it was so monotonous, that I could barely stay awake. This movie was definitely a ""chick flick,"" if even any women could like it.",While You Were Sleeping
176,annmariescia,Perfect Date Night Movie,10,23 August 2021,I have watched this movie so many times. The actors are wonderful and the message is timeless. We all want to find true love with our soulmate and the love and support of a close knit crazy family. Those of us that have found both know just how lucky we are. It's a perfect happily ever after romantic comedy with a likable cast.,While You Were Sleeping
177,adail-sebastiao,A wonderful and lovely film,10,20 June 2006,"Believe it or not, it was the first time I saw Bill Pullman acting. He was just terrific as well as Sandra Bullock. The movie is a lovely comedy in which Lucy (Sandra Bullock) falls in love with Jack's (Bill Pullman) brother (Peter), a successful businessman. Every day her love grows as she always sees him on the subway while she works in a toll booth. After an incident with Peter, Lucy ""dives into"" his family as if she were his fiancé. Confusion begins until Jack (Peter's brother) notices Lucy and falls in love with her as well. It is a wonderful film, full of surprises. And Bill Pullman is simply great! This is undoubtedly a must-see movie.",While You Were Sleeping
178,michael-2157,one of my favorites,10,22 July 2006,"I thought this was an excellent movie. It was funny and entertaining as well as, well casted. There are not too many movies that I want to watch again but I have seen this over 100 times and will watch it many more. It seems to be so well written and directed that even when you know the ending, you still get caught up in the emotions of the characters throughout the movie. The late jack Warden was fantastic but Sandra Bullock showed us how wonderful of actress she is and convinced the audience how she could fall in love with a family. I think it is that it is more than just the average romance film where a man or a woman falls in love and has to overcome some obstacles to fulfill that love but how a woman can fall in love with a guy as well as his family.",While You Were Sleeping
179,selahstanbery,"Very chaotic, but in a good way.",9,4 August 2020,"I loved this movie, but I do have to say that this sure did keep me on my toes. It could've gone in so many different directions at any point in the story, but I feel it was well written and well played. Very good movie. (OH! Also it's clean other than some foul language, so that's a plus)",While You Were Sleeping
180,akruger-1,the best movie ever!,10,7 July 2002,While You Were Sleeping is a wonderful charming and hilarious comedy that plays sunny side up with Sandra Bullock being her charming self as usual. The movie is excellent and I've seen it 81 times and I'm still not sick of it yet! The best movie ever!,While You Were Sleeping
181,h-e-gray,Love it!,10,6 December 2006,"This is what I'd call a real Christmas movie. Sandra Bullock at her best (and she can do best!), and Bill Pullman looking particularly handsome. I'm fed up with films that are dirty, contain swear words for no reason at all, and try to make statements using shock tactics. This, on the other hand is ideal for aeroplane journeys, as it has none of those things. Non-marital sex isn't even advocated! I also absolutely love the stereotypical American family which support the film wonderfully. Meal time conversations, present openings, and visits to church are pulled off in hilarious style. A fantastic bit of mid-90s 'nostalgia', which creates a warm feeling inside. People may sneer, but there's nothing wrong with that!",While You Were Sleeping
182,debbiev76,Remains my all-time favorite movie,10,4 August 2002,"They don't make movies like this anymore! Just a wonderful, simple love story. Each time I see this flick... I fall in love with it all over again. No other movie has ever made me laugh, cry and cheer sometimes simultaneously!The bulk of this movie is set during the holiday season... In my book, it should be played every year without fail during that time of year. It's that special.""While You Were Sleeping"" is still number one on my list. If you haven't seen it, and like a sweet, simple, wonderful love story with lots of smiles (and some tears)... give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.",While You Were Sleeping
183,hermionexandra,"A really cute movie, proving somehow that dreaming is possible.",9,9 September 2002,"I really like this movie, because it shows that dreams can sometimes become true. Moreover, the character of Lucy (played by Sandra Bullock who is so cute and sweet) is really touching. She is so lonely that she dreams her life, and once that it almost becomes true she can't dare to tell the truth. This movie is really cute. Every character is both funny and tender, Saul is funny when he's supposed to tell the truth, the whole family is very funny.. More than being a nice movie, it really feels true. This movie reminds me of some aspects of my life, and i do hope that I'll be as happy as Lucy.",While You Were Sleeping
184,blackcat-mh,I love this film,10,15 February 2011,"This is the first review i've ever done on this site but after reading some of the comments I would like to add mine too. There was nothing worth watching on the box this evening so I dug out my copy of WYWS and settled down on the sofa. Although I know this film pretty well having watched it a few times it never fails to give me a wonderful warm glow. Although Peter is a handsome guy the chemistry between Lucy and Jack is, without doubt, very real and the two characters play their roles brilliantly. There are so many quirky one liners in this film and the family scenes are well scripted and well acted. How I wish I could be ""adopted"" by a family like that even if it were only for the holiday season. If you're an old romantic like me (and hey i'm not that old lol) give this a try. I've given it a 10 because there isn't anything to dislike.",While You Were Sleeping
185,Yellowanderer,More than a chick flick.,7,14 January 2015,"I am not really a fan of chick flicks. I think they are only good when it's raining outside. However, I am a big fan of Sandra Bullock so I watched it. This film did not make me laugh, or want to fall in love all over again but it sure gave me a warm smile in my heart. It doesn't bore you at all. Entertaining for sure you won't notice how much time you spent facing the screen. I was just surprised Peter Gallagher used to do this kind of role... you know sleeping. Hahaha! I was kinda hooked with his role as Arthur in Covert Affairs. It sure has the Sandra B charm. I will surely watch it all over again, and I recommend it to women who live alone and watch TV with their cats. or to ladies living with roomies. This could bring in some giggle. :)",While You Were Sleeping

This movie is pure and simple, no sex or complicated scheming characters.This is a movie I can watch with my kids or my parents in the room. You cant say that for most movies these days.

Like when the newspaper boy was delivering papers, and when they had the dinner conversation. If you just watch the movie for some good laughs and don't try to expect some big, deep storyline you will find that it is a VERY enjoyable movie. It had us all laughing till we......well you know what I mean. Sit back, get some popcorn and enjoy the show. There's nothing wrong with silly, senseless humor, is there? Even my husband enjoyed it. I've seen this movie more times than I probably should admit. But I laugh every time I see it. Another good choice...How to meet a guy in 10 days.",While You Were Sleeping
188,wdrm2,"A well- put- together, charming movie",10,3 February 2005,"Since I was born in Arlington, Virginia like Sandra Bullock, I have been a fan. And, it happens, I have a sister named Sandra too. I find her role in this movie simply delightful and very, very well done. The vulnerability she displays in her character is played with poignancy and artistic sensitivity. Sandy shows me that her acting talent has a range that others might not see. Since she is very pretty, it is sometimes difficult to convince audiences that you have real, raw acting talent. I believe she displays her capabilities admirably in this role. Bill Pullman is also a great complement to her character. He blends his character into a caring, smitten, masculine, sensitive human being. One does not see this type of character developed by others in similar roles. He has accomplished it marvelously. His role is a real tribute to Bill's versatility as a ""character"" actor. The direction and script make this movie charming without overdoing and with real people that you feel totally connected with from the start. And yes I believe the chemistry between Sandy and Bill is just as electrifying as Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks in their romantic comedies.",While You Were Sleeping
189,phtham,A must-watch movie for all romantics at heart.,10,1 February 2005,"It's a must-watch movie for all romantics. Its simple wholesome storyline uplifts one's spirits and leaves you feeling all nice and warm inside. The chemistry between Pullman and Bullock is magic. It's nice to see old-fashioned romance come to life in the interactions between the 2 lead roles. The scenes where they appear together are touchingly sweet, especially when they were caught under the mistletoe. The supporting casts are strong and often very funny. The dialogues and scenes with some of them are sure to bring a smile to your face. Though the ending is predictable, it did have a small twist when Pullman's (as Jack) family went with him to propose to Bullock as Lucy. Or maybe not as it's obvious from the beginning that having a family meant a lot to Lucy. This is one movie where you can watch and re-watch without feeling bored.",While You Were Sleeping

This movie I watch every year at least 10 times, maybe more, maybe less. It is by far my favourite and I love watching it around Christmas time, since the movie is around the Christmas/New Year season. So if you're going to watch this movie, watch it around Christmas time, November/December should do. I watched it just now and it's October but still, it's a great movie anytime of the year :)It will make you laugh, cry and sigh as you see her life and the magical events that happen evolve into a beautiful heart-warming story. If you are an ol' romantic and enjoy innocent humour then this is the movie for you :)It's just amazing. I'm so glad my Mum introduced me to it. I can't wait to have a family and introduce them.

Not too diabetic or too bitter but just a perfect mixture of love, friendship, and family. Sandra Bullock is perfect in her portrayal of Lucy and so is Bill Pullman. Bullock and Pullman combination works very well. Michael Rispoli is fun in his Joe Jr. role. Glynis Johns,Peter Boyle, Micole Mercurio, Monica Keena, and Jack Warden make up a great family. Peter Gallagher looks real good when he is in coma.I have watched it over and over and simply never seem to get tired of it. Though the storyline is pretty predictable it is still kind of fun to watch it for Bullock. She really pulls it through and many could identify with her. The dialogues are pretty funny, especially the church episode, one during the Christmas dinner and the last hospital scene.It cannot the termed the greatest of all but if there is one movie I could recommend to watch again and again without getting bored it's this one.

Silently in love with a man that comes by each and every day, without seeing her. When she saves the man from a deadly fall for the train, the man gets into a coma. In order to see the man in hospital, she poses as his fiancée. That works, but then she meets the family of the man who never seen his fiancée and instantly believe she is his fiancée.

I loved her as I had no other woman before her. The obvious love between Jack & Lucy was the way we were. You can see it when they were standing together at the top of the steps outside of her apartment. Again, when they do the slip and slid routine on the ice and again when they area moving that ugly sofa into Peter's apartment. Sol was a gerat sidenote in this comedy. Between him and Joe Jr., they keep the comedy flowing the right way. I didn't like Peter's character even before he woke up. Peter was everything we weren't, him with his perfect apartment and loving himself with all those pictures. How could he have room for anyone else? Family meant everything to my ex. Her family was just the opposite of Jack & Peter's. I just wish that my ex could realize all she gave up for her dogs! Does anyone have some dead people's furniture for sale?
