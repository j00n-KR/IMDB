0,TheLittleSongbird,It's not just the house that's crooked,5,26 December 2017,"Agatha Christie is one of my all-time favourite authors, and, while 'Crooked House' is personally not one of my favourites of her books, it is not hard at all to see why she herself thought very highly of it (one of her favourites reputedly).It is a terrific book with a dark atmosphere, a lot of suspense, even more unexpected and delicious red herrings and twists, well-defined characters, a strong mystery and one of her most shocking and most ballsy endings. She didn't have one quite like this, with a murderer that one does not expect with a quite frightening motivation.Can totally understand the mixed reception for this 2017 film adaptation of 'Crooked House', both from book purists and especially for those not familiar with the source material. Was very mixed on it myself, there are worse Agatha Christie adaptations as well as much better. As an adaptation, it is not exactly dumbed down, nor is it a complete re-write like some of the Geraldine McEwen adaptations. In fact, there are a lot of recognisable elements as well as having things that add nothing.On the flip side, 'Crooked House' feels bland, as an adaptation and as a standalone (a lot of the criticisms unusually this time round have actually come from those unfamiliar with the book beforehand). It lacks the suspense of the book, much tighter direction would have helped in particularly Hayward's backstory scenes, which felt like irrelevant padding and slowed the story down in what was already a film that was prone to pedestrian direction.What it also lacks is the well-defined characterisation, here with so many suspects one doesn't really get to know most of them. The characters that the film focuses most on are also the least interesting, while others especially Laurence are so underwritten that one forgets they are even there most of the time. The most interesting characters are actually Edith and Josephine.Max Irons is a dull, charmless lead and shares very little chemistry with Stefanie Martini as Sophia, who plays the character with charm and allure but could have brought a harder edge. Pacing is also odd, parts do feel pedestrian while the staging of the ending is slightly rushed.There are positives with 'Crooked House' conversely. Apart from some sloppy editing at times, it looks wonderful. Very elegant and atmospheric, with deliciously evocative attention to period detail and sumptuous photography. The music is haunting and jaunty if occasionally a little intrusive. The script, which has a lot of talk and requires full attention all the time, is thought-provoking and droll.It is thankful that the twisty nature of the story and its darkness are still intact, the red herrings and twists fascinate and shock. Likewise with the final revelation, it was very brave to keep it intact and because it is such an ingenious ending that really makes impact in the book it would have induced fury by me if changed. Luckily it also still leaves me floored, although the film rushes the pacing and staging of it, is chilling, in some ways affecting and in Christie's time and now it's pretty daring.Some other scenes leave impact. There is a suitably awkward and well-staged dinner scene, while the scenes between Hayward and Josephine actually feel relevant and add a lot of intrigue to the mystery and Josephine's character. It is something of a shame though that the difference in acting quality is obvious, young Honor Kneafsey far outshines Irons when they're together. Other than Irons, the acting is good.Particularly from an enigmatically regal Glenn Close, gravitas-filled Terence Stamp (underused but great) and beyond her years Honor Kneafsey. Unrecognisable Gillian Anderson (looking like Cleopatra risen from the dead in mid 20th century period detail) , vampish Christina Hendricks and firm Julian Sands are also fine. Christian McKay is pretty wasted.Concluding, a crooked mixed feelings adaptation of terrific source material. 5/10 Bethany Cox.",Crooked House
1,Leofwine_draca,Lesser adaptation of a lesser work,4,27 December 2017,"Agatha Christie adaptations seem to be all the rage on British television these days and this one's adapted for the screen by the ubiquitous Julian Fellowes, who brings his usual Downtown Abbey stylings to the proceedings (Glenn Close plays a matriarch with more bite and even more craziness than Maggie Smith). I'm not familiar with the little-adapted novel upon which this is based, but it doesn't make for a very entertaining production. A detective is called in to investigate a suspected murder at a country house and must work his way through a cast list of potential suspects. The dialogue has been updated with mild expletives and the like but none of it is particularly convincing. Even worse is the lacklustre cast, with a miscast Christina Hendricks ariating the scenery, Max Irons proving exceptionally wooden, Terence Stamp wasted, and Gillian Anderson a pure caricature.",Crooked House
2,SnoopyStyle,old Agatha Christie,6,30 November 2018,"Sophia Leonides (Stefanie Martini) hires her former lover, private investigator Charles Hayward (Max Irons), to investigate her grandfather business tycoon Aristide Leonides' death. Charles' family friend Chief Inspector Taverner (Terence Stamp) gives him helpful advises. Lady Edith De Haviland (Glenn Close) is the sister of Aristide's first wife Magda (Gillian Anderson). Philip Leonides (Julian Sands) is his oldest son. Charles arrives at the family estate to investigate the untrustworthy family with rumors of esponiage. Brenda Leonides (Christina Hendricks) is Aristide's young widow who the others consider to be a gold-digger.This is adapted from the 1949 Agatha Christie mystery novel. It has an old school feel. While this has lots of acting talents, the leading man doesn't have anything juicy enough to outshine the rest. He's rather bland and there is a strict lack of stakes for him. The obvious way to elevate the stakes is to make his relationship with Sophia bigger. Some way or some thing needs to be manufactured to increase the danger and the intensity. Overall, this is solid and a little bland from old school Agatha Christie.",Crooked House
3,Horst_In_Translation,"I wanted to like it, I really did, but...",4,17 December 2018,"""Crooked House"" is a new British/American movie, well new is relative because this premiered in 2017 already, but it took this long for the film to get released here in Germany. The movie comes relatively close to the two-hour mark so it is not a short movie by any means. The writer and director is Gilles Paquet-Brenner, but he is certainly not the biggest name attached to this project. That would be Agatha Christie as it is based on a work by her and another writer adapting the latter is Julian Fellowes, an Academy Award winner in the past. So with the people in charge of the story, no surprise some fairly familiar faces are part of the cast here. For me a highlight was the inclusion of Christina Hendricks because I love Mad Men, Gillian Anderson of course too, even if I must admit I did not even recognize her. Terence Stamp I did recognize, but I wasn't entirely sure if it's him, his skin looked so tanned. Anyway, I like him, so I wish he could have had more screen time. And then there is Glenn Close of course, who just cannot be mistaken for anybody else and was in charge in every scene she was in. There is talk this year again about her finally winning an Oscar, not for this film though, and we will see if it happens. But yeah, she gives a good performance here too, maybe the best from the cast although young Honor Kneafsey was a scene stealer too. One big problem for me in terms of the cast is that the lead actor, or lets say the one who is most lead, is Max Irons and I did not know him at all admittedly. And I also found him really forgettable. A handsome face somehow, but that's not enough and I also struggle with accepting the things they talked about in his past, his time in Egypt etc. he just seems too young and also he did not feel to me like somebody who is in charge of things like James Bond or anything, but they wanted to sell us this idea. But perhaps they felt the same because I had the impression that the longer the movie ran, the less significant he became. Talking about his character's significance, I quite liked the comment early on about how he saved her from a horse and that obviously she just acted this way, which shows how he may not be the brightest bulb either believing he really saved her.Now as for the story, it was okay overall I would say. With Christie penning, it is of course a murder crime story about who did it and as such it works most of the time. But not perfectly either. Eventually, despite being all about finding the killer and despite some suspects being really colorful characters, I did not care as much as I hoped I would about who did it. It may have had to do with how shallow the key investigator felt to me. I would be surprised if they make a sequel or even more than one with him in charge. But we will see, maybe others enjoyed it more. I was also a bit undecided with my rating here. It's a really close call between giving a positive and negative recommendation here for me because the solution and the last 15 minutes or so felt right and were pretty interesting, even if the definite end felt a bit abrupt then. But almost everything before that was just too weak honestly. It sucked to see Christina Hendricks wasted like that, she is a much better actress than what she had to work with here. Also some characters were just included for the sake of it and added virtually nothing to the story. Okay I can accept that as they were not at the core of the investigations, but still. And finally one moment that I felt to be the weakest was maybe when we find out the little girl will inherit almost everything and then 5 seconds later we find out she fell from that tree because somebody manipulated the rope. Too much of a coincidence honestly for these two things happening at the same time. But yeah, looking at who did not like the nanny and who inherited everything, it maybe in the end should not be the biggest surprise who the killer was. Not sure if she knew about the changed will though. Also an interesting twist with Close's character there. When she steps into the car with the girl, we feel Close's character is the one who did it. Overall, like I said, a close call if I give it a thumbs-up or thumbs-down, but I have to go with the latter. I preferred the recent Branagh vehicle ""Murder on the Orient Express"" when it comes to recent Agatha Christie adaptations, even if that one was not a great film by any means either. Back to this one here: I think given the cast and talent involved here, this could, no should, have turned out much better. Watch something else instead.",Crooked House
4,Prismark10,Not crooked just weak,3,20 December 2017,"Charles Hayward (Max Irons) formerly in the foreign office, now a private detective has been asked by the police to look into the death of a ruthless Greek tycoon Aristide Leonides who was also the grandfather of his old girlfriend.The Leonides family all live in a large rambling mansion, rich, overindulged and cruel. Lady Edith (Glenn Close) is seen blasting moles on the lawn with a shotgun. She is Aristide's late wife's mother. Also in the house is Aristide's new wife and presumed sole heir to the estate as well as his son's their wives and grandchildren. All seem to be discontented.The setting is the late 1950s, you get some trips to London and early rock and roll. However the film is flatly directed, there are several street shots with period cars but apart from that it looks cheap and I was unsure whether it was a period piece at times.Max Irons is a bland lead. The film takes a while to get going and the story is not that interesting. A rich eccentric dislikeable family, so what? The movie would had been better if it was directed with some flare and a pared down screenplay with some suspense and tension.",Crooked House
5,Sleepin_Dragon,A Lavish production,7,24 December 2017,"It is so wonderful to see Agatha Christie's work still in demand, on the small and big screen alike. Brave to see the production team take on Crooked House, a feat never before attempted. The results are pretty good, as a novel I think Crooked House is one of her best, it is outstanding, so the story is not in question, firstly it's quite a faithful adaptation, and they were brave enough to stick with the shock ending. The acting is excellent, Glenn Close is commanding in every single scene, showing the class act she is. Gillian Anderson and young Honor Kneafsey also impress. The settings and fashions are flawless, it looks wonderfully glamorous, and is again in keeping with the text. If I were being critical I would pick on some of the editing and cutting, at times it was a bit clunky, which is a shame because the core elements are strong.I'm always glad to see a new production from Agatha Christie's catalogue of brilliance. More please, 7/10",Crooked House
6,Tweekums,An impressive murder mystery from the pen of Agatha Christie,8,19 December 2017,"When tycoon Aristide Leonides dies at home his granddaughter, Sophia de Haviland, suspects foul play so approaches private investigator Charles Hayward who she had met some time before when he was working as a diplomat in Cairo. Charles heads to the family's large country house and meets the somewhat dysfunctional family each of whom is a possible suspect. Aristides death was apparently caused when his eye drops were substituted for his insulin; something they all knew would be deadly as he had previously joked about being easy to murder. Charles isn't the only person 'investigating' Aristide's young granddaughter, Josephine, tells Charles that he is 'Watson' to her 'Holmes' and that she has uncovered certain facts; she refuses to tell him though as mysteries can't be solved too quickly. When she falls from her tree house it would appear that she has put herself in real danger. As Aristotle's will is read there are surprises but it still doesn't narrow the field of suspects... if anything it widens the field as somebody suggests that Sophia and Charles could be working together and his investigation is just a way to point suspicion elsewhere! Eventually an arrest is made but Charles isn't convinced that the police have the right person.Having never read the book I had no idea what to expect from the Agatha Christie mystery; it kept me guessing to the end and when the killer is revealed it was a genuine surprise. The country house setting is a classic of the genre as was the large pool of suspects. These are nicely varied, each with their own motive. Max Irons is nicely understated as protagonist Charles Hayward and is more than ably supported by a cast that includes plenty of well-known actors; most obviously Glenn Close, Gillian Anderson, Christina Hendricks and Terence Stamp. The less well-known actors, such as young Honor Kneafsey, played Josephine, are also impressive. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of Agatha Christie; I discussed the film with somebody who had read the book and was assured that there were less changes than in most Christie adaptions.",Crooked House
7,paul_haakonsen,The entire movie was crooked...,4,1 August 2018,"When I sat down to watch ""Crooked House"" it was solely because it had Julian Sands on the cast list, as he is one of my all-time favorite actors. I had not heard about this movie prior to finding it because of his acting credits.And this being an Agatha Christie thing didn't really do much to entice me. But still, I decided to sit down and watch it.I must say that this movie was somewhat of a swing and a miss for me. It was not overly interesting, nor was it a movie that I really delved and immersed myself into. The plot just felt incoherent to me, but perhaps that is because I am not interested in who-did-it-murder-plots.What worked for ""Crooked House"" was the impressive cast list, which included Glenn Close, Julian Sands, Gillian Anderson and Terence Stamp. Yet, in my opinion, not even these performers could manage to do much for the story or the movie as such.I managed to endure the movie all the way to the end, although my attention was failing a couple of times throughout the course of the movie.""Crooked House"" is not the type of movie that you will watch more than once.",Crooked House
8,blanche-2,adaptation of Christie's favorite novel,6,2 December 2017,"""Crooked House"" is an adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel of the same name, published in 1949. It was a book she personally loved the most, and she steadfastly refused to change the ending, despite the insistence of her publishers. Nowadays, I suppose, we're more used to this kind of story.The film has a great cast - Glenn Close, Mox Irons, Terence Stamp, Gillian Anderson, Christina Hendricks, and Stefanie Martini. A detective, Charles Hayward (Irons) is asked to look into the death of an old girlfriend's (Martini) grandfather, which she thinks may be murder. It's a wealthy family and not all that anxious for publicity.The house has several discontented generations under one roof, including the victim's late wife's mother (Close), his young, beautiful wife (Hendricks), his sons, their wives, and another younger granddaughter. The will the family thought was in effect was never signed, and there's plenty of disappointment when the family learns about the heirs. Everyone is at each other's throats.There are plenty of suspects and more death in this dark story that contains some excellent performances. I found the second half much more exciting than the first; the movie is slow in the beginning, but the characters make it interesting enough.I read all of Agatha Christie's books probably 50+ years ago, so it's hard for me to remember if this story stuck to the book or not. Some producers have taken a lot of liberties with Christie's works, sticking Miss Marple in when she wasn't in the novel, etc., but this one is probably pretty straightforward.",Crooked House
9,Coventry,All hail Agatha Christie! What a phenomenal writer she was.,8,10 April 2018,"More than 40 years after her death, the almighty Mrs. Agatha Christie is more alive than she ever was! I've been a massive fan of her work since many, many years, so you can imagine how ecstatic I am with this Christie-revival. The BBC still regularly produces fancy mini-series based on her work (recently there was another great version of ""And then there were none"", starring Sam Neill and Charles Dance) and within one and the same year there were no less than two large-budgeted film productions with impressive cast ensembles. Kenneth Brannagh played it safe, with another umpteenth but nevertheless enjoyable interpretation of ""Murder on the Orient Express"", but most of all I was looking forward to the very first adaptation of the fantastically bonkers - and Agatha's personal favorite - story ""Crooked House"". At first, I was a bit concerned regarding the choice of director. The French born Gilles Paquet-Brenner's first film ""Walled In"" really sucked, and he didn't do a very impressive job transferring Gillian Flynn's powerful novel ""Dark Places"" into a compelling thriller, neither. But hey, maybe it's because I'm biased regarding the source material, but ""Crooked House"" nevertheless became a good old-fashioned and absorbing mystery-whodunit with a stellar cast, lovely decors and a thoroughly ominous atmosphere. But it's the phenomenal story that is domineering here. Like I said, I'm biased, but if the novel is faithfully adapted it's difficult to ruin a good Agatha Christie tale. If you haven't read the novel or read any plot spoilers, I dare you to guess the denouement! The dead of 76-year-old family patriarch and self-made millionaire Aristide Leonidès quickly turns into murder when it's discovered that his insulin got replaced by a lethal poison. Leonidès large and entire family, including a sexy young wife and a sister-in-law from his previous marriage, all live together at the immense family estate and, in familiar Agatha Christie style, each had a motive to murder the overbearing old man. His beloved granddaughter Sophie enlists the help of private detective, with whom she had a brief romantical history in Cairo, but he doesn't make a lot of progress in unmasking the culprit. For people who aren't as obsessed with Agatha Christie than me, ""Crooked House"" is perhaps slightly overlong and admittedly it takes too long before the second obligatory incident occurs. Meanwhile, however, there are many great dialogues and a continuously mounting suspense to enjoy. The young cast members (Max Irons, Stefanie Martini, Honor Kneafsey) do a more than adequate job, and it's always a pleasure to see some veterans, like Glenn Close, Terence Stamp and Julian Sands.",Crooked House
10,grantss,Good but not great,6,30 December 2018,"Multi-millionaire Aristide Leonides has just died, apparently of a heart attack. Private investigator Charles Hayward is approached by his granddaughter Sophia and asked to investigate his death as she believes he was murdered. Hayward takes on the case and visits the Leonides estate, questioning the family. He discovers that it is far from a simple case - the family is incredibly dysfunctional and nothing is as it seems.Decent, though not great, adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel. Good setup with a fair amount of intrigue and mystery. Solid performances from a cast that includes Glenn Close, Julian Sands, Terrence Stamp and Gillian Anderson. Great work by 13 year old Honor Kneafsey as Josephine - she almost steals the show.However, after a solid start, the intrigue doesn't get built on very well and the middle-to-end part drags a bit. Even more disappointing, the ending feels very rushed and out of the blue.Another negative is the performance of Christina Hendricks as Brenda. I know she is supposed to be a femme fatale but she didn't have to try to sound like Marilyn Monroe on helium. Way overdone and quite irritating.",Crooked House
11,Calicodreamin,Intriguing but disjointed,6,4 September 2021,"Crooked House ticks off all the boxes, good acting and well casted characters, an interesting plot, and good cinematography... but it just feels off. The storyline doesn't flow well, some scenes just end, and others feel out of place. Though it was definitely an unexpected ending (though that was abrupt as well).",Crooked House
12,gradyharp,An Agatha Christie feast,8,26 November 2017,"It is difficult to satisfactorily transcribe Agatha Christie's ingenious mysteries to the screen and even Julian Fellowes (Downton Abbey, Gosford Park, The Young Victoria, The Tourist) had difficulty finessing the complex characters in this murder mystery. As directed by Gilles Paquet-Brenner the film feels choppy and disjointed and lacks the slow inexorable building to the climax in the way Christie's novels succeed. Set in England with splendid photography by Sebastian Winterø (struggling with a rather dreadful musical score by Hugo de Claire) very briefly the story relates a spy-turned- private-detective is lured by his former lover to catch her grandfather's murderer before Scotland Yard exposes dark family secrets. A more complete overview – 'In Agatha Christie's most twisted tale, the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of a wealthy patriarch is investigated by spy- turned-private-detective Charles Hayward (Max Irons), who is lured by his former lover Sophia de Haviland (Stefani martini) to catch her grandfather's murderer before Scotland Yard exposes dark family secrets. On the sprawling estate, amidst a poisonous atmosphere of bitterness, resentment and jealousy in a truly crooked house, Hayward encounters three generations of the dynasty, including a theater actress (Gillian Anderson), the old man's widow 50 years his junior (Christina Hendricks), the family matriarch Lady Edith de Haviland (Glenn Close), the inquisitive little Josephine (Honor Kneafsey), the nanny (Jenny Galloway) and the male contingency Julian Sands, Preston Nyman, John Heffernan, and a fine turn by Terence Stamp as Chief Inspector Taverner.This is a true whodunit with a fine Christie flavor, but somehow the telling of it cinematically falls clunky.",Crooked House
13,deloudelouvain,Books are just better,5,3 March 2018,"They say no movie beats reading the original book and in this case it's again a valid point. With a book well written you can use your imagination completely, on how the characters look and what their part is in the mystery. In the movie though you don't get that same sensation. I thought Crooked House was very slow and a bit boring if I have to be honest. I would rather play a game of Cluedo than watching this movie again. It's just more entertaining. The cast wasn't bad though, but the story being so slow they couldn't make this movie better. I do like Agatha Christie's books but her movie adaptions seems not as good to me. And by the way I saw the end coming from far. I'm not sure that would have been the case with the book.",Crooked House
14,ksf-2,Rarely shown Aggie Christie.,8,8 February 2021,"An Agatha Christie film I had never seen before?? Who knew? Members of a family hire Charles Hayward (Max Irons) to figure out what is going on at the family estate. Someone has been poisoned. And everyone is a suspect. Turns out Sophia dated Hayward way back when, so he can probably be trusted. But can Sophia be trusted? The formidable Glenn Close is Lady Edith. Hayward starts to question the family, but not many seem upset by the victim's death. Gillian Anderson (from xfiles) is the odd Magda. Flashback to Cairo, to when Hayward may or may not have first learned of the family and their secrets. And there's a will.. that hasn't been signed. There's a younger wife.. .that the family doesn't like. Intrigue. When Inspector Taverner (Terence Stamp) shows up, he tells Hayward he must stick with it and solve this murder. I was able to find a cheap dvd of this film -- it never seems to show on tv. Most odd. Someone must still have the rights to it. Directed by frenchman Gilles Paquet-Brenner. It's quite good.

15,cherold,fails to sustain interest in its mystery or its characters,4,29 August 2019,"The set designer for this movie must have had a lot of fun; every room is filled with classy bric-a-brac, as though every character spends all their time shopping.The very definition of ""handsomely mounted,"" the movie is typical of the all-stars in luxury approach often taken to Agatha Christie movies. Some of the all-stars are quite good, such as Glenn Close as a sharp-tongued matriarch.Unfortunately, the movie has no sustaining interest. When an interesting character is up, like a vain actress or a precocious little girl, the movie comes to life. But the protagonist is decidedly bland, as are a good many characters, and I felt I was spending all my time waiting for what would always be a very brief moment of genuine entertainment.Half-way through this movie, I realized I still didn't care in the least who committed the crime. A mystery that fails to interest me in either its mystery or its characters is the antithesis of what Christie is known for.So I stopped watching. Life's too short.",Crooked House
16,kfo9494,"Great Book, Poor Film",3,2 January 2018,"Anytime you have a mystery, you want the audience to feel like they are part of the process. Where the viewer feels like they could have solved the mystery with the right amount of motivation. That is why, in most mystery movies, you have a character that is unique and even quirky, a person that stands out above others. However in this tale, you have a bland, uninteresting guy making each scene feel long and boring. Max Irons, that plays the detective, is mundane and even dusty, in the role that makes the story drag on like waiting at the emergency room admitting office. The entire movie, except for some scenes near the end, almost became unwatchable as drab performances and ill-timed background music filled the film. A movie mystery from an interesting book was turned into a long walk in a small platoon of trees.This movie did have a number of great actors but it was obvious they were not used to their potential. And with the script going from one suspect to another suspect in a matter of minutes, the viewer only got a small potion of each character background right before changing to another scene with another character actor.

18,paul2001sw-1,One of Christie's better tales,6,20 December 2017,"Agatha Christie wrote corny, one-dimensional murder mysteries with presposterous plotting. And yet there can be something quite comforting about entering her world on a winter's night, and sitting down before an adaptation of one of her stories. 'Crooked House' even has a genuinely clever ending, one based (for once) on plausible psychology, whereas normally its the psychological parts of her stories that are most ridiculous. Screenwriter Julian Fellowes is, of course, a dab hand at representing this kind of tale. It's light entertainment, but altogether nicely done.",Crooked House
19,pennyelenabooks,Good Enough,5,6 October 2018,"Crooked house is just good. For a mystery thriller movie it didn't raise the anticipation and made the audiance wonder who was the killer. Actually, the whole suspense was created by the story itself. So, I'm disappointed with the way this movie was made and how they presented the story, because it could have been much much better.
At least, the settings were wonderfull and the performances good, so the movie didn't look like a cheap tv movie. So, 5 out of 10.",Crooked House
20,jtindahouse,A twisted tale indeed,9,28 November 2018,"There's nothing I love more than a good whodunnit. And because I've never read any of Agatha Christie's novels I get to watch each of her film adaptions fresh, with no prior knowledge of how they end. I was treated to that last year with the 2017 adaption of 'Murder on the Orient Express' and now here with 'Crooked House' and while I very much enjoyed both films, I would have to say I preferred 'Crooked House' (much to my surprise).First of all, what a cast! Maybe not quite as A-list as 'Murder on the Orient Express' but arguably a better set of actors. Glenn Close in particular was a scene stealer. The charisma she possesses is almost second to none. It's criminal that she has never won an Oscar. There really wasn't a weak-link in the cast at all though. Perhaps not every scene is of the same incredibly high standard as the last, but it's still a heck of an effort all round.The story though was just terrific. Apparently this was Christie's favourite novel out of her own work and I can see why. A delectable cast of characters, all with motives and all with the personalities to do such a dastardly thing. As an audience member it is just so much fun running through each character and the likelihood that they did the deed, basically playing detective yourself. That's what the best whodunnits allow you to do. This was undoubtedly the best whodunnit I've seen in a long time and it is a film that I would highly recommend.",Crooked House

22,myriamlenys,a mixed bag,7,7 July 2019,"I must have read the novel - I'm a great admirer of Agatha Christie's work - but this was a long time ago. As a result I'm unable to judge the movie's fidelity as an adaptation.To begin with the good, ""Crooked House"" is set in some striking and marvellously apt surroundings. The sets, costumes and props are well-chosen and complement each other beautifully. As a viewer, one gets a strong sense of an opulent but unhappy mansion where the various inhabitants have grown obsessed either with the idea of power or else with the idea of powerlessness. People don't LIVE there : they fight, they vegetate, they plot, they dream, they play-act, they flee in alcohol-induced fantasies.""Crooked House"" also has an intriguing and well-constructed plot, complete with enough red herrings to fill the North Sea. The ending, also the solution, is quite dark : it goes where not a lot of other mystery thrillers would dare to go.And yet, strangely, the movie does not crackle with electricity or suspense, perhaps because it insists on telling rather than showing. The Charles Hayward character, for instance, is supposed to be adventurous and intriguing, with a background which includes the police, the diplomatic (perhaps secret ?) service plus a private detection job, but the movie doesn't include much in the way of flashback, anecdote, incident. At the same time one learns little about Charles Hayward, the man : what are his likes, his dislikes, his quirks, his ambitions, his views on justice and crime ? It's unclear what makes him tick as an individual, just as it's unclear how he really feels about his assignment or about his girlfriend.Another example : the crooked house in question is the property of a crooked man (now deceased) who came to England as a poor Greek immigrant, built a fortune in the restaurant and hotel business, and then dabbled in unsavoury international intrigue. Again, the movie tells us about these things, but it does not show us scenes - for instance - of politicians preparing a coup d'état, of foreign ambassadors dancing a celebration gig or of foreign citizens staring at the ruins of a once-happy city.Still, it's worth a watch - and Glenn Close gives a terrific performance.",Crooked House

24,MR_Heraclius,Crooked House,7,20 February 2020,"Agatha Christie's ""Crooked House"" is a gripping tale that will keep you at the edge of your seats most of the time. Only most of the time because the film is oddly paced, moving either too fast or too slow. However, this is compensated for by the captivating performances of the talented cast members and the elaborate mystery that Agatha Christie herself considered one of her personal favorites. I was a bit disappointed by the detective Charles Hayward because his character was flat and static although the flashbacks offered potential. He was also nothing more than a device used to let the audience into the dysfunctional family's lives. Unlike Poirot, he was unable to reach conclusions without having them shoved into his face. I still thoroughly enjoyed the film and would recommend it to anyone who has not read the book. Knowing the twist could diminish the charm of the movie.",Crooked House

Sprinkled some famous faces (Max Irons, Stefanie Martini, Glenn Close, Gillian Anderson, Christina Hendricks, and Terence Stamp); acted well; and themed in a way to make things look and feel authentic.Following a young sleuth as he tries to figure out who killed a millionaire Greek patriarch, whose immediate family all seem to have motives and means to be able to commit the murderous act. As the sleuth meets all members of the family it becomes more and more difficult to find the responsible party and bring them to justice. Is it the obvious nasty characters, or is the more charming and friendly characters - enjoy the ride while the audience and the sleuth uncover the truth at the same time.I quite enjoyed this film and recommend it as a safe film for a lazy Sunday, or to enjoy with the family.

El detective, es el detective menos inteligente del mundo. No tiene ni una frase que te diga que está avanzando. De hecho yo pensaba que le habían puesto a él porque no parece muy listo, como dice la nieta en un momento en la película. Es el primer detective de la historia que no tiene que correr aventuras en ningún momento de la película. Esos momentos en los que investiga y casi le ven.Los actores están bien, salvo el detective. No me gusta ese detective, no es un detective.
La iluminación esta estupenda. Si es una película de gran presupuesto y eso se nota. Ayuda contar la película, a meterte, pero hay otras cosas que te sacan.El director, no me gusta, no ha sabido hacer una película policiaca. No ha sabido usar la cámara. No sabe contar con la cámara. Los planos son básicos o incluso feos. La película no aburre, pero no dice nada.Es como ver una película que cuando termina no sabes que te está contando, porque no te ha llegado.
I mean, a movie of intrigue, it has to have intrigue, suspense, excitement, adventures, this movie does not have any of that.
The detective is the least intelligent detective in the world. It does not have a phrase that tells you it is moving forward. In fact, I thought that they had put him because he does not seem very smart, as the granddaughter says at one point in the movie. He is the first detective in history who does not have to run adventures at any time in the movie. Those moments in which he investigates and almost see him.The actors are fine, except for the detective. I do not like that detective, he's not a detective.
The lighting is great. If it's a big budget movie and that shows. It helps to tell the movie, to get involved, but there are other things that take you out.The director, I do not like it, he has not known how to make a police movie. He has not known how to use the camera. He does not know how to count on the camera. The plans are basic or even ugly.

As I watched (and fell asleep, awoke, fell asleep, awoke, fell asleep, awoke) rewinding constantly to catch what I'd missed - I realized the fault was that of the screenwriter and director. They're completely incompetent.Excruciating tedium, a narrative that just does not further the story for an hour at a time, an ending that simply TELLS you in the last five minutes the entirety of the mystery - and a waste of many fine actors (Glenn Close, Gillian Anderson, Julian Sands, Max Irons (son of Jeremy, whom I liked very much in The White Queen), the wonderful Terence Stamp - WASTED them all! - make the viewer actually angry at the film.How do you ruin Agatha Christie? Even when it's not been done very well (e.g., the played for broad jokes in the 1950s versions with Robert Morley and Margaret Rutherford), it's FAR more interesting than this real mess. And to think of the many dozens of wonderfully made versions starring Joan Hickson or Geraldine McEwen or David Suchet models is to realize it can't be a near-impossible task to create an entertaining in fact engrossing film of Agatha Christie.The director should not have been allowed the financing to make this movie - he is incompetent.",Crooked House

37,msunando,You won't see the end coming,8,18 April 2020,"Crooked House - Adapted from a novel by Dame Agatha Christie, Crooked House is exactly what the name states. The patriarch of the Leonides family Aristide dies suddenly and the coroner pronounces murder by poisoning it is - his insulin injection has been replaced by a deadly dose. We discover a disjointed and volatile family comprising of Aristide's young widow with a past, his two feuding sons and their respective families, his daughter, a family affairs manager and a nanny, and practically everyone has had a motive to eliminate him. The huge estate and his wealth could potentially be the objects of desire, or it could be a crime of passion. The police is investigating but has limited access to the members of the household, hence Sophia (Stefanie Martini) hires a private detective Charles Hayward (Max Irons) to solve the crime.Crooked House is a fascinating tale of bottled up emotions and a web of secrets. It makes you believe that it could have been anyone to have committed the murder as more incidents complicate the progress of the investigation. If you watched Knives Out recently, you may find similarities, but trust me, you won't see the end coming. That is, the discovery of the murderer is indeed startling and shocking. Glenn Close stands out in her role of Lady Edith with her witty dialogues and towering personality. Gillian Anderson, Terence Stamp, Julian Sands and Honor Kneafsey (in the role of the precocious Josephine, who seems to know a lot but talks in riddles) are impressive too.Do watch Crooked House if you are a fan of Christie's novels or murder mysteries, you won't be disappointed.",Crooked House
38,WalkdenEntertainment,A House Full of Twists And Turns...,6,11 January 2019,"Based on a well known Agatha Christie murder mystery novel, a private eye named Charles Hayward accepts a murder case from an ex-girlfriend to investigate the murder of her Grandfather.Our private eye is granted a two day head start before the investigation is officially taken over by the police. Charles will talk to a number of family members and search for clues which are all found under the roof of the large mansion where all the family live. 'Who' and 'Why' are just some of the questions raised behind this mysterious death.Needless to say if you love a classic ""who done it tale"" then this film could be your type of film. The film is loaded with plenty of characters, with family members who all could possibly be behind the murder. From the introduction of each character I did find myself slightly struggling to work out the connection or relation each one had with the murder victim.The filming style is different and personally I found it to be an odd choice. Many shots will have the main character in focus but the background in many shots are blurred. Perhaps this was used to keep the focus on our actors and the dialogue, but if your film is set in a beautiful mansion or landscape, blurring shots seems like a missed opportunity. One scene in particular at the start also used a horrible shaky cam style which also hurt what should have been a critical moment as it was introducing key main characters. The rest of the film's camera work is fine and I also enjoyed the film's audio track, in particular the sound effects.While I enjoyed the film's twist, the journey towards the final reveal can came along at a slightly slow pace with frustrating elements, including knowing what the final piece/element required to solve the crime is before our lead characters do. And prior to the third act, the film seems to simply fill time with pointless flash backs or by watching other characters get questioned.Despite being a film with many characters, it's no surprise that the actress Glenn Close is one of the biggest stand outs of the film in regards to performances.Overall, Crooked House delivers a well written murder mystery to the big screen. While the twist is rewarding, the journey can be a slight struggle in regards to the plot. The director's choice of selected blurred shots with narrow depth of field, only focusing on its leads in each scene instead of crisp shots does make sense, but also seems like a waste considering how beautiful some locations truly are. Worth a look for an Agatha Christie movie.6.2/10

39,bangel3322,Not Bad,7,29 November 2017,"I have not read the book, so I'm unable to make comparisons. Seeing as Agatha Christie thought this to be her best book, I'm guessing the novel was 10x better than the movie.I felt the film itself moved quite slowly, despite being nearly 2 hours long. I felt myself at points losing interest. I'm thinking we needed a Marple or Poirot in this to spice it up a bit! I'm absolutely obsessed with the Poirot series; I find it thrilling, jam packed with twists, and so when I come across any Agatha Christie adaptation, I'm expecting them to live up to these high standards, but this fell short. I don't believe there was enough time with the suspects for the audience to build cases against them. However I must say that the big reveal of the actual killer left me speechless, it made up for the rest of the movie being quite boring, otherwise my score would be a lot lower. I'd say instead of big named productions, stick to the BBC/ITV adaptations of Agatha Christie's work....so much better.By the way Glenn Close was fab.",Crooked House

41,Hallelujah289,"Dull mystery, sharp cast, good twist",7,21 March 2019,"""Crooked House"" has a great cast. The actors seem well chosen. The cast is what made me feel inclined to see this film (I haven't read any Agatha Christy novel) and I wasn't disappointed. I like all their different personalities and different faces and the way their faces seem to reflect their personalities.The eldest son is gambling historian with a flair for the dramatic and he has sharp, hawkish features. The second son is the father's favorite and he's a bit plodding and incompetent and he has a soft, pudding like face. His wife played by Gillian Anderson is a would be actress and she has refined features paired with a rather too stylish bob haircut. Her aunt is perhaps the matriarch of the family and she has sharp features and twinkling eyes. This is Glenn Close. She plays her cards close to the chest. I think Close in particular is a stellar choice for her role and she carries much of the film. Then there is Sophia, the niece and favorite of the murdered grandfather who has a mix of allure and just enough mystery to be thought a suspect. Not to forget Christina Hendricks as the thirty something second wife to the aged millionaire. Hendricks seems to play similar roles but I liked that here she plays a bit of an attractive simpleton. A nice twist for her.Most of the cast actually plays roles just a bit different than what they would normally. Glenn Close doesn't easily make a nurturing grandmother figure but it makes sense she might here in this murder mystery. Gillian Anderson also usually plays characters less drunk (see her popular X Files detective character Scully). I think ""Crooked House"" was likely to be a breath of fresh air for these actors and actresses and I liked seeing them inhabit their rules with gusto. Anderson in particular seemed to like being the disorderly mother too in love with the theater for her own good. I liked where the actors went with their roles, but again Close did make the most of the role she had and it does pay off by the end (you will have to watch the film to see what I mean).I was intrigued with the casting choices and I think the dynamic between the actors is what makes ""Crooked House"" worth watching. They really do seem like a family-a sullen one, but a fascinating one to watch.I do agree the film is rather slow and plodding as another reviewer said. This is sometimes the style of period pieces and there is enough visual splendor to rest your eyes on. I did think the costumes were also done very well and seemed to suit each character. Glenn Close often wore pants and I liked her for it (pants are unusual for the period).I would say that the soundtrack was also a bit unique and worth listening to. There was a moment where a version of Richie Havens' 1960s song ""Freedom"" was playing and if you listen to the lyrics there is a bit of a clue there. The song is not in period-it wasn't made until years later, and so it sticks out just enough for you to listen. There seemed to be other instances of particular song use which I thought was a nice touch.I'm glad I watched the film, and I did appreciate the twist at the end because it did feeling shocking in a way that could be believable and that did give depth to the characters involved. It's a strange thing to have a victim who may have deserved some of what he got. I pitied the family a bit. They were meant to be seen as snobs but the actors did too good of a job making them unlikable but yet sympathetic.Worth a watch if you can enjoy a slow mystery or a play about shades of character in usually aristocratic snobs rather than, perhaps, a thrilling fast paced film about detective work. The other reviewers are right in that the detective is not really as interesting as the family he investigates. He is also not Sherlock and cannot seem to make many deductions for himself or impress the police much or help the family too much either. I would not call him a ""drain,"" though. I think he performed pretty good. His character started off dull and never really got a chance to shine.""Crooked House"" has a good twist but it isn't a great mystery, insofar as a great mystery is an enjoyable back and forth participation of the film and the audience in the act of solving a crime. Although the film has a lengthy run time there wasn't so much focus on piecing together clues.

If the inspector wanted the woman to come along to the station he can ask them or arrest them, what he can't do is get two officers to drag her out by the arms, and as for the papers leading with the banner headline 'Murderers' simply because someone has been taken in for questioning, not in this country in the fifties. 
The cutting of the ladder was a complete joke; you'd have to stand on the ladder to cut it through!
And as for the final scenes where Glenn Close is tearing through the countryside in her sports car, if you were watching her hands on the steering wheel you would have been convinced she was driving through hairpin bends in the Alps - not driving a dead straight road in the English countryside. I just hope she doesn't really drive in that fashion.

Hugely miscast at leading male role, the film starts promising leading slowly into the mystery as in the novel, but deviations from the original source such as ridicolous CIA-anticommunism link weaken the plot. Although interrogations in the big house show somewhat similar effect as the novel, the truths unwinding phase lack enough intrigue and even the great Glenn Close cannot save this picture from being par-average",Crooked House
56,s-andra-1957,Loved it,10,11 June 2021,Agatha Christie is a favourite of mine so yes maybe I'm biased. Love it. One comment was the music it was late 60's music with the original late 40's feel. A tad confusing on that but lovely acting and looks really lovely! Good performances by all the actors!,Crooked House
57,lexva5,A Murder Mystery that could have been better,5,24 March 2020,"This film has very good production values for a period film, sharp dialogue and good actors bar one - the main lead as played by Max Irons. He has neither the presence (despite him being tall) nor the talent to pull this through and makes all the whole film proceedings seem theatrical and false. I never could believe he is a detective of any salt, or a wronged lover or anything else which is a pity because he plays the anchor character that binds all proceedings.
Another thing which bomb the film are the characters are almost all introduced in interview fashion with little interaction between them until half the film is already gone. This part of the story line could have been done better especially when a notable amount of characters are introduced.
Kudos to Glenn Close and Honor Kneafsey. They completely pull it off as well as an unrecognizable Gillian Anderson",Crooked House
58,david-546,Good acting can't hide pedestrian direction,7,3 August 2019,"While it was spicy to become engrossed in another Agatha Christie whodunit what could have been an engrossing film was given a pedestrian feeling by the weak direction. Oh yes the acting was good generally all around naturally spiced up by the performance of Glenn Close and the presence of 60's film legend Terrance Stamp the film otherwise moved at a snails pace. The supporting cast was fine as well as solid character actors played the put upon Leonidas kids and the young actors who played the grandkids were especially perfect in their parts. If there was I felt a miscast it was Max Irons as the gumshoe. But then again since he had an affair with the enticing Sophie a much older man might have seemed out of place. Irons is just too good looking to give off that tired cynical gumshoe look. As my wife said ""Boy was he easy on the eyes"". And that was it. The entire film was easy on the eyes with great sets, a 1950's feel even noirish at times with shadows (where was the black and white) and period costuming. But I shouldn't have been checking my watch while watching.",Crooked House
59,Oggz,Whenever Glenn Close says...,8,25 November 2017,"Whenever Glenn Close says ""I love you more than you'll ever know"" things are bound to end up badly. And they do, in this conspicuously lavish mystery thriller which is well put together but suffers occasionally from some sloppy dialogue editing, revealing that a lot of lines must have been left on the cutting room floor. It's all rather good and wicked fun really, even though it feels like a routine job. Max Irons leads the cast in a role that some years ago would have gone to Jack Davenport, and the production uses his recently beefed up dark good looks to good effect. Some of the cast are experienced Christie actors - Sands, Abbington, Galloway, McKay - they know how it's done and it shows. The youngest two actors are also very good. At nearly two hours long, the ending still feels a little rushed - the way events are being telegraphed for us in the car chase sequence as they happen is a hoot. That's compensated by Gillian Anderson camping around as a boozed-out drama queen, the awkward family dinner scene (there's always one in these stories) and of course the main draw - Glenn Close, who has the misfortune of evoking Cruella De Vil whenever she assumes the British accent. As always, though, she is a delight to watch, her hairdo deliberately coiffed to remind us ever so slightly of Marquise de Merteuil. Other than that, it looks like an expensive show, you'll remember the mid 50s glamour ambiance from the ITV Marple series, and the soundtrack is mostly hot jazz and early rock'n'roll - just check out those vintage cars and turntables which are on display in practically every scene - that's never a bad thing. Watchable.",Crooked House
60,thatfilmperson,Underrated by both crtitics and audiences.,8,14 December 2020,"If you liked:
Knives Out
Murder on the Orient Express
Ten Little IndiansThis is a yet another modern film adaptation of Agatha Christie's mystery crime stories. Now, it isn't that I've never heard anything good about this film; I've actually never heard anything at all, which is surprising, considering how much I enjoyed it. A huge family house, a murder, everybody is a suspect - classic, what else do you want? I liked the story, I liked the cinematography and directing, and the acting was also ok; however, this film, like ""Murder on the Orient Express""; which is also based on Agatha Christie, got very mediocre reviews; and I think I now understand why.First reason is that I'm a bit too obsessed with detective stories so I might let everything except for the mystery elements slide because I'm so immersed in trying to guess the outcome myself. So, if the story is good, I don't notice anything else that might be bad, but that's only for detective films. Despite that, I did notice that the film kept tilting dangerously towards a melodrama, which I hate in any kind of movie that isn't a melodrama (my problem with Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" as well); but overall it didn't seem too unnecessary and distracting. Another reason could be that most people who gave this film bad reviews, especially the critics, are actually familiar with Christie's work (I'm more of a Conan Doyle guy) and are comparing it to the novel rather than to other detective movies. So, for them, after a while ""there is not a great deal happening plot-wise, with the programme not so much gripping us as drifting pleasantly by"". Perhaps when you already know the outcome the adaptation itself isn't that great; although on the other hand once you've read the story first it's almost next to impossible to perceive it as a film and compare it to films; rather than to see it as an adaptation and compare it to the book; so I don't blame them.I enjoyed it a lot more than ""Orient Express"", and it was the first film that was very similar to ""Knives Out"" (which I loved), so it is a film I recommend; especially if you know nothing about the story.",Crooked House

It is so poignant and sad that I personally had tears in my eyes at the end. It hurts the heart and causes incredible sadness. The production here is great, I don't even have words to Express my delight at the directorial work of Gilles Paquet-Brenner. The atmosphere is very, very good, and the game Honor Kneafsey and Glenn Close is just fantastically good. By the way, Josephine Leonides (especially performed by Honor Kneafsey), for me - the most unfortunate and sympathetic in the entire detective genre. I can't help but cry when I think of her. One of the Director's best finds is Edith sitting in a car and imagining Josephine dancing. This scene is really very touching and heartbreaking, as well as the ending.

67,jezfernandez,One of the blandest murder mysteries I've ever seen,5,13 January 2020,"The problem with Crooked House, as other reviewers have said, is that it's just so functional and pedestrian, with absolutely no visual flare. It runs with a functional unravelling of plot, rather than an immersive and atmospheric experience like And Then There Were None. Story-wise, it's is a lot like Rian Johnson's Knives Out, which was executed (excuse the pun) with way more verve.Crooked House feels like a standard episode of Poirot (without Poirot, of course), with a bland leading man. Max Irons can act, but he can't truly captivate. The ending feels weirdly abrupt, with no epilogue to bring the character's story to a close. The stellar cast members - Close, Anderson, Stamp - are sidelined to supporting roles and it hardly seems worth their while being in it.If you want a cracking murder mystery, Knives Out is one of the finest.

After (barely) getting through it, I felt obligated to login to my ancient IMDB account to reduce the stars! Because UGH!Of course I adore Glenn Close (and Agatha Christie), but this film does nothing to honor either of them. The lack of character development left the audience without anyone to get to know or root for (were we supposed to feel anything about that ""grand"" night in Cairo? Oof. About as much chemistry as flat soda). In order to view *all* of the characters as plausible killers, they robbed us of the chance to be involved. Instead of feeling the ""twists"" as the trailer promises, I felt collective groans. The ending felt positively stupid. Christie is brilliant, but this film felt like work.

76,floraposteschild,A crooked little house -- of great actors,7,6 March 2019,"In a world where every other Christie book has been filmed, remade, re-written, updated, altered, and filmed again, why is this the first filmed adaptation of Crooked House? It's because it's not the usual Colonel Mustard in the library with a candlestick story. No eccentric but beloved detective will appear. Thus it's tricky to write and market to both Christie fans, and to audiences that like dramas and thrillers, which is what Crooked House really is. The script is by Julian Fellowes of Downton Abbey fame, and the production is sumptuous and authentic, Ironically, it would be better if it had a lower budget, as they would have had to tighten it up. The same observation applies to the cast, which is almost too star-studded. Individual performances are good (the exception being dull Max Irons), but taken together, instead of coming across as members of a family, they sometimes appear to be actors having a Big Moment at an audition. This includes Glenn Close, whom I love, but come on, tone it down. On the other hand, the character of the murderer has been toned down, which is a bit disappointing, but inevitable. It would make the murderer too easy to spot, which might not have been the case in 1949 when the book was published. [There's a clue! -- or is it? ;) ]",Crooked House

On acting -- Max Irons acting didn't do good for this movie. Being the lead and expected to drive almost all the scenes given his character, it just didn't work.

Certainly it did nothing to break the mold, but with Agatha Christie's name on it, I was perfectly prepared for a dialogue-driven unwinding of a complicated and very English skein.As the movie wound its way toward a climax, though, I began to realize that its side plots of CIA accomplices, mafia relationships, communist offspring and a half dozen other side plots would barely be addressed after having been thrown carelessly into the movie's melting pot of English aristocratic ennui. Even if none were ultimately going to explain the murder at the movie's core, if the story had at least followed one or more of these to some sort of scandalous revelation, it might have given Max Irons' private investigator some actual detecting to do. Instead, the movie came across as such an untamed mess of half-baked elements that I have trouble imagining even the original novel managed to bring them under control. But even though the film totally failed the landing, I can't pretend that I wasn't fairly entertained until it reached that point.The cast is mostly game for the attempt, with the most noteworthy member being Glenn Close, but otherwise they are saddled with cliched characters who hardly speak a word that's more than a device to move the plot along.",Crooked House

The editing feels like it was lazily cut and pasted together by bored intern on their last day. The writing is so dreary and mediocre you wonder if a computer program could have come up with something more inspiring.

Today's technology is so hard to get into and out of touch with - as long as the '40s are trying to be staged in character with a postmortem spirit.

It is not a silly puff piece like those other Agatha Christie Hollywood movies. Some have written and these reviews that it is slow however it is not really slow if you understand the importance British culture and movies give to nuance and atmosphere. It is a quintessential British movie and is to be savored if that is what you like.

However, in this case the film is unfortunately its own crime scene.At least in a book, you can flip back to remind yourself who the characters are, but very quickly in this film, you lose interest in working out who they are, and their complex family relationships.A great opportunity for a good film with a range of well known actors, who in turn are strangled and stabbed in the back by the directing of this film.
This is where the real murder takes place.Enough said for the negatives!However, one lazy and inexcusable fact remains.
The song ""Hippy, Hippy, Shake"" is played by what I think is the Swinging Blue Jeans version. There is a sequence with it being played on a record player
This song was recorded in 1963, and became a big hit in early 1964.
Even the original version by the songwriter, Chan Romero, was not recorded until 1959.The film is set in 1957! An example of very lazy directing, which ruins this film in so many other places.",Crooked House

It's so easy in a film to give away plot elements by focusing too much on certain characters but in this one (one of the few books I hadn't read) I was constantly kept guessing at who the murder was, which is essential in a Christie adaptation, the whole point is to be guessing until the last chapter, or in this case scene, which the film did beautifully. 
Every single character had a motive or motives to be the murderer and they portrayed that really well, in some films it's really obvious that they are only focusing on one or two people and then throw you a curve ball and present a character that has two minutes screen time and no real personality, and you leave feeling cheated because you never could have guessed or figured it out yourself.

While not altogether awful, this film left me disappointed.Why is it that these modernizations try so hard to put the emphasis on needles drama, edgy characters, and artsy cinematography rather than the mystery when the mystery is inevitably what people tune in to see? The first act of the film is spent nearly entirely on side-stories that have little to do with the plot. It's as if they don't have faith in the source material's ability to hold the viewer's attention.Far too much time was spent on the detective's irrelevant backstory and one of the most off-putting romances I've ever been subjected to, (like two cold, dead fish being knocked against each other,) while most of the suspects, and subsequently the mystery, are allowed to fade into the background.If you're familiar with the book I'd suggest skipping this film.

I felt the portrayal of the central character (the P.I) and his ex were a little flat and lacking in character in their delivery overall, this becomes less apparent as their characters develop with the main story and the added drama 'brings them out of their shell' a little. The acting overall from the cast was probably the best aspect of the film. The Writing: Being adapted from an 'Agatha Christie' novel, it was never likely that the writing would be poor and lacking structure, depth and development, its an overall good story including well analysed and depicted characters, though in all honesty she has written better stories than this (at least from what I have seen from the adaptations of them) I much preferred 'Murder on the Orient Express' and 'And then there were none'.The Directing: By far the biggest drawback of the film and it seems this is also the most common factor for most films that are lacking in this day and age, it almost seems as if there are too many productions that rely solely on making the actors/actresses look pretty, then point HD camera equipment at them and hoping for the best, using technology (of any kind) and portraying image and style through the cast are both useful techniques in making good films but it should never outrightly substitute good content and diverse techniques that give any film both an 'in depth feel' to what is happening as well as a level of individual distinction from other films. As this is my first written review I feel a little bad as it is not an overly positive one, though anyone unsure if its simply a question of negative biase instead of simply being constructively critical only needs to check my many 'star ratings' Iv cast on here (there are many that are positive, negative and everything in between) I also intend to start making the effort to write full reviews on the more positive ratings I give too as, as an avid fan of film, I feel filmmaking seems something of a dying art from the start of this century (amongst other art forms) though it has had its gems, that paired with the hard work and often frustration that people within the industry go through to get a quality end product in the very least deserve that recognition.",Crooked House

Whether it be film, television, live theatre or radio dramatization, this point is decisively driven home with the quality of each production presented.The limited release of the Gilles Paquet-Brenner directed mystery crime drama ""Crooked House,"" based on Christie's novel of the same title, saw Max Irons, Terence Stamp, Glenn Close, Gillian Anderson and Christina Hendricks breathe new life into Christie's characters.""Crooked House,"" arguably one of Christie's most twisted tales, revolves around the death of business tycoon Aristide Leonides (Gino Picciano). Sophia de Haviland (Stefanie Martini), Leonides' granddaughter, engages spy-turned-private-detective Charles Hayward (Irons) to investigate her grandfather's murder before Scotland Yard can expose sinister family secrets best left buried.If one is going to adapt well-written material, it goes without saying writers worthy of the task must be assigned the duty of coming up with either a screenplay, teleplay, stage play or radio play fitting of representing the source material. If the writers do not have the skills required to realize the task, there is little point in carrying the production forwards to completion. Fortunately, with Julian Fellowes and Tim Rose Price, screenplay duties were in good hands.While Price is best known for his work on the 1997 Philippe Rousselot directed ""The Serpent's Kiss"" the name Fellowes has become synonymous with quality period drama. If there is any doubt, one would only need cast an eye over the writer's resume. As well as being the writer and creator of the ITV / Masterpiece Theatre series ""Downton Abbey,"" in a career spanning almost four decades, Fellowes has penned the screenplays for several films, including ""Gosford Park,"" ""Vanity Fair,"" ""The Young Victoria,"" ""The Tourist"" and ""Romeo & Juliet.""Great drama requires source material that stands up to the test of time. There is a reason Agatha Christie's novels a continuously adapted to film, television, live theatre and radio. Christie's work is filled with ripe vibrant characters actors can apply their craft to and be much better for having done so.While Irons was not the first actor I would have selected to play Christie's private detective, there is something to be said for being wrong. He turned in a marvellous performance.Irons, best known for playing Lucius in the 2009 Oliver Parker directed thriller ""Dorian Gray"" and as Edward IV in the 2013 historical drama ""The White Queen,"" is the son of English actor Jeremy Irons and Irish actress Sinéad Cusack.Having worked on the 2011 Rodrigo García directed romance ""Albert Nobbs"" and the 2016 television mini-series ""War & Peace,"" Close and Anderson, respectively, are not new to working on period dramas. With a wealth of experience, both actresses have proved time and again they are capable of bringing well-executed performances.When producing a film such as ""Crooked House,"" one needs to be mindful of the musical score. An inappropriate score could easily detract from the dramatic content. The score must add to the drama rather than be a distraction. Hugo de Chaire's work on both the 2012 Paul Kowalski directed drama short ""Battersea"" and the 2015 Andrew Martin written / directed science fiction horror drama ""Capsule,"" provided he was the right person to compose the score for this Christie adaptation.The cinematography, film editing, production design, art direction, set decoration and costume design, carried out by Sebastian Winterø, Peter Christelis, Simon Bowles, Sion Clarke, Rebecca Gillies and Colleen Kelsall, respectively, is exemplary.

Whilst the story is inevitably on the dark side, I am sure something better than this could have been produced. If I was to focus on the worst elements, then the soundtrack must head the list. The sound effects and music were completely overbearing. For example, early in the film we are treated to the unnecessary shot of a bus with a sound effect loud enough to rattle the windows. On turning down the sound to make this a comfortable listening level the young woman in the next scene was almost unintelligible. When later we are introduced to the widow of the murder victim, she is she is speaking so quietly that it is impossible to hear her. This can only be down to the most inept direction and one wonders why the film company bothered to employ one, particularly when we are later treated to the overload thunderstorm which had no relevance other than to drag the film even lower into the depths whilst trying to re-create the cartoon style ""It was a dark and stormy night"".
The characters were poorly defined and almost universally drab and had no entertainment value.
The final scene really dragged the direction down to it's lowest level of incompetence. We had the small car going over the edge of a quarry, purporting to create an explosion big enough to send a fireball out of the quarry. It is well documented that cars crashing in this way simply do not explode in this manner and the very small car used for the scene would not have been able to hold enough fuel to cause such a fireball even if it had been deliberately ignited. Total unbelievable nonsense.
