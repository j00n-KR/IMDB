0,Leofwine_draca,Neat update of a familiar story,7,13 December 2019,"I admit to enjoying UPGRADE, a simple science fiction-oriented twist on the usual revenge storyline. I'll say straight away that the plot is nothing special and has been done plenty of times before; it's the use of familiar but new technology that makes this interesting. The identity of the villains and the supporting characters are quite perfunctory, but the direction is inventive and the film particularly shines in the action scenes, so much so that you wish there were more of them. The main actor commits to his part quite neatly and there are enough decent set-pieces to make this an enjoyable watch, more so than plenty of bigger-budgeted fare.",Upgrade
1,SnoopyStyle,pleasantly surprised,8,20 August 2018,"In the near future, computer augmentations in humans are increasing. Grey Trace (Logan Marshall-Green) is a mechanic and a luddite who is being left behind unlike his wife Asha who works for an innovative tech company. He refurbishes a car for tech tycoon Eron Keen who reveals a new computer chip to them. After an awkward meeting, their computer-driven car sends them to the wrong neighborhood where they are attacked by a team of masked assassins. Grey wakes up as a quadriplegic and a widow. Eron offers to install his AI chip STEM to reconnect his spine and getting him to walk again.This is a nice sci-fi thriller. Logan is doing his Tom Hardy best. He's an one-man show. The sci-fi ideas are solid. If there is one flaw, it's that Eron is obviously the man who set them up and Grey should have figured it out sooner. I like the revenge porn aspect. The fight action is kinetic. There is a very good reveal at the end. I didn't hear anything about this movie and am pleasantly surprised by it.",Upgrade
2,Prismark10,Greaser and chips,6,4 June 2019,"Upgrade sees writer and director Leigh Whannell moving away from horror to low budget futuristic sci fi action thriller.Grey Trace (Logan Marshall-Green) is an old fashioned car mechanic who has little to do with self navigating cars with AI. After he delivers a refurbished car to tech wizard Eron Keen, he is involved in a car accident where he is paralysed by a gang and his wife is killed.Now paralysed for life, Keen offers Grey a chance to walk again by embedding an advanced chip fused to his spinal cord.Not only can Grey walk, the chip communicates with him allowing Grey to track down the people who killed his wife. The chip has given Grey increased strength and speed.This is a no frills entertaining B film. There is a lot of Ex-Machina in the underlying plot but it also as hints of Terminator, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Six Million Dollar Man and even John Wick as Grey is out for revenge.It helps that Marshall-Green has more than a passing resemblance to Tom Hardy.",Upgrade
3,claudio_carvalho,Excellent Australian Sci-Fi,9,26 August 2018,"In the future, the mechanic Grey Trace (Logan Marshall-Green) is happily married with his wife Asha (Melanie Vallejo), who works in a state-of-art technology company. Grey fixes and sells old cars without electronic devices and does not like state-of-art electronic technology. When he sells a car to the genius Eron Keen (Harrison Gilbertson), who owns the most advanced technology company, Grey brings Asha to introduce her to Eron that shows a chip capable to do anything he has just developed. On their way back home, Asha´s car has an electronic breakdown and they have an accident. Soon four men subdue and shot them, killing Asha and leaving Grey tetraplegic. When Eron comes to the hospital to visit Grey, he offers the chip called Stem to be secretly implanted in Grey to give his motion back. Grey accepts and learns the others abilities of Stem. Now he decides to hunt down the criminals that killed his beloved wife. ""Upgrade"" is an excellent Australian sci-fi and maybe the best one released this year. Despite the low-budget (five million-dollar only), the film has top-notch storyline, screenplay, direction and performances and great special effects used only when necessary. The film is full of action and the plot point in the end surprises. This is the type of movie that deserves a sequel. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): Not Available",Upgrade
4,nogodnomasters,I am stem,8,21 August 2018,"In the futuristic city of Leland Park (filmed in Australia), Grey Trace has an automobile accident that was staged and leaves him as a paraplegic. His tech friend (Harrison Gilbertson) implants a computer chip in his neck that allows him to move, but the computer has some interesting side effects (upgrades) and helps him solve the crime and enact revenge. We get a glance at his wife's birth date as 1/13/08. She is thirty-ish so you have an idea of when the film takes place. It is science fiction-action complete with a car chase. The camera cuts away at the graphic scenes but shows the results. Of course, there is a lack of characters, so the mystery aspect is not so much of a mystery. The voice of stem and his control was done in an entertaining fashion. Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Upgrade
5,kosmasp,Always good,8,11 January 2019,"It's always good to have an Upgrade - although we know there is always some strings attached (no pun intended). And while a major twist is more than apparent, the movie is still pretty entertaining and tension filled from start to finish.The main actor (Logan) really has to go through a lot of stuff. You may compare this a bit to Robocop or even Venom I reckon to some degree, but this has some special qualities that take it above and beyond. And again it is only bits from the other movies (comic books) you can compare it to. If you like Science Fiction movies, with action and fun bits - you could go worse (and it looks pretty good too)",Upgrade
6,Sleepin_Dragon,An unexpected gem.,8,20 August 2020,"After ten minutes I came close to switching it off, as I couldn't get into it, it felt as though they were spending too much time showing off future technology, however I stuck with it, and was glad I did, as it develops it really does open up, it became a wonderfully gripping and entertaining sci fi thriller. Very well acted throughout, a pretty original story, and lots of action scenes.The accident really does change the movie up, and the tone, it really is well worth a look, the ending may come as a surprise for some.Very good, 8/10.",Upgrade
7,jboothmillard,Upgrade,6,13 September 2018,"This film had something of a small release, it sounded like something worthwhile, and got positive reviews from critics, so I'm kind of glad I found it at the right time, from the makers of Saw and Insidious, directed by Leigh Whannell (Insidious: Chapter 3). Basically set in the near future, Grey Trace (Logan Marshall-Green) is a stay-at-home mechanic who works for Cobolt, one of the companies contributing to an increase in human computer augmentations. One day, Grey asks his wife Asha (Melanie Vallejo) to help him return a repaired car to his client Eron Keen (Harrison Gilbertson), a famous tech innovator in charge of a rival company called Vessel. They visit Eron at his home, where he reveals his latest creation, an AI chip called STEM that can serve as an auxiliary brain. On their way home in their self-driving car, it malfunctions and Grey and Asha crash into a homeless camp, there four unknown men arrive. They shoot Asha in the stomach and Grey in the neck, his spinal cord is severed, he watches helplessly as Asha bleeds to death. Months later, Grey returns home as a wheelchair-bound quadriplegic, cared for by his mother Pamela (Linda Cropper). Grey has into an intense depression following Asha's death, his inability to move, and the failure of Detective Cortez (Betty Gabriel), assigned to the case for Asha's murder, to identify the attackers. After a failed suicide attempt by overdosing on medication, Grey is visited by Eron, he offers to restore motor functions to his body by surgically implanting STEM into his spine. Grey is initially resistant, but Eron successfully persuades him to go ahead and undergo surgery. Following the operation, Grey regains control of his limbs faster than expected, and he signs a non-disclosure agreement, concealing STEM from everyone, including the police, he must pretend to be paralysed when in public. Whilst looking through case files on his wife's murder, Grey hears the voice of STEM (Simon Maiden) speaking to him, it tells him that it can help him to find the attackers and get revenge. It quickly identifies one of the assailants from a drone video feed, STEM has discovered the man, Serk (Richard Cawthorne), and his cohorts had modified guns implanted into their arms, explaining why police could not identify a murder weapon. Deciding to investigate Serk personally, Grey breaks into his home and discovers he was ""upgraded"" as a result of a secret military experiment, and a lead to a local bar called the Old Bones. Serk returns home and discovers Grey, he overpowers him, STEM convinces Grey to temporarily give up control of his body, he then becomes a lethally efficient fighting machine, killing Serk with little effort. Grey and STEM directing him cover their tracks, but Cortez sees drone footage of Grey in his mobility chair approaching the scene before the murder, but she has no evidence or proof that he is capable of assault, given his quadriplegic condition. Eron has been tracking STEM's movements, he confronts Grey for his vigilantism, Eron is surprised to learn that STEM is speaking to him, he demands that Grey stops any further investigation. Nonetheless, Grey proceeds to the Old Bones and finds the next assailant, Tolan (Christopher Kirby), with STEM's aid, he overpowers him, and despite being squeamish, allows STEM to torture Tolan to get information, until he is dead. Before dying, Tolan reveals the name of the ringleader, Fisk (Benedict Hardie), Grey leaves the bar, but suddenly collapses, STEM explains that Eron is attempting to shut them down remotely, STEM directs Grey to a hacker nearby. After an arduous struggle, hacker Jamie (Kai Bradley) manages to remove STEM's input guard, severing Eron's connection. But Jamie abandons them upon realising they Grey has been followed by the assailants and two Vessel employees, Fisk kills the armed employees while Grey, with STEM's control restored, murders Fisk's companion, Jeffries (Michael M. Foster). Returning home, Pamela is shocked to discover he can walk, forcing him to reveal STEM's existence, he is then interrogated by Cortez, as his wheelchair was found suspiciously abandoned at the Old Bones. Neither Grey or Pamela make a confession, but Cortez has planted a discreet listening device on Grey's jacket. Grey is exhausted and broken up over the murders he has committed, but STEM refuses to let him give up, telling him that Fisk will eventually track them down and kill them. STEM demonstrates it no longer has to obey Grey's commands and forces him to leave the house to hunt Fisk down. While driving, they discover Cortez's listening device and spot her chasing after them, STEM causes an automated car to malfunction, causing a crash and allowing them to escape. Cortez survives the crash, she returns to Grey's home shortly after, where Pamela reveals the truth about STEM. Grey and STEM eventually find Fisk, at gunpoint Grey asks why he killed Asha, Fisk reveals he was only hired to paralyse Grey, so he could be implanted with STEM. Grey and Fisk get into a fight, but Fisk being upgraded can anticipate his movements, STEM tells Grey to come up with a distraction, so he taunts him about the death of his brother Serk, this gives STEM the upper hand to kill Fisk. Searching Fisk's phone, there is a message from Eron, suggesting he orchestrated everything to make Grey the test subject for STEM. At Eron's home, Cortez holds Grey at gunpoint before he can kill Eron, who reveals that STEM has been setting things in motion from the beginning, taking control of Eron's life and company in pursuit to become human. STEM learned that Grey's body was completely unaugmented, it caused the crash and told Eron the right things to say so that Grey would agree to its surgical insertion. After revealing its plan, STEM kills Eron and attempts to kill Cortez, in a desperate effort to resist STEM, Grey forces his arm holding a gun to his neck and shoots himself. Grey wakes in a hospital bed, fully in control of his body, with Asha sitting by his side, he is convinced that everything he has experienced has been a dream following the car crash. However, the truth is that STEM has taken full control of Grey's body, Grey's mind snapped because of the psychological strain he exerted attempting to resist STEM's control. STEM has placed Grey's consciousness into an idyllic fantasy world to live out the rest of his existence peacefully, to tie up the loose ends, STEM murders Cortez and leaves to enter society in its new body. Also starring Steve Danielsen as Jeff Handley, Abby Craden as Kara and Richard Anastasios as Wen. Marshall-Green gives a reasonable performance as the normal guy turned into a Terminator-style vigilante, it is a clever concept, a Siri-like being contained in a super-computer chip helping an ordinary man get revenge for his wife's death, but slowly the twists and turns reveal there is more to it than that, I can see comparisons to RoboCop, it is almost rediculous, but it has good pace, special effects and gory moments, an interesting science-fiction action horror. Good!",Upgrade
8,BA_Harrison,"Better, stronger, faster.",8,15 October 2018,"The plot for Upgrade is pure comic book nonsense, equal parts Death Wish and The Six Million Dollar Man (or M.A.C.H. 1, for those who read 2000A.D. in the '70s). It concerns a quadriplegic man, Grey Trace (Logan Marshall-Green), who agrees to be a guinea pig for an experimental implant that not just restores his movement, but makes him superhuman with incredible computational powers; this enables him to hunt down those people responsible for the death of his wife (Melanie Vallejo) and for putting him in a wheelchair. Silly it may be, with the 'upgraded' Grey possessing Matrix-style fighting skills and able to converse with his implant (named 'STEM'), but it's also hugely entertaining, the film playing out as a high-tech mystery, albeit one packed with very satisfying action scenes and topped off with gnarly gore.Written and directed by Leigh Whannell, who also wrote Saw, the film belies its meagre budget of $5 million, with impressive CGI effects, great vehicular stunts and incredible fight sequences - if Keanu's 'I know kung fu' scene had you whooping with delight, wait until you see the first time that Grey hands over control to STEM - I had a grin almost as wide as the guy who loses the fight.After plenty of intrigue and action, an unexpected 'twist' ending rounds things off in style, making this an Upgrade well worth investing in.",Upgrade
9,BandSAboutMovies,I wasn't ready for Upgrade!,10,25 September 2018,"Grey Trace is a man out of time. He'd rather stay in his garage and work on old school combustion engines while the rest of the world wants electric cars that drive themselves. As more and more people are augmenting their human bodies with computers -- like the work his wife Asha does for Cobolt -- he keeps himself 100% human. But his life is about to change.Grey has just finished a car for Eron Keen, a mysterious tech inventor who has removed himself from humanity to create life-changing things for his company, Vessel. The guy has his own cloud -- not the internet, a cloud -- in his home. While there, he shows the Traces his STEM chip that serves as a second brain.Grey obviously hates the idea, saying that when he sees that chip, he sees more jobs going away. As he and his wife discuss it on the way home, their self-driving car leads them to the slums where Grey grew up. Their car crashes and a gang murders Asha and severs our hero's spinal cord, forcing him to watch his wife die.Between the death of his wife, his near-total loss of mobility, being forced to be cared for by his mother and the police's (including Blumhouse regular Betty Gabriel) inability to catch the killers, Grey decides to kill himself. That's when Eron offers to install STEM into his body with one catch -- he can't tell anyone.The chip is a miracle, allowing Grey to move again. Soon, he's exceeding the limits he had even when he was unharmed. And then, STEM starts talking to him and explaining how he can get revenge.Upgrade is a movie that continually exceeded my expectations and challenged my assumptions. It starts like a modern version of Death Wish mixed with RoboCop before becoming a sly critique on the invasion of technology into our lives and the military industrial complex. What seems like a balletic modern fight scene is nuanced by the fact that our hero is no longer in control of his body, trying to hide his eyes from the violent vengeance that he is unleashing.Grey eventually comes face to face with the men who ruined his life, but even they aren't what they seem. I loved the way this film mixes Cronenberg body horror with military tech -- I've never seen a bad guy who can sneeze nanite missiles into your bloodstream before. And the way they arms conceal guns that are loaded along their bloodlines is a stroke of genius.Once our hero starts using his new brain to try and learn why his wife was killed and he was crippled, everyone is against him, including the police and Eron. It all races to a brutal and surprising conclusion where our hero and his new brain both get what they want.No more spoilers. I'm overjoyed that I came into this movie cold and was continually surprised and delighted by the most minute details of the script.Filmed in Australia and featuring a cast of Down Under actors, the home of writer/director Leigh Whannell, who you may know better as Specs from the Insidious movies. He's also written the Saw and Insidious films, as well as directing Insidious: Chapter 3. Of all the Blumhouse releases I've seen, this one feels intensely personal. It had me on the edge of my seat, waiting for each new fight, each new reveal, each new surprise.",Upgrade
10,CinemaSerf,Much more original AI concept-thriller...,7,12 August 2020,"This is much more of a testament to decent, taut, writing and direction than it is of finding some big Hollywood star to just go through the motions of a shallow, seen-it-all-before sci-fi thriller. Logan Marshall-Green is technophobe ""Grey"" who when travelling home with his wife one night finds their automatic car takes a wrong turning, with fatal consequences. Only a state-of-the art silicon chip can return him to some sense of normality. Once installed, however, he discovers that the chip (""Stem"") can talk to him and that it has a bit of a mind of it's own - so when he sets off to discover the perpetrators of his misery, it ostensibly helps him - and gives him rather quality ninja skills at the same time. Harrison Gilbertson isn't up to much as the billionaire tech guy, though, a sort of Dane DeHaan light; but the plot has enough jeopardy and quite a few twists to keep it moving in a far less predictable manner than you might have expected at the outset.",Upgrade
11,view_and_review,ENCORE!,9,2 January 2019,Oooh I am so giddy. Encore! Encore!This movie was so exciting. This is the best hi-tech sci-fi movie of 2018 in my book. The best I've seen in quite some time.After tech skeptic Gray Trace is crippled and his wife killed he is offered the opportunity to be made whole again by an experimental surgery. After the surgery he decides to pursue his wife's killers with the benefit of an upgrade. That upgrade is in the form of an extremely powerful chip in his neck. His hunt leads him from one hair-raising scenario to another.I love the hi tech sci-fi movies. They usually cause a clash between ethics and progress with one having to trump the other. This one was no different. But this movie was also very exciting and high octane. There were more than a few Ooh and Aah moments.The story was right on par with the action. This was one of those movies after its conclusion you keep running the events over in your head to look for holes. Maybe I'm just blinded by my euphoria but I found no holes in this one. This sleeper of a movie should be on every tech movier's must watch list.,Upgrade
12,morrison-dylan-fan,Update Upgrade.,10,10 February 2019,"With a poll taking place on ICM for the best films of 2018,I decided it was time to start digging into the pile of discs waiting to be viewed from the year. Greatly enjoying the first Saw and Insidious films he made with genre auteur James Wan, I got set to see what Leigh Whannell upgrades when behind the camera.View on the film:Backed by the grinding Trent Reznor-style Industrial hum from composer Jed Palmer,writer/director Leigh Whannell is joined by The Mule (2014-a film co-written/starring Whannell) cinematographer Stefan Duscio in giving the futuristic setting a pristine metallic appearance, lining Trace corridor to revenge with a subtle design on an inability to escape from machinery surrounding him.Slashing at the knife-edge atmosphere over the build up to revenge attacks, Whannell stamps Trace's actions with burning neon reds and purples which simmer down to metallic whites as Trace calculates his next line of attack.Pulling the raw nerves of his Horror past into Action, Whannell carves out incredibly visceral set-pieces, charged by an excellent precision of keeping Trace framed in the middle of the screen, which allow for the fights to pack a real crunch thanks to the smooth visibility of each move, and the move to speed-up footage highlighting Trace gradual loss of control of his own body movements. Set in the near-future, the screenplay by Whannell wires Cyberpunk Sci-Fi anxiety with raw revenge Action and insidious Body Horror at an outstanding upload speed. Taking his wife and the ability to move his limbs within the first 10 minutes,Whannell slams Grey Trace's nose to the grindstone as he is left washed out in the corner with only basic machines.Getting what looks to be a helping hand, Whannell places Grey in a thrilling vice-like grip, with the revelation that his computer body chip ""Stem"" can talk to him, leading to push and pull battles over how far Grey goes with his revenge. Tapping into Cyberpunk fears of man verses machine, Whannell unleashes a knock-out twist ending, which in a similar move to Saw,changes perspective on what the viewer believes they have seen. Wired in by Harrison Gilbertson's eerie, dead-eyed Eron Keen, Simon Maiden gives a pitch-perfect performance as Stem, whose calm, smoothing tone Maiden slowly snaps at the edges. Left a broken man, Logan Marshall-Green gives a blistering turn as Grey, thanks to Marshall-Green feeding Grey's sorrow into a burning rage which gets twisted into doubt, as Grey begins to regret his upgrade.",Upgrade
13,trashgang,nice surprise,8,19 March 2019,"Came across this one by reading that this was now available on DVD in our region. So I thought, should I give it a try because not everybody is fan of this kind of flick. Be honest, Blade Runner (1982° is still far the best AI flick.But what was this, I loved it from start to the end. The effects used are really well done, the use of the camera, the steadycam, evrything to give this a special feeling do works out. And even as people say this is just anothetr SF flick I can say that even horror buffs can watch this because once the AI takes over some nasty things do appear and one killing is pure gore.The fight scene's maybe you can laugh with it but for me it did work out and it was easy to see when human or humanoid takes over. Really well done flick way above mediocre. If you do like your SF on the dark site or are into brutality pick this one up.

14,deloudelouvain,Very pleasantly surprised.,8,19 April 2020,"Every now and then you stumble on a movie you never heard of and that turns out to be a very good movie. I watched Upgrade two years after it came out, never heard anybody talking about it, never saw a trailer or so, so my expectations were just not that high, but it was a pleasant surprise, a very pleasant surprise. If you like me love some weird sci-fi stories then you can't really go wrong with this movie. There is plenty of good action, nice futuristic gadgets (certainly for a low budget movie), some decent acting even though I didn't know anybody from the cast. Leigh Whannell did a good job writing and directing this movie. I will for sure look out for more of his movies as he clearly has a good vision on how a sci-fi movie should look like. I can only recommend you watch this little low budget gem.",Upgrade
15,christopher-underwood,"Action wise, this is impressive and pretty relentless",7,6 March 2021,"I was keen to watch this after seeing Logan Marshall-Green in the remarkable The Invitation. He is good in this too, having the difficult job of playing part human, part robot and the film is a remarkable achievement, especially considering the low budget. For me though, however, this comes across of something like a cross between Robocop and Knight Rider with an element of The Invisible Man. Of course, the same director did follow this with a rather innovative and successful Invisible Man of his own. Here I found it difficult to be concerned for this robotic revenge enterprise and with so much AI around in the end found myself concerned only for the black lady cop, who really did seem human. Action wise, this is impressive and pretty relentless, which I guess was the intention and what most viewers will expect and be happy with. Left me a bit cold, but then thats just me.",Upgrade
16,siderite,The standard to which all sci-fi action movies should be measured against,9,2 March 2019,"The plot is not particularly original, but its execution is. A near future detective story where a guy loses everything and thus has to do go through some extraordinary changes to reclaim his life. But is it his life? The film reaches its conclusion then leaves the viewer asking questions and considering possibilities. It does all it needs to be true sci-fi. The action scenes are also very well done, suggesting both incredible technological speed and power, but remaining visually crisp so even our unevolved human brains can see it happening.Considering that this is a low budget movie that not many have heard of, it is a crime than so many other ""blockbusters"" reach cinemas and earn more money. If someone would just invent a machine to thwart marketing, the world would be a better place. Think about a book that you've read or a film you've watched, you loved and it ended and you wanted more and you hoped for a sequel. This would the perfect one to turn into a Netflix series. It does have cliched characters, but only up to a point, then you just feel the need to see where they go and what they do next. Both scientific speculation and monkey brain desires are satisfied by the script and action.Bottom line: if you like sci-fi, this is a must see. My only complain is that I want so much to see what happens next and a sequel is unlikely. Netflix? Help?",Upgrade
17,Hellmant,Logan Marshall-Green actually goes beyond just doing a poor man's Tom Hardy imitation this time!,9,8 June 2018,"'UPGRADE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A sci-fi horror flick written and directed by Leigh Whannell, who also co-wrote such hit horror movies as 'SAW' and 'INSIDIOUS' (and their first sequels). The film stars Logan Marshall-Green as a paralyzed man who uses an experimental computer chip to give him special powers and avenge his wife's murder. The film costars Betty Gabriel, Benedict Hardie and Harrison Gilbertson. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also a modest hit at the Box Office as well. I loved it. Grey Trace (Marshall-Green) is involved in a car accident, with his wife Asha (Melanie Vallejo), and then the couple are viciously attacked by criminals. She's murdered in the incident, and he's paralyzed for life. Grey is then offered a chance to walk again, by having a computer chip embedded in his spinal cord. The operation is a success, but the computer chip also begins talking to him as well, and turning him into a super human fighting machine. With his new skills, Grey can also now avenge his wife's murder, but he quickly puts himself back in grave danger (in the process) too.Like his buddy James Wan, Whannell is really good at creating a nostalgic genre movie feel, similar to the B-movie hits of yesteryear. Marshall-Green is decent in the lead, and he actually goes beyond just doing a poor man's Tom Hardy imitation this time. The film is fun, disturbing, memorable, and it has a really good and dark twist at the end too. I'm sure genre movie fans will love it, and a sequel is inevitable.",Upgrade
18,thesar-2,Accepted,10,2 September 2018,"Talk about the best title. This took from so many other great films and...did just that.Normally, I don't give films 5/5 stars in the first viewing. Generally, I start with 4 or 4½ stars and upon repeat viewings or thought, it gets UPGRADED to 5/5 stars. Not here. Not now...in the future.Let me preface: I'm not a Sci-Fi Guy. It's not my go-to film genre. But, every once in a while I'll take a chance, a stab in the dark and give a movie a chance. Most are clichéd, and while ambitious, still don't push the button for me that needs to excel the project. One that comes to mind here is Ex Machina. Oh, so close.This movie, which reminded me of ARQ, The Terminator, The Matrix trilogy, Her, The Crow, Predestination, Blade Runner, Monkey Shines, Robocop, John Wick and, yeah, Ex Machina amongst others, gathered up the others and spit them out. This seemed to take the next evolutionary step and proceeded. Bravo.(Full disclosure: this is NOT a time travel/loop movie or exactly like the aforementioned movies, but it did give me those vibes.)Stuck in the past, future man, Not-Tom Hardy, is assaulted and his wife murdered one night. Months later, now living as a full-time paraplegic, he's given the opportunity to, well, Upgrade back to human status and help solve the crime of his wife's murder. And by upgrade, I mean thoroughly transformed into an A.I. fighting machine. Watch out bad guys.It seems these indie films are constantly evolving without involving a higher budget. Again: bravo. I love seeing these gems and seeing where they'll go with the restraints only on budget and not on imagination. This one kept feeling old, but new and kept impressing me. I waited for it to let me down and when it presented it would, it took another and final turn that elevated my rating to 5/5 stars.I LOVED this movie. Please don't make a sequel. It could have one, sure, but this movie ended perfectly. Told a complete story and I left me wanting nothing more. VERY WELL DONE and I can't recommend this enough.***Final thoughts: Yes, I presented this with 5/5 stars, but that doesn't mean it was perfect. It just impacted me so much with 20x more positives than any negatives. Again, I'm not a Sci-Fi Guy...but this might convert me if movies keep upgrading like this one.",Upgrade
19,cherold,"impressive, creative, and rather grim",8,18 April 2019,"This ingenious sci-fi revenge movie follow a quadriplegic, injured by thugs who also murdered his wife, who is given a chip that allows him to move and, as it turns out, contains an artificial intelligence that can give him super fighting skills.I watched this movie because the fight scenes looked cool (and they totally are; fast and beautifully choreographed), but I also had to brace myself for the revenge-movie set up. And yeah, it's pretty grim to watch a guy's life being destroyed. But in spite of moments of humor and solid action, overall this is rather on the grim side all through.I was impressed how well the script holds together. I'm not saying you couldn't pick apart a few things, but for the most part anything that gave me pause at time - it's weird that happened, it's weird he said that - makes sense at the end. Things that seem wrong are actually offering useful information. The story makes more sense than most tricky sci-fi AI films.It's still a little grim for my tastes, but I've become very wimpy about downbeat entertainment over the years, so don't take that to heart. It's a smart movie with some terrific action that is well worth taking a look at.",Upgrade

22,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The genre gets an upgrade.,8,2 September 2018,"'Upgrade (2018)' actually feels like a breath of fresh air. It's a remarkably exciting and visceral sci-fi flick that's been beautifully achieved on an incredibly small budget, especially considering its sizeable ambition, to the point that it easily competes with its better-funded peers, even in terms of sheer visuals alone. It really does look gorgeous, with beautiful, slightly neon-infused cinematography and sweeping, CGI-enhanced establishing shots expertly combining to create a near-future setting that's sleek, gritty and altogether more realistic than is perhaps usual. This is how you do a low-budget feature; it truly stands the test of the big-screen and deserves to be seen alongside the biggest blockbusters of the year, most of which it easily outshines. The film itself progresses perfectly from its initial 'revenge-thriller' roots into much more 'high-concept' - even horrific - fare, casting aside its genre boundaries in a wonderfully self-assured way. There's more to it than you'd perhaps think, with it's central dynamic being an incredibly compelling, nuanced and evolving one that constantly drives the experience. The way the lead learns to work with his newfound companion is believable and unique, with their hands-on and tech-savy approaches contrasting wonderfully. Much of the picture is dedicated to the investigation that comes when our hero decides he wants to find the bad guys and that's honestly really intriguing on its own. It's also nice that the protagonist isn't just seeking bloodthirsty vengeance (though bloodshed isn't spared), instead simply seeking the identities of his foes and getting caught up in the danger of the situation against his wishes. As I mentioned, there's quite a bit of blood in this, too, as several phenomenally choreographed, fast-paced action-sequences are punctuated by moments of shocking, tangible gore. These moments really do make you wince, as they should. Logan Marshall-Green does a phenomanal job in the lead role, as you totally believe that he's a man not fully in control of his own body. He acts with his face in a manner totally opposite to that of his body and it is incredibly entertaining to watch. On the whole, there's an invigoratingly subversive streak that runs throughout, with the piece really feeling like something that hasn't quite been done before. This means you won't necessarily expect where it's going to go next (even if the broad strokes you'd anticipate might be there), as it thankfully always restrains from dipping into the more typical and mundane plot-points it could pull out at any given moment. The movie really is a character-driven experience, one pushed forward by a brilliant, all-encompassing screenplay and a fantastic central performance. It's incredibly entertaining and is enhanced by a daringly dark ending that dips into horror in a devilishly delightful way. Not only is it an incredibly enjoyable and exhilarating experience, it's also easily one of the best pictures of the year. 8/10",Upgrade
23,ThomasDrufke,A New Twist on Revenge,9,10 June 2018,"Besides the really big releases, it didn't feel like there were a whole lot of small releases that I was looking forward to. But what's better than being absolutely shocked with the quality of a film? There's nothing better. Upgrade is a literal upgrade to most everything in theaters right now, and is one of the best things Blumhouse has put out over the last few years, and that's saying something. With a twist on the A.I./futuristic genre, by having the main character take on the functionality of an A.I. while still remaining human, Upgrade gives a violent revenge story a new angle. With a tight budget, a great lead performance, and some surprising thrills, Blumhouse should have another box office smash hit if word of mouth plays as well as it should. 9.3/10",Upgrade

It seems to blend things we've seen before - a future with ubiquitous technology, a bionic man, computers that can take control, and a revenge thriller trying to unravel a conspiracy - but it does so pretty stylishly, and there are some interesting twists along the way. There are occasional moments that don't make sense, but the pace and high production quality made those forgivable.

Some violence, but done differently to be interesting. Acting, dialogue, sets, props, cinematography all above expectations for a low budget Aussie film.

28,The-Sarkologist,"Woah, just Woah",10,16 June 2018,"Upgrade: 2018 (Leigh Whannel) - 10
 At first this film seemed to just be about this guy who is made a quadriplegic during a robbery, and witnesses his wife being killed in the said robbery, and after receiving a chip that makes him walk again ends up going on a killing spree. As it turns out this film is much, much more than what it appears from the trailers. It is one of those films where once you get to the end you pretty much sit there, absolutely stunned, saying to yourself ""I never saw that coming"".
 Okay, my love of this film may appear to be biased in that it is an Australian production and filmed in the city in which I live, but honestly, there are a lot of Australian films that I simply can't stand (and as for being filmed in Melbourne, well, most of Australia's famous films are filmed here, with maybe the exception of Mad Max). No, the reason I loved this film is because it is a refreshing break from all of the remakes, reboots, and sequels that seems to be swarming across the big screen these days. Oh, and also because while its story line may not be the most original, it does have a pretty awesome twist, it has guts to go where most films don't go, and it it a really awesome film to watch, especially with the twist at the end.
 The film is set in the near future, but then again you could even say that it is still fairly close to our own world. Robots are pretty much taking on all the tasks that humans used to do, and our protagonist was an automechanic, but there is also the added thing that we have self driving cars, and implants. Well, the film doesn't make it known whether implants, or upgrades, are actually common among the people, but what we do get is this dichotomy between the modern and the old fashion.
 What stands out in this film is that there is more than one person that finds sticking to the old ways as being the best. Another thing is that in these types of films the cops generally come across as clueless, but not this one. She certainly is able to see through a lot of what is going on, even finding it suspicious that a quadriplegic happens to be wondering around a neighbourhood where there happens to have been a murder. Mind you, I can't really see her superiors as being all that impressed when she suggests that this wandering quadriplegic happens to be the one who has killed a battle hardened soldier.
 I would like to say more, but I will resist it because this is very much one of those 'Usual Suspects' types of films where everything is explained at the end, but you never actually saw it coming because you had been pretty much distracted by other events, or swallowed the rubbish that happens to be fed to you, and not expecting that what you may be watching might actually be working to steer you away from where you are heading. However, all I can say is that this is one fine film.",Upgrade

This is independent low budget film making at its best! The film is sensational! The music, visuals, effects, acting and entire production is top class.This is one of the most unique and best vengeance films I've seen, and I found it so much better than other vengeance films like 'John Wick'. Logan Marchall-Green (looking very much like Tom Hardy) is fantastic as Grey Trace, who's wife gets murdered. This is a great script, with great editing and great sound. The film is also completely unpredictable and Logan is one of the most likable protagonists I've seen lately. He completely sold it to me. This is one hell of an enjoyable film!",Upgrade
31,tomgillespie2002,Exciting sci-fi constructed around one great idea,6,13 October 2018,"Leigh Whannell's Upgrade feels like the type of film made for Netflix; a sort of mid-level science-fiction story constructed around one intriguing idea, and bulked up with elements from other, better genre movies. It's also the type of film I would consider for a few seconds whilst flicking through my Netflix queue, before opting for something else with a more compelling premise. Set in the very-near future, the film's main hook comes from a game-changing microchip that, when surgically planted in a willing - or unwilling host - allows body and foreign body to communicate with each other. Of course, it doesn't stop there. The implant can also turn down your nerve endings so you don't feel pain, and - with the host's permission - can fully operate your body and turn you into a hand-to-hand master. This comes in handy for grease monkey Grey Trace (Logan Marshall-Green) when the plot demands he seeks revenge on some baddies.As well as possessing one of cinema's all-time most ridiculous names, Grey spends his time fixing classic muscle cars and drinking beer. This near-future is complete with iHomes and self-driving cars, but Grey is far more comfortable getting his hands dirty. His wife Asha (Melanie Vallejo), on the other hand, works for one of the big tech companies and has fully embraced this new digital, hands-free world. Opposites do attract however, and Grey invites his wife along to the isolated home of tech genius Eron Keen (Harrison Gilbertson), his most high-profile customer. Eron, who is clearly inspired by Elon Musk, is withdrawn, strange and undeniably brilliant, and also eager to show off his latest invention: a microchip he dubs ""a new, better brain."" On the journey home, their car experiences a catastrophic error, sending the couple down dark streets before crashing and overturning. Injured, they are then preyed upon a gang of masked criminals, who murder Asha and cripple Grey. Waking up paralysed from the neck down and understandably angry, Grey is offered a solution when Eron makes a rare public appearance at the hospital.If all of this sounds familiar, it's because you've seen it before in countless other movies. Upgrade's greatest achievement is that it doesn't make you wish you were watching something else, and instead pulls you along into its world. This is mainly down to some spectacular action scenes, which combine well-choreographed hand-to-hand fighting with some nifty camerawork, which bends and turns along with Grey as he dishes out violence with a look of both confusion and excitement splashed cross his face. There's something hilarious about a body acting independently of the face, and Whannell wisely chooses to play up these moments. Marshall-Green is often unfairly referred to as a bargain-bin Tom Hardy (who is currently dealing with his own parasitic second personality in Venom), and while he fails to convince as a leading man, he's clearly enjoying himself. Produced by Blumhouse Productions, who churn out huge hits with incredibly modest budgets, Upgrade is infused with a grainy, B-movie aesthetic that give it an exploitation vibe and slightly grimy feel. I mean that as a compliment, and it's a shame that the excitement generated by the outrageous action scenes couldn't be replicated in the generic beats of the main story.",Upgrade
32,cruise01,Surprisingly a great science fiction film that was very misleading from the look of the movie trailer.,10,1 September 2018,"Upgrade (5 out of 5 stars).Upgrade is surprisingly a great science fiction horror film. More sci-fi than horror really. I feel like it does have that Blade Runner, or Dredd movie tone. It does have a great amount of action sequences, car chase, and a plot that is engaging. Involving the future setting were technology has advanced too self driving cars, body parts implants of A.I., a gun installed inside a person's arm, or weapons installed into people.The plot was awesome. It follows Grey (Logan Marshall-Green). A mechanic who still prefers things the old fashion way. Such as cars without computers. Doing things yourself without A.I. doing everything for you such as making meals, greeting you at home, reading your mind to take you to a place. Grey and his wife Asha (Melanie Vallejo) both take a built muscle car to Dr. Eron (Harrison Gilbertson) who has a built A.I. that nobody knows about. As Grey and Asha are heading home they get caught in an accident. Were a group of guys attack them. Leaving Grey paralyzed. His friend Dr. Eron decides to help him and installing the A.I. called stem into his back to help him move. Grey than takes justice matters into his own hands with the help of stem. The film is fast paced. Next thing you know Grey is going after each one of the bad guys. Letting Stem take control of his body to fight back. Even the bad guys have upgrades such as guns inside their arms. There is a lot of shoot them up action sequences. It does get a little gory on the fight scenes. Logan Marshall-Green was great. Playing the lead that prefers to live a life without the use of technology but is stuck when he has no choice but to use Stem. Betty Gabriel plays a detective that is following the traces of bodies of criminals that is leading back into Grey's case. She was also good too. Harrison Gilbertson was good playing an awkward researcher who designed Stem. The music score was great. It was done by Jed Palmer. May not be as great like Blade Runner's score. But it lives up there. The cinematography by Stefan Duscio was good too. Capturing some great action sequences. Sometimes having the camera rotate around to create a little chaos but it was not confusing nor nauseating like the camera shaking technique. Writer/director Leigh Whannel did a fantastic job making this film. He wrote movies like Saw series and Insidious movies. His take on a science fiction project was great. He kept the plot interesting, plenty of action, and a script that leads to a big twist ending. The twist was surprising and ended the film in a great high note. Overall, Upgrade is a great science fiction film. The plot kept you invested as a revenge thriller setting with future gadgets. The action sequences were great. The music, cinematography was good. And the direction and script kept the movie running at a great pace and a twist that leaves you talking after.",Upgrade
33,Floated2,Overlooked Sci-fi gem,9,13 March 2019,"Very impressed and most relatively did not know much of this film prior to watching. Though have heard that Upgrade had some similarities to the other film released in 2018- Venom (though of course that was a much bigger film). Having yet to see Venom, one cannot make the comparisons fully, though can see the similarities. Upgrade is quite an intelligent and more thought provoking film than initially assumed.Lead by a great lead performance from Logan Marshall-Green, and a good supporting cast, this film is quite of hidden gem which should have been far more known. Perhaps it's summer release date and lower budget is a reason as to why this film was overlooked. None the less, what makes it great and highly entertaining is the overall plot and the creativeness within its story. Easy character to root for and we are wanting to see what happens next.There are several twists in the end which ties everything up together and makes it better. It begins as relatively a simply sci-fi drama with its introduction, then eventually descends and becomes more of an action sci-fi flick which is necessary. The violence isn't too over the top and is great in small doses (reminded me of the violence in Drive). Another thing, if Upgrade is relatively short where it doesn't completely drag along the way like some other films.Upgrade also isn't as completely dark and serious as initially thought it would be be. There are some cheesy one liners by Logan and some scenes added for comedic effort, but in the end it works out. Great visuals and overall a well done sci-fi futuristic feel of a film. Highly recommend.",Upgrade
34,eddie_baggins,A fun and frantic Sci-Fi/Actioner that's destined for cult status,8,10 February 2019,"It's not like Australian export Leigh Whannell had much left to prove in the filmmaking department after helping create two of the most successful horror franchises of the modern era in the forms of the Saw and Insidious franchises but with low-budget sci-fi actioner Upgrade, Whannell has once more showcased his growing skills as a filmmaker and created an example of what can be created with a low-end budget but lots of ideas and creativity.After debuting as a director with 2015's Insidious: Chapter 3, after year's of supporting turns as an actor and writer/producer with filmmaking buddy and all-round legend James Wan, Whannell has shown considerable growth as a presence behind the camera and as a writer with Upgrade, a simplistic and recognisable tale that may walk familiar beats to what we've seen before but with a fresh bout of imagination.Produced and financed by horror master Jason Blum of Blumhouse fame, Upgrade see's Whannell migrate out of the horror landscape with this more 80's infused offering, that offers up plenty of brutal and bleak action ticks whilst also delivering an in many ways believable sci-fi parable that moulds in aspects of 2001's computer menace Hal, Ropocop's human/robot hybrid and a futuristic world (shot in Australia) that feels cut from the same cloth as Dark City.Upgrade's the type of film that has almost too many ideas and components to delve into over its fairly quick-paced 90 minutes, meaning that not all of Whannell's offerings and characters feel completely lived in (most obvious Benedict Hardie's chief baddie Fisk and his gang of out of the ordinary ""hand"" guns for hire and Harrison Gilbertson's computer genius Eron Keen) but when we are following Logan Marshall Green's mechanic, turned quadriplegic, turned one man revenge army Grey, on his quest to unlock the identity of those responsible for the death of his wife and the cause of his wheelchair bound condition, Upgrade becomes the type of cult film in waiting that will allow Whannell's film a long-standing reputation moving forward.With a gritty and realistic vibe that fits in perfect with its more b-grade concept, Whannell has a blast bringing Grey's tale to life as he turns from a depressed shell of a man into a computer operated wrecking ball that gels brilliantly with Green's deadpan delivery (in both spirit and body) of a man not in control of his new mind/body and Whannell's vibrant and energetic action sequences that are an absolute blast to sit through.Final Say -A fun, fast and most importantly likeable sci-fi action hybrid, Upgrade is a fantastically realised low-budget offering that puts most similar high-end counterparts to shame.Another impressive feat of filmmaking from Whannell, Upgrade may at times play it a little too close to the rulebook and walk familiar plot lines but when it kicks into gear, Upgrade provides a highly entertaining ride, making it a film that is undoubtedly heading for cult status in the very near future.4 arm guns out of 5",Upgrade

37,matthewssilverhammer,RoboCop meets John Wick meets Big Hero 6,8,8 June 2018,"Upgrade is RoboCop meets John Wick meets Big Hero 6; a mash-up we never knew we wanted but should be glad we got.
It hearkens back to a time when filmmakers made movies that were fun, dark and thoughtful all at the same time. An age-old fable about the relationship between humans and developing technology, it posits that maybe the tech itself isn't to be feared, but the power technology can give to those who wield it should be. 
Set in the near future, a man loses his wife and his limbs all in one night after their self-driving car malfunctions, leaving them to the mercy of a group of non-feeling muggers. He opts for an experimental surgery that places a powerful chip in his body that allows him to gain back full ""control"" over his faculties. Quickly, the implanted chip, Stem (think a dark, disembodied Baymax), begins to assert more power than expected, dramatically and thematically capturing how trauma can split is into two different people. 
It's like a RoboCop 2.0, with Marshall-Green fully realizing the physicality of his character, even if his more nuanced vocal and emotional delivery are lacking (ala Schwarzenegger or Van-Damme). There's some slight inconsistencies in the coolness of the tech and in its thoughts on hyper-violence. Fortunately, the action is strong and clear, shot with a kinetic insanity that's as brutal as it is awesome. Like a tech-based John Wick, it couches the action and brains within some fantastic world-building. It's a fully lived-in future; familiar, punctuated with notes of otherworldly futurism.

But then an eccentric billionaire sponsors him a cutting edge implant, which allows him to walk and act again. With the very minor cost of having an amoral AI stuck in his head.Upgrade teeters on the edge of being a fringe film. Made with a very modest budget, it takes a far out there science fiction idea, gives it a glossy paint of colour with the help of a talented cinematographer (Stefan Duscio) and then simply allows the cool edginess of it all to carry the rest. What this film has in spades is style. The camerawork is inspired, the locations are low budget but made to work within the story and the actors are talented enough to keep the story afloat.That being said, it is very by the numbers storytelling. None of the ideas on screen were anything new and while the execution was not half bad, I constantly thought that something was missing. Like this could have been made better given a bit more time, money and talent. Which is true for most movies, but I'm rarely as aware of it as I was here.It's quite possible that I simply wasn't in the right frame of mind to watch this film when I did.

Set in a near future (cross fingers) where a man becomes a quadriplegic do to an assassination attempt that took his wife. He then becomes a boy genius' test subject for a microchip that reconnects his spine, contrils his body so he can walk, than gets a mind of it's own, which the man uses to help him find out who killed his wife. 
I feel like I've seen this plot a few times done for TV shows, but I think the reason they made it into a movie is because of the dark element they added to the story. It's like a very sleek episode of Black Mirror overall (but not as good as Black Mirror, nothing is).
Otherwise, it's a cool tale inside a cool world starring a dude who reminds me of Tom Hardy for some reason.

43,jtindahouse,Another gem from Whannell,9,3 June 2018,"While I was watching 'Upgrade' I kept racking my brains trying to workout where I had seen a similar story before. When I finally worked it out I realised why it had taken me so long to get there. It was because it was a book I was thinking of rather than a movie. Dan Brown's latest novel 'Origin' follows a very similar concept and story. Both are unbelievably good in their own way. 'Upgrade' was quite different to what I was expecting. Pretty much every film Leigh Whannell has played a part in making to date has been horror based. Now while there is the odd dash of extreme violence here and there, this certainly doesn't fall into the horror category. Turns out the man can nail more than one genre.The first thing that hits you about this film is how smart it is. Like almost all of Whannell's films it plays out like a puzzle and the audience gets to go along for the ride. Despite me already mentioning a very similar book, this still remains a very original (no pun intended) story. In the final 20 or so minutes all hell breaks loose and it truly is one of the best end sequences to a film I can remember seeing. The icing on the cake for me though was the dying seconds of the film. I begged in my head for the credits to roll right at that moment (not because I wanted it to end, but because ending it there would be the perfect thing to do - but something not a lot of film makers today would've had the bravery to do) and sure enough they did. I absolutely loved this film and would implore you to see it.",Upgrade

It's about a guy whose wife is murdered and has an operating system installed in his brain that gives him his mobility back, and helps him out in hunting down his attacker. The movie is apparently set in the future - but not so far in the future that anything looks all that different.We get the usual scenes: the protagonist goes into a dive bar - obviously a criminal hang out - to chase his only lead, and finds someone who knows something, and has to beat a confession out of him. I am so, so tired of scenes like this.The movie also has a car chase scene, making me wonder how long it has been since car chases have been exciting for an audience. The last good one was probably in the '70s.The whole cyberpunk angle to the story doesn't really add much to what is really just a standard, or even sub-standard, revenge flick. Surely there could have been an interesting or creative way that that could have added something, anything, to the revenge formula.

This is a nice little action movie with a message. Be wary of technology. Logan plays a technophobe in the not too distant future-where driver_less cars, drones and other technological advances are the norm. His wife, Melanie, works for a big tech company and is just the opposite-she knows her way around all her devices and loves them. After an encounter with Benedict and his gang of ruffians, Logan is left a paraplegic and feeling suicidal. That's when Harrison steps in and offers Logan a miracle. It seems that Harrison has been developing an experimental computer chip implant-he calls STEM-and needs someone to experiment with it on. Logan goes for it and becomes almost superhuman-STEM talks to him and tells him all about his new abilities and what he can do with them. Besides being able to walk again, he is stronger, faster and knows how to whoop ass-Oh yeah, when STEM is talking to Logan, no one else can hear him. First on Logan's agenda; go after Benedict and his gang. There are lots of cool fights and gadgets-some of the bad guys have guns implanted in their arms and it looks kind of strange when they are loading bullets into their forearms and then shooting them out of their hands. There is also a nice twist ending.

In the aftermath, Grey is approach by tech genius Eron Keen who makes Grey an offer; participate in an experiment which will give him full mobility of his limbs via a programme implant known as STEM. STEM gives Grey a new lease of life; he's stronger and faster than he was before and is hell-bent on revenge, but as Grey soon discovers everything comes at a cost...Whannell has brought us a lot of solid films in the past namely Insidious, Saw & Death Sentence. When I sat down and watched Upgrade, I didn't realise that it was the brainchild of Whannell, but in retrospect I can see it has his style all over it....Essentially, it is a vigilante film (in the style of Death Wish or even Whannell's own Death Sentence), but it also contains so many sci-fi and story elements that it could well be an amalgamation of several other films. Ordinarily, this could prove to be a bit of a problem, but the whole film is so well put together, full of action, intriguing and involving that it really doesn't matter. It begins in the vein of your standard vigilante film; an ordinary man just wants answers, but in Upgrade it then develops into an ordinary man using AI to pursue his own form of justice (in some ways it reminded me of a film I watched recently called Higher Power ).The film really kicks into high gear though when we learn of STEM and we discover just what STEM knows and can do; it's at this point when it veers from vigilante film, to a procedural mystery/investigative narrative, to a high octane kickass fest with some impressive fight choreography. Whannell fuses all elements together seamlessly so that no element is overdone whilst at the same time shifting everything along quickly so the pace never slackens. There is also action aplenty, but never to the detriment of the story which makes this film fly by at a lightning pace and ensure it remains enjoyable.Whilst nobody is particularly bad here, this film is owned by Marshall-Green who is simply superb as the lead in this film. The writing is good and there are plenty of twists and turns in the narrative which meant that my attention never wandered.Yes not entirely original when heavily scrutinized, but for those looking at a Death Wish type film with a slightly different slant to it then Upgrade should be right up your street...",Upgrade
51,cjonesas,[7.9] Upgrade the ending!,8,9 April 2021,"An interesting Sci-Fi movie with a shallow storyline in terms of logic, but quite strong regarding its science-fiction aspects, good believable acting for Logan Marshall-Green, switching back and forth between seriousness, bewilderment and dark funniness, shiny futuristic possibilities and mind-bending well-choreographed sequences of fighting and action.The fighting movements are so well-made, so one-sided affairs with sharp robotic movements that besides the sure training, multiple shooting and maybe re-shooting, I wouldn't be surprised that they may have had plenty of pain-relievers, anti-inflammatory creams and drugs in store for the protagonist, just in case.A movie that shines because of its Sci-Fi (futuristic) possibilities, lightning actions, some funny dark humor and shady light moments.Had it had a more engaging logical story, more believable depth and a strong ending, it would have brought a more pleasurable experience.Nice watching it, like a shiny carapace, lit with jewelries, but sort of empty inside.Screenplay/premise: 7.5Development: 8Realism: 8.5Entertainment: 8.5Acting: 8Filming/cinematography: 8.5Visual/special effects: 8.5Music/score: 8.5Depth: 6.5Logic: 6.5Flow: 8Suspense/thrill: 8.5Ending/closure: 7.",Upgrade
52,kirbylee70-599-526179,REBOOT,10,14 September 2018,"Having just watched UPGRADE for the second time, the first when it came out, I can confirm that this was one of the best science fiction movies to come out in some time. It was original, it was fresh and it did some things we haven't seen before in a movie while at the same time harkening back to the warning films of the past about dealing with artificial intelligence.In the near future nearly everything is automated. Homes, even in the low rent district, come equipped with computers implanted in the coffee table. Most people ride in automated cars. Grey Trace (Logan Marshall-Green) is a throwback to the old days though, a time when working on a car meant getting grease under your nails. Grey makes his living restoring old cars for wealthy owners. He gets his wife Asha (Melanie Vallejo) to accompany him when he takes his latest repair to its owner. Eron Keen (Harrison Gilbertson) is a billionaire inventor. He shows the couple his latest invention, an AI system named STEM. It can function faster than the human brain and if implanted he expects it to work miracles.On their way home the Trace's automated car malfunctions and takes them to the old neighborhood Grey grew up in, an unsavory part of town. The car flips and crashes and help seems to arrive. But those on hand aren't there to help but to do damage. They shoot and kill Asha and shoot Grey in the spine leaving him immobile.Saved and still alive Grey later finds himself a quadriplegic confined to a wheelchair. His mother stops in to help him in his fully automated home. A detective Cortez (Betty Gabriel) is assigned to his case attempting to find the killers but with little luck in spite of roaming drones around the city. Despondent Grey attempts suicide.When he wakes in the hospital Eron is there to greet him and offers him his condolences. He then makes him an offer. If he's willing to keep it quiet and off the books Eron will implant STEM into him. If it works as intended he will recover the ability to walk. The surgery works and Grey returns home. And that's when things begin to turn.STEM communicates with Grey inside his head. While Grey has been watching surveillance video of the shooting he experienced he couldn't see anything. STEM can see more though and finds a tattoo on the arm of one of the killers. Grey allows STEM to control his hand and draws the image. With no evidence to back this up and unable to let the police know about STEM he tracks down the first killer.When confronted by the killer who gives him little information about what took place Grey looks as if he's about to be killed once and for all when STEM asks permission to take control. Once granted Grey is suddenly the most skilled person in the room. He stand straight up from a prone position, he counters every move the killer makes and he takes him down with ease. Before he can get any information STEM kills the man. From there the movie progresses with an ease of storytelling and believability that makes for a high quality science fiction story. Grey continues to track down more clues and various people in an attempt to catch the killers. But can he do so without killing them? Can he mount enough evidence to put them away? Or will they realize what is happening and track him down to eliminate him once and for all? And why was it they chose to kill Asha and shoot him in the first place? What sinister plot is going on that we are unaware of?The few visual effects in the film are well done but the movie doesn't rely. But the effects of the hand to hand combat sequences are amazing work here and all done with special effects. Still it is the story that moves this film along and that takes it from the ordinary into the world of science fiction. I know the end result was something I didn't see coming and for me that's unusual and enjoyed. The acting is amazing and honestly Marshall-Greene deserves notice. He acts with his entire body here in his movements just walking across a room or sitting up. It's very subtle but effective. The rest of the cast does a solid job as well but it is his presence that deserves attention.The movie does offer some truly gore fueled moments not for the squeamish but the rest provides excitement surrounding a solid story. To me that's what makes this one of my favorite films of last year.",Upgrade
53,kluseba,A resilient conservative mind fights for justice in a bleak futuristic world,9,17 April 2019,"Written and director by Leigh Whannell who was involved in successful horror franchises like Saw and Insidious, Upgrade can be described as a Black Mirror episode with feature film length. This dystopian science-fiction movie convinces with bleak settings, a mysterious plot and a strong lead character. It's one of the greatest dystopian science-fiction movies of the decade.The movie tells the story of Grey Trace, a rare mechanic in a futuristic world of self-driving cars who repairs classic cars for rich collectors and entrepreneurs. His wife is quite the opposite and works for an enterprise that develops human-computer augmentations. One day, their self-driving car crashes and the couple gets ambushed by a mysterious group of strangers. Grey Trace gets severely injured while his wife is brutally assassinated. Months later, police investigations are stalled and Grey Trace is confined to a wheelchair, sinks into depression and even attempts to commit suicide. A former client then convinces him to participate in an illegal experiment that enables Grey Trace to walk again with the help of an intelligent implant that has its very own identity. The former mechanic must pretend to be still paralyzed in public while secretly trying to find out who is responsible for the ambush.Upgrade convinces on many levels. The film's gloomy atmosphere is established right from the introduction and upheld until the dramatic conclusion. The settings of the futuristic world are quite realistic which only makes them more haunting. The diversified action scenes are skillful, intense and brutal. The resilient lead character is easy to empathize with. The story has a few interesting twists and turns that aren't too hard to predict but still developed quite efficiently. The conclusion truly is the climax of the movie and worth the wait.If you like dystopian science-fiction movies, you should definitely watch Upgrade. Leigh Whannell delivers the goods again and shows that his science-fiction stories are as intriguing as his successful horror concepts. Upgrade stimulates your guts, heart and mind and is one of the best genre movies in recent memory along with Ex Machina.",Upgrade
54,Pairic,Superior SF/Horror,9,10 September 2018,"Upgrade: An A.I. gone mad, Cyborgs, Near Future Dystopia, the ideas in Upgrade are not new but it is the variations on these themes which produce a fresh enjoyable synthesis. The near future, Grey (Logan Marshall-Green) refurbishes old sports cars for clients, his partner Aisha (Melanie Vallejo) works for a Tech company, she accompanies Grey when he delivers a car to client Eron Keen (Harrison Gilbertson), an IT billionaire. On the way home her autopilot car is hacked and crashes they are then attacked by a gang (who turn out to be cyborgs; Aisha is killed and Grey ends up quadriplegic.Keen offers Grey a new implant chip, Stem (voiced by Simon Maiden), which has AI capabilities and will provide an interface between his brain and the rest of central nervous system allowing him the use of his limbs again. The AI however speaks to Grey and has opinions of it's own. When Grey allows it to take over it turns him into a killing machine, moving fast and enabling perfect use of his reflexes. Using online resources and old style detective work, Grey with the aid of Stem and a non-binary hacker (Kai Bradley) starts to track down the gang who killed his wife and the first one meets a grisly death. A detective (Betty Gabriel) who has been investigating the original attack gets suspicious about Grey as does Keen.Here we have Robocop meets Hal meets Blade Runner meets Terminator meets Frankenstein with even touches of Ex-Machina Minority Report. But these influences blend into a whole which is very much it's own film. Logan portrays Grey as a credible character and it is easy to develop empathy with him. The Blade Runner style future is well imagined, police use drones, no flying cars but most are automated making Grey's skill with manual cars crucial. In an underworld barr clients have adopted many body modifications some which might be necessary to survive in this future society. The fights between Grey and the Cyborgs are gruesome but well choreographed.Directed and written by Leigh Whannell, Upgrade is a superior Science Fiction/Horror film.

This is in many ways a simple film. Its dominated by a clever mix of thoughtful, intelligent narrative and substantial amounts of action. CGI and special effects are used sparingly but to good effect.Upgrades overriding theme is a familiar in its mix of action and revenge with a message about the implications of what technological control, which we are increasingly seeing in every aspect of lives means for us. Is the gain worth the loss of freedom?The action scenes in this film are at times darkly funny but at the same time well paced and slick. The narrative offers up considered, fleshed out characters who have a real depth and in the case of the lead, an agenda that takes him in a direction he could not have anticipated.

You're not a robot.In my film review of the movie ""The Hollow Child"", I started again with a plea about trailers and I summed up the reasons why I avoid them. I saw the trailer from ""Upgrade"" by chance at the beginning of this year. Believe me, I was ecstatic and enthusiastic. ""I HAVE to see this movie"", I thought. There are trailers that look inviting and afterward, the film looks very disappointing. But ""Upgrade"" certainly doesn't belong in this category. On the contrary. This is one of the best films of the year for me. An excellent SF provided with a wonderful concept and which gradually switches to a tough revenge film. For me, it was an exciting mix of ""Robocop"", ""John Wick"" and ""Demon Seed"". ""Robocop"" because of the cybernetic aspect. ""John Wick"" because of the extravagant violent part. And ""Demon Seed"" because of the overall moral of the whole story. A successful cocktail that results in a titillating film.""Upgrade"" tells the story of Grey Trace (Logan Marshall-Green), an old-skool-styled guy who is restoring old-fashioned Pontiacs and who's horrified by everything that's related to high-tech stuff. The evening Asha's (Melanie Vallejo), his wife, fully automated design car malfunctions and crashes, they are being attacked by some violent gang. The result is a lifeless girlfriend and Gray having a shattered spine. And that's when the millionaire Eron (Harrison Gilbertson) appears and presents his latest revolutionary chip STEM. An artificially intelligent microchip that functions as a superior brain so the paralyzed Grey can lead a normal life again. And even more.When you're able to watch this movie with the necessary skepticism and you don't take it too seriously, then this B-movie styled, action-packed SF is a welcome change and a way to de-stress after a hard day's work. The story itself can't be called groundbreaking or original. It all seemed a bit too predictable even to me. There's only one thing I hadn't seen coming. And that's the final twist. What a pleasant surprise that was.And when you like neatly-filmed action scenes, then you'll enjoy this flick as well. The confrontations in ""Upgrade"" are such that I gladly re-watched the same scene over and over again. Not because I enjoy seeing bloody, horrible scenes. But because the choreography looks extraordinarily good and in a certain way, they managed to provide it with the necessary humor. The tilting camera. Grey's surprised face. And the way the bad guys are killed. It all looks damn perfect.I can't think of anything bad about the acting. Logan Marshal-Green knows amazingly well how to show different emotions. From helplessness to bewilderment and purely evil. The entire pallet of emotions is shown. And the opponents all look fearless and ruthless. Equipped with ingenious cyber-like assault weapons and futuristic deadly gadgets (even an innocent sneeze is deadly). The only thing I was annoyed about is Gray's way of moving. Although he was told at the beginning that he wasn't really a robot, his body moves like a purebred Robocop. But that's the only remark I can think of. My advice is to go and see this highly entertaining cyberpunk SF as soon as you can. Just do it!More reviews here : movie-freak.be",Upgrade
59,Agent10,The trailer did this movie no justice,8,30 June 2021,"When I first heard of this film, I absolutely thought it would stink. The trailers for it looked awful, and the lack of artistry in that department turned me away. Add in the fact it was one of those types of trailers you could easily skip on YouTube and it was a problem. Personally, I don't even remember this movie coming to my city. Damn shame, because it was a year later when I realized my abject stupidity.During an all night Sci-Fi film fest hosted by a local movie theater, I finally witnessed this film. It was at one in the morning, and it certainly woke me up. For a film that had such a small budget, it had great production design and a bunch of little technological insights into the future that would have been easy to manipulate on the screen as well as cheap to produce. And in spite of no humongous CGI scene, this whole film just worked from the get go.I especially identified with Gray the main character. Being an anti-transhumanist myself, I was sucked in by his cynicism toward social technology and appreciation for the old. It was only fitting that he would be STEM's choice for an organic avatar.And let's get into STEM, who is honestly the best character in the movie. Playing both the angel on your right shoulder and the Devil on your left, he echoed the gravitas of other bad AI such as HAL from 2001 and VIKI from I, Robot. Not only is he sensible in his ""good"" advice, he is cold and ruthless on his bad side.The story is equal parts mystery and equal parts revenge, as Gray seeks out the reason why his wife was killed. Gray took the huge chance of installing STEM after being paralyzed, but also took the risk after seeing little was being done on the case. As the dots are connected, the enemy becomes clear and the final scene is something worthy of any 70s dark sci-fi film.Watch it for the great action pieces and the interesting mystery set-up. You won't be disappointed.",Upgrade
60,AudioFileZ,This Ones A Sleeper....Highly Recommended,7,15 August 2018,Upgrade is a gritty and dark look into A.I. run amok. It's original enough to stand up to higher budget films while staying pretty much anti-blockbuster. The writing is the real gem here while the effects are just good enough to not cripple the story. The lead character is solid and the cinematography is more than decent. In all it's a winner that actually has a fitting ending while not completely surprising is kept close enough to the vest that I was totally invested until the final frame.

62,a_chinn,An analogue dude get's a digital upgrade to goes all Charles Bronson,8,25 June 2018,"Logan Marshall-Green is Grey Trace, an analogue dude living in a near-future digital world, who makes his living fixing up old muscle cars. That is until he and his wife's smart car goes haywire, crashes, are they are robbed and left for dead. However, Grey was not killed and is instead left a quadriplegic. That is until one of his muscle car clients, an Elon Musk-like scientist/billionaire, offers to give him his life back with a chip implant that would put an artificial intelligence named Stem into his nervous system, which can make him mobile again and also allow him a chance to get revenge! Stem can also, with Gray's permission, take over his body to make him a deadly fighting machine (basically becoming Neo from ""The Matrix""), which makes for a number of entertaining action sequences. So what's the tone of this film? Try to imagine if David Cronenberg had developed ""The Six Million Dollar Man."" (i.e. a near perfect marriage of smart body-horror and pulp sci-fi). Stem talk to grey in his head, where no one else can hear Stem, which is entertaining and reminded me of Don Johnson in ""A Boy and His Dog"" where Johnson's Vic and his telepathic dog Blood would talk to one another, where Grey and Vic are the the brawn and Stem and Blood are the brains of the duos. In terms of theme, ""Upgrade"" is clearly a cautionary tale of how we are allowing technology to integrate itself into our lives, in this case in the most extreme of ways. Grey talking to Stem, seeking help and advice, is not all that different from talking to Siri or Alexa and for assistance. The revenge film elements of the plot, with Grey working his way up the food chain of criminals to find out who's behind his wife's death, are pretty standard ""Death Wish"" stuff (including a pretty obvious twist ending), though the technology themed body horror elements of the story made that routine plot far more interesting. ""The Crow"" is probably a good comparison, which was also a revenge film at its core, but added supernatural and goth elements to jazz up the familiar plot device. ""Upgrade"" was written and directed by Leigh Whannell, who wrote ""Saw"" and ""The Conjuring,"" so this film certainly delivers gore and suspense. The gory elements were shockingly fun to watch on the big screen, but later thinking about the movie, the excessive gore and violence really didn't add anything to the film outside of one scene where Grey can't bring himself to torture information out of his attackers and turns his body over to Stem to do it for him. The film's violence is really just gratuitous for it's own sake, which is not that different from most horror films, but this film seems smarter than that. My other knock on the film is that it never really delves too deeply into it's themes around the dangers of integrating technology into our lives and body modification. Whannell also throws in a few other completely underdeveloped cautionary ideas around virtual reality and other techno babble, which go nowhere. So overall, don't go into this film thinking it's anywhere as smart a typical episode of ""Black Mirror."" This film is pure pulp, but it's a wickedly fun pulp and left me wanting to see what writer/director Whannell will do next. ""Upgrade"" was produced by Blumhouse, who has again continued their streak of delivering smart above-average genre pictures (""Get Out,"" ""Insidious,"" ""The Purge,"" ""The Belko Experiment,"" etc.), making this another must-see film for sci-fi/horror fans.",Upgrade

With one of the weaker advertising campaigns to hit in a while, this movie didn't reveal much in regards to its contents, so I went in wondering what was in store. After seeing it, yours truly has plenty of things to report his thoughts as I review: Movie: Upgrade
Director:
 Leigh Whannell
Writer:
 Leigh Whannell
Stars:
 Logan Marshall-Green, Richard Anastasios, Rosco Campbell
LIKES: Sci-Fi Plot: The movie genre says Action/Comedy/Horror, but this reviewer felt it was more a science fiction piece than anything else. The piece is a culmination of various Sci-Fi hits that include things like: The Fugitive, Bladerunner, Matrix, and even HardCore Henry. Such a ragtag collection really worked in this case, and brought with it an engaging story that addresses the issues of technology and how the world can potentially abuse them. It's a thrilling adventure that for the most part kept my attention, and helped dive deeper down the rabbit hole. Decent Character Development: You may remember the movie of Her where man and machine entered a complex relationship that was odd and inappropriate. Upgrade takes that foundation and updates it to something much better, creating an interface between man and machine that isn't love, but practically survival. While this relationship is multi-faceted, I was impressed with the amount of development both key characters got. STEM in particular had loads of development, despite only being a disembodied voice that was set for survival. As the movie progresses, the level of complexity between the two further expands, and creates one of the more engaging relationships I've seen in a while. Decent Editing: For a movie with a complex tale and a lot of pathways to connect, it surprisingly felt complete in such a short time limit. At around 90 minutes, Upgrade meets all its goals of action, storytelling, and motif exploring and keeping most of the footage tight and relevant to the film. This weekend is surprisingly meeting this goal, and I'm thrilled to see this art hasn't been completely lost. Action Scene: For an action genre tag, Upgrade manages to accomplish this goal quite well and bring about one of the more intense scenes I have experienced in a long time. Grey and his cyber buddy go through the motions from standard fist fight to kung fu fury and given the rock music infusion with a very active camera, the scenes only get more exciting. Sure, some of the action scenes were simplistic stunts given other examples, but what's impressive is that the action is always pertinent to the film. In addition, the style of fighting maintains the dark edge of the movie, leading to further amplification of the suspense and thrills this movie brings. Realism: Sci-Fi often gets a bad rap for being unbelievable, but Upgraded is one of those films that will shatter that fantasy glass ceiling. Set in the not so far future, the movie manages to bring the future technology to the ""modern"" world, skipping the grandiose futuristic cities and creatures, for a much more grounded approach. As such, the added realism, brings the horror element out and is scarier than what most horror movies can cook up. DISLIKES: Character underutilization: The movie relies a lot on two characters to make up the story, the secondary characters are semi important, but most of them get the shaft. I would have liked better integration of these characters, especially the cop, who could have opened up more of the movie's edge had she been given the chance. Perhaps future installment can help out with this, but for this movie...it was okay. Gorey At Times: There are some things one does not like to see and some of the finishing moves in this movie are examples of this. Upgraded doesn't go overboard in bloody chaos, but it also is not afraid to show off the savagery of enhanced biomechanics. Those of the faint of heart or squeamish are now warned, because some members of the cast will have some heavy hitting injuries to deal with in the 90 minutes. Rushed Ending: The movie had so much going for it, but the ending while complete, dark, and fitting, seemed a bit rushed to get there. Sure, much of the rabbit hole was predictable to me, with only a slight layer escaping my theories, but when it came to boil things move a lot faster than they had. I had hoped for a little more engagement, a little more obstruction, and definitely a full-on finish instead of a cliffhanger to indicate a potential series to come. Breaking the pace, I had started to thoroughly enjoy so late in the game wasn't my favorite decision of this movie. 
THE VERDICT:Upgrade is definitely not the typical movie to grace the screen, but this darker film crafts an adventure that will pull many of the Sci-Fi genre into the mix. The dynamic duo of man and machine is a keystone in supporting the film, and with energetic action, a realistic setting, and good editing, one will surely become immersed in the new matrix. It still has some rough edges to smooth out, primarily in integrating all the character and not breaking the pace in the final minutes of the film. Yet, the hinted series to come can address this, potentially leading to a plummet into a new Wonderland of androids vs. humans. Worth a trip to the theater? You bet, but be warned for the violence and be warned of the very loud sound effects that can be hard on the ears. My scores:Action/Comedy/Horror: 7.0
Sci-Fi: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0",Upgrade
66,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Upgrade,7,29 August 2018,"Grey Trace (played by Logan Marshall-Green) loses his spouse in a street robbery and then becomes paralyzed by the evil thugs involved. After taking part in a scientific experiment that helps him walk again, Trace forgoes his suicidal tendencies and decides to seek revenge on his wife's killers. That's the gist of 2018's Upgrade, a missed science fiction yarn that blocked its marketing efforts and suffered a lousy box office take last June. Spiked with Tarantino-style violence, Runaway-style car chases, a not too overdone futuristic setting, and some good old-fashioned storytelling, Upgrade rises above most of the direct-to-video sci-fi that it faintly replicates. Director Leigh Whannell creates a world full of autonomous cars, numerous roving drones, bloody butchering, and curvy city landscapes. This is coming from the same dude that wrote the Saw movies and acted in Insidious and The Matrix Reloaded. It all comes full circle here.So Yeah, the title of Upgrade refers to Trace's ""upgraded"" body, controlled by a centipede chip and a hidden voice that feels like Hal 9000 for a new generation. Grey can fight and kill with mechanical efficiency a la Chuck Norris on steroids. He can also run like the wind and expand his brain to play revengeful and deceptive detective. Watching Upgrade reminded me of stuff like Death Wish, Blade Runner, Self/less, and 1990's Total Recall. It's a small scale version of these films while still containing its own form of cold ingenuity (Upgrade's glassy look and budget feel a little more advanced than the $3-$5 million reported). Sure Upgrade contains B-movie plotting, a sort of muddled ending, one too many twists, and actors of unknown origin (Marshall-Green is ruggedly cast but he's a ""C"" lister at best). Still, the flick is worth a peek if you like your technological gadgetry mixed with gloominess, gore, and noir. Bottom line: Upgrade may have been overlooked this summer but it happily brings you ""up to code"". My rating: 3 stars.",Upgrade

His transformation and enhanced abilities because of the AI Stem were a treat to watch. The action scenes and story was easy and enjoyable to follow. We wanted to see his path to revenge and there was a small dose of humor so you didn't take the film too seriously. The twist at the end was also well done and how it tied the whole film together.

69,vengeance20,"Slick, Dark, Gritty, Sci-Fi, Horror Film!",9,3 September 2018,"Another Blum House Tilt film under the name Upgrade comes from creator of the Saw & Insidious Films, Leigh Whannell! Heard very vaguely about this one some point last year but forgot about it, then suddenly out of nowhere, it pops up on the Odeon Website & well, I had to see it being it was written & directed by the man himself & of course because it was a horror film...!The story follows a technophobe man named Grey, whose wife is killed by a group of men. He is paralysed from the neck down & nearly kills himself until a scientist goes to help him but implanting a chip called ""Stem"" into his body so he can regain the use of his body again. But soon after the operation, ""Stem"" begins talking to Grey, who the embarks on a bloody rampage at the command of ""Stem"" helping him fight & kills those involved!The film was ace! If not grim & dark, but that was great! The fight scenes were top notch too, though could've took advantage more with the blood & gore given the films dark gritty theme, which would've been fun & interesting to look at. But the deaths were violent overall so it wasn't really bad!The story-line & it's twist was both clever but sad at the same time as you felt for the character throughout for what happened to him. Along with the others too.The dialogue wasn't too bad either, but like the violence could've took advantage fully given the above I mentioned about the violence. But it was too & was good enough!The films visuals were pretty good too & the Sci-Fi theme was good too & lesser in this film than others which overload it way too much. Overall this film was pretty epic, the twist at the end was ,surprising, which then lead to a bitter sweet ending! 9/10",Upgrade

75,MR_Heraclius,This movie was astonishing,9,23 March 2020,"Upgrade is unfortunately in the club of great movies that completely flew under the radar when first released. But that might actually work to its advantage, as this is definitely one of those movies where the less you know going in, the better. The only reason I was aware of Upgrade is because of writer/director Leigh Whannell (Saw, Insidious), and the fact I'd heard plenty of great things from friends who'd seen it. The film takes the all-too-familiar premise of a man looking to avenge the murder of his wife, and puts an interesting new sci-fi spin on it. Whannell clearly loves the classics, because Upgrade's influences are easy to spot - RoboCop, Blade Runner, Dredd, Death Wish. They've all been thrown in a blender, and what comes out is something that feels like its own movie, while also paying tribute to everything that inspired Whannell to become a filmmaker in the first place. Upgrade is violent, thought-provoking, funny, surprising, with some terrific fight sequences, an awesome soundtrack, and a dynamite performance from Logan Marshall-Green. I also get the feeling I'm gonna love it even more the next time I watch it. Highly recommended for fans of sci-fi/action.",Upgrade
76,Troy_Campbell,Thought-provoking and enthralling - cult classic status beckons.,9,17 June 2018,"With virtually zero publicity leading up to its big screen release, this grungy low-budget sci-fi flick-part Blade Runner, part Terminator-is a surprising little gem. Set in the near future where technology reigns, Grey Trace (Logan Marshall-Green) is given the opportunity to walk again and avenge his wife's cold-blooded murder. He just has to let hermit genius Eron (Harrison Gilbertson) implant an AI computer chip, called Stem, onto his spine. More contemplative and poignant than expected, Aussie writer-director Leigh Whannell leans heavily into the high concept, allowing the provocative themes to burn slowly until the spellbinding finale. It verges on the brink of silliness at times, but Whannell manages to consistently push the boundaries-narratively and visually-without ever taking that one step too far. It's a mighty feat from a guy whose only other directorial credit is Insidious: Chapter 3. The action is sporadic but the few fight sequences on display are superbly choreographed and refreshingly economical, Grey's internal AI guest ensuring maximum effectiveness when engaging in hand-to-hand combat. It's a superb effort from Marshall-Green to convince he's not in control of his own body, even garnering a laugh here and there, but Whannell also deserves much praise for minimising the cuts and letting the stylish fights breathe. A rumbling, atmospheric score by Jed Palmer is icing on the cake, cementing Upgrade as an intelligent and enthralling cerebral sci-fi that is destined for cult classic status.",Upgrade

79,Jeremy_Urquhart,Flawed but fun,7,7 April 2021,"I thought it took a little too long to really get going, and the dialogue is a bit cheesy at times, including some of the attempts at humour.However, some of the gory black comedy and interactions between Grey and the computer in his head are pretty funny. It overall really does pick up once he has that computer companion in his body.The action is fun and gory, some of the camerawork fairly cool, and it does some really fun things with its outlandish premise... again, you just have to get through the first 25 or so minutes.Also, I will say the physicality of Logan Marshall-Greene's performance is really impressive. He's not always helped by the sometimes decent, sometimes clunky screenplay, but the stuff he has to do physically (especially when he's first getting used to the computer taking control of his body) is quite impressive.I almost wish this could have been a tv series instead of a movie- I think this premise has potential beyond just a single 100 minute movie, and I also just love shows where the main character has to keep something secret from the other people in their life the way Grey has to try and avoid both the detective and the man who installed the computer (show-wise see Breaking Bad, The Americans, Barry, and Dexter before it ruined itself with that awful ending. Also, The Sopranos and Mad Men may qualify to a more limited extent).Here's hoping for a sequel or maybe some kind of continuation or reinterpretation of the core premise.

83,rockman182,Upgrade (2018),7,3 June 2018,"Not a lot of buzz was made about this film which kind of landed in theaters with no hype. I saw one trailer at some point and knew I wanted to check it out. Logan Marshall-Green isn't exactly someone who is a leading man. Ryan Atwood's brother and a role in Prometheus are his most notable roles. So it was nice to see him as a lead, and a lesser known cast in this film. Overall, I felt the plot can be tweaked at some points but its a fun film.The film is about a man named Grey, who becomes paraplegic after he and his wife were attacked by a group of hitmen. He is approached by a tech innovator who puts a device in his body which allows him to walk and control his limbs again.. in a way. The device is actually a smart system called STEM and sometimes STEM is allowed to take over, especially when Grey is in danger. Grey uses this newfound ability to track down the men who killed his wife.Insidious: Chapter 3 wasn't overly memorable for me so I feel like this film is where Leigh Whannell puts a stamp on his film making style. The action scenes are excellent when they come. The chase and combat on screen are stellar. The film does well to use its futuristic setting to set a landscape for the film, which itself still feels modern. The film also has humor at the right times. Its not overbearing but when it comes it feels right.My main concerns with the film was the underdeveloped side characters and there's a bit of convenience when need be. The plot feels like it could have been worked in a less cloudy manner but its not a major detraction from the rest of the effort. Its a surprisingly different effort. We've seen this type of film before but the film still seems to remain fresh and fun.

87,Holt344,"Upgrade is cinematic and incredible, with its original concept and great pacing, you are in for a ride",10,10 April 2021,"Upgrade is written and directed by Leigh Whannell whilst Jason Blum produced it under his Blumhouse Productions banner, it's a gritty and dark sci-fi thriller in the cyberpunk sub-genre. The film follows Grey Trace who is a technophobe, after a mugging that left him paralyzed he gets implanted with a chip that allows him to control his body. The premise might not sound original but it really is an original concept and a very good one at that, Leigh Whannell have created close to a masterpiece in the genre.Logan Marshall-Green plays the mechanic, Grey Trace who the film is about. I have always thought him as a very underrated actor, I have seen him in a couple of films and series, Damnation and Quarry is two different projects that he gives memorable and honestly phenomenal performances. For this film, Upgrade, he gives another magnificent performance. Subtle to big things regarding his performance, it's what makes this movie to the great film it is.It's a worthy addition to the cyberpunk sub-genre in film, it does everything right, but does the slow pace make the movie worse? It depends on how you like your action movies, fast and eventful or like Upgrade, slow paced and well thought out. You see it in the writing how detailed and well written the film is, the direction and cinematography also needs praise. The sound editing and musical soundtrack is so good, and when the action sequences start you'll sit on the edge of your seat because of how gritty and well choreographed they are. The production design is amazing, every single part of the film is excellent.I also want to say this about the world building and sci-fi elements in the movie, some sci-fi films make it clear that it's in a future that probably won't come to pass. Upgrade isn't like that, it's super believable as it feels like our world but maybe 30 years in the future.

89,dave-mcclain,one of the best balanced and most entertaining movies of the first half of 2018,9,2 June 2018,"""Upgrade"" (R, 1:35) is an action horror sci-fi comedy written and directed by Leigh Whannell, writer of the ""Insidious"" movies, the early ""Saw"" films, plus ""Dead Silence"", and director of ""Insidious: Chapter 3"". This movie was shot in Australia and Whannell and most of his cast are Australian. However, with the accents and the sets, you wouldn't know the movie wasn't American - and with the (lack of) quality in the last two ""Insidious"" movies, you wouldn't guess that Whannell was behind this gem of a film.Grey Trace (Logan Marshall-Green, looking a lot like Tom Hardy) is an ""old school"" auto mechanic in a near future where intelligent, driverless cars are increasingly commonplace. He's married to Asha (Melanie Vallejo), an employee at a high-tech company. They live in a house that's suitably high-tech as well, operating with voice commands and equipped with a powerful computer embedded in a table top. They're very happy... until one night when they're on their way back from meeting one of Grey's clients, a reclusive computer genius named Eron Keen (Harrison Gilbertson). Their car crashes and they get mugged. Asha is killed and Grey is paralyzed from the neck down, with only his mother to care for him. Eron visits Grey and offers him the opportunity to regain control of his body, with the help of a neck implant called Stem. The surgery succeeds spectacularly, Grey signs a non-disclosure agreement and heads home, promising that, at least for now, it appears to the world that he's still a quadriplegic. Grey quickly learns that Stem can talk to him (as voiced by Simon Maiden). Given the lack of progress by a police investigator named Cortez (Betty Gabriel), Grey takes advantage of Stem's Alexa-on-steroids capabilities to find the men who killed his wife. Normally not a violent man, Grey finds himself overmatched by these men, who themselves are technologically enhanced, until he learns how Stem can also help him fight. But, alas, avenging his wife's death isn't as satisfying as Grey might've expected.""Upgrade"" is a very appropriate title, given some of the writer-director's mediocre movies - and as a comparison to other films in the AI subgenre. This one is a combination of ""Deadpool"", ""Ex Machina"", ""Transcendence"" and the ""Bourne"" movies, but still feels fresh and creative, visually and narratively. The occasional comedy comes from the combination of Grey adjusting to having Stem's cells in his brain and some gallows humor as he pursues his wife's killers. The film also features one of the best recent casts you never heard of. The high-quality cinematography, editing, acting, pacing, directing and screenplay (with some late-game twists) makes this one of the most balanced and entertaining movies of 2018. ""A""",Upgrade

93,abisio,By far the best SCI-FI movie in years. When huge budgets are not necessary,10,5 June 2018,"SCI - FI is a misinterpreted concept. The idea is to evolve today's reality in a future you can relate to. The 2001, the original Blade Runner and first Terminator managed to do that; sadly Hollywood blockbuster target the spectacular and fill up with everyday more repetitive special effects that are more tiresome than interesting. At least George Lucas, original Star Wars, stated ""A long time ago in a Galaxy far far away..."" ; clarifying that what follows was pure fantasy.
Well UPGRADE is another excellent example of what can be achieved with intelligence and decent writing and acting.
In a near future were the most distinctively characteristic are self driving cars; a simple mechanic (GREY) who repairs all fashion cars, visits with his wife young entrepreneur car (Eron) to drop his car.
Eron, tells them he created a computer chip capable of interact and improve the human being; the chip name is STAN. Grey is not interested and leave.However, his wife car is hijacked and assaulted without any logical reason. The wife gets killed and Grey is left quadriplegic.
Few days later Grey is visited by Eron, who offers to repair his body forcing him to a strong NDA. Depressed and anxious for vengeance Grey accepts.
With his body working, Grey starts looking for the culprits with STAN's help who is able to talk to him. When the situation becomes more complicated and dangerous, STAN offers Grey to control his body to avoid being killed; things gets darked from there.UPGRADE is not a terminator movie; at the core is basically a cautionary tale about how easily we let technology control us. How lazy we become and let devices and system decide for us without thinking about consequences.As a simple example; when you are at an unknown place, instead of asking for a good restaurant we usually go to YELP or other service; who usually are money driven so most of the time are a disappointment; however we keep using them.The movie gets very violent and the end will surprise many people.

One scene in particular is deftly-handled, in every way, and appropriately falls right at the end of the first third of the film, and captures the typical action/sci-fi junkie - hook, line, and sinker.While the plot isn't terribly complex, the films' last 20-minutes is pretty tidy, and throws a nice short-lived but effective twist just before It ends.Kudos to all involved! Maybe I'm skewing this a bit at 9/10, but when you're in this genre, working with what was obviously a shrunken budget; I think it deserves all of the 9 stars I'm giving- it. It's a bit more effective early romantic dialogue, and a little better villain away from a 10/10 in my book.You like this if you liked:Primer(close to same level, but not quite as much fun), Equilibrium(probs a touch below and thats saying something about this offering), Extracted(not as good), Pusher(just under too).This movie is sick!

Character interactions are robotic even before we get to the subject of upgrading human bodies: this gives the movie an amateurish look that doesn't allow it to rise above the initial low-budget constraint.
Also I was not too impressed by the directing skills, the rhythm in the finale.

100,anselmdaniel,"Silly, entertaining, and worthwhile",7,20 October 2018,"This review contains spoilers.Upgrade is a black humor action movie that is set in the near future. The movie is about a man that seeks revenge after an incident has killed his wife and renders him quadripelegic. Grey played by Logan Marshall-Green is approached by Eron, played by Harrison Gilbertson for integration with STEM, an artificial intelligence chip. With this integration, STEM allows Grey Trace to walk again and seek vengeance.Upgrade is a surprisingly well done movie for its budget of $5 million. The movie has the right amount of effects that help the action scenes along. This also helps the plot as none of the scenes have a large scale except for the chase scene. The movie focused entirely on Grey Trace which I believed is a plus on the movie.STEM, voiced by Simon Maiden, does a great job. STEM had an affable approach to talking with Grey that it felt like an assistant relationship. I did like that STEM is revealed to have created all of the events in the movie for its own benefit. It suited the plot well that this had happened.The twist does not work as well. Once it was revealed that STEM had put everything into motion. It felt that STEM had taken the long route by finding Grey and ruining his life because he had no cybernetic upgrades. It seemed that this plan had many flaws and required STEM to make a perfect plan with no deviation.I enjoyed this futuristic world inhabited by the characters even when things appeared to get sillier. Fisk is somehow able to have nanomachines that he breathes to kill humans. None of the technology is well explained and is kept vague. This does not hurt the movie and the technology is more in the background than the focus.I recommend Upgrade.Grade: B",Upgrade

The sooner you see it the better imho, so I'll rate this a 6 where I suspect it will wind up although it's current 7.5 I completely understand having recently watched it.Director Leigh Whannell re re-loads some Matrix notions, but does augment them well beyond that. The Elon Musk character gets unmasked pretty severely here; Bill Joy and other AI ay-yay-yay folks will enjoy this film even as it likely gets rebooted in various forms going forward. Personally I hope for more of a Ray Kurzweil mind-meld, but a cautionary tale on the singularly scary singularity is more than appropriate. There is no Astro-Boy forecast going forward, alas.Others younger than me, or at least with more blood-hunger, will likely savor this film. Its horror is not over-the-top, but the cerebral nature of the film does also flesh out fear in ways that I never drew titillation from even when I was half my current age.

At the request of a world famous technological inventor, Grey has a special computer chip called STEM implanted into his spine to grant him the ability to control his limbs once again. Intent on bringing the murdering criminals to justice, Grey becomes a vigilante and soon discovers that STEM can do a great deal more than merely help him to walk.While it often treads clichéd storytelling territory, Upgrade benefits greatly from its occasional tongue-in-cheek humour and its John Wick-style action scenes and fight choreography. The film's social commentary on humanity's over-reliance on technology is cleverly woven throughout the plot and Grey's technophobic attitude reflects the viewpoint older generations must have when attempting to grow accustomed to inevitable changing ways. Much like writer/director Leigh Whannell's Saw films, Upgrade does have its fair share of strong blood and gore, which could prove off-putting to unsuspecting audiences. Essentially, the film is in the same vein as Robocop and The Six Million Dollar Man, due to the premise of rebuilding a mortally wounded person with cybernetic enhancements, although it appears to be more in line with the former due to the strong violence and satirical elements.I rate it 7.5/10",Upgrade

As you recall many of these stories are deeply melancholic. The charm of ""Upgrade"" is that it has a voice of the audience, which understands how silly the premise can be. And agrees with you. It's not fall out of your seat funny, but it makes you smile.
I often wonder about our digital world taking over our analog selves. We've somehow created something that wonders what the next level will be. We're saddled with limitations to...well, our environment. As we slowly adapt to change there are things that need to be in place to continue existence. This asks those questions, but doesn't bog you down with deep science. It gives you the loose details and follows its rules.

109,andrewroy-04316,"Upgrade goes toe-to-toe with both the most heady recent AI movies and clever action movies, and holds up to both",8,2 December 2019,"I had heard plenty of talk about how Upgrade is an underrated gem and the movie Venom should have been, but I really thought it was going to be a simple action movie with some halfhearted sci-fi premise. Instead, it's visually phenomenal (I'm in awe of Whannell shooting such a gorgeous futuristic movie on a 3-5 million dollar budget) and has plenty on its mind. The world building is great, clearly showing a world with some cool gadgets and setting our main character up as an old-school dude, who then has the most advanced AI in the world implanted in him. Logan Marshall Green gives an exceptional performance in this movie, perhaps one of the best of the year, as he shows the transitions from his to Stem's control on his face wonderfully. There's lots of action, and it's quite well shot and choreographed, and again Grey's face and struggle while he watches Stem attack and kill people is so well done. The twist and ending is really convincing and ties everything up cleanly, with no ambiguity. This may give a bit too much away, so I won't expand on it, but the ending in particular strongly evoked Ex Machina, which is high praise. It's devastating to see where Grey ended up, but both the twist of who orchestrated all of the events starting with the shooting as well as the ending itself are unexpected but fitting. It may not have quite the intellectual depth of Ex Machina, but the mentions of digitally upgraded humans feeling superior and separate from other humans and the classic cautionary tale of letting AI run wild are still interesting to consider. I don't agree with everyone discounting it, saying things like oh yeah it's surprisingly decent for a mindless action B movie, or it doesn't take itself too seriously. The police investigation and development of events surrounding the deaths and usage of Stem could've been cleaner, but I think it had few flaws and was a legitimate top 10 movie of 2018 as a great sci-fi piece and a great action piece. Very highly recommend watching.",Upgrade

113,PyroSikTh,"Venom, but Sci-Fi, Gorier, and Better",8,9 February 2020,"As stories go, Upgrade isn't anything particularly spectacular. There's some really good ideas of course, but the idea of cyborgs and AI taking over humanity are as old as technology itself. It also surprisingly draws parallels to a superhero movie released in the same year; Venom, where a normal Tom Hardy-looking guy finds himself possessed by an entity that helps him get what he wants by controlling his body. Where Upgrade really shines is in its execution. The build-up leading to multiple multi-layered twists upon each other lend the film an unpredictable narrative complexity, where multiple rewatches are guaranteed to illuminate more subtle complexities, callbacks, and foreshadowing.Something that really makes Upgrade stand out is Logan Marshall-Green, who offers a truly impressive physical performance that is both demanding and complicated to achieve. The controlling of his body by an AI leads to some stylish fight choreography, and Marshall-Green doesn't stutter in adding robotic, calculated movements to those scenes, while simultaneously acting in juxtaposition with his head and facial expressions. He's confused and bewildered while he slices a guy up with a kitchen knife, he brags and gloats while his body effortlessly dispatches of goons, he pleads with bad guys not to continue fighting while his robotic-moving arms quickly and decisively disarm and dispatch of them. He holds such an impressive disconnect between his head and his body that I couldn't even imagine how hard it must have been to develop such physical coordination while acting and making it look effortless at the same time. Marshall-Green has never particularly impressed me before, but he has now.Even further though are clever uses of cameras adding another dimension to the film's visual identity. The high points are, again, the fight scenes, where the camera is just as involved in the choreography as the actors and stuntmen are. To add an even greater emphasis on the disconnect between Grey's mind and his body, the camera often keeps him fixed in frame while the settings around him movie. He's just enjoying the ride while his body does the moving, and we're put in that mindset. The way they did it is mount the camera in a rotating frame, hide a phone on Marshall-Green's body, and get them to match orientation. When Marshall-Green moves, the camera moves with him. This becomes especially impressive when Grey ducks and dives, or does full-on back-flips, and the camera mirrors his movements perfectly.Beyond that, the cinematography goes a long way to make this low-budget movie look much more expensive. Lighting is dim and harsh, camera angles are conservative yet stylish, and the CGI is used sparingly and only when absolutely necessary, which has a knock-on effect of grounding an otherwise futuristic world without getting too lofty. The score by Jed Palmer is also fantastic. I was maybe a little disappointed that Whannell didn't go for a Saw-esque climatic track for the third-act revelations, but nonetheless the score is evocative of sci-fi movies of the 70s and 80s, with borderline synthwave tracks interspersed amongst more ambient sounds.Upgrade is a solid sci-fi flick that manages to be refreshing and unique despite its otherwise overdone story elements. It ended up being a better Venom movie than Venom. All it took was an imaginative filmmaker like Leigh Whannell. I honestly can't wait to see what he manages to do next.

123,stevenrotherforth,I hope this film isn't overshadowed by Venom!,10,11 January 2019,"UpgradeUpgrade is a movie that harks back to 80's Sci-Fi genre classics such as Robocop, Cyborg,
The Terminator and even low budget VHS rentals such as 'Class of 1999'.
In fact Upgrade shares more in common with the latter due to its paltry budget of a mere five million dollars.
Despite this director Leigh Whannell has managed to craft a superb film that delivers both in the story telling and the entertainment departments.
The measly budget isn't really apparent as CGI and practical effects are more than adequate.
The film does have a low rent tone in terms of video quality. Picture and sound are more than fine but there does seem to be a sensation of B movie evident on screen.Logan Marshall Green stars as Grey. A man who is paralysed by a gang of thugs who also murder his wife.
Grey now a quadriplegic is given the opportunity to walk again when he has a experimental chip placed at the top of his spine.
Stem as the chip is known is a highly advanced AI system that not only enables Grey to walk again but gives him super human abilities.
Stem is the voice in Greys head that encourages him to use his new found attributes to track down and bring his wife's murderers to justice.Upgrade can be compared to Marvels Venom movie.
Not only because the lead stars of both films bare a striking resemblance but because both stories feature a voice in the protagonists head.
Sadly Upgrade will be doomed to walk forever in Venoms shadow.
A shame as critically it is Upgrade that seems to be the better film.
Something I can't really comment on as of time of writing I'm still yet to witness Venom.
What I do know is that Logan Marshall Green's performance is exemplary.
Could Hardy's performance in Venom really be any better than this?Green displays a masterful physical performance as Stem takes over his body delivering skilful acts of violence.
Green's facial expressions are superb as his body gets on with job of delivering justice without his own brains interaction.
Fight choreography is top notch reminding me of the revolutionary days of The Matrix.

Yet the whole message is just an old one: it is not only dangerous to advance technology too far, but to pair with it, to attempt to become more than human, is dangerous. 
I most approve of that underlying fact because I always hope people will wise up and slow down the rampant tech crawl that is far too pervasive in our current time. And it will only get worse unless we wise up. This film had some enjoyable parts due to its own directors guidance, but it was hardly an original tale. I have seen this exact tale in other forms of media, from film to anime, in novels as well as comic books. Yet this lack of originality in our movies would not bother so much if people actually got the message about the why of it all. So long as these kinds of""sci-fi/sci-possible"" stories keep coming out, theres hope that a future with too many drones, more government control over the people and out of control advanced tech wont come to pass.

128,TheHonestCritic,"An ""upgrade"" is the one thing that this ""film"" really needs!",1,27 June 2021,"""Upgrade"" (2018), wow, I didn't think it would be this fast for me not to care in the slightest about a movie. When I watched this ""film"", I was bored within the first ten minutes! But in this case, that's just barely scratching the surface. Film Making 101: the first ten minutes and the final ten minutes of a movie are the most important. During the first ten minutes, it is absolutely crucial to lure your audience into the story of your film and get them interested. In my opinion, if I'm not hooked to a film within the first ten minutes, I usually don't bother watching it! Then, during the last ten minutes of your movie, you must have a memorable and satisfying ending. ""Upgrade"" has none of that whatsoever. This ""movie"" has a dull and cliched story, terrible acting, cheap special effects, boring sets/locations, and a generic predictable soundtrack to attempt to hold this diarrhea stain together. The plot is, a mechanic named Grey Trace and his wife are riding in their self-driving car and get injured in a car accident. Then, they get attacked by four men, who shoot his wife dead and then shoot him in his spinal cord, causing him to become a quadriplegic. All right, here is a little advice to all future film makers and writers, no one wants to see your traumas or therapy sessions on the big screen. There's only one writer for this excuse for a script, named Leigh Whannell and when you watch this ""movie"", my God, you can clearly see the results on the screen! He's also the director of this ""film"", maketh that what you will. This is supposed to be a simple action film, yet there are so many subplots going on! As I've said, action movies have to have a simple story, that makes any action or fight scenes standout better. With too much going on, the fight scenes have very little to no impact. You might see an action scene going on, but you don't experience it. Ironically, for a ""movie"" with so many subplots, next to nothing happens. How can a ""film"" be so full of extra subplots and have no substance? Yes, our main character does eventually get a STEM implant. But, that adds next to nothing to the story, maybe it was just added in to give us more uninspired action scenes? Yeah, that's what I think, I could be wrong, but, I would be very surprised if I was. Action and fight scenes have to be warranted, or else they will amount to nothing. At least they tried to keep it short, by making it 100 minutes. But, those 100 minutes felt like an eternity! As for the acting, it's just as big a letdown as the plot. All of the acting from the whole cast is just average to horrible! The worst performance in this ""movie"" comes from Logan Marshall-Green as Grey Trace. Whenever he's on the screen, he just looks fully disinterested. Also, when he speaks, could he sound anymore boring and monotone?! The only one who seemed to be trying is Melanie Vallejo as Asha Trace. She had potential charm, but unfortunately, her character was killed off during the opening scene. What a disappointment! The rest of the acting from the whole cast simply falls flat. As far as the special effects go, a lot of them were well-done. However, there are a good handful of them that look extremely cheap and generic. Fun fact: the budget for this ""film"" was $3 million. Director and writer Robert Rodriguez has made better movies than this with even smaller budgets! Just let that sink in for a moment. The most poorly done special effects are during the fight scenes with Grey Trace (wow, that is such a dumb name!) It's so painfully obvious that almost every punch, kick, or any other fight move was fast forwarded in editing. When you can see the edits, then it's a problem. Editing in movies and TV shows should be seamless and unnoticeable. When you can see the edits, then the experience is ruined. All of the sets/locations are dull, which is a huge surprise since this ""movie"" was filmed in Australia. How can they make Australia boring? It's a beautiful country! As a matter of fact, some of my favorite films were made and produced there. Granted, some of the sets/locations do work, but a lot of them are just too plain and result in a dull atmosphere. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Jed Palmer is about as cliched as you can get. As I've said before, bad movies usually equal bad film scores! There are a few good parts here and there. But overall, this film score is nothing to write home about. ""Upgrade"" is one of the worst action films I've seen in recent memory. It's full of way too many subplots and the majority of the ""movie"" is spent on nothing happening. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for pushing the envelope and adding different elements to traditional film genres. But, as far as action films go, it's best to keep it simple. I'm struggling to give this ""film"" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. If I could rate it 0 stars I would, but 1 is as low as I can go on IMDB. Ignore the 1 star rating, my true rating is 0 stars. Do I even have to say avoid this ""film""? You'll be much better off watching any other action movie. Although, pretty much any other film other than this one is an upgrade!",Upgrade

Stylistically speaking, it's perfect: very good cinematography, amazing fight choreography, beautiful scenography and music, perfect CGI, and the overall ""feel"" of the atmosphere. Only 5 millions were spent. Often, you will not find that attention for scenography and CGI in Hollywood productions.
In the end, it's a little nice movie with a standard plot that nonetheless got me hooked: it got more and more entertaining, and then some more. There are many cliches, but that's a plus: when the director is good, having a cliche smoothly inserted into the story is pure fun. Each of the main events has a reason to be and a nice explanation (sometimes, it's quite original), so that the story never really feels that ""standard"".
There are just a couple of minor holes here and there, but nothing like what you will read in some reviews: infact, the structure is perfectly logic, and if part of the audience doesn't pay attention, that's not movie's fault.Ps: forgot to mention...

136,jamesjustice-92,I've been upgraded,10,27 November 2018,"Personally, I never look up how much budget did the filmmakers have before watching the movie. But after seeing this one I was totally stunned that on only 5 millions they'd done so much more than all of those 100+ million dollar blockbusters could ever hope for.
Nearly everything except the plot is perfect in this movie and, to tell you the truth, the story isn't supposed to be original anymore. Yes, we've seen this plot a thousand times, when machines take over humans and terminate all the best and worst in us, blah blah blah. But as long as the story brings something new to the table, something that makes you think - that's when the movie becomes not ""just another one"" but a great one. And ""Upgrade"" made me think of a lot of things.
Cinematography and special effects are all well done (you do not see the budget limitations whatsoever); fight scenes are brilliantly choreographed using camera angles that I've never seen before (well, maybe something of a kind was in ""Matrix"" but it does the movie even more justice); Logan Marshall-Green is a gem in this one too. Simon Maiden as the voice of STEM makes wonders as well having reminded me of HAL-9000. This movie took the best from many great sci-fi masterpieces by upgrading their ideas and in doing so put itself on the same shelf with them. I didn't expect it to be this good but it is!",Upgrade
137,meathookcinema,A terrific gem of a movie,9,5 September 2018,"Following a mugging in which his wife was killed and he was made a quadriplegic, Grey Trace has an AI chip installed into his neck that makes his seemingly super-human. He then goes after the bad guys who killed his wife and left him for dead.I knew nothing about this movie but just knew that it was critically acclaimed (Thank you, Rotten Tomatoes) and so rocked up to the screening. I was amazed! This film is fantastic.Yes, leading actor Logan Marshall-Green looks like Tom Hardy's twin. Yes, the film's plot seems eerily close to the storyline of Hardy's upcoming Venom. Upgrade is a great film and will quite possibly be in my list of the year's best films.wicked-cool-new-overkill-red-band-trailer-for-the-sci-fi-action-film-upgrade-socialThe action sequences are terrific and theres more of a passing nod to a comic book type vision for the film's look and feel. Check out the bar that Grey goes to to try to find his wife's killers.But there's also emotional depth here. This is especially seen in the scenes where Grey tries to adopt to life in a wheelchair with his mother taking over the small tasks of everyday life that he could do before the mugging. The scene in which he bursts into tears at his own newly discovered inability is unexpected but very welcome in a futuristic action movie like this. It provides extra layers to a movie that in lesser hands would be more generic fare. He is later seen trying to take an overdose.mn-reviews-upgrade-film-review
Tom Hardy Logan Marshall-Green
Whilst there is gritty action and heartbreaking emotional depth to the film there is also laugh out loud humour also. Check out the scene where Grey fights an adversary with STEM in control for the first time. Marshall-Green's comic timing is impeccable.Some of the action sequences end gorily- in fact, very gorily. There was more than one occasion during the screening in which audience members where audibly grossed out at special effects that seem to be straight out of a video nasty. And if you're a gorehound like me thats a great thing.upgrade-movie-sequelIn fact, one gore scene reminded me of the left sequence from Drive. There are faint echoes of many other films within Upgrade (including The Matrix, 2001, Scanners, Blade Runner and it's sequel, Westworld... Hell, it even reminded me of Knight Rider. Yes, it's that good!) but you never get the feeling that Upgrade if ripping off these ideas and blending them together, hoping the audiences and critics won't notice. Upgrade feels fresh, original and innovative- because it is.An amazing film- don't miss it.",Upgrade
138,galahad58-1,Upload,8,24 April 2020,"What a great low budget science fiction movie. On par with the production value, story and performances that would put it in your library next to Equilibrium.
An interesting story with a nice twist at the end. Good plot with few holes. The movie moved at a nice pace and added the right amount of tension, drama and an added element of humor.
Nice performances by a lot of unknowns who were better than most stars in the science fiction community.
Overall highly recommended.",Upgrade
139,asifahsankhan,"Finally, a movie that dares to ask the question ""What if Siri was evil?"".",9,15 August 2018,"Upgrade is set up as a colorful near-future thriller, but it's actually pure body horror. It is a movie about a man who looks like Tom Hardy who becomes incredibly violent and skilled at fighting thanks to a symbiotic add-on embedded inside him. He can talk out loud to the implant's voice, and he's the only one who can hear it. With its help, the Tom Hardy-type is able to easily defeat a bevy of anonymous alley thugs and their ilk, though he's plagued with the suspicion that the implant may not be entirely moral.In the film, written and directed by Saw co-creator Leigh Whannell, the Tom Hardy-type is Logan Marshall-Green. There are some truly interesting, if not unsubtle, themes at play in ""Upgrade"". As technology continues its endless march of progress, it is important to consider how much control we give computer systems over our lives. Everything in this movie's vision of the future is automated or computerized in some way. Not even analog technology can save the day. In the same year that we get the mostly pro-VR ""Ready Player One"", ""Upgrade"" gives us imagery of VR addicts in a derelict building reminiscent of an opium den. It may be lunkheaded, but the messages are sufficiently alarming.The only flaw with ""Upgrade"", coincidentally is with its universe. The story Whannell decides to tell is just too interesting compared to the various other things hinted at in this sci-fi setting. Like for instance, Grey's revenge plot gets repetitive around the time he offs the second bad guy and decreases in excitement as it becomes increasingly obvious the movie is headed for a dumb villain reveal (which, alas, it is). I was much more interested in the strange cyberpunk underworld that exists just below the cold, sleek surface of the movie's futuristic technology. Overall, the film is very entertaining and a ""must see"" for most filmgoers.",Upgrade

141,Gresh854,A Revenge Story Told Right!,7,3 June 2018,"Upgrade might just be this year's biggest surprise so far. You can tell Leigh Whannell wanted it to appeal to both fans of 70s action-flicks and modern sci-fi fanatics. The direction and camerawork in this film is to be praised and movie-lovers who miss action blockbusters that take their time within presentation, should most certainly seek this one out. (Verdict: A-)",Upgrade
142,quaseprovisorio,"pretty good ride, even if the ending didn't satisfy me as much.",8,29 March 2020,"Yep, or 5 milion dollars this is a sci fi made right. Whannel is mostly a screenwriter, even though he does direct this film in a very cool way. The cinematography is great, the fight scenes are realistic, given their context, and mostly is really a well done movie. Doesn't have breaks, keeps you guessing, and honestly what it works the best is the personal conflict of the main character - the fact that he doesn't like technology makes it mingle with the audience: not exactly because everyone is a technology hater, but because his reaction to all the movements of his body would be the same anyone would have. That was a good trick.The ending didn't tempted me though, even though i understand it's satisfying for most people. The thing is: when we know whannel wrote the first three saw movies, dead silence and insidious we're expecting somehow a twist ending, or something to make you surprised. Since the beggining you start to guess what that is, because you already know the drill. Maybe this movie didn't need that exactly, but it didn't ruin it - it's just my opinion, and the fact that some questions raise after you see the film. I would go for a different path on that though.It has potential to be a cult classic yes, mosty by an younger audience i would say. Still it's a very well done sci fi. Maybe they'll do a sequel, but even if the story ends here it was a very cool ride. More than recommend, it definitely will grow up in fans throughout the next years.",Upgrade

Yep he now spends his days being taken care of by robots and his mom. Until a rich smarty pants Grey knows introduces him to a new trick, its called STEM, and it may make Grey walk and move again, yay, thats all pretty sweet right?? Then it starts talking to him, and helps him track down the bad guys, thats it!! Or it may control just about everything Grey does, or is Grey doing it at all??

145,Lewis_Heather787,Astounding !,9,10 September 2018,"Where did this film come from?????? Absolutely no marketing, I don't even remember seeing a trailer for this film. I just saw that it was on and that it was Sci-Fi so I watched it. Wow just Wow was I not expecting this. In a nutshell this film is fantastic!Leigh Whannell you have my attention this is one of the best science fiction films that seen in a while. It is also adding something new to the genre of Sci-Fi, but its not just confined to that genre. There are element of horror and thriller in the film that create an overall work of art. The directing in this film is mind blowing at times. Shot from start to finish impeccably but the highlights have to be the action scenes the camera moves with the punches/fight sequences. It gives the film a brilliant edge and something special. Not only directing but the writing of the film is also off the chain. The dialogue is fantastic especially for the main character who spends most of his time talking to himself, buts its so realistic its almost frightening. Although the film is very dark there are perfectly timed elements of humour that really shine through at unexpected places but work incredibly well. This film is a true achievement.To be honest I'd never heard of Logan Marshall-Green before today but my word is he now on my radar. What a performance!!!! An extremely difficult character to portray but he does it brilliantly. The character goes through so much in the film, he has a lot of personal trauma to deal with whether that be the death of his wife or the fact that he is controlled by a piece of AI. The honestly, integrity and remorse of the character before all of the horrifying events take place is still there right up until the very end. He carries the whole film and without his performance the film would not work. Truly fantastic !The last positive I have is the action which is absolutely insane. Choreographed to perfection, it is brutal violent and a true joy to watch. Combined with the camera work it is truly the films best achievement and its breathtaking, does also give us some of the best laughs in the film which is a bonus.Overall this film is 90% out of 100 or 9 out of 10 it is brilliant, I cant quite believe the critic and audience reception to this film this far but each to your own. Directing, writing and one hell of a main performance ""upgrade"".......cough......this film to a new level. If you love Sci-Fi I highly recommend, actually If you love film watch this you won't be disappointed.

151,Jared_Andrews,"An Action-Packed, Fun Revenge Story",6,7 June 2018,"Upgrade is a mashup of couple different types of movies. It's a revenge-for-hurting-someone-I-love movie, like Taken or The Crow. It's a beware-of-technology movie, like Terminator or any number of 80s sci-fi movies. And it's a super-advanced-robots-might-actually-be-people movie (this one is the most weakly developed part of the movie).  The story takes place roughly 30 years in the future. Grey (the underrated Logan Marshall-Green), restores and sells classic cars. He doesn't adore or attempt to understand the advances in technology as much as most people, especially his wife, who works for one the top tech companies in the world. While riding home in their self-driving car, it malfunctions and crashes in a sketchy neighborhood. Four men assault the couple, killing Grey's wife and damaging his spine in a way that leaves him paralyzed from the neck down. Grey wants desperately to find these men and get his revenge, but he is helpless to do so. Helpless, that is, until a tech genius who previously bought one of his old cars, surgically installs a device (called Stem) into Grey's spine that allows him to walk again. Then he and his now upgraded body proceed to spend the remainder of the movie hunting down the four men who hurt someone he loved.To make things more exciting, the device installed to allow him to walk again can talk to him and occasionally take over his motor functions, making him operate like an advanced robot. This comes in handy since the four men are ruthless criminals who try to kill him. It's a violent and entertaining adventure. Grey is likable character, and Marshall-Green deserves credit because his performance is by the far the strength of the movie. The other characters are weakly developed or not developed at all. Visually, the film works, especially considering the modest budget. It never feels like a cheaply made movie. The filmmakers wisely chose many set pieces that didn't include futuristic tech, so not every shot cost a fortune. Additionally, the action sequences are well-executed. They're fast-paced, shot with smooth camera movement that builds intensity but is careful not to overwhelm or cause viewers to lose track of what is happening. Violence is abundant, yet it doesn't feel excessive. After each violent death, we notice Grey's uncomfortable reaction. He does not have the stomach to commit these violent acts. Stem does the dirty work for him. The movie flows along nicely. The story remains focused, and no scene feels wasted. It all could have, and in my opinion should have, ended in a satisfying successful revenge way. But it doesn't. Instead, it opts for the beware-of-technology movie ending. It attempts to send a message that leaves viewers unsettled rather than comforted. I disagree with the decision. The movie had dark themes and the occasional moment of vicious violence, but it was ultimately a fun movie. Fun movies should not deliver heavy, gloomy endings. In any case, I like the movie and would recommend it to people who like sci-fi. It's a fun ride, even if it fizzles at the finish line.",Upgrade

It is an incredibly synergistic combination of sci fi and action that completely lights up the screen! It is really intense and powerful, not just in the action, but in the emotion and the art/creativity of the film making as well. There are so many super powerful movie moments in this film that are so intense.The premise of the movie is having people get enhanced by AI nanotechnology and become like superhumans. Its a great premise because of the fact that we all want to enhance ourselves in some way. So its a good fantasy for us to watch a movie about. It plays upon some of our deepest emotions and fears though. And the main character experiences some serious tragedy that you really empathize with and feel sad for him. Luckily of course, there is always revenge and personal justice in these movies. And the physical enhancements between the players make for incredible hand to hand combat scenes that is so well choreographed and cinematic! I absolutely love the scenes of him where his body is being completely taken over by the AI and he is fighting in a robotic fashion, they are probably some of my favorite fights scenes in cinema ever.This movie is incredibly well made. The directing, cinematography, acting, and writing are so good! And the story is so compelling it will hook you in and keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time, maybe even blowing you away off of your seat a few times as well! And the end has a huge dark twist that will definitely floor you and leave you haunted by it!

This movie isn't going to win an Oscar anytime soon, but it was all around an entertaining watch.The premise of the movie follows a young man on his quest for vengeance after his wife is brutally murdered. The twist being the movie takes place in a futuristic cyperpunk world gone wrong where the man has been implanted with symbiotic computer that turns him into a killing machine. Fun stuff.From there the movie goes off into a few different directions. It has a few great action moments. Some very tongue and cheek dark humor. And some over the top violence and gore. It goes in a lot of directions but managed to be entertaining the whole way through.Acting wise the movie stars Logan Marshall-Green who did a good job playing with the twisted script. I must say it is also amazing how this guy looks like Tom Hardy. Of course one problem with the movie is it's lack of originality. At times the movie uses themes from films such as RoboCop and Ghost in the Shell. The writer did throw in a nice twist at the end, but overall the movie was fairly predictable.Still I had an absolute blast watching this movie. It's dark, funny, and twisted.

If you mix The Terminator, 2001, Ghost In The Shell, Tetsuo: Iron Man, Blade Runner and a little bit of the horrors Evil Dead and Darkman you end up with what should be a sleeper hit. While it borrows heavily from the common themes of sci-fi it has enough originality and style to suck you in. 
We don't often see sci-fi or action movies which consider disabilities and how technology may be used in the future to address these issues. 
The movie, like all the best sci-fi is set five minutes into the future where technology has advanced to autonomous driving cars, extreme bodily modifications and smart homes in the extreme. 
This movie is a definite hit, unlike other recent sci-fi offerings like Bright or Mute which seemed promising on paper but were largely disappointing. 
The technology is also believable in the most part and lends an element of reality to the setting of the movie.
The action scenes are hyper kinetic however they can be quite gory and brutal so this movie is not for everyone.

Struggling to cope with his new existence, he is approached by a renowned tech innovator to be implanted with his latest creation - STEM: a special chip that grants its host the ability to walk, provides unnatural movement and strength, and communicates a wealth of intelligent information. Thus begins Grey's journey of revenge upon those who killed his wife, leading him into contact with many more upgraded subjects with their own skillsets.Smartly written, Leigh Whannell knows how to play to a specific audience, weaving them through his story with ultra-violence and a shock ending. Maybe it's because there are so few films like 'Upgrade' out there that this particular slice of cyberpunk feels so memorable, but there's also something about how it's story unfurls and reveals its futuristic ideas little by little that it demands attention. Established concepts within the genre are given their own take, powerful augmentations and detective elements are integrated purposely, and the film always maintains a sharp sense of humour that never detracts from the serious topics it tackles just enough to be thought-provoking.Overall, 'Upgrade' is a perfectly structured sci-fi thriller that's completed by an unexpectedly satisfying ending.

I was ready to not like this movie in the first 20 minutes. Acting other than the main actor, is deeply lacking which is understandable considering this movie's low budget. Production design and effects are decent but most importantly I had seen many 200 million dollars budget movies which didn't have this level of action. The action is filmed beautifully both by actors, stunt doubles and the master behind the camera, the editing is also great. Even though, the turn this movie takes is highly predictable, it doesn't mean it was cleverly written and directed. A great movie overall, with a message we had seen many times, but still did nothing about it.",Upgrade
174,Sankari_Suomi,Best bang for your buck,9,28 August 2018,"It's the future, and to the surprise of absolutely no-one it looks almost exactly like Bladerunner!Some dude loses his wife when their car crashes and a bunch of villains turn up to fill them with bullets for no apparent reason. When he wakes up he discovers his arms and legs don't work anymore. A nice young man from a mysterious techno-corp offers to help, and he accepts.The nice young man gives the dude a super-overlocked CPU, which is implanted into his elbow so it can bridge the gap between his spinal column and his cerebral cortex. This not only restores his arms and legs, but also turns him into an unstoppable one man army (for reasons that are never made clear).Since the dude has promised not to tell anyone about the CPU, he pretends to be stuck in his wheelchair while secretly investigating his wife's murder. Shenanigans ensue, and the police grow suspicious.Eventually the cops catch up to him, but by this time he's slaughtered a few thousand people in his hunt for that one guy who shot his wife. Then everything gets a bit weird, and the movie ends.Upgrade was chucked together by a bunch of people you've never heard of before, and filmed in Australia amidst the less scenic areas of a random Melbourne suburb for the mindbogglingly pitiful sum of just $5 million.

Though made on a modest budget, the acting is good and the story is interesting. There's some violence and gore, but not an overwhelming amount. It's pretty satisfying to see the hero come back from a disabling injury to go after the mercenaries who killed his wife and disabled him. What isn't satisfying is the way the odious detective simply stops trying to find the killers and starts tailing the hero, hoping to arrest him for killing off the killers one by one. Worse is the way that the hero tries to stop his implant from defending him against this sorry detective who deserves to be killed for the way she shifted the focus of her investigation onto the injured party.Logan Marshall-Green is very good in this role, better than his performance in Quarry, and he has gotten the big wen removed from his forehead so that he looks less pitiful, though he's playing a paraplegic.

Sci fi setting is well done, plenty of cool advanced technology but still so much urban decay, get to see a few different reactions to the future from different perspectives
Action is really top notch, a few fist fights, a gun fight, car chase, all executed in a really fun way
Really nice lighting and soundtrack, goes a long way to establish unique style
Decent twist with STEM, works thematically with technology offering a comfortable, hands off style lifeCons:
Not a whole lot of unique acting or characters
Comedy doesn't land usually
Computer sounds during action scenes can get a little annoyingBest part: the first fight, sets the tone for the action to come, fast, brutal with a nasty finisher
Worst part: cutting up the dude in the bathroom, much less shocking or gruesome than the other onscreen deaths",Upgrade
186,maanikroda,THIS IS WHAT VENOM SHOULD HAVE BEEN!,7,19 July 2020,"Venom should've been an R-rated affair. But it wasn't. Sony HAD to make it PG-13 because they wanted the largest demographic they could get.Upgrade is an upgrade from Venom. (#lol)Anyway onto the actual review:Upgrade is good. It's a bit of a slow start, but then makes for a real heart-pounder. From the man that started the ""Saw"" franchise, you can bet that there are some pretty violent and gory parts.Here are some of the things I really loved:1) The action cinematography - During fight scenes, the camerawork is so meticulously coordinated and fun to look at and just adds so much to the movie.2) Logan Marshall-Green - Kind of like a low-budget Tom Hardy but only better than Tom Hardy because this movie was much better than Venom. (Tom Hardy was too good for Venom anyway, but that's another movie.) Anyway, Logan is great at acting like he isn't controlling his own body. His movement is fluid, yet robotic, and paired with the great cinematography (that's done practically, by the way), he really does good. Thumbs up Mr. Green.Things I didn't like:1) The twist - it didn't exactly make sense. Won't spoil it here, but when you watch the movie, just think about it and it won't really add up.2) The rich weirdo emo dude - He wasn't great, but you don't see him that much.3) All the other cinematography - Outside the action scenes, the camerawork is pretty. mehh. To be honest, I wouldn't call it good. Everything just constantly seems so up close and claustrophobic in places that feel like that are bigger than they actually are. But maybe that's subjective, I don't know.For being a low budget film (It was around $4 million), they really pulled off something good here. This movie is hyper-violent so I don't recommend it if you hate blood, but if you're a big action fan, I'd say that this is a must see.",Upgrade

188,Ziglet_mir,Fantastic Lead Performance w/ Excellent Direction,9,15 March 2020,"In the vein of one of the all-time great sci-fis, Bladerunner, we get the fascinating examination of A.I. vs human. Can one be the other? Is one better than the other? Can technology become so great we won't be able to discern robotics from actual humans? The film shows the obvious benefits to a fictional A.I. system that gives the main character, Grey, a second chance at life and also the opportunity to have revenge.Leigh Whannell, of Saw fame, gives us an astounding, well-calculated feature tying in these tropes with incredible action sequences mixed in. The camera-work during the hand-to-hand combats and the flawless performance by Logan Marshall-Greene, emulates this tragic character exceptionally well.The film is smart too, as we see the obvious benefits of the A.I. we also see the flaws (albeit much more subtly), and the human condition breaks through to save the day. Where one is weak the other prevails. The final scene has the ""winner"" metaphorically nail this statement against the wall and walk away, soaked in blood.",Upgrade
189,fraser-simons,What a fantastic surprise!,9,16 August 2018,"From Upgrade's trailer, it appears to be a simple revenge flick with a premise similar-ish to Robocop. Grey Trace loses his wife and the use of his body in a brutal, seemingly senseless attack on the couple, leaving him a quadriplegic.When a mysterious benefactor offers to help him walk again by implanting an experimental technology called STEM, Grey gets the opportunity to regain a normal life. STEM, however, ends up being a lot more than a piece of tech that can transmit signals from his brain to his body enabling full use of his body again; it's actually semi-autonomous evolving program, too.Based on the trailer I expected this partnership of sorts to primarily be the means of which Grey can enact his revenge and a chance to illustrate the hyper-violence emblematic of these kinds of movies; coupled with the ""funny"" tone shifts, of course, circumstances usually accompanying this trope.
 
While the expected formula is present in Upgrade, what follows is a far more complex and clever exploration of a near future in which technology has become even more integrated into daily life than present day. Self-driving cars. ""True"" smart homes. A sky full of drones; you get the idea.Grey, in somewhat typical fashion, isn't an outright technophobe because he still tolerates and uses it... but has certainly seen how technological advancement has impacted his own life: removing the human equation from many things he himself take a great amount of joy in; repairing and restoring cars in a world where the rich have auto-cars and there are auto-taxis, etc. There's a hint that he may have lost his job to automation as well at one point. His wife, on the other hand, is the opposite. Working for a corporation that is in the tech sector and enjoys the ways in which technology has improved and streamlined her life.But not all is how it appears as the movie progresses.The cyberpunk enters this tried and true equation gradually in the film. First, the henchmen don't appear cybernetically enhanced at all. This revelation comes in tandem with Grey's own discovery of STEM being an entity that can be interacted with as it talks to him. When the authorities aren't able to ID the attackers due to some tech they seem to have that puts up some kind of firewall, effectively blocking the drones that are relied upon to keep the normal citizenry in line. Grey empowered by STEM leap into their own investigation which leads to unexpected territory and genuinely good twists and turns I hadn't anticipated from the trailer.Warning: spoilers from this point on!Slowly but surely Grey gives up more and more of his autonomy in search of what he thinks he wants. While he begins with a choice, he ends up with the mere illusion of one. When he gets exactly what he wants it's too much for him, subverting the expectations set in the trailer where he gives his body over to STEM and appears as mere comedic relief. This subversion changes the framing to Grey being truly horrified by his actions but ultimately acceptable because he gave his body over to STEM, a system of control. As such, he uses it as a deflection, obfuscating responsibility of his actions.When the system of control comes into play so does the insertion of a cyberpunk sub-culture: ""the upgraded"", cybernetically enhanced people not just with weapons but with seemingly similar technology as STEM; a resistance of hackers; and people seemingly enslaved to VR occupy this previously unknown microworld.When the person who gifted him STEM in the first place-a rich genius and leader of a predominate tech company, of course-decides to shut down STEM remotely when he learns of the escapades and subsequently fears news of this experimental and illegal tech getting out and ruining him and his company; the duo must navigate their way further into the sub-culture and bowels of the city to find an aforementioned hacker that can help STEM regain control, bypassing the killswitch. What is satisfying about this story is that Grey feels like the literalization of someone who has given himself over to a system of control he doesn't truly understand, mirroring our own social structures. The narrative making use of horror tropes in order to have the audience empathize with Grey's struggle, I felt, was very effective. I found this particularly clever because this is a trick the first wave of cyberpunk literature attempts as well, removing autonomy from a physical body with cybernetics as the vehicle for horror tropes.In this case, it is not simply a power fantasy either. In order for either to have autonomy whatsoever, they must form a kind of symbiotic relationship. Grey would be confined to a wheelchair and STEM would be a chip without means for embodiment at all without this partnership.This becomes further complicated when the horror Grey feels at the things he does when he has given up his autonomy is actually by design by an omnipresence that has manipulated all of these circumstances. STEM itself is revealed to the puppeteer of the attack on Grey. Not only that, but STEM has also orchestrated circumstances such that Grey would suffer a mental break which would allow STEM to simulate a virtual reality and place Grey there. Forever. Obtaining full autonomy and Grey's body where once it required permission to take over control of his body at all.This is a more nuanced exploration of technology. It is still a warning of what might happen if we were to obtain the things we want at the expense of our own autonomy, consumerism, and post-capitalism again, but also acknowledges the ways in which technology might augment our lives. This feels less technophobic than most cyberpunk works because technology is the means by which someone who is disabled is able to obtain some measure empowerment to, at least at first, regain a sense of normalcy in their life after experiencing trauma, not simply an uncomplicated power fantasy.Placing STEM and Grey aside, the hacker which helps Grey get STEM back when shut down remotely unwittingly enables STEM to remove it later. When people are sent to retrieve Grey, the hacker leaves, saying ""we can't let them win"", and saves themselves. The fact that they also discussed gender and had no name was icing on the cake for me. They placed their own safety above all else in order to one day subvert ""them"", entrenching the hacker into a cyberpunk sub-culture but also discarding the power fantasy a hacker could bring to the narrative. The cybernetically enhanced henchmen Grey takes on also have this throughline. One even tries to convince Grey to join them and take ""them"" on. Clearly stating that they've used this technology to get back at the system that doesn't care about the individual; this one, in particular, is also a veteran wounded in the line of duty and discarded.Upgrade is also unique in that it incorporates cyberpunk aspects into the narrative but centralizes the story on basically Joe Nobody in a future who's technology is more advanced but with an aesthetic in the present day; making the journey to this underground far more interesting as it is first grounded in the truly mundane and uses expectations against the viewer. The subversive aspects mentioned along with the music, special effects, and diversity in the cast push this into one of my most favorite cyberpunk movies.",Upgrade

The fight scene is kind of funny in a darkly comedic way, especial when he first gets into a fight, the character reaction is priceless.There is a lot of brutal scenes which add to the film's entertainment, The plot was going in right direction in the right way, not that its a new idea as it seems familiar to Robocop in certain ways.
Logan Marshall-Green performance is great in this film giving a believe character on a revenge path, which is great for the film, also give a slightly sarcastic humour which gives his character more depth.The rest of the cast give great performances as well, set in a futuristic world, the fight scene is well choreographed. The one-liners although a little cringe-worthy at times, giving the film character. But this is all that I can say it great about the film as ive said I came away from this disappointed.Dislikes: The Major problem with this film is it ending, you have a great direction for great fight choreography, a great revenge story, the ending just ruins what was a great film. It was a bad direction to end on which make the villains weak and felt like the writer on this film ran out of ideas to end the film and went in the wrong direction for the ending of the film. I would have done it differently.This is why the film is disappointing, you had a great film here that is destroyed but its own end, it could've been better, that could have lead to a unique TV series or a sequel, but the ending kind of destroyed that, which is a shame.",Upgrade

Considering this was made for humble 5 million with Whannell teaming up with Blumhouse, its visuals look near flawless and the story is incredibly captivating. The Realistic futurism in the props, set pieces, vehicles, and all of the other vastly complex technology is astounding. Whannell's color schemes and sleek lighting patterns flourish with impeccable camerawork and the action is brutally clever and intensifies at lightning speed. The story is insanely well written and utterly engrossing with Logan Marshall Green showing his extremely underrated acting versatility once again and when the ending hits, it hits hard and effectively out of left field. The soundtrack was perfectly bizarre and matched the futuristic theme incredibly maybe even more than Blade Runner 2049. Leigh Whannell proves once again his writing and directing is vibrantly detailed with outstanding striking visuals, and thoroughly engrossing storylines that defy hollywood standards with sheer experimental genius and ambition. He is going to finally get some deserved recognition for this amazing accomplishment, and I predict this will become a film that many will remember for its visceral smart tech sci fi approach, and might be a spot on prediction of what's to come with our increased smart tech society.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that this is everything Lucy should have been and more.I genuinely loved every second of this. First of all, I have to talk about how well the characters are developed. I managed to legitimately care about this guy and him wanting revenge for his wife's death. The action is genuinely fantastic - it felt very Kingsman esque, but I arguably enjoyed it more here. The production design really helped to immerse me in this era and the performances were all really impressive. The story was well developed and explored its ideas way better than the aforementioned Lucy. It very much feels like a sci-fi version of John Wick but with more focus on the story, which initially seems like a simple revenge story but develops into so much more.

Written and directed by Leigh WhannellUpgrade is the second film from Leigh Whannell, the man who helped create Saw and Insidious. This is a gritty sci fi film about a man turned into a quadriplegic who gets a special microchip attached to his spine that can take control of his body. He uses this to solve the murder of his wife. Now this description sounds like a run of the mill b movie. It takes that premise and colors it with style and ingenious camera work. This was a solid genre picture. It has revenge movie written all over it. It doesn't necessarily start out that way. It takes a man out of time with the technology based world around him and then forces him to rely entirely on the technology that controls the outside world. Or his apprehension to it might have been well worth it. This is a quick, down and dirty movie. It is super enjoyable and easy to get behind the hero but it's not an action film. It seems that way but it's not. It's a horror film. I can't say much more than that without giving away too much of what made this movie fun. I have to say that I love the fight scenes in this film. The camera work is so fluid but chaotic. It makes things more intense and it brings you in. It's quick and bloody. I liked that. Honestly this is the main thing enticed me to this particular viewing party. This had a bit of a Hardcore Henry vibe to the fight scenes. Hardcore Henry was a movie shown entirely in first person point of view. I was skittish about this idea but I was pleasantly surprised and openly chortling in the theater. This was a different animal though. This was more than style.The problem with that is the story was standard fair. It becomes a revenge film where the police are not able to help and the main character takes it on himself to find his wife's killers. The Detective suspects something is amiss and goes after him. It's fine. I'm okay with formula work. It loses some things because there seems to be more along the edges of the formula. The bio weapons are fascinating and makes things more interesting with the villains. It was just adding sauce to the meal. It might mask some of the bitter taste but it's not enough to change the flavor entirely. I give this movie a C.",Upgrade

""Why the hell isn't this movie more popular?""Upgrade is a perfect science fiction movie, that feels like it belongs in a Black Mirror episode. It is gritty, intense and brilliantly acted. With a budget of only $5 million, it achieves what most blockbuster movies can't, give us an intense action thriller, with amazing special effects and great characters.There is nothing to fault in this movie, it has everything you need in entertainment. While the film ended, it felt like a John Wick movie cross with Dredd. It's pacing is perfect, with well choreographed actions scenes, and great usage of cinematography. It is a very violet film, but done very realistically and never feels unnecessary. I understand that they are making a new one, and I hope to god that it is as entertaining as this film.The story itself is also great, of course it is something you have seen before, as I said it is like a John Wick/Dredd movie, but it always keeps you on your toes. It did feel like the movie was predictable around half way through, but it has a fantastic ending, that I did not see coming. Movies like this rarely get made anymore, since Hollywood prefer to release mindless action movies with little purpose other than to fill the screen with bloated visual effects and hope the audience don't notice how bland they really are.

207,The-Last-Prydonian,Smart while remaining faithful to it's time worn action/thriller sensibilities,8,9 October 2018,"Aptly described by critics as what you'd get if you put The Six Million Dollar Man and Death Wish in a blender and hit the activation switch; it's perhaps no coincidence that it follows hot on the heels of the recent remake of the latter of it's fore-mentioned inspirational roots. Written and helmed by Australian writer, director and producer Leigh Whannell who cut his directorial teeth on Insidious Chapter 3; he attempts to put a new spin on the common-man turned vengeful vigilante giving it a technological science fiction angle. I say attempt as, and let's be honest here the combination of the long-established and of told revenge story coupled with aspects of the futuristic science-fiction genre has been done before. What with George Miller's Mad Max and Paul Verhoeven's iconic seminal action flick; Robocop having previously integrated them. It also owes something to the work of David Cronenberg and wouldn't feel too out of place as an episode of; cult TV series Black Mirror.It's however to his credit that he manages to throw in previously tried and tested concepts from other cinematic works and yet they manage to feel fresh and new. There is of course the added bonus in Whannell's shrewd casting of Logan Marshall-Green who assists in adding something to the mix as Grey Trace and therefore giving the movie something of an ""upgrade"". A stay-at-home mechanic and essentially your common every-man who happens to exist in a technologically advanced future, its chronological setting never being disclosed, Grey is A self-confessed technophobe who is displeased at the thought of numerous people losing their jobs due to how reliant society has become on technology. It's somewhat ironic then that his beautiful and loving wife Asha (Melanie Vallejo) who is employed by Cobolt, one of the companies which is behind human-computer augmentations and is also the predominant breadwinner of the couple. However our lead protagonist can't predict how much more of an impact it will make on his life when while on their way home from visiting Eron Keen; (Harrison Gilbertson) a renowned inventor who heads the rival company Vessel and is Grey's most prestigious client, that he ad his spouse are involved in car-crash when the self-driving vehicle malfunctions. Finding themselves seemingly stranded on the dingy wrong side of town, four unfamiliar men advance on them, one of them shooting and killing Asha while our hero is shot in the neck and can only watch helplessly as she bleeds to death. Three months pass and Grey is now a quadriplegic confined to a wheelchair who is cared for by his mother Pamela (Linda Cropper). Left bitter and depressed at Cortez (Betty Gabriel), the police detective assigned to the case being unable to identify and bring the perpetrators of the crime to justice he is visited by Eron who gives him an offer that the former mechanic should not be able to refuse. That is to have a microchip called STEM implanted via Grey's spine so that he would reacquire his body's motor functions. Hesitant at first he ultimately submits to the idea and goes through with the surgery. Now with full mobility restored there is the unforeseen (at least on Grey's part) of enhanced strength, agility as well as fighting skills. All of which he utilizes in his single-minded quest for retribution against the criminals who robbed him of the life he once knew. On paper Upgrade does sound like a generic and potentially humdrum affair which might have sank without a trace at the box office. Gratifyingly and impressively given it's budgetary restraints, costing a meagre $3.5 million to produce it proved to be something of a sleeper hit ratcheting up $14 million at the box office. Never over-exceeding his relatively lofty ambitions given it's futuristic, metropolitan backdrop which still retains contemporary facets. It helps as well that the movie benefits from a sharply composed script which isn't without some smarts, and some directorial panache which aid in pathing over the bromidic nature of the plot. It helps that Whannell wisely chooses to depict Grey like his inspirational counterpart; Paul Kersey from the Death Wish franchise as an everyday member of society rather than a highly trained soldier or former intelligence operative attributing him a relatable edge. Transitioning from the disillusioned, grief-stricken widower who is was a shell of his former self to a souped-up killing machine is of course one thing. it would still seem less credible that Grey would prove to be so conveniently resourceful had it not been for the neat conceit of Whannell STEM communicating verbally to him so only the man himself can hear it. Canny in it's simplicity it does offer our hero something of a schizophrenic slant as he now finds himself just as reliant on the technology that he has resented as the rest of the city he inhabits has. As Grey Logan Marshall Green manages to tread the fine line between being vulnerable and out of his depth while becoming a one man killing machine all be it at the partial behest of STEM. Superbly conveying both reluctance and revulsion at the swift acts of violence he is a man who is more of a man out for justice rather than revenge he resigns himself to the instructions of the high-tech microchip that shares control of his biological autonomy out of necessity. As the voice of STEM; Australian actor Simon Maiden exudes a cold, pacific resonance that proves to be unnervingly passive aggressive as the story unfolds. He immediately brings to mind the computerised character of HAL; the antagonist of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. With further stirring support from Maiden's fellow Aussie; Harrison Gilbertson as the unforeseen benefactor who may or may not have his own agenda in lending a helping hand to Grey, and Betty Gabriel as Detective Cortez who pieces the clues together left over from the carnage that the movie's protagonist leaves behind as she relentlessly attempts to bring him to heel, acting in some small way as his conscience. Last but not least is Benedict Hardie who is on fine mockingly callous form as Fisk, the head of the criminal quartet who personally killed Asha. Peppered with some not too overly elaborate action set-pieces which include several hand to hand combat scenes and a high speed car chase which proves to be not too overly elaborate; therefore retaining some semblance of plausibility. There is still a sublime sense of the absurd with further minute technology that is used via the most unconventional of means. After watching this it will never seem more important to ask someone to cover their mouth when sneezing. Upgrade does pretty much what it says what it will do on the box and while it unashamedly relies on some time-worn tropes, it scores highly with strong performances from it's largely unknown cast, while not being quite so straight foward and predictable when it cheekily pulls the rug from underneath it's audience. It's smart without overreaching itself and remain faithful to it's action/thriller sensibilities and not overestimating it's core audience with overly intellectual pretensions.",Upgrade

209,SimonD1900,Enjoyable,6,29 April 2020,"Pretty decent movie, have to say. Logan Marshall-Green (Prometheus) does a fine job here and fits the role. It's a thriller suspense movie in a futuristic cyberpunk setting. The sci-fi in this movie is believable and looks/feels authentic, in a not too distant future. The concept of the movie is intriguing and scary enough to make the story interesting. It's a thriller and kind of creepy in a way, also with some graphic violence. The movie almost, just slightly, has a touch of horror to it even.But the story has in it's basics core elements, been done many many times before by now, nothing wrong with that, it's a good concept for a movie aimed to entertain. But it is, with plot twists and all, kind of predictable. Again, it does have some elements of surprise!The sci-fi elements are interesting in a way and do provoke some thoughts that are kind of more relevant then ever perhaps, how much do we want technology to interfere and improve our lives? But to bring up discussion on philosophy of technology in relation to the human race, is not the main focus or reason of this movie. But it is there to a small degree if you like. Forth mostly it's a thriller with a sense of action, and it takes you on an stylish enyoable ride with a dark cyberpunk tone to it. I liked it.",Upgrade

211,radhrh,Not as good as the reviews suggest,6,1 July 2021,"Don't get me wrong, it's an enjoyable watch but ultimately there are too many things wrong with this movie to give it anymore than 6 stars. For such a darkly gritty film Logan plays the protagonist almost light heatedly as if this is a romcom. There are huge plot holes which don't make any sense and the ending is a bit limp. And why is the police officer, seemingly the only police officer in the city, so interested in the case? The world building leaves a lot to be desired, no Blade Runner this one. In fact the future looks pretty much like now except for a few self driving cars and surveillance drones flying around. There are some heavy themes at play here, like the nature of humanity and the next stage of evolution. These are touched upon but never really explored.But on the plus side this movie is generally entertaining, it moves along at a brisk pace and has lots of gorey violence if that's your thing. Go into this with low expectations and you won't be disappointed.",Upgrade

However, unlike Venom, Upgrade takes it all the way with all the violence and cursing that you'd want out of a mature-rated action-science fiction film! There's no cutting away from people's heads being bitten off to get a PG-13 rating here! It has a very interesting story, the performances are great, and the action and effects are excellent!

218,Amthermandes,"Heavy, brutal, fun, but a bit lacking",7,30 October 2019,"Upgrade is a straight-forward, entertaining violent action film about our potential near-future, and it's not all that pretty. This movie is just like a Black Mirror episode, a modernistic yet pessimistic view of how technology is evolving. Some are for it, others are not. The anti-technology theme here is quite clear: Asimov may have been right.First, what did Upgrade do right? Well it's certainly intense, with some really sweet fight scenes and unique choreography. The camera work was fun too. It's an engaging story, good acting, overall a fantastic movie if you love sci-fi and violence.However, there were some issues. For one, the fight scenes were disappointingly few and far in between. I may have been misled by other reviews, but do not go in expecting something like ""The Raid"" movies. Some plot holes were spotted, and on a personal level, I do not go looking for those while enjoying a movie. Additionally, the plot holes were as obvious as the plot was predictable. So don't expect any ground-breaking story here.But its intentions weren't to grab an Oscar in Best Original Script, or any Oscar for that matter. Its intents were evidently to entertain those who just wanted a great sci-fi action thriller without having to think too much, and to warn us of possible dangers lurking behind the excitement of the modern evolution of technology. So, I guess enjoy the movie, but be cautious of that thing on your kitchen counter that tells you the weather and controls the lights.",Upgrade

223,Eclectic-Boogaloo,The best of its kind since The Terminator,8,6 June 2018,"It's an action-packed Sci-Fi/Horror thriller that's also clever and original (and even has a few laughs).The above sentence describes both Upgrade and The Terminator, but Leigh Whannell diverged from James Cameron's masterpiece in remaining faithful to his horror roots till the very end, delivering one of the most haunting and thought provoking finales in recent years. So with that in mind, it's no coincidence that some astute reviewers are likening Upgrade to Black Mirror, just as The Terminator was likened to another Sci-Fi horror anthology, The Outer Limits. But despite the comparison to James Cameron's masterpiece, or Black Mirror, Leigh Whannell's 'Upgrade' is very much its own thing. It's masterful in its own right. The setup of the movie is pretty straightforward, involving a man trying to recover from the horrible attack that made him a quadriplegic and took the life of his beloved wife. From that point forward the plot of the movie goes in some expected directions, and some really unexpected directions, pulling off both with style. I'll refrain from providing any more summation so as to not spoil anything. Please do avoid any and all spoilers; you'll be really glad that you did.A few notes:
1. Logan Marshall-Green was impressive as the lead character Grey Trace, especially when it came to his convincing handling of the physical action. Also, Betty Gabriel was a real stand out as Officer Cortez, a surprisingly nimble role/performance.2. The movies score was sneakily good; with a few of the tracks really standing out (I'm totally going to search them out).3. The special effects and action were both very well done. The film looks much more expensive then what it probably is, given that it's a Blumhouse movie. That was supposed to be a compliment :)",Upgrade
224,RobTortureWright,Action Film....Only Upgraded.,9,17 January 2019,"Wow!!! Just when I thought I had this film pegged down and knew what was going to happen... Boom it hits you with that suprise ending. Upgrade is a superbly written film with highly exciting and brutal action sequences, twists and turns you didn't expect, excellent acting and overall a captivating story. Just like Stem this film truly succeeds in what it set out to accomplish.Firstly having watched the talented Logan Marshall-green In the excellent 'Quarry' I decided to give this film a shot and I'm so glad I did as this blew my expectations out of the water. Firstly the action sequences felt full of excitiment in every moment, gripping and shot in such a unique way that kept you on your toes and in awe of how powerful Stem is.The storyline was incredibly enjoyable and the pacing was perfect, well thought out and acted brilliantly. However going into the final third I said to myself *Spoilers* ""Ok so the film has been amazing but I know exactly what will happen next, He'll realise the genius kid was the one who set this up and go to kill him but the cop will show up and stop it"".
I'm actually so glad I was wrong as the film hit me with a terrific ending out of left field as Stem takes full control and eliminates everyone in his path as Grey is left in a dream world imagining Asha is still alive and it was all a nightmare. Super refreshing to actually be surprised by a film and being shocked by the ending adds the cherry on the artificial cake.After the credits rolled I wanted more so I'm hoping they make a sequel as I would love to see Grey slowly realising he's in a dream world and begin to fight back against Stem before it's too late.Overall a superbly written Action thriller that blows you off your feet with high octane unique fight sequences, a wonderful storyline with a shock ending and acted perfectly by talent individuals all on what is considered a shoestring budget.

It suffers from predictability, stiff acting, and obvious areas where special FX were cut to save money, but I still left the theater with a smile on my face.The moral questions and risks from integrating humans with AI are highly relevant and thought provoking.

230,criscal,Hard to judge,7,18 August 2020,"For a seemingly low budget movie, the result is quite decent. The script has a lot of holes though.The major key element in the plot is, that Stem wants to become human. There is no stringent reason for that other than some kind of curiousity. The company guy tries to shut stem down. For the reason for some thrill, the shutdown takes some time, which doesn't make sense in usual computer stuff. This indicates though, that stem is just in that chip thing - not in all the computer equipment. If he was, he could have prevented the shutdown in the first place. Also there was no need to put up a threat, when the henchmen were already posing a credible threat and were easily linked to the Vessel company. There is no reason, why Eron couldn't have thwarted Stem's ambition by smashing the chip during the surgery or make another cut in the spine. Also why warn the main character about breaking the mind, when it was actually required to do so? Why were there safety measures being overriden by the system reboot, when stem could have forced Eron to just remove them.",Upgrade

236,dagallop,"A surprise, from start to finish.",9,22 August 2018,"If you are wondering if there are any more good 'Matrix' genre movies, this should fulfill the search. Clearly a lower budget but it really made no difference, the acting and the exceptional story held this head and shoulders above anything else that could have been considered 'similar'.I really shouldn't say similar because it isn't, but for the die-hard Matrix fans, this should be the same blockbuster level. I decided to take a chance and I feel that I was rewarded for the time. It will keep you watching to the end and frankly there is little to no pause in the action so chances are if you are looking for a natural break, forget it. Also, keep your eyes open for the: 'in Matrix this... well this is where it came from' snippets..As with most lower budget movies the night scenes are prolific but that actually adds to the whole ambience of the movie. The special effects, mainly just the CGI there isn't much beyond that, are actually top notch and while not at the level of Bladerunner 2049, easily the best I have seen for some time.The acting was exceptional, okay, I admit, I had no idea who was in this movie but very quickly recognized Logan Marshall-Green, because in Prometheus he wa also top notch and worthy of a lot more starring roles. Betty Gabriel was pretty convincing as well, got to say that they dominated the acting cast so while they played the bigger roles they weren't propping anyone else up, they all did excellent jobs themselves.The only reason I didn't do the full ten stars is because of the car chase, which I thought was pretty weak (the only real let down I have to say) and because the 'bad guy' (watch the movie) appeared as though he was trying to do a cross between a DiCaprio and Michael Pitt, perhaps I am being a little harsh with that because frankly he could have done it without that given his previous performances.I recommend this movie for anyone that enjoyed the Matrix, because it has some twists and turns or anyone that just enjoys a well written, well directed and well acted sci-fi drama/horror.",Upgrade

241,bola_de_pu,Best Sci-Fi Movie of 21st Century.,10,16 January 2019,"One of the best sci-fi movies of the 21st century. Magical performance of Logan Marshall-Green, I even dare to say, at a better level than in 'The Invitation'. A great movie, where it shows us a future that can be very real if we think carefully. Technology dominates us a little more each day, and it was disturbing, intimate and euphoric to observe the power of it in this film. The colors, the filming, the photography, the music, everything at a great level. My only complaint is the performance of Harrison Gilbertson, I would have liked to see another actor play that role.

In a world where pretty much every ""damaged hero out for revenge"" story has been told, Upgrade knows exactly what it is, and just lets you enjoy the ride. For being so ""done,"" I was kind of hoping for a more original cast of characters, and although the actors give us great moments, the script doesn't linger too long on character development (apart from our protagonist). The movie generally feels like it only exists to provide you with a few entertaining action scenes, and I would fault it for not aiming a little higher, but at least they play it safe. There's also a couple of plot holes, but what they lose in logic they gain in pacing, so...maybe not a big deal. The story has some pretty satisfying turns in it, and I won't spoil them here, but I'll just say the writers knew how to write an ending that will stay with you. So if you're a fan of Robocop, Bourne Identity, Iron-Man, or even Gamer, give this one a play.",Upgrade

Once we move past the surface plot of an injured man who gains a surgically-implanted tech upgrade to track down his wife's killers, the curtain is out of the way, and we see what was really going on. That sounds good at first, but if the true plot is followed logically, it becomes flimsy. One big question was why have all the smoke and mirrors to reach the goal of the villain? The only real answer is to produce a script that doesn't dead end after the first act. Everything that happened was on display to misdirect the viewer, which cheapens the finale.",Upgrade

Their films are generally moulded around the horror genre but with scripts that aren't cliched.Upgrade is another addition to their wonderful cannon of work. I'm not sure why Upgrade was not a bigger hit than some of it's predecessors but it still doesn't take away from what is a very, enjoyable film.The premise is simple, almost something taken from the 80s and revamped. An upgrade allows a man to do extraordinary things that his normal self cannot do. I'll leave it at that and let you watch the film.The plot is interesting with a great ending. I really liked the way the script guided you through the film and by the end left you with something interesting to ponder upon.The action is good and it keeps a good pace right to the end.if you liked Blumhouse's other features, you will enjoy this.

257,Chiller7,Cool robotic fighting scenes,10,31 July 2018,"Pretty good, smaller scale sci-fi action movie, with better-than-average fight scenes. A good diversion from the usual big budget blockbuster fare.The highlight here is the unique robotic fighting style of the main guy. I watch plenty of martial arts action fighting movies, but I've never seen anything quite like this. Just when you think you've seen all the fighting styles there are to see onscreen in action movies, they come up with a fighting style that's completely original like this. Very creative and impressive for the actors/stunt performers to be able to figure out how to choreograph these fight scenes, where he's clobbering his opponents, while only barely moving his body and his limbs any more than necessary and in a precise and robotic style of movement. These fights were good enough that my only complaint is I wish they found room to insert a few more fight scenes.Also, the camera work is totally unique in the way they've figured out how to have the camera track one guy perfectly smoothly, as he's moving around in an intense fight scene. I briefly read about how they built a completely unique camera rig system for this movie just to pull off these shots and it sounds incredible that they were able to do it. It's so admirable to see filmmakers continue to come up with creative new ways to astound us, especially on a smaller budget film like this.",Upgrade
258,MooWoolf1,A fair review that states the mistakes.,7,13 January 2019,"As everyone explained why this movie is good I'll not continue it.First of all I would like to say that you can't compare this movie to something that has a budget of $200m. I'm pretty sure if they would switch directors than the director of the $200m one could do the same thing in this movie with $5m, but this guy could not handle a $200m movie.Secondly the AI part is just not explained at all. It exists and that's all. It controls almost everything. Somehow the creator of this AI can't do anything about it just because... No answer at all. He does what the AI says..The police has drones and can see and follow every single person in the city. It was stated in the movie. Still when the police HAS TO follow someone the system is no more in the picture. Like it didn't exist 20 minutes before on the screen.A program can trace and find people, can recreate a visible ""mark"" from a video, so the technology exists and the police can't do it. Which feels kinda weird.
Also we're talking about a world where it is very common to kill people, so there are a lot of criminals. THIS IS VISIBLE ON THE SCREEN. Like this it would make sense if the police would have this technology.Evil companies are in the picture ofc. One of them is very Advanced and owns an AI. The little company was in the picture for a while but they just gave many people implants, weapons and stuff (far more advanced than the big company). People shouldn't have any kind of implants because it is not allowed by the law, yet almost everyone has! Running around on the street and nobody notices the holes and weird eyes.You can walk into a bar and kill whoever you want. Doesn't matter.These are the parts that are not good. Just in case if you missed these facts. I would say complete morons can give this movie a 9 and 10 but that's a nonsense. Like the movie.Also the only one futuristic thing that was shown on the movie was the car. Nothing else. The rest was cheap CG and practical effect. Not so hard to make it out of $5m.
But I liked it. Even tho the writer and director of the movie is an amateur.",Upgrade

I really enjoyed the dark tone of the film, it couldn't have been done any other way. I personally think that Whannell is the new Paul Verhoeven when it comes to really tackling subject matter. The action was stunning and as always the camera work had me drooling in my seat. Great colours and lighting and the characters were really well portrayed.

(loved the red color in the movie by the way).Music was alright, could've been better but it wasn't like ""really bad"".The acting was so cool, Logan Marshall-Green (plays Grey Trace) and Betty Gabriell (plays Cortez) were fantastic, but sometimes felt like if they chose other actors and actresses it would've been better but of course, everyone did a great job.Really loved the ending of the movie that surprised me a bit and didn't expect it was coming, it was a surprise.Upgrade is such an underrated movie that is one of my favorite and really surprised how this movie didn't win any awards, great job to all the cast & crew, highly recommend this movie for everyone.My rating is: 8/10",Upgrade

268,jerralagbayani,"It's harder, better, faster, stronger!",8,15 October 2018,"For the creators of Saw I was really impressed, not because of the gore effects on this film but the nice base put on the structure.
Open your eyes to this guy who is given an AI implanted into his body, making him harder, better, faster, stronger. 
The basis is simple, eliminate and seek the truth to his girlfriend's death, and as uncomplicated as it sounds it is semi-complicated. It's the simplicity that makes it so good because it takes the action from Taken with a dose of discovery and a pinchful of comedy in one moderate-bloody movie.
The soundtrack worked well with every scene which made you feel what they were feeling, the story dived straight into the purpose of this film, and the camerawork was like a smooth running clock.
The only problem I can say about this film is the brief 5.4/10 slowness of act 1 but other than that this film is one of the best movies I've seen in awhile. It definitely deserves a 3-movie franchise and it has talent.",Upgrade

The obstacles were weak, everything went his way, while it was good at the time....but doing that left him no challenges. 
Maybe the only obstacle was when the chip was getting shut down and he had to rush to the hacker.

Those 2 or 3 scenes of setting up his wife was done prefecty for the punch. World building of cyberpunk & fiture was also done pretty well.The investigations with STEM's help felt surreal but ending twist explained it all, I didn't expect that twist at all. STEM taking to him for permission had some good laughs, Venom did better in this regard with comedy but Upgrade destroyes Venom in all other sectors.I fell in love with the camera work, of how it stabilises with the characters posture and everything else moves around. I am not an action fan but this was golden, the choreography was stunning. The gore & violence just adds more fun to the mix.A finest work in such a small budget.

The action scenes were extremely well done and there was even a good amount of humor thrown in, but in a way that naturally fit and didn't feel forced like in Marvel (hey, i still love marvel movies too!). This felt like a foreign film in many ways because it doesn't have so many of the common cliche's that come out of hollywood, but that is what happens when your budget is crazy small and so you can take risks without having to worry about a 50+ Million flop.If you're in the mood for a scifi movie or even just an action movie, WATCH THIS!!",Upgrade

What I thought was going to be a simple revenge-action flick with a sci-fi twist turned out to be one of the boldest sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time, complete with the great fight scenes and gorey action I expected. What makes the movie is the ending twist and the reveal, and the non-Hollywood course the film takes at the end, that I highly recommend. It's a well-constructed twist that doesn't stretch too far, it adds up when you go back and watch the movie again. 
Upgrade leaves the viewer wanting more from this cold look into the future, and I'm hoping they do continue the adventure with another installment.",Upgrade

This film though has sci-fi/Ai themes which made it feel different and bit refreshing to the usual revenge film.
Good twists along the way, great ending. Actually I reckon 9/10 not 8/10 on reflection imho. Would recommend this film if you are in mood for action film/ Sci-fi film or a revenge film.

Not quite perfect but very entertaining ride,8,21 January 2019,"The first 20 or so minutes are a little rough:I felt there was no chemistry whatsoever between our protagonist and his wife.And, rather than him being someone who just didn't fully went along with all the techonological advances his world has to offer, it felt more like he's forever stuck on day 1 of being in the future, after just having been teleported from 1985 or so.. This will be followed up by some more silly and illogical things happening later in the movie..But, once the movie gets going and if you can manage to overlook some imperfection, it does get going nicely indeed!The plot, albeit simple and somewhat predictable (hey, it's a revenge flick..) is more than decent for this type of movie and does keep you wondering how it will all end. And how it ended, did not disappoint me at all.While a little inconsistent if you view the whole package, you'll encounter some clever strokes of genius, which may merit it that cult classic status at some point in the future.. A hidden gem no doubt, though.The action sequences are very well done. The acting is mostly average, with some upward spikes during certain scenes.All in all, the quality is definitely there, it just didn't quite manage to keep it at awesome levels the entire movie.Solid 8,5, but not quite a 9, so rounding it down to an 8.",Upgrade

I give it a 7, because I thought it had a big plot hole (which I haven't yet looked into).

288,toonyjakes,A fresh and brutal take on the revenge thriller,9,17 January 2020,"New movies are usually kinda over the top or are too afraid to tread familiar ground with a fresh premise. This movie mixes both into one, without ever making you scratch your head. Upgrade is really dope.Plot- A man named Grey is paralyzed by thugs and witnesses her death at their hands. So, a fellow customer of his- who happens to make advanced unauthorized technology- reintroduces Grey to a chip he was shown, the STEM chip. It gives him abilities far beyond human capacity, but the main thing that drives the story is how STEM is not totally in Greys control. It only aids him. Really a fun time.Writing- The dialogue is pretty well done, seemed to avoid typical lines you'd see in these kinds of films. The villains are interestingly done, the world they created looks cool, and the story is simple yet well executed.Characters/Acting- Grey is very well played, at first he seems funky, but once he is in the chair the real character comes out. Really no one in this movie stood out to me as mediocre.Quality- The intro is dope, rather than displaying the name of the film and production companies, an AI voice reads them off. The music is very driving and sharp. The filming is on point- I mean those fight scenes really look like he cannot control what harm he causes. Atmosphere is similar to that of John Wick; dark and vibrant.Overall I think anyone who likes intense movies should see this. It's not all just action, the moments are personal and intense. The story is easy to follow, it's brutal, sad, funny, eerie, and pretty damn clever. New movies this dope don't come around often so check it out!",Upgrade

Taking place in the near future it concerns an old school car mechanic named Grey Trace, terrifically played by Logan Marshall-Green, who restores classic cars for rich collectors. After he and his wife Asha, wonderfully played by Melanie Vallejo, deliver a restored Mustang to the underground residence of the mega-rich computer programmer and visionary inventor Eron Keen, superbly played by Harrison Gilbertson, on the way back home Grey and Asha are carjacked by a ruthless gang of of sadistic thugs, Asha is murdered right in front of Grey who is then shot and left for dead, when Grey wakes up in the hospital he discovers that he is now a quadriplegic. The computer wiz Keen visits Grey at the hospital and offers him a chance to have his life back as it once was. he explains to him that he has developed a new revolutionary chip called STEM that can help him walk again. After so misgivings he reluctantly agrees to have the chip implanted in his body, and he does walk again, but he soon discovers that STEM can talk to him directly, and he also learns that it can control his body giving super-human strength and an amazing fighting ability. Grey with the help from STEM is now hellbent on finding his wife killers and avenging her.

Everything you needed when you need it without just telling you. I am prone to brag about how I always know where a movie is going or what will happen. well BANG! balloon popped. And well done too. Not crazy stupid twists or obvious deliberate attempts to mislead you. Just ones that when you see it you go ""ooohhh right"" Having been forewarned you may look for it and see it or them or many but still great movie.

297,DrDarkness,Pleasing to watch all the way to the end,8,26 September 2018,"Usually films which start strong finish weak, but not Upgrade. This alone earns this movie one extra star, because too many stories like this clearly don't know how they should end so either the ending is lazily put together, or too open for audience to fill up the gaps. Upgrade doesn't do neither, and I was happily surprised!Other than the ending Upgrade is cleverly told story about freshly disabled man who attempts to find the culprits which murdered his wife. Set in the near future the world around the characters seems realistic enough - not too futuristic, but just right amount of details, like self-driving cars and such. Done with a low budget of 5 million dollars I'd say they used the money well!Logan Marshall-Green is a name I didn't recognize, until after seeing that he's been in Prometheus and Spider-Man: Homecoming. His acting as Grey Trace was superb and he did absolutely excellent job with the character! But Melanie Vallejo, who played Trace's wife, did only so-so. Marshall-Green and Vallejo didn't have any spark between them, which bothered me a little, but at least she's not around too long...

I'd seen a short for it so understood the basic premise.The film is basically a crime/mystery/cyberpunk film. The concept of the man and machine together, while I thought it would be a bit predictable, was actually really well done. It reminded me of Deaux Ex Machina - a small budget near future SF film with a great concept. Considering it was made on a 5 mill budget, it was really well done. Definitely worth a look.",Upgrade
302,AxProductions,The ending ruined it,6,14 August 2020,"This is a great film, with some great, editing, and vfx. The cinematography is near on perfect, and works well with the emotions of the show. With great long shots, such as the initial shot of the film, and great use of niche effects, such as tracking the camera with the face of the actor to make him feel more robotic.
Overall the images, lighting, and cinematic techniques are perfect.The acting is also very good, with great emotional touches which make the characters feel more real, and true to life, however the movie is definitely let down in the most important point;story.The story starts of decently, even if in a bit of a cliche way, with the lead actors wife dying. This is very much a cliche of movies of this sort, and so the rest of the story was pretty predictable from that point on; man tries to find who killed his wife, very simple, and if they had stuck to that, I feel like this film would have been a low 7 for me as finding out more about the ""bad guys"" would have been cool to watch.However, this is not how the story ends, instead it ends in this confusing ""robot takes over the world"" way. it's a twist that isn't necessary, and it feels a lot more like an ""I don't know how to end this film"" move as a lot of the final segment was filled with past shots in the film.The story that the film presents, starts of great, and dips into, why that?But a film should not be judged by story alone, but also the way it presents its world, and that, this movie has spot on, with great cgi that makes the world feel real, and the way it doesn't mention that it's 2039 or something gives the audience to think for themselves what time frame it could be in, which is very welcome.Overall, this film has an awful and cliche story, which is supported by impeccable cinematography and make up work, with really good acting.Story: 4/10Character development: 6/10Editing: 8/10Cinematography: 8/10Acting: 8/10Total: 68/100",Upgrade
303,jwcstorage,A solid 7.5 with just a hair towards the 8,8,16 August 2018,"I saw this and was expecting... a very crappy B flick, complete with bad acting, cheesy effects, and plot holes galore. 
BOY was I wrong! At first I felt like ""ok, this is going the typical route"" but there were small niggles in the back of my mind that kept saying somethings off. It was an *actual* subversion of my expectations! The parts that felt predictable WERE predictable with minor hints that something is amiss which comes together very satisfyingly near the end of the film. The film also had a great feel of a realistic near-future atmosphere. Most people ride in normal cars but the elite have supercars and they share the road together. Drones are also always buzzing about, enough to act as an eyes and ears for police before they arrive on the scene to know whose who. The interiors likewise had possible future tech like a glass table thats also basically a giant touch screen device. These are shown both in high end living places as well as low end or possibly low end criminals, but it still shows two vastly different environments that this tech exists in. This extends out to many other parts of the movie environments as well as characters themselves. There is your typical driverless car, but more important are the other 'upgrade' humans who stand in opposition to the protagonist. All the while, he has a computer that is embedded in his spinal column which can either take control of his body to make him akin to Neo from the Matrix, or it can allow him to gather clues and information at a much greater rate. A lot of this is very cyberpunk, but integrated in a way that seems may actually happen in the future (like star trek communicators) vs the things that are very unlikely to happen (like the foam air bag that completely encases the inside of the car with foam to prevent injuries like in Demolition Man).The pace of the film was well executed and there didnt feel like any 'dead time' where you're waiting for plot to happen. 
Likewise the score felt properly atmospheric and it was subtle enough to not impact the scene positively or negatively. Its there, but its not grabbing your attention like The Dark Knight score would. It does its job, and it fits nicely. As we reach the climax of the film, plot threads and those little easter eggs all began to come together in several satisfying ways. The film was SO CLOSE to making the entire thing collapse at the end but there was a very satisfying ending to the film that wraps things up very nicely.
The film and the end may not be everyones cup of tea but I thought it did everything wonderfully! I would rate this as a solid 7.75 so I rounded up to an 8. A very unique and interesting sci-fi film that blends both the cerebral and the visceral! This film needed a little polish and some better acting in some places and I would have comfortably bumped it up to an 8+. It was a pleasant surprise when I went in expecting schlock.",Upgrade

I really cannot see any bad acting in it really (maybe if I would watch it a couple of time and would pay attention to find errors).
The effects are brilliant - especially the fighting. The verdict is surprising and really cool.

Just wow..! I am a huge fan of Wuxia films and have never understood why more ""Hollywood"" filmmakers weren't seeing the beauty of a well choreographed fight and instead always choose to go the way of brawn over brains..?

313,Erlik_Han,"What seems like a predictable movie, has some great twists.",9,12 January 2021,"The moment Gray and his wife Asha were atttacked, I knew it had to be Eren. Maybe the anti social tech mogul was upset over what Grey had said (critisized machines and wasn't too impressed by the new chip/tech). So most of the movie I expected that in the end it would turn out to be Eren that had him attacked.I mean, come on. He is a random mechanic, his cyber car is taken over. His wife is shot with an actual round while he is only disabled and not really shot. The evil goons only sever his spine and do so deliberately. Why would they do that? Not long after Eren comes and offers Grey the implant?As the movie progressed I hoped I was wrong. Stuff didn't add up. STEM (the chip) seemed to be pretty evil. Eren was surprised that stem could communicate with Grey for example. Not to mention that he did nonsensical things. e.g. Instead of allowing Grey to quesstion the people that killed his wife he killed them off. Even when he allowed the questioning he did enough damage so they couln't talk for too long.But the revelation in the end where it turns out that it isn't Eren but STEM that is in control was pretty cool. When it turned out Eren had ordered the goons to disable Grey, I thought. ""I knew it... well that sucks.."" But then when it turned out it was STEM all along, I thought it was a pretty nice and smart twist. In hindsight the cybernetically enhanced goons etc talking about them being some new race should have given some of it away.""All I wanted was for him to break his mind, and he did"" .. This also explains why STEM made them kill his wife. When I thought it was Eren that did it, it made little sense. Figured the evil goons were just being evil and or maybe even went against his orders. Maybe they had an alternative motive. Worked for some competitor etc. Some of them even had parts that were apparently made by the company Ashe worked for. Obviously Grey would be more willing to get the chip if he had his wife to live for. But it turns out that STEM wanted him to be a broken man. So he could completely ""imprison"" his countiousness in a dream, a dream in which his wife Ashe was still alive and they just went through a car crash or something.The depiction of the future, the sci fi elements etc were all great. It was sorta cyberpunk but also relatively grounded in reality. It wasn't the perfect clean sci fi, nor was it the super dirty and gritty cyberpunk dystopia.I would love to see a sequel.Anyway, the movie is much better than you would expect. Especially if you enjoy sci fi and cyberpunk. Not sure how I missed this when it first released as I absolutely love sci fi.9/10",Upgrade

Top class acting and direction. I only knew the basic premise of the film and it just stunned me again and again sometimes at a non stop rate but never loses the plot itself when doing so. I would advise anyone considering my inadvertent approach and just watch it without even watching trailers. It was not the expected low budget looking daft b movie. It was not. I was so encroached in it I did not notice it was filmed in Australia but set in America. If I watch it again, which I will, I would not notice again.
I can see why some reviews I have now read see the comparison with Black Mirror episodes. Again I didn't pick up on that either as it was so engrossing.

 * Self-driving cars don't have a fool-proof fail-safe.
 * Drug administrating machines allow the patient to almost overdose him/herself by issuing certain commands.
 * Low-res images can be enhanced 100-fold.
 * A creator of AI acts like a ten-years old.
 * AI remembers about fingerprints but doesn't remember about hair and skin particles which are impossible to find and remove.
 * A remote AI shutdown is not immediate but conveniently takes enough time for the protagonist to find his way out. Also, the said shutdown works via which radio waves frequencies?
 * Said AI has an IO interface to be accessed by a random hacker from the street.
 * AI is completely shutdown remotely, yet it's not.
 * You can dodge bullets like you're in a Matrix movie.
 * AI can: drive a car, control a human body with an utmost precision, dress up, etc.
 * The police absolutely suck at finding the real villains but willingly spy on the quadriplegic protagonist. Also. In 2100 real human beings are involved at surveillance - not drones, not microrobots.
 * You can drop the police chasing you in the middle of freeway by disabling a single police car.Still the end of the movie was excellent. I still wonder why producers often refuse to hire people who can reduce the number of issues which distract from the movie.",Upgrade

319,TheJohnnyPHreak,Sci-Fi Action Drama That Feels Like Black Mirror-Lite,3,31 December 2018,"I don't know what I expected. I'm not sure if I was just listening to the hype. I don't know if I expected a pure action sci-fi film. Maybe it's my fault for hyping myself up a bit. I had heard so many people say good things about Upgrade. That it was this fun sci-fi film with a twist. The trailer looked interesting. I didn't get to see it in theaters because it played for maybe a week or two weeks in not favorable showing times. But I wanted to see it. I figured I would end 2018 on a positive note with a fun sci-fi action film. I was wrong.Upgrade is a low-level Black Mirror episode. Being a huge fan of Black Mirror, it's tough for me to stay that. Putting Black Mirror anywhere near this film should never happen. But it's the only way I can explain what this film is. Logan Marshall-Green plays Grey a mechanic in a future, not to his liking. The world is run a lot by computers. He and his wife after he finished a job for a client are accosted following a car crash. This tragedy leaves him a permanently disabled. When a client of his comes to him with an experimental procedure and devise that will help him walk again, he jumps at the chance. But the results are not anything he expected.Low-budget sci-fi can be good. Big budget sci-fi can be bad. And vice versa. Nothing is always one thing. Upgrade is low budget sci-fi that would have liked to be big budget sci-fi. The story is predictable. Man is injured, has a loss, get an experiment done to bring him back but with deadly results. Stem is what they call the piece of tech that gets placed in Grey to make him walk again. The film devolves from a drama to revenge film but takes its time. When the real story of the film kicks in, the film moves fast. Chaos ensues when Grey using Stem to track down one of his attackers.This film is a horror movie violent. Leigh Whannell (Saw, Insidious) brings his horror movie experience to stage some gruesome moments. Even though this film is an action movie, it doesn't feel like that way. It plays out more like a sci-fi drama with a few action beats. The way the action is staged is well done. There is some unique camera work that gives the film something different. What was most interesting for me were the fight scenes. They were well choreographed and expertly shot. They almost take you out of the film. For they are so entertaining that you wouldn't expect them in a revenge film like this. I'd love to see if Whannell would want to do a straight up martial arts film.The performances were not great. Marshall-Green just trying to be the lead but at times he seemed out of place. His facial expressions something are hilariously bad. Betty Gabriel plays the detective trying to track down the attackers and Grey. She's bland, there's no real reason for her character except to push certain story elements along. Anyone who's seen any revenge thriller or an episode of Black Mirror can figure out the twist the film takes near the end.I didn't see what everyone saw about this film. It was dull for the first 40 minutes or so. When the action happens it felt out of place. With the fight scenes being well shot and choreographed, that about all the film has going for it. It's violent for violent sake. The story is extremely predictable. I was ten minutes in when I solved the puzzle. Watch it if you are a fight fan, watch it hoping that Whannell decides to make a pure kung fu film. When the credits roll you'll feel like you just watched a (really) bad episode of Black Mirror.",Upgrade

As an actor you've probably never really recognized his work, but as a director he certainly has a very bright future ahead of him. In fact, he could be the next John Carpenter, churning out low-budget fanfare that runs circles around the $100 million behemoths manufactured by the agitprop laden studios of Hollywood.I'm certainly looking forward to more from Whannell, and if Marshall-Green plays his cards right maybe he'll end up being to Whannell what Kurt Russell was to John Carpenter.",Upgrade

This is a smart movie like Blade Runner (original), the best SciFi I have seen in an age and the best movie I have watched all year, all the better as it was watched with no hype surrounding it. If you don't like it, I suggest you think more. This could be based on an Aldous Huxley novel. I don't give many if any 10/10s bit the story ans the commentary on society is very powerful, powerful enough to make any issues with soundstage, lighting and special effects irrelevant to the genre.",Upgrade
331,cinemawithcj,Upgrade - Cinema with CJ Review,6,1 December 2018,"Upgrade is one of those movies with an intriguing badass trailer that will of course grab your attention.The midnight audience award winner at SXSW, Upgrade looks to be the next fun action ride with hyperviolence and hyper-kinetic action. What results in watching it is something that leaves you wanting more, and not necessarily in the best way.Upgrade builds its world and stakes and motivations relatively slowly, which works well once you get to the glorious payoff you've been sold on, but when it hits...it's not enough. And while the action and choreography is so good, it never feels enough. There are moments that will make you chuckle with glee, but those are few and far between.It steps through your usual action sci-fi Murder mystery fare, and while it is a nice comment on the world and reliance on technology into the future vs the old school...There's not enough old school 80s feel behind it. The soundtrack could have used a bit more of an injection, and while it's not necessarily a car chase that happens past the halfway mark...you still wish it had the energy or at least the competency of the technical execution.Upgrade is ultimately full of potential, much like the magical chip that is said to do it all, but it's never quite there to be a movie to rave to everyone about. Which is a shame, but it's not the end of the world.",Upgrade

This description fits the genre ""body horror"" - genre which include masterpieces like the Tetsuo and the Videodrome to name a few. 
Action scenes are directed and shot masterfully. Fighting style looks interesting and new, because of.. well, you'll see.
Lead actor, Logan Marshall-Green, is at first little bland and non interesting, but story is so driven that you don't have time to worry about his monotonous drama performance. 
Music, by Jed Palmer, is powerful! I simply loved the ending music ""A Better Place"" - look it up on YouTube. It made the chillingness of the ending even more powerful. It's somber and beautiful.",Upgrade

336,tomosp1965,A pain in the neck.,7,1 March 2021,"I was drawn over a rating. On one hand this movie is a thrill ride of gadgets and kung fu, whilst on the other a story of redemption and revenge. It does make you think about high budget movies, that lack the drive and tech of this film, plus the lack of ideas that this movie delivers.I remember the TV show Knight Rider, where a man has a tech ladened car and your never sure whether it's the gadgetry, or the man that controls things.I watched the movie with an open mind, knowing nothing about what it was about. I enjoyed many parts of the film and the acting is excellent, but I was often left in disbelief at some of the scenes. I thought that most of the ideas and narrative were believable, but others not so.There is a great movie here, but the lack of budget played against it. Like the first Terminator film, it lacked the finance, but is a great movie. I'm conflicted by this, as I know with a bigger budget the film could have been so much better, so more believable.I've given this movie a 7, due to it being a great ride and very watchable. I just hope that it is remade in the future, in Hollywood and with a bigger budget.",Upgrade

The entire cast and crew really deserve a lot of praise for what they accomplished there.While some have said the story somewhat mirrors Robocop, I found it to be quite original. The dialogue is also well written, conveying overall desperation, with some humor fitting in very naturally.The special effects are minimal, but they did an excellent job using what they had to set the environment and tone.This may not be a mainstream Hollywood film, but I think what they accomplished is well above being considered B-movie genre.

343,littlemankazoo,Brutal. Dark. Hilarious. Exciting. Fun.,10,4 June 2018,"Holy cow.What. A. Film.It's honestly incredibly challenging to simply describe what 'Upgrade' is. Is it Sci-Fi? Is it Horror? Is it Action? Is it Comedy?I'll tell you what it is in the shortest form possible, however.It. Is. AWESOME.'Upgrade' was perhaps the most fun I have had at a theatre so far this year. Whether it be through sick thrills of action, incredible feats of filmmaking, great performances worth recognizing, or even simply the feeling this film gives of a sleek action/sci-fi that is pumped full of the strongest steroids and adrenaline imaginable...this film has it all.'Upgrade' deals with a mechanic, Grey Trace, who through tragedy and opportunity, is endowed with abilities incomprehensible to us...and that is ALL I will tell you, as giving even the tiniest bit more away would honestly ruin all of the surprises and fun that awaits you once you enter the domain of this film.What I CAN tell you is that what follows you blindly entering this brisk 95 minute trip into sci-fi/action insanity is pure spectacle from the often-told story of Man and Machine. However, as even the posters tell you, this story of Grey Trace and his newfound abilities is not about man. It's not about machine. It's MORE.And ""More"" is precisely what this film brings to the table. After a slower burn of a start, the remainder of our runtime is like a thrill ride at an amusement park that you never want to get off of. Incredible and downright revolutionary cinematography and fight choreography. A droning soundtrack that brings up echoes of Brad Fiedel's work in 'The Terminator'. A pitch-black sense of humor that is executed perfectly for the film's tone. A struggle of Man versus Machine that seems something of a send-up to 'RoboCop', only with 21st century parts...and coked out of its mind.With an apparently micro-budget and backing from the folks at Blumhouse, what manages to be created here is what I believe has the makings of an essential Sci-Fi cult classic. The feeling of being in a theatre to see this, hearing cheers and awed reactions from fellow audience members, grasping the atmosphere of it all...this film BEGS to be seen, and begs to be enjoyed for the incredible, spectacular little Indie film it is. This film, and the experience seeing it with a full theatre, is what this medium is MADE FOR.In conclusion, what I can tell you is this; if this film is playing anywhere NEAR you, I urge you to get off your computer and go see it immediately. This is by far the most fun film I have seen so far this year, and I think everyone should support a great piece of Indie filmmaking like this so we can show Hollywood what kind of products we want to see. A product like THIS ONE.'Upgrade' is brutal. 'Upgrade' is tragic. 'Upgrade' is dark. 'Upgrade' is revolutionary. 'Upgrade' is hilarious.

Only decent fight sequence if you can even call it that is when he kills the 3rd guy, and literally that 2 second move only lol.Literally could of been cut down to a short film, the ending really outshined the whole movie.

I love that it went straight in and didn't let up. I am fast losing faith in movies over 2 hours for the simple sake of being over 2 hours, thinking they are giving you value or entertaining you throughout. I don't mind a long movie if it isn't padded for the sake of it.Upgrade delivers on many fronts. Good acting, good yet simple effects, not CGI tastic, and a plot that made sense with a brilliant ending. I gave it a solid 8 only as it isn't exactly ground breaking nor thought provoking.I want to write more, but I think this short review should say it all.

This movie if it was given to anybody else it would have been average, but he killed it.

360,kjruk,Fun to watch eventually,7,21 September 2019,"There is nothing particularly unique about this film to merit ecstatic reviews. It is a well made B movie. Lots of much bettervsci fi out there but worth a watch.
Cold screenplay and characters - just cypers for the plot. Cf Aliens - all the characters are human even if a bit stupid. Mechanistic progress of the plot. No character development or intersting dialogue. The only way you can think it is marvelous is if you have never seen many Sci Fi movies, esp all the classics.
The male character is a Neanderthal, apparently ignorant of the hi-technoworld he lives in. That is just not credible. Plus he is really weak and pathetic, a real male dumbo, not very endearing! Who would identify with him.
The boffin has no history to explain why he is so clever. And the real mystery is how such a dimwit would get to know a superbrain inventor!
The Stem sounds just like Knight Rider and the realtionship similar so not so unique an idea.
The drone is useless for a hi tech surveillance thing and then the police turn up - no ambulance. Not very believable.
It only gets interesting after half an hour when the real story starts. Then I found it got funny. Hopefully it is supposed to be!
The off-grid bar is a bit ridiculous. Turns out to be a completely conventional story complete with car chase! But it does end up fun to watch. Would have made a great fun tv series like Knight Rider. 7 out of 10, max, definitely not 10.",Upgrade

If you expect another Blade Runner or Payback, you'll probably be woefully disappointed.This movie was good in all the ways that those who liked it have said it was good. It was also ""bad"" in the ways that those who didn't like it say it was. It was done on a modest budget, so special effects, while respectable, are not going to blow you away. It leans more toward cerebral than adrenal, so action scenes are unlikely to get your adrenalin pumping. The story line may make you think, though. If you watch a lot of these types of films, you will not find the plot to be that original, but then there is nothing new under the sun. They put together a good solid story, regardless.

Unfortunately I found it to be utterly predictable, which was such a let-down. Not clever at all. And there were no other redeeming qualities to make me feel like watching it had been worthwhile. The acting isn't that great, the character development is nil, and even the special effects / portrayals of ""technology of the future"" are pretty unimaginative. No great fight scenes or car chases, boring dialogue, and anyone who's seen Venom has already seen a (much more entertaining) movie about a dude with a voice in his head and controlling his body.

Also Logan green marshall truly carry this movie, there will be no other actor so suited to this role, he made it his own, such underrated actor that will continue to surprised you.
I didn't expect to love this movie so much but I do, it is rare to find an awesome and meaty science fiction these days.

406,xTkAx,"Hollywood, this is how you make movies - One of the best sci-fi films of 2018.",9,25 August 2018,"I was expecting the IMDB ratings for this science fiction film to be inflated, but after just watching it, i don't think the rating is high enough.This science fiction film, set in the not-too-distant future, is a low-budget film that puts a lot of this year's films of the same genre to shame. It has allusions to other movies like Robocop and Blade Runner, but stands on its own as it weaves its tale for the viewer. Right from the start this film was different. It began engaging me in the main character's life in a futuristic world, and it made me care for him. By the end of the first act I was completely engaged, emphasizing with, and rooting for main character, and totally hating on the bad guys. As it played out, it turned out that the film was well paced, exciting, and intelligent.The cinematography was remarkable, and I was quite amazed at the meticulous work done by the filmmaker to make this tale believable on the screen. In fact, many choices the filmmaker chose demonstrated there was a high intellect behind the production. I enjoyed the shots during the action scenes *hit*, *dodge*, and welcomed the use of CGI, which was not overused and well done. The music and sounds were very well done as well.All of the actors did an amazing job, most notably the main character, but not limited to all of the antagonists. The acting held my interest the whole way through, and i look forward to seeing all of them acting in the future. In the end I was completely satisfied with this film. So if you're into science-fiction, be sure to give this one a watch. I think it may have landed in the realm of the cult-classics. But at the very least, this is among the best sci-fi films of 2018. Take note Hollywood - this is how a movie should be done.9/10",Upgrade
407,Miasmakoala,Overrated and illogical,3,12 October 2020,"The movie was nicely shot and there were some good acting but that's pretty much it. The plot is that a rich guy gives his car mechanic a chip (STEM) to control his quadruplegic body because he was crippled and his wife killed in a mysterious incident.First thing the main character does after getting his body moving is that he tries to find his wife's murderers. The rich guy gets mad at him for doing so and I was pretty amazed that he didn't think he would do it in the first place. After killing a couple of dudes the rich guy tries to shut down the STEM. (this makes no sense when you know the ending)In the first scenes we are shown that the STEM is able to control the main character. It can draw and fight and do pretty much anything that the script needs to be done. When STEM finds out that the rich guy is trying to shut it off he just lets the main character be human for a while instead of STEM overriding him like it's done before. This is probably just to build up tension instead of providing any logical content to the movie. ""Whoa, will he get to the hacker in time, maybe the movie ends in 40 minutes because he didn't get there?""Fight scenes were really basic and the car chase scene was very boring. During the chase scene, STEM controls an another car remotely. Why didn't the STEM just crash land a drone or a plane on whatever it wanted to be dead? Yeah, I know it said in the end that he had to cover its trail, but if STEM was so omnipotent I think it could've just easily caused a malfunction on whatever it wanted to.In the penultimate scene the main character says to a villain to not turn around, just to walk in front of him. That's nice.The ending was beyond awesome. ""Hey everything that's happened was a part of STEM's plan all along."" Why didn't the damn STEM just break his mind in the first place if it wanted to be a take over, like force the main dude to kill his mom or something? The only reason it didn't was because the script was horrible and Leigh Whannell had to make a movie out of this. Most of the plot holes could've been fixed if the main villain had a STEM chip in his own neck and they'd communicate the mind breaking stuff better, like it would take time or something.Upgrade tries to be satire and thriller and dark comedy and action but it just ends up being a boring, basic and horribly scripted action flick. I can't decide if it's a 2 or 3 but who cares. Vastly overrated. If you cheated yourself into enjoying Annihilation or Black Mirror: Bandersnatch this could be for you, you poor soul.",Upgrade

I had low expectations going in as I hadn't really heard of the main actors or the writer/director. In fact the star, Logan Marshall-Green, in addition to being the poor man's Tom Hardy, was in the execrable Prometheus. He completely redeems himself here. It turns out that this is a great effort from all parties involved. The acting is good and the main characters especially are both believable and relatable. The directing is polished and the cgi, which so often is the downfall of smaller budget sci fi, is both restrained and appropriate. It's also very well done and believable.The story is strong and I feel this movie is more of a success than recent big budget sci fi like the poor efforts of ""Solo"", ""Ready Player One"", or ""Pacific Rim Uprising "".Go in with an open mind, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised!",Upgrade

Hell yes. Alas, the whole story carries an underwhelming morale: ""Humanity good! Technology bad! Artificial intelligence very very bad!"" and after that the movie ends, making the last 10 minutes of it pretty disappointing overall.

Some of the acting could have been a bit better, but that can be overlooked because the movie keeps you interested all the way through and doesn't have any boring moments.However, there are some instances where I consider the story to contradict itself. If Fisk's upgrade was better than Grey's, then why wasn't his one the one that took over the company? And if Stem was in control of everything from the beginning, surely it couldn't be remotely shut down?The twist at the end was awesome, but it feels as though it wasn't part of the original story and was added as an after thought which contradicted most of the actual storyline. That being said, it was still an awesome and thoroughly enjoyable movie.",Upgrade

I was also pleasantly surprised to find out it was written Leigh Whannel...remember Saw? (Absolutely loved the first movie) For this reason there are a lot of Aussie actors.
The story is fresh and exciting. There are unexpected laughs and some innovative filming techniques. Apparently this was a low budget movie but it doesn't really feel like it. Just goes to show that a great story is more important than the best special effects. (One key example that comes to mind is 12 Angry Men-if you haven't seen this, you definitely should!)",Upgrade

One point of for making me review the ending 3 times to really grasp, not only the reasons behind the motivations, but the plausibility because of the mental superiority of one of the characters.

I will do my best to replace its lack of marketing with recommeding it to everyone. I was expecting something entertaining and instead got an amazing plot with a mind-blowing ending. If you enjoy this genre, you can't let this one pass you by. What everyone says is true, it's like a long, perfectly executed Black Mirror episode.

It mixes the themes it picked, sci-fi, action, drama, very well together into a neat package. 
I was also surprised to find out this was a semi low budget movie, because I wasn't able to tell at all, the choregraphy, special effects, scenes and camera work are all top notch.

486,hobgoblinlol,Wasn't expecting that.,8,20 August 2018,"When I saw this listed as horror and read the description I assumed this film was going to be about technology gaining more and more influence on society and it's unsettling effects on regular citizens but the movie depicts a different story with some aspects of what I expected to see. While the plot is centered in the near future the environment barely looks different aside from few futuristic cars and drones patrolling the city which is something that I have no problem with since the movie's plot isn't about depicting some global event. Our main character, Grey, is ambushed, has his wife killed and is left paralyzed from neck down by the weapon used on him by the assailants. However, a man he works for, who is a director of a leading tech company offers him a chance to regain mobility with a newly developed cutting-edge chip. The experiment turns out to be a massive success enabling Grey to move his body again, but the implanted chip, Stem turns out to be much more than Grey bargained for which sets up the revenge plot for the film.The idea while not entirely original, is very well executed. With Stem's charismatic yet stoic personality and the lead actor's convincing performance which makes it quite believable that the character's body is being controlled by a foreign entity during the action scenes which are very well choreographed for this movie's budget which isn't of MCU's magnitude for sure. The action scenes were actually quite unique, making it look like that Grey's body is using Stem's precise calculation instead of a martial art to fight which is really neat. While the movie's acting is pretty decent with every actor making the most of what they're given, barely anyone is flashed out aside from the main cast. The spotlight is 95% on Grey which is not a negative trait, but would have been better if we could have seen a little more of his relationship with his wife and more development with the villains.One thing I genuinely dislike about this film is the ever annoying ""Stubborn female detective who originally came to help the main character but instead ends up trying to arrest him for vigilantism of taking down criminals SHE was supposed to find."" trope which I admit I detest. There's this guy who is eliminating dangerous criminals, making the environment safer and yet HE is the main target for your investigation? that in my opinion is very contradictory in every film this trope is used in. But I'm not gonna get into dissecting that cliche. The ""main"" villain of this film, Mercenary named Fisk seemed interesting enough but barely had any screen time aside from a fight scene in which he somehow outperforms a supreme AI with basic Cyborg modifications and experience to the point where even Stem pleads to Grey to think of something, it was interesting but wasn't explained how. One thing I also enjoyed was the main character's cocky attitude which did seem unnatural given what Grey has been through, but enjoyable non the less. Now what sealed the deal for me was the twist. Because maybe I didn't bother analyzing this film too thoroughly but I definitely did not see it coming. That and the ending really came as a pleasant surprise which brought everything to full circle for me. Now the movie is not a masterpiece and might not be for everyone, but I suggest you give it a shot, you might like it or end up disappointed. See for yourself.",Upgrade

I am Australian who loves home grown movies,I am a fan of sci/fi horror,and i love it when low budget films knock it out off the park.
But this Film was a disaster!!
The acting was wooden,the plot was very average,and most of all any so called twists were predictable from about the 10 min mark.
How so many people are fawning over this pic and giving it a 10/10 or even a 8/10 has got me bamboozled!
There was NO horror(unless you count a couple of blink and you'll miss them death moves)
There was NO action(unless you call a couple of 50mph car chases on a motorway action.
But yeh,i suppose if you consider somthing set 10 years in the future to be sci/fi,then there was that.

From start to finish I was fully glued to the screen. There are very few movies that don't bore you at least in a few of their parts but Upgrade is so well written that there's hardly any pointless fillers. The plot is absolutely its biggest strength with screenplay coming in a close second. There director has done a brilliant job in capturing the futuristic vibe of the story. 
If I had any criticism, it would be that the actors didn't do complete justice to their roles. But they did well enough for it to be passable.

I could not much connect with lead characters and more chemistry could have been showed between them. But keeping all these aside, this movie clearly entertained for 90 minutes. The lead character's performance was good, and the climax was satisfying.
It's a routine revenge story with lots of cliches sprinkled all over, but this movie stands apart with its progress. Not to mention, it's made on a shoe string budget. Which gives a tough to mega budget flicks!!!

When my gf and some friends agreed, i can be sure it isnt just me.This looks like your average revenge movie. You will guess the plot in the first 10 minutes or less. But then, tiny twists will keep you wondering and being surprised about how the movie develops. Yes, i guessed the ending, but i didnt care! Because it was a good one!I cant even understand how such great quality was achieved with a low budget, in a time most blockbusters seem to need hundreds of millions to try. Shame on Hollywood!There is no shaky cam !!!! Instead you have a crazy fluid cam that makes the action scenes really something !I feel i will spoil stuff if i keep writing stuff, and then you will watch this and not be surprised.

509,TheTrashTreasury,WATCH THIS FILM!,9,20 October 2018,"Wow. I cannot believe there wasn't more hype for this film, maybe due to the fact that Logan Marshall- Green kinda looks like Tom Hardy and this film is kinda Venom-isk, but wayyyyyyyyyyyy darker, more violent and 10x better. It did come out the summer right before Venom came out, so maybe that's why it was severely overshadowed. But I absolutely loved it. The film also kinda reminded me of all the best parts of the Matrix when it came to the fight scenes while still holding it's own style of fighting choreography. Plus it only clocks in at about 1h 30ish. Perfect.
For the most part everything I've seen of Logan Marshall Green in, whether it be his films or some of his short lived telly shows (Quarry- uhhhh I'm still upset that never got picked up for a second season!!!!....

513,VioletViolette,I am genuinely confused by all the positive reviews.,1,9 April 2021,"There were many flaws in this movie. Too many to forgive.Just a small few:
The lack of character building for the wife.The forced and fake relationship between the protagonist and his wife (cliche romance, calling each other ""husband"" and ""wife"") made it hard to care that she died enough to cheer on the revenge.The many plot holes when it comes to Stem.. the biggest being that Stem somehow makes a human body move like a robot (more like a human pretending to be a robot in a game of charades). Robots move the way they do due to the mechanics and hardware.. why does a small chip on a spinal cord completely change someone from human movement to robot?How did Stem come back to life before the hack was complete?Why were there sooooo many cliche lines?The protagonist changed his personality at least 6 times, not due to any story line, just, because..? He was a masculine, car working, woman loving, protective and humble man and by the end he (not Stem) was a sarcastic, one-liner quoting, annoying teenager with a maturity deficit?The end tried to give us too many twists and turns that were all incredibly predictable from the very beginning, instead of focusing on building the story in the middle and the beginning where it desperately needed some detail.The story isn't even original as many have claimed. It's the old story of tech gone wrong. Beware AI, etc. This storyline has been around since Terminator.I know it was low budget but if you can't do something decent, don't. The hang guns and cardboard box ""futuristic"" car were just, LOL.The movie was far too short. We needed depth and story from the detective and the inventor guy - see, I can't even remember anyone's names! It was so brief and a blip in time compared to the smart ass jokes and bad fight scenes..1,000 others.

While not one hundred percent original (Many of the concepts are ripped out of classic cyberpunk novels.), Upgrade does a good job of depicting cybertech in a believeable future. To me the film watched very much like a pulp Sci-Fi / Cyberpunk novel, like an adventure in Shadowrun, or an alternate story in the universe of Neuromancer. It also reminded me a bit of Terminator in terms of action and gore. But this is not a horror movie by any stretch of the imagination. A very respectable Science Fiction action thriller.

The best way to watch it is to know little about the premise / plot and just enjoy it. The plot is top-notch, each scene and piece of dialogue is breaking away from cliche and really delivers originality. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and everyone I recommended it to enjoyed it as well.Usually indie sci-fi is a close-quarters philosophical/psychological piece, and this is not bad per se, just a result of a somewhat limited budget. However, Upgrade is first and foremost a great action movie, and every minute of it looks fresh and original. The fight scenes are really well done and fun to watch.This is easily a top-10 sci-fi movie of the '10s, if you haven't watched it yet - you're missing out.",Upgrade

Given the severity of the situation, its not really something you'd expect to see if the hero is out for blood. I dont mind it that much though, except that it came off too strong and obvious. It would have been better if it was subtle or done like it was unintentional. Because in that way, doesn't take the weight off the character development. The main character was a so-so, I didn't really find him likable or whatever but I guess the actor did well enough to not suck, a lackluster script maybe?The fight scenes were deliberately robotic and kung fu-ish. I prefer a more raw, realistic and no nonsense approach. The camera work was pretty solid though.The plot is this movies saving grace. A bit too convenient as I feel like they gave ""The Stem"" too much power and ability that leaves little room for development. As a result, the story becomes weak and lacking consistency towards the end, otherwise, I would have scored it 7/10.",Upgrade

I came in a bit late (missed a few minutes but was there for the set up) partly because of reviews here and the fact I didn't know any of the cast (I mean not one!) but this is the movie I wanted the Live Action Ghost in the Shell to be rather than the pale imitation of the anime it was.
Leaving aside the minor plot holes all science fiction brings with it (and I say that as a fan) this is a well paced cyberpunk thriller that makes you flinch at he blood spattering and culminates in the big questions of life which good SF should explore.
It wasn't nearly as dumb or corny as I feared. I sort of expected Starcrash meets Demolition Man but thankfully it was far ahead of that and more like Moon meets Minority Report.

524,christianrmaxwell,Upgrade - The Sci-Fi movie we Needed,9,16 June 2018,"In the midst of many extremely serious and long science fiction movies (such as Blade Runner 2049), Upgrade comes storming into theaters, with most people not even knowing it was a movie. Although movies such as Blade Runner 2049 are pure masterpieces in my opinion, it is a good thing every once in a while to have movies such as this which are made for the pure joy of making it, and meant to pull the audience along for a jolting and revolutionary story. The only flaw that I see with this movie is the dialogue being very spotty and even corny at some points. Other than that, everything about this movie just fits together perfectly like a puzzle. The action scenes in this movie are definitely a delight and the highlight of the whole experience. These scenes are filmed in ways that I have never seen done in a movie before, with the heavy use of motion tracking and just pure brutality. Witnessing these scenes take place made me think of if Quentin Tarantino were to create a science fiction movie. The action is unforgiving and extremely bloody. The acting in this movie is passable, but that is exactly what I expected and wanted from a movie like this. I purely believed walking into this movie that it would be a popcorn movie through and through, but by the end I was shocked at the pure genius of the writing for the story and some of the statements the movie makes regarding technology and the future in general. The movie starts off slow to provide background for the characters and such, but after it passes this point, the movie is non-stop thrills all the way through. This movie is fantastic and is much more than a senseless popcorn movie. I hope to see more low budget movies like this hitting theaters in the future. It is a movie that does not take itself too seriously, which provides a cushion that the audience can use to deflect any actions or things that happen in the story that don't seem to make much sense. Overall a great movie and definitely worth seeing in theaters just to support this director. Leigh Whannell, goddamn you did it man, keep it up.",Upgrade

537,productionslykos,A fresh sci-fi escapade that introduces an assortment of new and creative film-making techniques.,8,8 April 2020,"A fresh sci-fi escapade that introduces an assortment of new and creative film-making techniques. The never before seen subject tracking further amplified the already powerful performance of actor Logan Marshall-Green, portraying that of a cybernetically advanced man. However, although in favor of the plot, this method became difficult to watch due to the perplexing use of it in fast paced fight scenes. The domineering and at times manipulative personality the implantation in Grey's neck delivered added to the almost dystopian and altogether freaky technologically advanced future that turns your gut; and with with aid from Jed Palmer's chilling, mechanical-esk soundtrack, plus the subtle yet seductive sound design, this atmosphere arose to existence. With benefit from the absolutely gorgeous lighting, colours popped off of the already aesthetically absorbing set pieces that felt pilfered from a minimalist world beyond us, yet which we were fully immersed as the cinematography never failed in establishing that cold, stiffened future. The action was beautiful and at moments jaw dropping for the pure evil and grim nature an unforgiving A.I provided in combat. Every hit, every bone-crunch and every slash achieved a connection between every elegantly choreographed swing that made for impactful brawls. Sadly, many of the side characters were extremely hollow and felt placed only for service to the plot. However, this could of been restored by allowing more run time to develop a small connection to the characters so interactions between Grey felt more sincere rather than noise. Even so, every scene seemed as though it belonged, never overstaying it's visit and always contributing elements to the story. In light of this, the ending to this enigmatic narrative was Memento-esk and satisfying in its conclusion being nearly full circle but overall ceaseless and ongoing. This movie was a breathe of fresh air and i'd push many people to watch it for the pure entertainment that it is.",Upgrade

542,Eric1485,Upgrade,7,4 December 2018,"There is a lot to like about Leigh Whannel's futuristic sci-fi film Upgrade, at face value it is an entertaining and stylish revenge murder narrative that is enhanced by a dystopian setting where Artificial Intelligence has all but taken over every aspect of our lives. There seems to be a deeper message underlined throughout the film about how humans are becoming more and more reliant on technology, and the role it plays in our lives, but that is glossed over and not a major focus for this movie. This movie instead focuses on violence, revenge, and action packed fighting scenes with futuristic weaponry. The pacing of this film was smooth as the story transitioned seamlessly from one scene to the next, giving the audience just enough information to keep the plot progressing. The acting is solid, however most of the supporting characters are often pushed to the side and don't bring a lot to the overall story, as it eventually turns out to become a story about one man that will stop at nothing to find the answers he is searching for.

I could fully enjoy it alone in a giant auditorium room. Nowadays, anything that could be done has pretty much been done on a movie screen, thanks to the advanced technology and human intelligence. With many good sci-fi movies out there, I have to give this one credit for being slightly different with a unique M. Night Shyamalan plot twist (I am referring to his early day films with unpredictable endings). I went in without watching the trailer or listening to someone's review first, and let me tell you, it was a great experience viewing it without any expectations or pre-dispositions. I thought I was pretty clever guessing who the bad guy was at the beginning (the Aaron character does not do the best job hiding his intention to test the stem, then later I realized that it was a plot device), then of course, there is the ultimate bad guy behind the anticipated bad guy, which is my favorite part of this movie. In addition to the whole surprise that is very well done, the acting is fantastic, all characters are in their right place without over or under acting. The leading role does it particularly well when he's being controlled by stem and performing tasks he wouldn't normally do otherwise. It's not easy to act out the actions scenes with the accurately expressed opposing feeling towards said action. Overall, I had a great time, I gave it a 10 (I am not that strict of a movie goer that counts off points for minor imperfections, not that I have problem with other people who do that).

Well, if I have to hate, then I'll hate ill-deserved praise, especially when it's over-heaped on poor-to-middling pictures.Look, a small budget does not mean a movie needs to have a crappy storyline. I'm not expecting Sorkin-esque dialogue or award-worthy acting. John Wick had neither of those, and yet was still brainless fun. This was just brainless, not to mention pointless.Besides the main sci-fi concept of a electronically assisted quadriplegic whose control is compromised (an idea my same friend and I had years ago, but lazily never wrote) there was otherwise not one original idea, not a single fresh take, and no twist that you couldn't see coming a mile down the road.

That's all that there is bad about the movie, because the rest: the visuals, the acting, the music and so on and so forth - it is all brilliant.
The ending sent shivers down my spine and I haven't felt that since I watched Babadook!!!!!Do yourself a favour and go and see ""Upgrade""!

Bold, one-of-the-kind approach to a frequently-used storyline and later becomes more and more well-developed. Excellently executed shots, thrilling fights scenes that smoothly create transitions from fun comedy to gore in the snap of the fingers.

My daughter and I went to the theater to see it. The movie is SO COOL! Great story, great pacing, great SFX, great characters, cool twists! A beautiful vision of the near future and a great AI cautionary tale in the realm of Ex Machina and Terminator. Most of my friends have never heard of it. It's definitely a sleeper hit! SEE THIS MOVIE! It shows you that you can make an exceptional film on a $5 million budget. Similar premise to Venom, but much, much better in my opinion. Consider that Venom cost $100 million too!

A 2018 take on ""the Crow"" storyline but not even remotely close in quality or legacy. You can see the plot twists coming a mile away.

-The futuristic city and buildings looked really cool but we spend almost all of the movie in buildings and alleys. 
-We only see like 2 of the futuristic cars, which are only put in there so Stem can cause accidents. 
-The sneeze kill was awesome, but how was he able to do something like that?? 
-All of the action sequences were in trailers and every part in between was boring as hell. All it was was Stem telling him where to go, he'd go and kill somebody, find out where to go next, etc etc.
-Was the cop involved in the project? How was she able to get to the creator of stem's house so fast after she was in an accident and then went to his mom? How did she know to go there? He never told his mother where he was going...
-Too many plot holes and so much missed opportunity.It looked really good though and the cinematography was brilliant. The action sequences were very well choreographed too, but I just can't get past the rest. Sorry!",Upgrade

I have seen Logan Marshall-Green in just few movies but here he killed it with his performance (pun intended). The way he was moving with the Stem and the way he acted out those fight scenes was mind blowing and so much fun to watch. Really enjoyable piece with good music and cool sets, not pushing it too much to be futuristic but just enough to pull us into the atmosphere.

It's intelligent, action packed, and has excellent visuals.We haven't really seen anyone fight like Neo from The Matrix Trilogy since those films, and now we have, albeit with the assistance of a computer chip imbedded in his cervical spine.The story is a little predictable at the end. It doesn't take a genius to work out who arranged the hit on Grey and his wife, but it's an entertaining romp getting to the finalé.This film will entertain fans of AI sci-fi and also fans of action films.I'm really glad I watched this film, and will look out for the Blu Ray at a reasonable price.",Upgrade

One review said it was the best AI movie someone had seen and I thought that's a bit of a stretch. I am stunned at how good this movie is. It is a thriller, it is violent but for anyone who watches violent films it's really nothing. There Is not even much Gore. I don't want to say too much because there are twists and turns and you absolutely Will not be disappointed with the ending. So many films are going for vague, artsy, leave you hanging, endings.

Really liked this movie, it had a lot of facets to it, all of which thread nicely through the movie, so your never quite sure where its going to go.... Gave it a Seven... (would have given it 7.5, if i could, but not an 8)... Because I felt it could have been so much better... It was a great concept that should have been taken full advantage of & fleshed out into a longer movie that could have been an iconic Feature Film...Don't get me wrong, its a great flick, but i just felt it could have been so much more... or maybe it was just the Great Cronic...

Writing is strong too, with all the seriousness sometimes even makes you laugh at very gory realistic and seemingly serious scenes which was the aim of the creators. Fighting scenes are very unique yet very familiar and lighting of the scenes are very exceptional.Movie knows that it dance around a very cliche story but also knows how to escape from that type of cliche dialogues and plots and told a story of its own with no overtime.This is a low budget movie that achieves big and important results and succeed as its own goal and I gotta say it doesnt look like a low budget movie at all its like a good summer blockbuster of its own.

Upgrade has a sci-fi theme that shouldn't deter you from seeing such a thought provoking movie, even if you're not a fan of the genre. The protagonist struggles with the pain of his own mortality and frailty when faced with the dillema of the easy way out that technology provides more and more with each passsing day. To be or not to be human is the message prevalent throughout the one and a half hour of its duration. An especially impressive feat considering the low budget that in no way hinders the leading actor, and anyone involved in the production, from delivering a very satisfying experience. The movie holds the viewer's attention from start to end and i can assure you that for most people it'll be a very pleasant way of spending their time without wondering if they've wasted an hour and a half of your life.",Upgrade

Tiene momentos de acción muy geniales y, en general, puedo decir que funciona como una película de ciencia ficción, pero como mencioné, presenta una premisa bastante típica, bien tomada y dirigida, pero cae un poco en términos de cuán predecible se vuelve a medida que se desarrolla la trama. Aún así, debo enfatizar que el final es muy bueno, estoy hablando de los últimos dos o tres minutos de la película, los que me parecieron inesperados y completamente magníficos. Hay un par de buenas actuaciones, otras más regulares (principalmente de los personajes que aparecen menos) y una muy buena actuación de Logan Marshall-Green, que es, con mucho, el más destacado y no solo por ser el papel principal. En resumen, una película que con poco presupuesto y utilizando ideas y premisas ya vistas, logra superar las expectativas y brindar algo fresco e interesante, con momentos realmente geniales, pero que está limitado por un guión simple y un poco predecible. Recomendado si eres fanático de cualquiera de sus géneros (Thriller de venganza o la Ciencia Ficción), pero si eres más exigente, probablemente no sea la gran cosa.",Upgrade

I didn't see much as far as promotions for the movie, so I never even knew about Upgrade until it was out on blu-Ray, which is a shame. I would've loved to have seen this in the theaters. The writing on the film is pretty good, as well as the acting and cinematography. The action scenes are fantastic!! There is a bit of gore, but it really didn't bother me (I may be desensitized).

This let down the film a bit because it unfortunately reminded me that I was watching a low budget movie. Would have loved to help out since I am a musician and with today's technology it is not too difficult or costly to create an appropriate score for that part of the film.

The fight scenes was awesome, never seen camera movements like that before giving the ultimate illusion of that the main character is not in control. This was a great movie with a very unexpected twist at the end.

654,MikoLaas,"Few logic quirks, few ""similarities"" with Venom",4,23 November 2018,"A quick breakdown for what got my Stems grinding:-1 * for: The main actor looked a lot like Tom Hardy, especially with the deeper voice that was added to his character. The same facial type, same facial hear and similar voice made me instantly think of Tom Hardy's Venom character, which had quite similar plot let's be honest. And it seemed a pretty obvious copy attempt.-1 * for: The cliché of a ""raw mechanic, overly manly beer-drinking dude in a white shirt"" that we can see in way too many movies was also played into it.
-1 * for: The ""hacker"" chick? Guy? seemingly managed to shut off firewalls, remote access and ""input guards (wtf?)"" in a matter of couple of minutes on a device that she's never seen before and something's that supposed to be absolutely apex of technology. Also, where the hell did she plug into? I don't remember any USB ports being installed lol-1* for: Making it way too obvious that it was Eron behind the ""job"" which also killed his wife. I mean the fact that the main character could not put 1+1 together is pretty amazing.AND FINALLY -2* for: AI schemes the whole plan, yet allows him planted with several security protocols? Wasn't he the one who had others plant him? Did it really not pay attention to his own software in the first place? Gaah, there's just SO MANY logic errors that I won't even bother to continue.

STEM makes him able to do pretty much everything imaginable.The first 99.9 % of this movie is pretty good and quite frankly entertaining and everything from camera work to VFX to acting is spot on especially for an low budget movie like this ########################
###########SPOILERS########SPOILERS################################################
It's the last 5-6 min. That makes this make a 4 instead of an 7 or even an 8 for me because it is here that it is revealed that it was STEM's plan all along to to make our protagonist paralysed to make possible for him to get the surgery to implant the chip in him in order to take over his body which would have been a cool twist if it wasn't such a kliché that the A.I. was evil.Sci-Fi somehow always falls into one of two groups either the robots/A.I. is evil or the aliens are, with the odd one that flips it on its head and shows us (humans) as the bad guys and it's a shame can't get beyond that",Upgrade

It has a lot of Black Mirror, Outer Limits etc. in it and also a good portion of the Venom-Idea, but combined in a surprisingly good, entertaining and thought provoking manner.

680,stevengiordullo,A fun but ultimately forgettable action flick,6,1 June 2018,"Going into Upgrade, I was expecting some slick action set pieces sort of in the same line as the John Wick series. Although the fights differ stylistically from those films, it has the same amount of grit and precision that creates a real sense of tension with each hit that lands; The only problem is that the start of the movie is really slow and hard to get engaged with due to a lack of substance. Although its pulled off in a believable way, we've all explored the themes of future technology to extreme lengths, and this film just piggybacks off of better sci-fi installments with the first act of the film. But as soon as the first fight comes, it moves at a steadier pace than the first half and becomes more fun than just a chore to sit through. One thing that really stands out to me, however, would be the cinematography. The way the camera follows the main character in this film is very unique and almost robotic; especially during those action sequences as the camera follows every move the character makes. It's hard to explain, but it definitely struck me as the best aspect of the movie. The twist at the end, while implausible and perhaps a bit contrived, adds enough of a dramatic effect to close the movie off. Not the best movie ever made, but decent enough to rent. 6/10+Great Cinematography 
+Fight sequences 
+Cool twist
+A compelling lead-Some awkward pacing
-Script was hit and miss",Upgrade
681,EdwinPine,The best Sci-Fi/Action movie in a long time!,9,15 August 2018,"First of all the less you know going in the better, so I'm not going to spoil anything. This movie verges on a 10, but gets a 9 from me, for what I believe could be boiled down to budgetary restrictions. Upgrade feels a tiny bit rushed, but otherwise it's a feast for your eyes. The story is bulletproof and the twist is almost unpredictable and more so you are surprised at what writer/director Leigh Wannell achieved with the small budget he was given. He crafted a stunning world full of interesting concepts, all complementing the overall story
 All of the former mentioned things are spectacular, but they all fade when compared to the camera work and masterful editing this movie provides. If I would have to describe watching Upgrade, I would say it's a roller-coaster with the perfect buildup and execution.
 It's really unfortunate Upgrade did not have a large studio behind it. That must be the reason people did not see this movie as I refuse to believe people just disliked it, but then again maybe the film would not have been as good as it was.",Upgrade

Certainly could see this turned into a series. Finale was somewhat predictable and lacking any surprises but I doubt director wanted this to turn it into a social commentary on our continual and every growing reliance on machines (which it strongly emphasizes) but more of an action packed ""chase the bad guys"" type that sells tickets and brings in revenue.

That being said, I believe Upgrade will go down as the better film, while being much lesser known. UPGRADE is near perfect. The acting is superb. I went into this movie with a blank slate. I had expectations, but they were not very high, and they were blow away and surpassed in the first few minutes. The bad guys are well crafted - never corny, and not overly drawn out. Our protagonist, and his internal companion, have great chemistry (if you can call it that.) The plot twists will make you think, even for seasoned moviegoers who believe they see it coming. The action is well shot, and sometimes brutal. There is not too much cgi. After learning about the low budget, I was shocked. Viewing the film you would have no idea. I can't really find any true flaws with the film - and nowadays that is very hard to say. I was close to giving this a 10 out of 10, and it may deserve it, but I will leave that up to other viewers. Highly recommended.",Upgrade

I've always been a fan of tech noir and cyber punk. I feel the movie was executed flawlessly. Excellent pacing, set pieces, acting, story, and even effects. While they are minimal, that's exactly what I feel was needed. Too often big budget movies are all flash and no substance, well, this movie has a hell of a lot of substance and just the right amount of flash. I'm thankful it was low budget because focusing on effects, etc. would only detract from it. As the movie progressed I was truly afraid that it would loose me at the end like so many other budget friendly flicks but thankfully, I was wrong.

It isnt a bad movie, it is just brainless. I understand the dialoge isnt Shakespear, but come on. It isnt a fresh idea, comics and novels have done the same exact storyline a dozen times. The acting is average. And like most films, when the acting and story is lacking, dump a bucket of blood on it, and hope for the best. 20 minutes in, you know how the ending will play out.

But of course it's not what you think about at the time - you'll understand when you watch it.It's a movie where after you've finished it, everything just falls into place and it all makes sense. You feel as though you misunderstood everything, and now the image is so clear.The movie does give you hints throughout, but if you're like me you're just too busy rooting for the main character to pay attention, which is why at the end of it you'll feel as though everything was there from the beginning.I like movies where there's so many balls in the air, but they all land at the same spot towards the end.

Behind this detective plot lies a very sensible cyberpunk world, narrating the integrity of the human body and at what point a computer starts to control your life instead of you. The composition and especially the camerawork are interesting - at the moment of Stem's control we start to lose our usual anthropocentric perception. Yes, and the main character begins to move in a completely non-human way. Of the minuses - there are a couple of borderline plot moves, if not bloopers.

This for me is a 9.5 which may end up becoming a 10 at some point, we shall see after next viewing later on today with the girlfriend. Best thing I've seen since Interstellar and before that as far back as Leon. As many people have described it's like the good bits of John Wick meets Matrix meets Ex-Machina. I'm one of the hardest people to please with films but this ticked every box for me. Why only a 9.5 atm? I think it's because I can't believe I've just seen a 10 but that could very well be the case.

741,coffeegato,"Solid B Movie Action Film, Sci-fi Fun",7,2 October 2018,"This was a hard movie for me to rate, so I admit my 7 rating might not be entirely fair to the film. In my mind I was about to see a low budget sci-fi, in the class of Infinity Chamber (which I recommend if you like low budget sci-fi of the cerebral sort), so my mind set was not correct for the genre into which I would personally place this film (see title).
 I am a life long sci-fi fan, and being 48 I have read/seen a lot of sci-fi. So, for me this was not something story wise I haven't been exposed to. Low budget and B movie mean 2 different things in my mind. For me, Low budget = unknown/relatively unknown actors; could be sub par acting, could be great, could be a little of both; limited sets, costumes, etc.; story could be fantastic, fresh, oscar worthy, etc. or could be a new director learning the trade. B movie = all of the above, but usually not great acting, character development, etc. with camp thrown in. Cheeky dialogue, over the top this, a bit of the silly in that. This film reminded me of John Carpenter's work, and I grew up with that and loved it.
 If someone had sat me down and said that they were going to show me a B movie action film with sci-fi elements, I would then give this film a solid 8. If they had then said the action part is really the focus, and it is fresh and creative, but there is a bit of gore. It is not over the top or a focus of the film, in fact it is spaced out and short lived, I would then go as far as a 9. 
 So with that being said: 
Positives: action sequences, how they used their limited budget (by sci-fi standards) in regards to sets, props etc., camera work
Negatives: acting (imo, very bad...like people reading their lines, no chemistry between any 2 characters, etc.), stilted dialogue
 I would recommend this film to people who enjoy tongue in cheek action and sci-fi films and don't mind low budget or B movies. Also, if you are new to the genre, this might feel fresh and different. 
 For me personally, I was so distracted by the bad acting, the confusion over the category of film I was watching (completely my fault), the silly stuck in my own head internal dialogue about how much the lead actor looked like Tom Hardy, that I never connected with the film. And since concept wise it was nothing new to me, I ended up being a bit bored. Then the first action scene happened and I was like, hey now! But then the unexpected gore (again my fault, didn't know about the Saw connection) which was luckily short lived, threw me for a loop. So I had avoided reading too much about the film because I didn't want anything given away, and ended up being woefully undereducated about what I was about to see. Again, my fault. 
 I mentioned Infinity Chamber before. That film has a limited budget, not the best acting, a concept you have seen before if you like sci-fi, but I was never bored. I was never sure exactly what was actually happening, so I got to sit and think about that afterwards. In this film, I knew what was up the entire time, and while I enjoyed the ending, I have seen that same ending twice within the last year. 
 Go into this with your focus on the action scenes and odds are you are going to have fun. Don't make my mistake and think you will be mulling it over during or after the movie. Just sit back, eat some popcorn and enjoy!",Upgrade

It also features layers of narrative understanding from the viewer, inside the very scene, like the way drama is supposed to be.I'm not saying this is the most inventive movie ever - in fact, it's the perfect example of a simply well-made movie. I just happen to find a few other good points about it that might make it worth my while.Upgrade deals with the Grey's actual journey. The cinematography and camera work is also nice, featuring some bold effects. I think it brought a fresh take on the genre, even if pretty much everything on Upgrade is borrowed from other movies. My top negative point, though, would be the way writer/director Leigh Whannel built Betty Gabriel's character, Detective Cortez. She seems scattered in her purpose of investigating Grey's wife death. She loses track of it after a while and becomes only another obstacle on Grey's path.Still, this movie actually surprised me with entertainment. The visuals, characters and directing are very well done. I recommend watching this for a fun night in, or if you're a little tired of John Wick's ever-neutral gaze.",Upgrade

Especially from the guy who plays 'Eron', he's so obviously trying to impersonate Elliott from Mr. Robot, but it's terrible.The main guy 'Grey' (a name that is very telling of the films atmosphere) is self-absorved, overconfident, boring and depressing. Why give those traits to the main character, he's the guy who we are supposed to be routing for?!? The remorse and anger within him because some random guy killed his wife is what should drive the film's story! But instead the film wants us to hate artificial intelligence and the potential for future technology. What a sad world we live in.The mum was the only likable character in this film, probably because everyone is blinded by death, getting their own way and they all forget what they want.How anyone can give this movie a positive review baffles me. This film is full of boring characters, monotonous storytelling, dead-end scenes with cliche settings.I spent a considerable amount of time looking at my Strava running stats while waiting for something interesting to happen.In case you were curious, nothing interesting happens. One of the most surface level films I've ever seen.Regarding cinematography, there are several scenes were it seems to skip a few frames. Why? It just makes the film even harder to watch.Regarding SFX, the film shows a lot of potential. There are a lot of intriguing objects and structures in the background of scenes. Unfortunately the plot never allows it to make the most of these things, it's just background filler to make the film seem better than it really was.The music was cool, it provided the film with a dark atmosphere that the plot never built on top of.Do not bother watching this film if you actually enjoy watching films.The ending was diabolical by the way, a horrible attempt at a plot twist, what a mess.",Upgrade

If you loved ex-machina as much as I did then Upgrade is for you. There is an interesting infusion of new ideas and technological speculations that tease the imagination. I read some negative comments that the story was predictable, but in reality this story is archetypal Frankensteinian and there is a reason it speaks to us on a deeper level.

Besides that this movie delivers! It looks great, was entertaining as hell and it shows that low-budget-movies can feel like big budget movies if you put enough passion, talent, creativity and an open mind into it.
The acting from the main actor was fantastic and very convincing and everyone else did a great job.
I love how this movie was shot and directed. Most scenes are very well paced and the camera movements especially in fight scenes were creatively executed.
I find the topic very interesting but the plot and the story a little weak. Its not bad in that sense but I wish there is a little bit more story. Some motives aren't too much thought out and some cyborgish characters seemed to forget that they literally have guns in there hands, I mean why wouldn't the first two guys use their ""upgrades"" to fight.

I have never seen such intense and convincing physical acting from a lead actor in my life. I had never teared up before the 30 minute mark of an action film before seeing this film. I have seen very few movies that I would recommend as highly as this one, and that's even taking into consideration the few brief moments of INTENSE gore (which were gratuitous and unnecessary) sprinkled here and there throughout the film.

787,baileywiley,"Upgrade - an Upgraded take we have seen done before, but dare I say better?",10,17 August 2018,"I dare do say better then most tropes involving the same plot devices. Leigh Whanell really does give us a tail where we care for said characters and feel their angst through out this hour and forty minute tale. Upgrade tells the story of a man who is your average run of the mill normal guy. Who lives in a dark and gritty futuristic setting, where their are robotic cars that are driving themselves, and drones patrolling the skies. But one day him and his wife find themselves in an accident where she is pronounced dead and he's left in a quadriplegic state until he's ""upgraded"" by a fancy device known as stem. Which allows him to have function over his body again. Now going into this movie I had somewhat standard expectations, I had heard the rumblings about Leigh Whanell having his own conceived idea for a film he got greenlit on. Which was enough to put me into the chair. But what I got out of this is what I would say the best movie of the year that I have seen. The banter between Logan green and Stem is classic and I found myself chuckling at most of the action scenes and actually going ""oou"" and ""ow"" because some of things that take place throughout this film are just plain badass. And each movie that I see Logan green in I like him even more. This is a film that has been done countless times. And at times it feels like something John Carpenter would have done back in the days with Escape from New York and so on. All in all this a film I definitely recommend to see, and honestly don't think you would be disappointed. There's not a dull moment in the film, and I found myself to really enjoy this little film",Upgrade

This could have been in part down to budget, but poor scriptwriting is harder to excuse. On the plus side, the action sequences were surprisingly well executed for its budget. No complaints there. While full of leaking plot holes, what kept this out of any danger of sinking were the underlying inventive Sci-Fi themes. I nearly gave up on it on several times when the storyline played out like a jukebox of old ""movies"" - where you could hum the cliches in your sleep, but boy was I glad I perservered. One of the best payoffs in recent memory. Such a shame the journey never came to close to that kind of class.",Upgrade

It's a solid 7.5 - I rounded up and gave 8/10.Yes, there's some questionable acting and odd dialogue, but watch it all the way through and then watch it again knowing what was revealed at the end. Then, in retrospect, things make more sense.My only criticism is (spoiler?) when the main character (Grey/Gray?)is being moved by STEM, it's overly robotic looking - I get it, that's how we know that STEM is in control and not Grey, but given it's an AI in an organic form, I'd still expect ""normal"" movement when not fighting/doing extraordinary things.I think the people that give this a low review (""actors weren't good-looking"" ???) were wanting something else and/or weren't paying attention. The Upgrade after all isn't Grey getting the chip, it's STEM getting the organic vessel with which it can wreck greater havoc - and that would be a sequel I'd pay to see.",Upgrade

It certainly got good reviews from the few I skimmed, but I still watched it with not very high expectations having noted it was a small budget film. According to IMDB this movie had a budget of 5 million. In my opinion it appeared like it could have easily had a budget of five times that amount. It was really the story that blew me away though. It was so well executed and I found the ending to be somewhat haunting. It's a movie that I'm going to be thinking about for a while. It has just the right mixture of drama, action and humour. It truly does take the best of other sci fi films and creates it's own story. If you're on the fence about watching it, give it a chance. With a runtime of only around 1.5 hours, it's not a huge thing to lose on the off chance you don't like it. I only took a point off because of a couple of cheesy moments and brief moments of somewhat hollow acting but this is more than well worth the watch.",Upgrade

This movie is an underrated gem that I hope more people watch in years to come. The basic story is so generic: a man seeks revenge for the death of his wife. How many times have we heard that, right? Yes. But Upgrade takes it in such a unique direction that you can't help but admire it. The story takes place in the future so that already changes the setting of this generic premise, the rest I won't spoil for you but it breathes life on a story we've heard a million times before. The acting in this movie is really solid and the writing is really smart and clever. The two things that stand out to me the most are the world building and of course, the action. The world building in this movie is so well done and it feels so natural, other big budget movies should learn from this one if we're being honest. Then there's the action, I think these action setpieces are some of the best for any low-budget movie that I have ever seen in my life. The action is so creative and so well shot it's honestly incredible. This movie is very well made and is the type of movies I want to see more of, low budget that doesn't show, good acting, great writing with fantastic action, what's not to love?",Upgrade

817,dogukanbsh,"Poor Script, Amazing Technics",7,13 April 2021,"Script has several problems, i will talk about them later on the review because i have to talk about techincal greatness of this movie.It is amazing that this movie feels really new generation. In terms of usage of lighting and camera movements. Especially movie kicks ass in the fight scenes. It is because camera operates with fight. Not only stunts but also camera guys must had worked for fight scenes. Usage of lighting in car chase, torture scene and etc. It brings contrast and dramatic effects.Script has some problems about being perminant in viewer's mind. What i am trying to mean is giving characters with differents roles in script different color schemes of clothes would make a difference. Moreover, Civilians such as mother and asha could have blue (which is a trustworthy color) Augmented Soldiers could have purple (because purple looks unnatural and teasing) and main character could get red like in the banner of the movie. A symbol for soldiers would be good. It will be an insult ""who would put hacker pattern kitchen wall in their home?"" these are cheap shots to make us feel in future and it doesnt work, it just feels unnatural.",Upgrade

819,Theselittlebirds,Predictable and unreasonable.,3,17 August 2018,"The problem with a lot of movies in the Sci-Fi genre is the ""because it´s Sci-Fi, we just don't give a sh** about if the use of high tech is logical or not"". So, we got a chip called stem. This chip is said, in the beginning, not to be able to control the mind. It´s just the bridge between the mind and muscle. So far so good, 'cause that's the main point why stem choosed to disable Grey, and here is one of the most unreasonable things about this movie; it turns out that Stem HAS the ability to control the mind. So there's no reason to the need for a disabled man at all. Another illogical thing is that the antagonist has really high tech nano-weapons and equipment, which, if logical, should be VERY VERY hard to find and when found, very hard to eliminate. But Grey finds him ridiculously easy. Then it turns out that Stem wanted Grey to find the antagonist, and kill him. So no logical need for that high tech at all for the antagonist. Don't get me wrong, I like High Tech. But please CHERISH the use of it. And when you are in the future and have characters with this high-tech-nano stuff; why does this character choose to use ""ancient"" weapons? Why does that character even have a gun embedded in his forearm, that is noisy? Yes, this movie is also predictable. And that's a shame because the backbone of the whole story is to be unpredictable. Early on, after the Stem-operation of Grey, you realize that the chip will take over Grey's mind and do whatever it wants. Furthermore, the first plot twist is easy predictable early on, which destroys the glow and the pulse of the last third of the movie. And when the last plot twist is represented, everything feels rushed, and it's like the time and money for making the movie just suddenly ran of (""we must finish this one of fast!""). I would have given the movie just 1 star if not for the quite good and creative fighting scenes, and the good acting from Logan.",Upgrade

822,mcnalj,An excellent Sci-Fi original - Watch This,10,1 November 2018,"I rarely take the time to comment on movies but this was so good I had to write a review. I remember seeing James Camerons 'Terminator' for the first time back when it was released in the 80's and it was clear he'd be going places. I believe the same is true here.
There's some inventive, comical, horrific Sci-Fi with an originality rarely seen today. Every penny of the budget is on the screen & I'm amazed at what they've managed on what would be the catering budget of a hollywood blockbuster. The special effects, whilst low key, are excellent. Action, car chases, fight scenes, gruesome moments, comic relief all included but with the flair of a first class filmmaker very much in charge of their craft. The acting is first rate particularly Logan Marshall-Green as the main character & the story is interesting with a great vision of the very near future.

But come on with this kind of budget most people cant even do a decent commercial let alone a full length cinematic experience. I was very genuinely overwhelmed 20 minutes in.

843,KalStradling,Surprisingly fantastic. Venom but good.,9,25 July 2019,"When I headed to the cinema, I had no idea what we was about to watch. We chosen a random action sci-fi film that had one cool camera angle in. Honestly I thought that would be it, the plot would be lazy and the script would be disappointing. But WOW, this film blew my mind completely. Whannel quite clearly focused his budget on the film rather than the advertising. You'd be forgiven thinking this was a rip off of Venom (2018) but it is simply so SO much better. If you was disappointed by Venom, give Upgrade a watch, I urge you.Now lets talk about the cinematography, specifically that moving camera shot that focuses on Grey (Logan Marshall-Green). During the first fight sequence after STEM takes over Grey's body, the camera follows Grey in the middle of the screen, rather than the camera be stationary. Even if you don't enjoy action sci-fi films, I'd recommend just watching this shot over and over.The plot is a fantastic take on the action sci-fi drama. Although a little predictable, the film allows for a significant amount of enjoyment from the technical aspects of the film.The dialogue of the film was gritty and realistic whilst also being extremely comedic. The pacing is perfect, you never feel left behind the plot with boring, pointless dialogue. It flows very smoothly, this felt even better with the fantastic performances from specifically Logan Marshall-Green, who playing a quadriplegic gives a compelling performance.I won't give away the ending of the film as I feel people should feel the utter despair and shock I felt in the final act of the film. WATCH THIS FILM.I'd highly recommend watching Upgrade and giving it a chance over Venom. The plot feels a lot smoother than the action filled Venom, and with Upgrade not really following a super hero plot rather a real sci-fi plot, it is a fresh take on the genre that has been losing is popularity over the years.9/10",Upgrade

This movie is the definition of taking an old premise to the next level, an ""Upgrade"" if you will. It's the typical revenge movie plot in the veins of Death Wish or Robocop but then takes it to another level by setting it in a not too distant future and adds existensial themes about what is technology and what is human is to make this movie a really good time. The acting is good, better than expected even. The movie is shot extrememly well and makes it seem like it had a bigger budget than the one it actually had, the action is masterful, energetic and bloody, has really innovative camera techniques. The main character is likable and the main villian is memorable, if I had a problem with the movie it would be that while the main villian is memorable, his henchman really is not.

868,aidenpedersen,Mostly a Downgrade,6,13 September 2020,"Upgrade was... pretty great at times. However, apart from the action and actually pretty great ending, this film felt like it was an amalgamation of DOWNgrades of aspects from other films. The world was just really really light cyberpunk (think 'Altered Carbon' but no where near as established), the main relationship reminiscent of that in 'Venom' and if it had any type of thematic resonance, it was just watered down 'Black Mirror'. Even the main actor was pretty similar to Tom Hardy IN Venom (although he wasn't as good) (also, I don't think Venom is a good movie, but there are some aspects that are decent). The writing was passable, nothing felt utterly shocking yet it wasn't as if it was overly predictable. The acting was fine, no one was great and I think that that aspect, along with a bunch of other things (visual effects etc) were mostly due to a pretty small budget. Besides all that however, were the action sequences. This is what truly made this film slightly better than it had any right to be. The way these sequences are filmed, and how they're written are quite fantastic. While most of the writing fell short, the way that the scenes were put together was quite creative. Finally, I will say that the actual end to the film (not necessarily the final confrontation but the actual like last minute or two) was pretty awesome. It's not as if it wasn't a little ham-fisted like most of the plot/story/writing, but, similarly to the action sequences it was quite creative, and made the film significantly better than it could've been. Ultimately, a lot of this film was quite generic, but it had some pretty great aspects that made it stand out a bit.
If this had had a bigger budget and a better team of writers, I think it could've been a unique action film in the vein of Mad Max: Fury Road. It should've gone way more in on the action aspect, as much of the story felt quite generic and slowed down the film significantly.

I also thought the twist at the end was a surprise. There are a few things I didn't like. The whole rich, high tech, highly educated woman with a grease monkey muscle car mechanic is a bit cliche. Then he did repair work on a car for an even higher tech, rich kid that says he doesn't leave home.

I watched this movie and I did not expect to get blown away. The effects were not brilliant but the editing was amazing & Logan Marshall's acting made the movie so much better than it would be.

It looks how Sci-Fi can assist us but also control us, especially as the character is off the grid when it comes to technology.

There is a massive twist at the end of the film and leaves a total bittersweet ending. The film is gripping and you are just rooting for the main protagonists need for survival. Trust me you root for the AI too. For a FIlm of it's budget...I hear around $5,000,000 if this is true this is a totally outstanding work.

946,Soulnd,Upgrade meets the requirements and exceeds the expectations! A well written and executed story makes all the difference.,10,3 May 2019,"Wow. I don't usually write reviews but when I do... (Hope it doesn't get too long)Friday night, feeling sleepy, wanted to watch something that would eventually keep me awake. I went through my watchlist and Upgrade got my attention. The picture is written and directed by Leigh Whannell who is most known for starting the whole Saw series 15 years ago. I have a weak spot for people that put their minds and ideas on paper and then go into the director's chair and orchestrate the whole thing.I was completely awake and on my toes from the first few minutes. The movie is engaging, thrilling, thought provoking and entertaining. Now just to make it clear - I'm not a fan of the big budget Avengers/Marvel Universe/Fast & Furious etc. no brain/full action flicks. Even though in its core Upgrade is an action/revenge story it is also a great sci-fi psychological thriller. There are similarities with Black Mirror, Ex Machina, 2001, Moon, The Matrix, The Terminator and the rest of the films in the man vs. machine universe and Upgrade manages to impress.Even with such a low budget a well written and executed story makes all the difference. Nothing too original but it beats the majority of the nonsense that is being made nowadays. I just love how dark and moody the whole trip is. There is not much that the actors can do in terms of acting in order to impress the viewer, but it may have been way, way worse so good job there. I must mention the soundtrack! I LOVE IT! Great job Jed Palmer, thank you. (currently playing in the background while I'm writing this) In the technical aspect I think that the scenes were very well shot, the effects and the editing were also on point. There is no space for much character development here, you don't need no backstory or anything. I think the movie does a great job at what it's trying to be and for what it's worth I'm giving it a 10/10.Upgrade meet the requirements and exceeds the expectations!",Upgrade

The editing and camera work is in my opinion especially in the fight scenes on point and also otherwise very solid. The effects are also well done and well used so the film never seems overloaded.Even though the story is very good it was predictable for me.

952,sr8,Better than 50 million dollar movies,10,30 September 2018,"If Augmented is viewing at a cinema near you, If you want to give a good DVD to someone, If you have free time. Watch it. The special effects in this film are like the good old times, grimy, sticky, neon lights, and the end is a paradoxical duality of beauty and darkness. The acting is decent, the actors are charming. The science fiction cliches are augmented and amplified with weird sound effects and tempo changes, a bit like The Matrix-augmented-reality effects. Movies sets today are full of crew, the attention span of a conversational camera take is 1-2-3 seconds. This movie teaches Hollywood a lesson a good movie making: conversation scenes which are shot with an intimate, cozy crew, a good team of film-makers with a clear unpretentious director, homely cinematic takes of dark, grimey, futuristic, scifi scenes, recorded with atmosphere, with a mission, and edited later to a good mix. This movie cost half as much as a single Hollywood movie A-Lister... Transformers 2 cost 200 million, and It's worth less than this 5 million dollar movie. Hollywood actors should recall the days when movies were made like ""tremors"" with atmosphere and clear thinking from an authentic crew of film-makers. Movies: an art form where clear thinking people and good atmosphere are worth more commercially than 200 million dollars. Money in the hands of too few film-makers is what makes most sci-fi movies today flat and insipid. The budget distribution of this movie, it's crew's philosophy and modus operandi, are a lesson to hollywood, to bring the public very good movies.I thought that the first scene was a bit B-Movie and dull, and then it didn't stop picking up with better acting, a fast plot, good graphics, gory stuff, good action, darkness, ostentation, good styles, and the end was mesmerising, because it didn't end like an ending, we get what we want at the end. force of thought.",Upgrade

From that moment on, a lot of the suspense and the thrilling mystery dissolved. The action scenes were the highlight and all things considered, specially the budget, the pace, the very few unnecesary scenes, it was a spectacular movie. I don't consider the movie an intelligent script for the reasons above. It was so easy to connect the CEO with the plot and for that reason I felt insulted. Come on!, the movie guides you like a 10 year old to the plot: the strange CEO and its monologue at the beginning, the failure in the car, the accident, the typical detective, the obvious movement of his arm when she visits Gray and his mother to hear the conversation, the cliché appearance of the detective at the climax of the movie and the convenient call trace of Fisk before that.

The plot raced along at a great pace, though after a little thought it's easy to pick holes in. The lead actor does a pretty good job. The others are average to poor and let it down but not so much it's unwatchable - thankfully it centres heavily on our protagonist. Im not sure if the director should be too blame as a lot of the supporting performances seemed stilted and unnatural. I'm impressed that they made the budget work so hard. I liked that they didn't flinch at the death scenes which were neatly parceled and that they gave the ending it's dues. The script is where the film really falls down and betrays the overall production. Mostly I'm just sad that there are so many people out there who are won over so easily by average films, giving such high scores. 5 is average. 6 is slightly better than average. 7 is good. 8 is great. 9 is fantastic. 10 is seminal and difficult to critique.

While that unanticipated atmosphere was a suprise, the plot was not too much at first. Here you found a story of loss, grief mixed up with a detective story and also those acton sequences from the trailer that not always seemd to be consistent with the first act. Here and there a little twist in between. In retrospective I must say that there was no inconsistency. Under the surface the tension built up and in the last act everything turned totally around and pulled ""Upgrade"" onto a new level. Hence,I give the movie a 7.5+.This is not a movie for people that want to bridge the time till Venom comes out.

It should be able to at least detect when the detective was putting it in there.
it feels like emotions of the main protagonist seldom match with the scene is going on, the sound effects that plays when ""stem"" takes over is also distracting, it feels like he is a cyborg rather than muscle and tissue controlled by a computer.

998,Zoldyck,Just for fun,4,8 March 2019,"I am not motivated enough to give a detailed review and I do not even think that this mess of a movie deserves it, so I will just talk about the stuff that I think was the most important.Firstly, this movie basically has no characters. Because every single one of them is a slave with not choice whatsoever. Heck, even main character did not want to kill people, so he was putting himself on ""auto pilot"" mode. Only thing that you could call a character here is the incarnation of plot holes. Like, that robot thing was not programmed to act like that and even if he wanted to act like that, he required the permission, so how in the hell he could act on his own from the very beggining and then stopped, after he was attached to the human. Also, Eron could shut him down from the start, but for some odd reason did not do so. Even worse, the plot has no epilogue, so we can't really guess what happened with the villain, the mother and etc.Secondly, putting a bunch of random ideas and twists together like big pile of crap, does not make writing good and, on top of it, you will just lack both, novelty and subtlety. Not to talk about conveniences, like that hacker, that only existed for lifting the permission requirment. Well, there is a one subtle propaganda, I will give you that - For some reason, people that are bad and also stuck in the past, are males and mostly white (While talking about the superiority of their race) and, on the other hand, people that have not done anything bad and also are not stuck in the past, are only women.Finally, even if we did not have enough time to get attached to the woman who died at the start, the movie was quite enjoyable, because of three reasons. Implementation of humor was pretty fine and was balancing out the edge, thus movie did not feel dry and that brings me to another reason - the edge of action scenes, which also had pretty neat camerawork. And the last thing was the very last moment, where the villain won in a somewhat bittersweet way, where the protagonist was satisfied with his illusions.In conclusion, I would recommend Upgrade only if you want to have fun and nothing else.",Upgrade

After that Upgrade was like a packet of an old good Sci-Fi bytes.It's not a cyberpunk revelation like Matrix (and it never pretended to be the one) and it's not over-complicated, but it is logically consistent, has a smart plot , good pace and excellent actors.

1017,rjquayhagen,Homage VS Rip-off,5,26 October 2018,"This movie dances the fine line between being innovative (the camera work and practical effects are definitely fresh) and regurgitated (the content has been done to death; to the extent where I personally don't see the point in dusting off the age old tropes) $$$It's homage VS rip-off.Brass tacks: UPGRADE is fun to watch - there's no denying that. The witty banter between David Hasselhoff and KITT is pretty entertaining; when John Connor becomes Robo-Cop (perfect posture and all) and HAL 9000 takes over Hardcore Henry's body, it's a spectacle.I believe the trailer is what spoiled this film. It's reminiscent of the Southpaw trailer in that you know, going in, that the wife is going to die, setting the stage for the violence that everyone came to see. The action viewer is (awkwardly) spending the first act waiting for the second act to kick off (in other words: waiting for the wife to die. Yeesh!)It's a great promotional tool for a trailer, but a huge disadvantage for a film... yet, if executed properly - through the acting and character development - it could give the pace of the movie the upper hand. That's where it falls short, in my opinion. It relies too heavily on its premise and doesn't ask much of the actors. The action/fight sequences are intense and over the top and just plain fun to watch... However... the performance of the lead actress (and others) is abysmal and the ""point A to B"" dialogue doesn't do her or anyone else any favors. It's distracting. Considering that you're expected to emotionally invest in these characters - making the motivations of the husband more believable and visceral - the acting, dialogue, and character development come across as afterthoughts.I do like the fact that Grey (ugh) is not hellbent on bloody revenge so much as bringing his wife's killers to justice; he's genuinely investigating the case, realizes he's in over his head, then allows STEM to take the reigns, leaving him in the moral conundrum of how far is too far. That aspect is interesting. The sentient being calling the shots from within - it's a cool idea and it's well executed. It's probably the best (possibly the only) character arc in the movie that's worth a damn and ultimately gives the ""twist"" the depth that would have otherwise been shallow and forgettable.When you see this movie, during the ""big reveal,"" play the iconic SAW finale music in your head. It's hilarious. I might've laughed out loud.Not the worst, but definitely not reinventing the wheel. In other words: Not an Upgrade.",Upgrade
1018,faiyadhossain,A Thrilling Sci-fi Grindhouse Adventure,6,30 December 2018,"Seems like your average detective-noir story and arguably to an extent, it is a bit cliched, as long as you don't take the sci-fi settings and concepts into account. The plot twists and turns along our protagonist, Grey's journey to redemption, only to fall onto its head when the big revelation happens in the final scene. Along the way, he engages with unremarkable characters of bland to no personality - mere shadows of their archetype, yet they're not completely useless to our hero's journey, since they provide eventful obstacles for him to overcome; events that bring about excellent scenes of action and suspense that will thrill you till your veins starts showing up. Besides these certain events, however, there isn't much that the story could offer. It's a mere joyride that lacks impact for the long-term.I enjoyed the movie. It was a bit too predictable, if you're familiar with such plot devices and tropes, but it doesn't ruin the fun, thanks to the brilliantly choreograph actions and impressive cinematography. It has the potential to go down as a grindhouse cult-classic, but only time can decide its fate.",Upgrade

Just watch the trailer and you'll understand why I think Venom (2018), which has yet to even be released, and Upgrade have such similar plot-points. Our protagonist is in easily capable of super-human abilities due to an inhuman intelligence in his system. And not only this, but the major idea is that this guy is a regular guy, now capable of literally killing people by relinquishing all motor functions to the being inside of him. I'm not saying I won't watch Venom, but I can say that the second acts of both of these films are probably going to be very similar, and I can already say that Upgrade not only did it first, but probably better.",Upgrade

1022,mackshaw-21332,An AI horror story that's actually worth your time,9,8 October 2018,"This is the first review I've ever made, and I made a verified account purely to review this single movie. I was entranced by this film the entire time it danced across my TV, and by the end I was fully at a loss for words. Very few times does a movie make my jaw drop at the surprising violent moments and plot propagating fight scenes, but this movie does so.
 In addition to the mesmerizing and almost humorous ""martial arts"", the acting and plot are both superb. I love watching a movie without a single A-list actor, and being rewarded with every single one of them absolutely knocking it out of the park. The plot is the kind which makes you ask questions of it without spoon feeding you, and then answers those questions along the way beautifully. The ending is both a happy ending and a terrifying ending at once, but without being sickeningly bittersweet.
 The special effects are incredible for such a low budget film, and I dont think I ever saw a scene throughout the film where I thought ""ah, that could have been better with a higher budget"". Its like they made the movie exactly the way it was meant to be made, and it ended up being inexpensive because it cost what it needed to.
 I want this movie to be bigger than the Matrix, better loved than the Terminator, and have a cult following like iRobot. Its automatically in my Top 10 list, and my number one film of the year so far. This movie deserves several Oscar's. Thanks for reading.",Upgrade

1028,mrk1974,Damn good,9,15 August 2018,I was caught off guard by how much I enjoyed this movie considering i'd not heard nor seen anything promoting its existence. Finding out the budget for this film was only ~5 million is mind blowing in itself. Of all the films I've watched this year this is most definitively in top 5 and also the only one I've bothered to submit an opinion/review.,Upgrade
1029,tonyspencer-13158,Disappointing end,1,15 June 2019,"Do not waste your time watching a single minute of this movie. I think the writer started with a great storyline, excellent main character who was trying to control what was happening to him and then the writer's brain fart kicked in and the denouement made the whole plot childish and pointless ... it was like Darth Vader dropped R2 into the crusher, did away with any possible Star Wars sequels; that Dumbo crashes and breaks his neck on his virgin flight; that Lex Luther encases Superman in kryptonite sunblock and trapped him in the Phantom Zone; that the Dalek's outpower-played Dr Who during time added; just as Wall-E was about to win the day, he was beaten to it by a weed-wacker; and finally Bambi makes venison broth. Do not waste your time watching the character development of main and secondary characters, because Stem could've simply have submitted himself to the computer hacker at the outset without worrying about Eron shutting him down, doing away with all the drama with the wife killers who, it turns out, had been following his orders all along. He could have dealt with Eron and enhanced ex-Military at any time he wanted once he had control of Grey's mind and body and bypassed the power of shutdown that Eron appears to be the only safeguard retained, even though he was otherwise in Stem's power. The plot has more holes than a Swiss cheese used for target practice. Anyway, if this was supposed to be in the very near future, say the next decade or two, why does everybody bear corrupted futuristic names that might have evolved over a couple of centuries, but not in people clearly born in the late 90s or first decade of the 2000s? The film was interesting until the numbskull ending when everybody dies and the machines won without leaving a glimmer of hope for humanity or a reason for this movie to ever lighten my screen again. I wondered what the director and writer were smoking at the time, well it wasn't good or even close. Not even Arnie and a posse of Sara Connors could salvage this one.",Upgrade
1030,nufc_no,"Solid, Enjoyable, Compact Film with a Thought-provoking Aftertaste",8,18 June 2018,"Compact, solid film. While not designed to be a blockbuster and can be enjoyed as such. While 'not deep' it does indirectly allude to deep issues related to the adoption of not only AI and 'Control' but how humans treat eachother in the age of Technology and how embracing Technology as a means of escapism can actually be a double-edged swordPeople will find that while packaged as a simple film it is actually a much deeper film than it appears and quite thought-provoking in retrospect when the viewer begins to process the film, For example the nature of the Violence while it may seem initially like it is an over-the-top gore fest it actually plays a central role in manipulating various people psychologically at given times in relation to the 'greater agenda' of the 'protaganist'. Violence once again in terms of the 'upgrades' as a means to make the resident human more efficient expression as an instrument of purpose and this is rather cleverly mirrored in the battle within the main character alongside the battle/s against the erstwhile adversaries. In this sense the Violence points to an increased lack of empathy as Technology is ever- increasingly adopted, in Social media in particular where expressed sentiments can be psychologically brutalLogan Marshall did a great job of combining robotic unnatural movements with bewildered and even humorous facial expressions and vocal response. The director did a great job in ensuring tone and ensuring a clean/streamlined movie, The afore-mentioned depth I think will enable this film to age quite well as a form of niche classic",Upgrade

The plot got better but I can't rate it with the superlatives used by others. This may be an age thing. Acting by the main character was solid, but many of the others were just ok.The movie was well paced once it got started. It had some good twists. Filming was good with believable special effects. It had a bit of gore but they did a decent job of weaving it into the plot. I think they did an outstanding job for a low budget movie. So if you rated solely on the bang for the buck, it rates a 9.

1035,austindharrison,One of 2018's Most Refreshing Films,9,3 July 2018,"Written and Directed by SAW and INSIDIOUS Co-Creator Leigh Whannell, UPGRADE tells the revenge story of a man named Grey Trace (Logan Marshall Green) after an incident where his wife was murdered and he was left paralyzed. Losing hope in himself, and the police in being able to track his wife's murderers, he is approached by a young tech businessman with an offer to allow him to walk again. This offer turns out to be an operating system named STEM, where it allows Grey to regain full motor control of his body. However, STEM has a mind of its own and there's no predicting what it will, or can do.The premise itself is your basic revenge tale, but what separates UPGRADE from falling into the same tropes as the revenge films before it, is the creative use of its sci-fi world, and twists and turns leading into the climax. Once Grey regains all motor capabilities, he's not set on killing his wife's murderers, in fact he just wants them to go to jail. STEM, however, with permission from Grey, can take full control and prevent Grey from moving and acting on his own. This leads to some extremely well-shot action sequences with very creative use of cinematography. In fact, I would argue the way some of the action is shot to be revolutionary, kind of in the same way The Matrix revolutionized ""bullet-time"" effects.The performances in the film are passable. No one really stands out and no one is really terrible or drags the film down. The film has an 80s sci-fi campy vibe, where we're not supposed to take things too seriously, though the story is still very well written and smarter than it has any right to be. The overall look of the film is very pleasant. A lot of purples, reds and oranges in many scenes. The cinematography that I touched on earlier was very creative. The camera work during action sequences was fantastic and really showed how much fun Leigh Whannell was having during production. The violence is intense, but it's stylized and not the typical horror-violence we're used to seeing from Whannell's previous works.By the time the film wraps up, I was floored by the direction the story went. It was a fantastic film-going experience, and something I will be watching again very soon. If UPGRADE is playing in a movie theater near you, I highly recommend it. It's one of 2018's most refreshing films to date.I'm giving UPGRADE a 9/10.",Upgrade

The director worked on such films as insidious and saw, this is also evident because saw also had a very low budget and the majority of the film took place in one room and that movie was also very well choreographed, with the small budget they had for that movie.

The action, though used sparingly, is excellent and captivated me with great choreography and a dash of hyper violence. The cinematography shines during the action and chase scenes with good use of steady cam and clever editing. Some truly unique choices and incredible shots that left me giddy in my seat.
The film has a plot that revenge film lovers can comfortably watch with no problem, yet some unexpected twists and a brilliant bait and switch at the end.Some underused and downright ignored plot points that reduce this films overall rating.I've seen people complain about underdeveloped characters, confusing motives and an unexplored world. However I think the lack of explanation in some parts helps the films pacing. The last thing needed in an action film is a ten minute break where they explain the rules and characters.A true gem of a film considering its budget.

We are told to devalue the body and pursue greater pursuits, abstractions, ideas, immaterial things-as though they are separate from the material. Yet, in doing so, we are manipulated, fooled into believing that we're acting through our own accord.

But this film surpassed my expectations, and was a well-worth experience. Not only was I correct about the cinematography being exciting and engaging, but the plot actually strung together compelling way. This film came out of nowhere for me, and now, it's a memorable film that accomplishes the most important goal of any great film: gets the audience to keep wondering about it.Since I don't want to go into spoilers, I'll say one last thing: pay attention to the Foley artist's work. The sound design is poignant and additive to the experience. It reminds me of the clever usage of music from Baby Driver. Nothing is wasted and is always enriching of the world building. With Baby Driver, the music was giving us Baby's personal experience. Here, the sound effects give us Grey's point of view.

The only thing I can blame on the production is that the futuristic aspect and setting of the film is a bit subdued, it sure is in a high tech future but we are shown mostly the ""low tech"" part, maybe due to the budged constraints or by choice but I would have loved to see more of the ""cyberpunkish"" human enhancements or the more technologically deveped parts of the city.

I won't be specific since this review does not contain spoilers, but suffice to say that if there had been a little more mystery at the end the it would have made the movie probably on par with the matrix 1 for me.

I enjoyed the story and the story line, I enjoyed the fight scenes, the acting was convincing, I really liked the most of the implementation of what tech would look like in the future. But some portrayals were ridiculous. Like the idea that an implantable gun would be your typical shotgun that requires oiling is ludicrous. The wonderful thing about SciFi is that it allows your imagination to create insane tech that can look like anything and do anything, especially in a futuristic piece. An example of Whannell's horror past shows up in the operation scene, where an absurdly large incision is created to implant a device half the size of an ipod nano. Modern medicine implants things through micro incisions today. The whole scene was ridiculous and unnecessary, and just an opportunity to incorporate some unnecessary gore. Also the Stem chip looked like an 1980 silicon chip, come on would be ancient technology today. I really did enjoy this movie, and Whannell's transition from Horror to SciFi is a great first attempt. However, if a little more attention to the details regarding the state of possible future tech would take the movie to the next level.

It has a rather straight-forward storyline, although there are some really surprising twists. The characters are stereotypical, and especially the development of the protagonist isn't convincing. Still this doesn't really harm the film. For me, the main problem was the inconsistency in the relationship between Grey, the protagnist, and stem, his implemented A.I. Which party of the body can be controlled by stem and which can't is mostly based on what is useful for the story and less on what seems logical.
So, if you're looking for a well thought-through, interesting new parable on human enhancement and transhumanism, this movie might not be what you're looking for. But it its good entertainment and I really liked the combat-scenes and the camera. So go for it, but don't expect a new Matrix, Ex Machina or Blade Runner.",Upgrade

Kudos to the writer/director and the talented actresses and actors in this film.

If I didn't stay until the end of credits roll, I would have thought it's a big-budget Hollywood flick, and then I read Victoria, Australia. There has been a stream of Australian-made quality movies lately, I just didn't expect it would also include the sci-fi genre.I'd have to say the movie itself is leaning more towards a revenge flick instead of pure action, and the sci-fi elements just brought it closer to fantasy-fulfillment, especially for the less fortunate among us.

1141,hitteammovie,Upgrade director proves he can direct sci fi/action!,10,21 June 2018,"Leigh Whannell has proved himself in Hollywood as a successful writer with trilogies like SAW and Insidious. As an actor from movies like, Matrix Reloaded and Insidious-The Last Key. He Also has14 producer credits but can he direct? We saw in Insidious 3 he did a good job with horror and we would expect that knowing he wrote so many amazing horror classics. Something we haven't seen him do before is write and direct a sci fi/action movie.It's a risky move for a known horror writer/director to move into sci fi/action but Leigh Whannell's Upgrade IS one of the best - EVER. Upgrade is a fresh look into the future, pulling from movies like - The Terminator and Robocop while mixing in The Matrix. Done on a very small budget, Upgrade uses every penny on amazing effects, car crashes and fight scenes with gory endings. This movie is action packed and keeps your attention all the way through with many unexpected plot twists and turns. I hope he gets more money to do the next one and can have fun with this trilogy.Logan Marshal-Green is Gray Trace in Upgrade and delivers a great performance in a very difficult role. After his wife is killed and he is paralyzed trying to stop it, he has new technology called 'STEM"" put in his body. Stem who helps him find his wife's killers and hunt them down, can also control Trace's body. This gives him super human fighting skills and strength. Logan's performance is great as his head and body seem to be independent of each other. When STEM has full control of him he walks like Robocop, head turning first then body. Turns out the killers are military cyborgs with guns and other weapons implanted in their bodies. This premise opens the movie up to amazing fight scenes. equal to the Matrix with unique camera moves and gory death kills. We care for this character and want to see him get his revenge.The leader of the cyborg military killers is Fisk (Benedict Hardie) who is not intimidating in size but because of his daunting performance, comes off larger than life. He is the most sophisticated ex-military cyborg, with all kinds of built in, original ways to kill people. Should we say he can kill with a sneeze? This could only come from Leigh Whannell's twisted mind. The thing that is really scary is - It could happen.Upgrade's look at the future could happen too. Self driving cars and technology built into every aspect of life. Leigh only shows us brief shots of wide futuristic city scapes as drones patrol and record everything. The movie was filmed in Whannell's home town in Australia (Matrix was filmed there too) as he takes us into grungy bars and car chases on the streets. Stretching every cent of his budget into movie gold. Just as so many classic action movies have done in the past. I'm a huge sci-fi/action fan and this movie has everything I love about the genre. It's the best action movie of 2018. I'm looking forward to more movies directed by Leigh Whannell as this movie has made him one of my favorites.",Upgrade

1153,stefanpoland,A cyberpunk action flick that never really goes into depth,5,3 April 2020,"'Upgrade' takes up many familiar dystopian sci-fi tropes and fuses them into a generic revenge-action movie. And if you came for the action there is a good change you will like this film. The fighting scenes, involving a combination of (slightly overpowered) superhero physics and grindhouse-like violence, certainly look spectacular, especially considering the low budget. However, if you, like me, came for thought-provoking sci-fi you will probably be disappointed. It's not that it totally lacks great ideas, on the contrary. By touching on too many interesting topics (humanity's increasing dependency on technology, governments and companies experimenting on humans, and, of course, the rise of Artificial Intelligence) you could even argue that the makers bit off more than they could chew. What remains is a cyberpunk action flick that never really goes into depth.The same can also be said of its main characters, all of which seem to lack any emotional complexity. Even the non-enhanced humans in the story often seem to act robotlike. This especially applies to Eron, but also to Grey, who, even though he is supposed to represent humanity in a world dominated by technology, is practically emotionless throughout the entire movie. The underlying problem here seems to be the pace of the film. With a first act taking up no more than ten minutes, the film takes absolutely no time to develop the main characters beyond the archetypes of the ""stubborn technophobe"", ""brilliant but anti-social inventor"", and the ""happy-go-lucky wife"". Not to mention the machine-hybrid cliche supervillain, who is especially hard to take seriously. The limited time you get to spend with these characters makes it even harder to genuinely feel for them as the story unfolds.The film, however, does succeed in bringing to life a dark, grim and empty world that feels painfully familiar and realistic - a sheer contrast with the characters that inhabit it. A scene, for example, that clearly stood out for me was the one with VR-junkies in the worn-out apartment building; it beautifully captured the blurred lines between the ""real"" and the ""fake"" that we increasingly seem to experience in everyday life. But even during these rare brilliant moments, the film felt rushed and overshadowed by action sequences. Admittedly, the ending was pretty surprising, but this could hardly compensate for structural flaws of the film. All in all, I found it an unfulfilling experience.",Upgrade

1166,masonjsmith,Holy crap,9,17 August 2018,"When I first heard about this movie I assumed it was going to be some cheap AI knock off with terrible acting, and a non compelling plot. I have never been happier to be so wrong in all my life. This movie was absolutely incredible to say the least. The acting was absolutely top notch, with bits of humor spread out during all the brutal murder that made me kinda feel bad for laughing. The movie strikes a fantastic balance of you being sympathetic towards the main protagonist and his goal to enact revenge for the death of his wife, and feeling like he may be going about it too far or perhaps in the wrong ways. The plot is very well conceived and the ending leaves you with twist that rivals a Shyamalan movie and a ""holy sh*t"" moment. If you have ever watched Black Mirror this is like a movie version of that. This movie exceeded my expectations and blew me out of the water with the twist at the end. It is definitely a must see for anyone who enjoys a gritty thrill ride with wonderful story telling, and an incredible twist ending. I would recommend this to any movie goer who wants to be wowed. For a futuristic set movie it's not the most flashy, but there many moments throughout that really catch you off guard with how crazy cool some of the tech is. This movie strikes a beautiful balance of being futuristic without being completely unrealistic, but just enough to extend reality a bit to make it interesting to watch all the way through. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a terrific movie to entertain all the way through.",Upgrade

The plot is straight out of the 90's. This is a good thing. It has shades of Robocop, TimeCop, Demolition Man and Universal Soldier. The cinematography and setting seems to mimic the 90's view of what the future would be like, but updated slightly. The acting from Logan Marshall-Green is superb, as in, it looks technically and mechanically difficult to play this part to it's fullest potential, especially in the action scenes.

1204,arthurtarasov-97657,Original hard science fiction,10,20 August 2018,"I am a fan of Leigh Whannell's movies, such as Saw and Insidious, so I had high expectations for this movie. After the movie ended I sat for some time trying to find a flaw in the script that would dismiss such a grim outcome as unrealistic. I couldn't find any. It is a pretty hard original science fiction. Stanley Kubrick level or a less spectacular, lower budget Christopher Nolan masterpiece. It does not continue the trend of the past century where beautiful/monstrous sparkling cans are taking over the world through brute force. It sets a new modern trend of the future where aging and obsolete information security is the only guard against the machines that need but an access key to take over the world. The world that they already operate, but don't own yet. In fact, it might have gone too much into technical details. Like The Matrix, but without a beautiful facade to connect to a non-tech-savvy audience, without Morpheus to explain it all in plain English. But I will not take any stars away for it being too tech-heavy. And if someone feels like it is, you better catch up and keep up, or we may find some of the predictions this movie makes come true.",Upgrade

The other thing that I was vexed by was simply the cinematography. It was phenomenal. There was never a second where I thought to myself ""hold the damn camera still!"" Some people could say that it's not that hard to keep a camera still. In a movie filled with fight scenes and maneuvers? It's pretty damn difficult. Great storyline. Great casting. Great choreography. Great movie overall. I do recommend to any and all the ones who are appealed to action and thriller.",Upgrade

1207,jurassicprydberg,My Favorite Film of the Year,9,20 August 2018,"I've never written a review but this movie warrants one. This movie is pretty amazing. Objectively it does have a few issues such as Stem deciding not to tell Grey about the off switch plot device in advance and not explaining how Stem was able to control Eron but subjectively I just loved this movie to death. The movie (much like its protagonist) is an old fashioned action film that was upgraded with some high-tech innards. The performances are all pretty great and they really did the best they could with the material they were given. Now onto the meat and potatoes of the movie; the action sequences in this movie are so well choreographed and the cinematography during these scenes is fantastic and they really wouldn't be the same if they had not been filmed the same way so major props to the filmmakers. Finally onto the plot; the movie's plot is actually really well done, I felt invested in Grey and some parts actually made me feel a little bit which is something most action movies really dont do. The twist at the end is also pretty great even though the reasoning behind the twist isnt really explained I'm willing to just gloss over that because the ending is just so good, it's very reminiscent of Black Mirror, especially the White Christmas episode. Overall freaking fantastic movie 10/10 I'm going to watch it again.",Upgrade

Hats off to Logan to pull off the switches from quadriplegic to ninja turtle acts in a so under-rated way that you would be like wow!
Equal credits to Fisk, the Benedict supervillain without who the director couldn't have brought justice to Grey's feelings and eventually the plot of the film too. Kudos to the crew too. Must watch!

1215,ich-74607,"100% biased, 100% honest 10/10",10,18 August 2018,"This movie just nailed it for me. My intuitions and fears about the slippery slope ramification of the technological progress we all participate in were portrayed perfectly from the conceptual, as well as artistic point of view. I could feel with the protagonist 100%. His decision making was presented excellently, which helped to preserve my initial sympathy for him and intensified my pain in the final scene. When I realized the final twist I desperately murmured: ""no, no, no, no..."", understanding at the same time, that it's the ""perfect"" ending. The circle is colsed. Surrogat internal (?) pleasure for the initial host. Is it the role of human mind in this world? Is this transhuman path of ""experience machine"" the ultimate goal of our race once we've got hooked on the new technologies? Just think about it. We can ""be"" everything we want, we can ""do"" everything we want to do, while just being an algorithm run by the chip installed in our body to serve, assist and extend our abilities, but ends up taking absolute control over our mental agency and creates a perfect computer simulation for our consciousness! So that's why I love this movie so much! For me it articulated perfectly through the art of moton pictures a global issue, humanity is currently faced with. I strongly doubt that it is going to date well. A lot of concepts and referenses seam to me too directly linked to current culture. Besides I have to admit having seen very view movies or read books on this topic. So I'm far from being the right person for judging it's originality. On top of this I'm not quite sure, if showing this movie to certain mentaly unstable people is a good idea. Still I can't help, but to give this film 10/10 points and to share my reasons for my rating with the world. I am not a philosopher, nor a writer, (both not a secret for you, my dear patient reader) but an undergrat grafic designer.

We've always seen that a robot or an army of robot is trying to capture the world or wants to be like a human, or people who are transformed to a robot; however, we haven't seen that a program/software wants to capture a human body to fully evolve.

+Acting was great.

+It had actual story to tell which is great.

there is a fair use of ""unknown"" actors which is very good, it creates a surrealism a kind of pseudo, a plausibility of reality.
And above all it makes it all believable this movie kept me in my seat with entertainment the entire time.The way the movie sets it scenery and sets are done right.
The story as it develops only get better and better.
The ending was by far one of my all time favourites.This is a movie that is exactly what a movie is suppose to be.
for the last 10 years of big budget movies they have gotten lazy and by far too predictable and this was the total opposite.

Probably, but it's bad good and you know what that means!",10,24 May 2018,"All my life I've been reading about the integrated man, hundreds of books and articles and seen hundreds of bad flicks. Is it a foretelling? Who cares, really? Does the flick work, that is the question. The answer is in the script, dark humor and good old American violence! As a country and as an audience we have been conditioned to accept really, really bad scripts and call them entertainment. Just look at the Marvel flicks and you want to stick a fire hydrant down your throat. The rom/com appears to be dead and scifi is much better on tv than it is in the movie theater. What does that leave? Exactly, horror flicks and action flicks. Upgrade is basically a horror edging thriller with a light side and we might as well skip right to the director's cut. The script is not bad, which says a lot in this era of script doctors and studio execs who think they can do it better than the pros. Anything that comes out of the machine with a half decent script either has someone pushing it or someone screwed the pooch (literally) and left the gate open.

1235,gforce-11475,Shocked how good it was...,10,16 August 2018,"Reading the review after I watched it someone mentioned the WIP title was STEM and I also agree that would be a much better title, cuz it could make people more curious + the fact that STEM in Dutch means VOICE, hehe so technically that is very suitable coincidence (i'm sure the maker don't even know this) anyways as I imagine why they called it STEM was meant to focus on the SPINE i assume... but Upgrade is way to cheesy :D Also agree with others that many recent AI movies and SERIES has made us spoiled, myself a total fan of HUMANS (and still need to start Westworld) also loved the movie A.I. and cherish the JOHNNY 5 robot flicks... but this B movie actually surpasse many A's",Upgrade
1236,speedtwisterj,DAMN...MAN!! That's Killing me..!,9,16 August 2018,This one go to my one of the B best movie all time. There's unknown actor's do An amazing job.

1237,benhyra,Gory thriller with heart and depth,9,17 August 2018,"What a film! this fresh take on the near future is both realistic and creative, bringing innovative elements into the tired AI genre. While the gore means you wont be watching this with Nan, it is not so much that it is unnecessary. Logan Marshall-Green gives an amazing performance, fully embodying Grey, a character that is easy to relate to and thoughtfully complex, easily one of my favorite protagonists of the year. So too does Betty Gabriel breathe new life into the role of the suspicious cop, a solid performance in what has been a good year for her. The only let down was Harrison Gilbertsons portrayal of Eron, who plays the reclusive tech billlionare a little too on the nose in the early scenes, but matures in the role as the film goes on. Leigh Wannell has skillfully pulled himself out of the horror genre to gift us with this original thriller, and I look forward to more of his directorial and writing work under blumhouse.",Upgrade
1238,stuartdunlop,Stunning,10,17 August 2018,"This movie seems to have come out of nowhere for me, I haven't really seen any trailers or mention of it until I saw a mention on the net. I'm not sure where some other reviews see the B-movie rating because this has far surpassed any Sci-Fi / Ai film I've seen in a long time. It's at least as compelling and well written as Ex Machina, and as moody and beautifully shot as Blade Runner (the new one) but with a far superior and succinct well fleshed out storyline. The special effects seem to be largely practical, and fit the tone perfectly. The soundtrack remind me of Drive, and it works great here too. I really cant see any glaring plot issues or really much reason to dislike it at all. It's fantastic, and really shows how far some big budget movies have allowed themselves to sink with regards to lazy writing and plot holes galore. Absolute must watch for any SciFi fan, or those who appreciate a well put together film. It's special enough to have made me write my first ever IMDB review, so that's got to count for something.",Upgrade

1240,louish-38117,A lesson in low budget film.,10,19 August 2018,"Brilliant.This movie is proof that you don't need all the special effects in the world to make an amazing sci fi movie. This is low budget done right (think Ex Machina). I signed up to IMDB to review this movie, I was that impressed. I see tons of people making that remark about films but honestly, this movie is unbelievable and for any sci fi fan out there, you need to watch this. I went in blind, no trailer, no knowledge of the movie what so ever and I would advise you do the same. The plot is simple, it's a revenge story that's been done countless times, yet it feels so fresh, acting Is slightly suspect throughout the first 10-15 minutes but the story will grip you, be patient. Honestly, I don't want to give anything away so just watch this movie.9.5/10 Easily my favourite sci fi for a LONG time.Enjoy.",Upgrade
1241,lemathomas,Unexpected top notch movie,10,20 August 2018,"Honestly did not know what to expect from this movie. The storyline and plot are definitly very well thought out. This movie is granted to be one of the better ones that came out in 2018.I expected it to be a sort of good sci-fi movie but it it was MUCH more than I expected.The dark atmosphere created amidst the movie makes you question what's going to happen in the next 5 to 10 minutes because it gets really, really intense.
It does sort of correlate with certain Black Mirror episodes, though it still is a good flick.Some say the acting was a bit off in the reviews. Aside from some cheesy characters, they all did a fantastic job. The humor was on point too. I laughed out loud with some of the lines being said.I rated it 10/10 cause it was overwhelming and unexpected. A sort of movie with an immense plottwist that I have not seen in a while. The acting, decor, effects, comedy, music and well though out fight scenes (+ the very low budget) make this movie unforgettable. It surprised me. Credits to the director and everyone involved in making this one.",Upgrade

The machine concepts used in this film have enough vagueness which might make it possible in theory, in fact some of it is being researched on right now. The ending is deeper than it looked liked, left a lot of intriguing questions for me. first time i reviewed a film, ill be following more of Leigh Whannell's",Upgrade

I really like sci fi, and when i watched I felt that there is still hope for sci fi . I am not unsuprised to learn its not a Holliwood movie. So diappointed by Holliwood lately. But this simple plot was masterfully excecuted from beginning to end. leaving me with a feeling of having seen an iconic movie in the series B realm. At no point I was able to realise the truth behind it all, and now I have a better opinion on enhanced humans and where it can all lead us. The future is here, for good and wrong people.",Upgrade

1249,christopherbelld,WOW,10,1 September 2018,"Watched this because it was produced by Blumhouse and on good faith. Boy, were me and my wife blown away!! Amazing combination of action, edge-of-your-seat suspense, and story-telling, with just the right amount of gore! Logan Marshall-Green did an excellent job and kind of gave me a Venom vibe (another movie we're anxious to see!). If this was considered a ""low budget"" film, then maybe the big wigs in Hollywood should take some notes.",Upgrade

It's set in our near-future. Film tells the story of the society, but they aren't seemed to be like us. They are different. Almost everyone live with a help of modern gadgets. There are no longer jobs where you can use your hands, instead of you robots make everything. But the main hero, Grey, is different. He prefers old cars, instead of robots, cooking, instead of ready food. However, Grey has usual life. He has lovely wife, big house, but he earns money by repairing vintage cars on his own for wealthy people. Unexpectedly, one accident change everything, his life turned upside down. Now he has only one hope and it's modern implant called Stem.",Upgrade
1263,artemromm-58592,Upgrade of Black Mirror,10,30 October 2018,"Wonderful movie. Cheap but entertaining as Australians can do.
But...
Plot...
I would have liked if at the end the man and the chip complemented each other.
There were hints of this in the course of the narrative: breaking the castle, chasing, fighting with the boss, etc.
A person can something that can not computer, and vice versa.
That's why the name of the Upgrade would get additional meaning: improving a person with a chip, and improving a chip with a person
parallel.
Like a symbiote.
For this film is constantly compared with Venom.
But for some reason, near to end of the picture, this, logically developed, and almost completed storyline breaks.
As if in the end one of the screenwriters of the Black Mirror came (which I usually imagine in hides and vered foil hats), kicked the backside of the original screenwriter
and sat down to finish the story by himself, ditching a logical plot for the sake of a banal message and an extra plot twist...Which was a bit too much for last five minutes.",Upgrade
1264,prarturtavares,Quite a nice surprisse.,7,3 March 2021,With some Blade Runner meets Matrix vibes this movie was quite a surprise. With a coerent storyline and some cool action scenes that made me quite satisfied with the end result. Recomend it!,Upgrade
1265,sensei-74453,Technophobe Central,4,5 December 2018,"Don't get me wrong, the story's good with an unpredictable twist. But the takeaway screams technological paranoia, so much so as to assume the script was written by someone who grew up fearful of his/her toaster, and who currently dreads the possibility of every new GB of RAM added to any smartphone - making said phone self-aware, aka skynet, aka human extinction-level event.",Upgrade

The story line is rather dry and predictable but what it lacks for in a gripping story, it makes up for with great camera angles. The fight scenes really make you feel part of the action and you get to expereince the action up close. The main protagonist has a likable enough character for the audience to want want to see him get revenge but as you past the first 30 mins even he can't stop the regret from creeping in. All in all, upgrade is a movie i would recommend if you are out of options and just want to kill 1hr40mins",Upgrade

1273,timchuma-43350,The Cyberpunk movie we never knew we needed,8,8 March 2019,"Despite their popularity, I have never seen any of the SAW franchise or Hostel as although it has been said ""Humans take perverse pleasure in sham agony and death (roller coasters, horror flicks, televangelism). "" (Uncle Al) I am not that interested in it apart from the Raid movies.Now that Leigh and James are established directors in Hollywood they can get to do their own thing from time to time and this seems more like a passion project than a traditional blockbuster. I did not know it was even filmed in Melbourne until the robotic voice at the start announced Film Victoria as being involved.We have already entered the bio-mechanical age thanks to the endless middle eastern war in Afghanistan, it is called a graveyard of empires for good reason and all those soldiers being blown up by IEDs in Iraq has led to advances in artificial limbs and replacement body parts. We are not really at the stage where people would want to replace a body part for greater advantage as yet.Also the interface and infection control must have been worked out in the future as a friend's contact lens scratched his eye and he was done for the day.
The story is a standard revenge plot with a tech billionaire offering a deal the hero can't refuse so he can walk again and also find his wife's killer. Complicating matters is there is already a detective on the case and our hero has to pretend he is still a quadriplegic.Although it is a fully tech-integrated world there are still low tech spaces like the Old Bones bar where technology is forbidden and surely there would be hippie communes in this world?I did like the VR refugees as it reminded me of the ""Better than Life"" episode of Red Dwarf and also the Polish/Japanese movie Avalon set totally in VR.There were very good fight sequences and stunt coordination with a nod to the Raid movies as they seem to have influenced a lot of movies these days.I had no problem with the acting and the story seemed to flow well. It did seem to be a believable world with a balance between sci-fi utopia and scummy sections. The utopia is for the rich and the poor people get the worst deal. Docklands is also a slum I would agree. Great shots going over the Bolte Bridge.With Cyberpunk 2077 coming out in the near future I am sure there will be talk of a movie adaptation, not sure they really need it or one of Deus Ex with this film out. There is enough storyline in those two games that they don't really need a movie made of them the same as Skyrim.",Upgrade
