0,MartinHafer,Tense and exciting.,9,24 March 2013,"""In the Line of Fire"" is a very exciting film and works well because the film was well cast and very well written. Clint Eastwood plays an old Secret Service agent whose claim to fame was his being on the detail that protected President Kennedy in Dallas (oops). Not surprisingly, he blames himself for the assassination and although he seems like a great agent, he is imperfect and vulnerable.Out of the blue, a strange threat arises--a would-be assassin (John Malkovich) who announces himself to Eastwood's character! In other words, he tells the Service that he's going to kill the President and taunts them! And throughout the film, the psycho keeps contacting Eastwood--as if they are old friends! What's next? See it for yourself.While I am pretty sure a Secret Service agent would watch this film and spot a few flaws, for the average Joe, it seems pretty tight and well made. My only quibble was the notion in one scene where the agent (Eastwood) did NOT kill the killer when he had a chance because he knew he'd die in the process. My assumption is a real agent wouldn't even think about this. Perhaps I am wrong. But, it did make for good viewing--as did all the film. Plus, using an old guy like Eastwood worked because his age was figured into the plot--not some old guy pretending to be a lot younger than he really is. Well done.By the way, if you get a chance, watch ""In the Line of Fire: The Ultimate Sacrifice""--a special feature on the DVD for the film. It talks about how the Secret Service worked with the crew to make sure the details in the film were correct. Fascinating.",In the Line of Fire
1,bkoganbing,Making It Personal,8,10 June 2009,"Back when I was working person, I remember having a really obnoxious client to deal with who insisted on making everything on a personal basis. I was telling him things that my agency could do and could not do and he firmly believed I was personally out to do him out of what was rightfully his. I swear but I was thinking of this guy as I watched John Malkovich and Clint Eastwood in their battle of wits.In The Line Of Fire casts Clint Eastwood as a veteran Secret Service Agent who was on the job in Dallas as a young man when John F. Kennedy was assassinated. He's had his doubts ever since and been given to drink and his life at one time was a real shambles. He's gotten back on the White House detail now and when a potential assassin's landlady rats on her tenant to the Secret Service, it's Eastwood and partner Dylan McDermott who draw the case.But the assassin is no ordinary crank case. He's a professional at his job, trained by and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich earned a deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He lost that year to Tommy Lee Jones for The Fugitive and I'm not sure, but that I thought Malkovich was better.Oddly enough Malkovich might have been better off, but he saw Eastwood as the agent in charge breaking into his apartment while on the job and he insisted on making the whole thing personal. He calls Eastwood throughout the film and taunts him. And after a while what Malkovich says and does causes Clint to get real personal. The presidential assassins we've had in our history have been lucky amateurs, unless you believe in some of the conspiracy theories about some of the assassinations. A guy like Malkovich, a professional with a real or imagined grudge, is the most dangerous kind of foe.Others to note in the cast are Fred Dalton Thompson as the White House chief of staff (and would be president in real life), Rene Russo as another agent who falls for the Eastwood masculine charm, John Mahoney as the Secret Service head, Gary Cole as the White House head Secret Service guy, Gregory-Alan Williams as another agent and Jim Curley and Sally Hughes as the President and First Lady.But when Malkovich is on he owns In The Line Of Fire. The climax with him and Eastwood is unforgettable.",In the Line of Fire
2,Leofwine_draca,Moderately good,6,6 May 2011,"A solid if predictable presidential assassin thriller boasting a typically strong performance from star Clint Eastwood. Eastwood plays an old-timer who finds himself in a battle of wits with a much younger man, a psychopath who's planning to kill the president. The running time is overlong but the film plays out in a serviceable, entertaining manner even if it sticks entirely to Hollywood convention throughout. Wolfgang Petersen, a director always more at home at sea rather than on land, displays little enthusiasm for the material but wrings the usual thrills out of the premise, only failing in some ludicrously cheesy slow-motion shots.There are roles for a whole bunch of familiar faces and John Malkovich is allowed to get his teeth into his turn as a psychopath, although it has to be said this is one of the less memorable villains that Hollywood's thrown our way. Watch out for a memorable rooftop encounter and some vintage tough-guy moments from Eastwood.",In the Line of Fire
3,SnoopyStyle,Eastwood perfect for the role,7,11 October 2014,"Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is a no non-sense secret service agent who is stilled haunted by his failure at the Kennedy assassination. He has a young eager partner Al D'Andrea (Dylan McDermott). They investigate Joseph McCrawley as a possible threat to the president. Then Frank gets a call from McCrawley (John Malkovich) who is fixated on him. Agent Bill Watts (Gary Cole) in charge of the presidential detail doesn't want to hear it but agent Lilly Raines (Rene Russo) is interested. Frank gets back on the presidential detail with the help of mentor Sam Campagna (John Mahoney).Despite its two hours running time, director Wolfgang Petersen weaves a tightly wound thriller. Clint Eastwood is the perfect choice for the world wearied expert agent. John Malkovich has a creepy menace to him. Also I love the wooden gun. It's not a complicated story but Eastwood keeps our attention throughout.",In the Line of Fire
4,Hitchcoc,That Crazy Malkovich!,9,9 November 2010,"This is certainly an engaging film. We have two entities. One is Clint Eastwood's Secret Service agent who is carrying around a great deal of baggage. He was in Dallas when JFK was assassinated and felt he should have taken the bullet. The other is the psychotic (and totally magnificent) John Malkovich, who takes it upon himself to torment the man and exert his own power. There is a gradual union of the two personalities who parry and thrust their way through each intense day. There is a third adversary, which is the Secret Service itself, which sees Eastwood as a loose cannon and an incompetent. Some of this is true, but they also don't see the forest for the trees when it comes to the danger to the President. It evolves into a chess match with a real twist. I won't throw a spoiler in here, but something occurs to create even greater conflict for Eastwood. The pacing and tight plotting of this film are quite good and we care about the people. There's a touch and go romantic thing, but it doesn't play into the real issues of the movie.",In the Line of Fire
5,classicsoncall,"""I like the wackos to see the whites of my eyes.""",8,10 May 2014,"When I watched this film the other evening, what struck me from the perspective of having been around when John F. Kennedy was assassinated was how familiar all the press clippings appeared to be in Mitch Leary's apartment. The pictures and headlines were ubiquitous in the aftermath of the assassination, and it struck me how viewers born after that event will never have that same kind of perspective. Not sure if that really means anything, but it's something I've been thinking about since watching the picture.Considering Clint Eastwood's character to be one of the Secret Service agents assigned to the Kennedy detail, I'm glad the film writers didn't take the approach of making Frank Horrigan a discombobulated mental case because of the assassination. Eastwood displayed just the right amount of angst over his connection to Dallas without obsessing about it. Casting John Malkovich against Horrigan as the disgruntled ex-CIA agent was a brilliant move, he exhibited a cold menace in the early going to keep Horrigan off balance. There was a great line he used to taunt Horrigan with when he said ""What do you see when you're in the dark and the demons come?"" Without knowing anything about how the Secret Service actually operates, the film had some interesting points to make about protecting the president. There was also the upcoming election intrigue taking into account the president's standing in the polls and how the Chief of Staff (Fred Thompson) obsessed about closing that gap with personal appearances in light of a credible threat. Another interesting observation which can only be made in hindsight, is the phony name used by Leary early in the picture when he was calling himself James Carney. How could anyone know that in 2014, the presidential press secretary would be someone named Jay Carney. It calls to mind all those weird coincidences when considering the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln.",In the Line of Fire
6,lee_eisenberg,Clint does his usual stuff,5,23 June 2018,"It's generally safe to assume that most movies starring Clint Eastwood will feature him getting tough on bad guys. Wolfgang Petersen's Academy Award-nominated ""In the Line of Fire"" doesn't have that to quite the same extent, but you should have a sense of what Clint does. The movie really belongs to John Malkovich as the villain. His character is one nasty but clever son of a b****. Rene Russo didn't get enough screen time, but there is one scene that lets her go all out; nonetheless, I'd like to see her get a lead role.Basically, it's nothing special, but it doesn't pretend to be anything that it's not. Watch for appearances by Fred Thompson (later a senator and presidential candidate), John Heard (the dad in ""Home Alone"") and the recently deceased John Mahoney, as well as early appearances of Dylan McDermott (of ""The Practice"" and ""American Horror Story""), Tobin Bell (Jigsaw in the Saw franchise) and Joshua Malina (Pres. Siebert on ""The Big Bang Theory"").",In the Line of Fire
7,jboothmillard,In the Line of Fire,7,15 March 2005,"I remember watching this film during my time at college, this was a long time ago, so with the leading actor's 90th birthday coming up, I felt it was the perfect time to watch it again, directed by Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot, The NeverEnding Story, Outbreak, Air Force One). Basically, Secret Service Agents Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) and Al D'Andrea (Dylan McDermott) meet with members of a counterfeiting group at a marina. The group's leader, Mendoza (Saw's Tobin Bell), tells Horrigan that he has identified D'Andrea as an undercover agent, and forces him to prove his loyalty by shooting D'Andrea. After firing the empty gun, Horrigan shoots and kills Mendoza's men, identifies himself as an agent, and arrests him. Horrigan investigates a complaint from a landlady (Elsa Raven) about an apartment's absent tenant. On the wall are many photographs and newspaper articles on famous assassinations and a Time cover with the President's head circled. When Horrigan and D' Andrea return later, only one photograph remains, it shows a much younger Horrigan standing behind President John F. Kennedy in Dallas on the day of his assassination in 1963. Horrigan is the only remaining active agent from that day, and since then he has been wracked with guilt over his failure to react quickly to the first shot, for not shielding Kennedy from the subsequent fatal bullet. This guilt drove Horrigan to drink excessively and his family eventually leaving him. Horrigan receives a phone call from the tenant, who calls himself ""Booth"" (John Malkovich). He tells Horrigan that he plans to kill the President (Jim Curley), who is running for re-election and is scheduled to make many public appearances around the country. Despite his age, Horrigan asks to return to the Presidential Protective Detail, where he begins a relationship with fellow agent Lilly Raines (Rene Russo). Booth, even though he is aware that his calls are being traced, continues to call Horrigan as part of his ""game"". He mocks Horrigan's failure to protect Kennedy but calls him a ""friend"". One such call is traced to be a phone booth from Lafayette Park, he escapes Horrigan and D'Andrea, but unknowingly leaves fingerprints in the process. The FBI matches the prints, but his identity is classified, so they cannot disclose it to the Secret Service. The FBI does notify the CIA. At a campaign event in Chicago, Horrigan is suffering from a cold. There, Booth pops a decorative balloon, which Horrigan mistakes for a gunshot. Because of this error, he is removed from the protective detail by Chief of Staff Harry Sargent (Fred Thompson) and head of security detail Bill Watts (Gary Cole), but he is left in charge of the Booth case. Horrigan and D'Andrea are told by the CIA that Booth has been identified as Mitch Leary, a former assassin who has suffered a mental breakdown. Leary has already killed several people as he prepares for the assassination. He uses his model-making skills to build a zip gun to evade metal detectors and hides the bullets and springs in a keyring. D'Andrea tells Horrigan he has been suffering nightmares about the Mendoza incident and plans to retire, but Horrigan dissuades him, saying he needs his help. After another taunting phone call, Leary is traced to a hotel, and Horrigan and D' Andrea chase him across Washington rooftops. Jumping from roof to roof, Horrigan hangs on the edge, Leary helps him, but taunts him that he has an opportunity to kill him. Horrigan cannot bring himself to kill Leary, risking falling to his own death, Leary swings him to safety, then shoots and kills D'Andrea. Horrigan asks Raines to reassign him to the protective detail when the President visits Los Angeles, but another mistake involving a bellboy forces him to leave detail once again. At the airport, Horrigan connects Leary to a bank employee's murder and discovers that, with a large campaign contribution, is among the guests at a campaign dinner. Leary prepares his weapon to shoot the President as he passes him. But Horrigan makes it in time to jump in front of the approaching President, as the assassin fires, saving the President's life. The President is quickly removed by the Secret Service, while Horrigan, wearing a bulletproof vest, is taken by Leary to the hotel's external elevator. Horrigan uses his earpiece to tell Raines and sharpshooters where to aim. They miss, but Leary winds up hanging outside the elevator. Horrigan tries to save Leary, but the would-be-assassin chooses to fall to his death. Horrigan, now a hero, retires, as his fame makes it impossible for him to do his job. He and Raines listen to a farewell message from Leary on Horrigan's answering machine, they leave to visit the Lincoln Memorial. Also starring John Mahoney as Sam Campagna, Gregory Alan Williams as Matt Wilder, Sally Hughes as the First Lady and John Heard as Professor Riger. Eastwood gives a compelling and convincing performance as the vulnerable aging former bodyguard turned agent, and Malkovich is terrific as the obsessive master-of-disguise villain who continually provokes the hero with threats. You could argue it is perhaps more often chatty than action-packed and pacey, and it is a little laggy at times, but it gets exciting when it needs to, it is much more about the interactions between the agent and his adversary, an interesting and worthwhile political action thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay. John Malkovich was number 59, and Clint Eastwood number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Malkovich was number 53 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and Eastwood was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!",In the Line of Fire
8,ccthemovieman-1,Malkovich Steals The Show,8,9 October 2006,"Here's another entertaining Clint Eastwood action-suspense film. I am not a particularly fan of his but I have to hand to him: he knows how to make entertaining movies. This is one more example. It didn't hurt, either, to have John Malkovich as his co-star. Now there is an intense actor! In this story, Malkovich plays an assassin, and he is fascinating to watch, thanks to his different disguises and the terrific dialog he was given. He also has a interesting voice.Rene Russo is fairly low-key (for her), but that's fine and Eastwood plays the usual loner-cop role, not appreciated by his superiors but showing them all up in the end. I guess he couldn't stop playing the ""Dirty Harry""-type figures, but he played them well.There were some negatives this film, however, namely: credibility in parts as there were a couple of times, had this been real-life, the killer would have done away with Eastwood. The climatic scene, in particularly, had too many holes in it. There also were too many abuses of Lord's name in vain in here.Overall, however, this is good, escapist fare.",In the Line of Fire
9,rmax304823,Satisfactory Condition,7,28 April 2002,"This is another of Eastwood's many movies mixing intrigue, action, and a dollop of romance, along with ""The Gauntlet,"" ""Firefox,"" and so forth. Clint's acting range by now is pretty familiar. In this one, he's taciturn and a bit outrageous, especially with women and superiors. There are no surprises in his performance. But the film itself is something of a surprise; it's above average. Clint is Frank, a Secret Service agent who, perhaps in a moment of doubt, failed to catch the bullet that killed JFK. He then took to drink, which drove his family away, and now plods along in the bureaucracy until he is contacted by John Malkovitch, calling himself ""Booth,"" who strikes up a sort of skewed relationship with him based on their shared, disillusioned conviction that everything is meaningless except the impulse to escape dreariness and predictability. Now, this is rather an anfractuous set of attitudes for a performer like Clint to project, but he does rather well, less robotic than usual. And he does seem to carry around with him, like a burden of stone, the memory of that moment in Dallas. He's tested again halfway through this movie. He is hanging from the roof of a tall building, grasping Booth's hand, and he pulls his pistol and points it at Booth, who asks him if he is really willing to shoot. If he does, of course, he saves the president from an attempted assassination by a CIA-trained murderer, but he does so at the cost of his own life. Booth twits him about the situation as they hold hands in midair. Later Clint even has a short speech, talking to Renee Russo, about his failure to save the president in Dallas. ""If I'd have reacted quickly enough, I could have taken that shot . . . and that would have been alright with me."" It's underplayed, but his voice chokes slightly, his eyes water, and his lip trembles. It's one of the few scenes in any of Clint's films that might properly be called ""moving."" We know from his newfound resolve that given another chance he would take the bullet this time. (The irony is that he doesn't like the current president. Who could? He gives pompous speeches in Colorado about how they ""carved a nation out of the wilderness."" Didn't they do the same thing in Las Vegas?)It's often said that a movie is only as good as its villain. It isn't true, nothing is that simple, but an argument could be made for its truth value in this case. The reptilian John Malkovitch with his Tartar eyes is marvelous.Talk about disillusioned. Okay, he can ham it up a little, sniffing with disdain even as he plugs two innocent hunters between the eyes, but he's fascinating on the screen. Renee Russo has little do to. Fred Thompson, as the chief White House aid, is now back in politics, a relief for movie-goers. If Clint's acting range is limited, Thompson's is something less. In every film he's been in, he wears the same solemn and dissatisfied expression, as if constantly plagued by some form of volcanic digestive disorder.The direction by Wolfgang Peterson is as good as it was in ""Das Boot,"" which is pretty good. There is a great deal of the usual suspenseful cross-cutting in the final shootout. And when Clint and Russo fall into an impassioned embrace in her hotel room and scuttle backwards towards the bed like two weasels in heat, Peterson playfully shows us their feet along with a succession of objects dropping to the floor -- not only the usual garments but handcuffs, guns, beepers, palm pilots, Dick Tracy wrist watches and other impedimenta. Interrupted, Clint lies back on the bed and sighs, ""Now I have to put all that stuff back on again.""Well written and worth watching.",In the Line of Fire
10,Tweekums,A cat & mouse thriller where Eastwood must thwart a would be assassin,8,30 July 2018,"Protagonist Frank Horrigan is a Secret Service agent who was unable to protect President Kennedy thirty years previously... now he is determined to prevent another president being assassinated. An assassin, calling himself Booth after Lincoln's killer, has made personal contact with Horrigan telling him that he intends to kill the current president. Horrigan and his partner are transferred back to the presidential protection detail and set about trying to identify Booth; it won't be easy though; everybody who has seen him remembers somebody different thanks to his propensity for disguise. Intertwined with the scenes of Horrigan and the Secret Service's search for the killer we see Booth making his preparations. He makes a composite pistol that can pass through security scanners, makes large political donations to get an invite to a presidential campaign dinner and eliminates those who could endanger his plan... apart from Horrigan who he wants to keep in the game.This thriller features Clint Eastwood on fine form as Frank Horrigan. It is refreshing to have an action lead who is getting on in years and not at the peak of fitness... he even wheezes as he runs alongside the presidential limousine... of course he still fit enough when it matters. John Malkovich also impresses as Booth; again he isn't an obvious tough guy but he makes the character feel dangerous... this sense of danger is only increased when we learn who he really is and what he used to do. Rene Russo is also solid as agent Lilly Raines who inevitably gets romantically linked with Horrigan. The story moves at a good pace; I liked how Horrigan and Booth's paths crossed as well as how their stories were intertwined before the final confrontation. Director Wolfgang Petersen did a fine job keeping the tension high throughout. There is a decent amount of action; this is realistic low level action; the occasional shooting, a couple of chases and a fight or two rather than drawn out car chases and exploding helicopters that often features in such films. Overall a really solid thriller that fand of the genre should really enjoy.",In the Line of Fire

Colorful and appropriate cinematography by John Bailey . The motion picture waas well directed by Wolfgang Petersen, from casting to scripting the movie was notable and our director made a good job . Wolfgang first big hit was ¨Das Boot¨ , following ¨The NeverEnding Story¨, and going on Hollywood productions as ¨Shattered¨ , ¨Enemy mine¨ . And a series of disaster genre movies as ¨Outbreak¨(1995) about the outbreak of a killer virus. This film had shades of an Irwin Allen disaster movie, The Swarm (1978), about the outbreak of killer bees. Both films had the military and scientists clash, also both had choppers all over the place. Then came ¨Air Force One¨ (1997), about terrorists taking over the presidents plane. This film had shades of a 1970s Airport disaster film . ¨The Perfect Storm¨ (2000) came next, and while the script about a boat at sea in a storm was okay, the constant fake looking computer generated sea water damaged the film. And then came ¨Poseidon¨ (2006) that was Petersen's worst action/disaster movie by a long way, dealing with a passenger ship turning over at sea. Outbreak just hinted at being an Irwin Allen remake , but with Poseidon Petersen failed at boxoffice , it was now official this was a remake of Allen's The Poseidon Adventure . Rating : 7/10 . Better than average . Well worth watching . The flick will appeal to Clint Eastwood fans .",In the Line of Fire
12,moonspinner55,Unimportant popcorn thriller...execrably staged,5,17 December 2010,"Slightly over-the-hill Secret Service Agent for the U.S. President is contacted over the phone by a would-be assassin who baits the team-veteran with knowledge of his spotty success record; it all leads to a showdown in Los Angeles where the President is campaigning for re-election. Cat-and-mouse thriller stars Clint Eastwood as the raspy-voiced, piano-playing hero who doesn't seem to have anyone backing him up. This film, in fact, makes the Secret Service unit look especially inept. When a fellow agent tells Eastwood, ""You have to give the rest of us some credit"", it's rather a laughable request since there is never an agent around (besides Eastwood and his partner) when one is needed. As the disguise-laden psychotic, John Malkovich trots all over the country without hesitation, and is always in the right spot (undetected) at the right time. Talking in an intentionally wet, mushy voice (like a rejected homosexual), Malkovich doesn't give us a new spin on the proverbial villain/nutcase role, and the feeble attempts to flesh out his character with background information just makes things worse. Eastwood is more affable than usual, but the unimaginative screenplay from Jeff Maguire features a rote finale and some especially ludicrous lines of dialogue. ** from ****",In the Line of Fire
13,Quinoa1984,the not-quite Dirty Harry for the 90s; a sinister blockbuster,8,9 February 2007,"Wolfgang Peterson's In the Line of Fire is cunning and occasionally a truly white-knuckled ride, even if once or twice we might feel like we've been down similar roads before. How could one not when Clint Eastwood, right after (allegedly) closing the book on his western legacy, likely closes the one on his gritty detective pictures (don't count Blood Work in there). But there's more than that because Eastwood's character, here a hard-bitten, demon-ridden and hard as nails secret service agent, has a slightly charming side to him, even the more romantic side that one never got to see in the pictures where he spouted his trademark lines. There is some complexities going on here that don't rely on just the usual swagger, and it's note-worthy for how such a possibly contrived back story (didn't save Kennedy from being assassinated in 63) is made somewhat believable amidst the rest of his persona, which more than likely hides his wounds- most of the time. Eastwood goes to town to make himself a great presence in the film, however, and under the circumstances the character seems tailor made for him.But there would be the risk of his part in the movie being slightly conventional (we still get the 'Harry' type scenes of him being smarter- and as smart-ass- over everyone else in the room, and being scolded and told to back off by the top brass, here a chief of staff), including here protecting a president that (wisely) we never really see or know at all. Even the romantic sub-plot, which is sort of undercooked if there for some machismo laughs, would make the picture a little sub-par if the other quasi-Dirty Harry aspect didn't come into the picture: an indelible villain. This time there's some extra Hollywood suspense, however brillaintly intelligent suspense (almost smarter than the rest of the movie deserves), with the ""John Booth"" character, played in an Oscar nominated performance by John Malkovich, as someone who's described more as a predator than an assassin. There's ways this could go wrong with the Eastwood character, but Malkovich possibly trumps some of his former villain counterparts by being extremely cool and un-collected (there's that devastating, cringe-worthy scene where he kills the bank teller and her roommate), and as his past is revealed, there's still that element of 'what the hell is with this guy' that keeps the audience and Eastwood's agent guessing and extra paranoid. It's a classic Malkovich performance, quintessentially creepy and always measured in the level of insanity and professionalism.It's also, aside from the conventional points, just a sleekly made picture from Peterson and company, and they come pretty close to the spunky pulp realism of Don Siegel. But Peterson also has a couple of cinematic tricks up his sleeve that had me grinning at times; anytime someone puts in such a blatant but exciting homage to Vertigo- jumping from rooftop to rooftop, hero dangling from the ledge, the 'twist'- it still provides some shivers down my spine. There's also the phone conversations between Eastwood and Malkovich, where we see the depths of the cat and mouse game, probably another kick in the ribs to Hithcock. But in the end, even with all the excitement and brutal danger and crisp formalism in the climax, it's also a characters picture in some ways throughout, and everything is fairly realized to give the audience a fine amount to ponder over, at least in the suspense-movie sense. Eastwod's a great lead, Russo plays the female possible love-interest sincere and mature, and Malkovich is top of the pops. There's also a few notable supporting roles too, and a fine studio score in there. One of the better films of 1993.",In the Line of Fire

Of course, the award should have gone to Ralph Fiennes for his ingenious portrayal of Amon Goeth, in ""Schindler's List.""Malkovich torments Clint Eastwood on the phone regarding the latter's failure to fully protect the slain JFK in 1963. Since he is a technological genius, Malkovich is able to thwart any of the calls he makes to Eastwood, a really washed up Secret Service Agent.

It stars Clint Eastwood as Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan and John Malkovich as the former CIA agent and assassin Mitch Leary. Horrigan is the sole active-duty Secret Service agent remaining from the detail guarding John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, at the time of his assassination in 1963. Aside from Eastwood and Malkovich,the movie also stars Rene Russo, Dylan McDermott, Gary Cole, John Mahoney, and Fred Dalton Thompson.It was written by Jeff Maguire and directed by Wolfgang Petersen. In the storyline,Frank Horrigan is a U.S. Secret Service agent who keeps thinking back to November 22, 1963, when, as an agent hand-picked by President Kennedy, he became one of the few agents to have lost a president to an assassin.Thirty years later, psychotic Mitch Leary is stalking the current U.S. president running for re-election. He has spent long hours studying the psyche of Frank Horrigan, and he taunts Horrigan (feeling that there is a bond between them), telling him of his plans to kill the president. After his conversation with Leary, Horrigan makes sure he is assigned to presidential protection duty. Horrigan has no intention of failing his president this time around, and he is more than willing to take a bullet. But everything goes Leary's way -- he is smart and cagey and the president's aides refuse to alter the itinerary. As the election draws closer, Horrigan's chances to catch Leary look to be less and less a possibility, and he begins to doubt his own abilities -- both now and in the past, when Kennedy was murdered.But in the end,Horrigan redeems himself as he finally was able to protect the current U.S. president from the assassination attempt.Clint Eastwood delivers one of his finest performances as Frank Horrigan.Although the viewer gets a rendezvous of Dirty Harry in terms of being a flawed hero,how he solves the mystery and how he meets with the villain,he was able to allow the viewers to sympathize with him in terms of his doubts,psyche,frustration and need for redemption as a Secret Service agent.Kudos also goes to John Malkovich for his portrayal of a psychopath who definitely was both excellent and outstanding as a villain.Although the movie is both formulaic and predictable,both actors elevates this film about the US Secret Service into a superior thriller especially in their battle of wills.Also,the film is both smart and intelligent in the screenplay despite the fact that everyone knows what to expect in the end.Petersen direction is superb as it the movie never lacks tension nor suspense.If Top Gun is presents what the US Navy is all about,then In Line Of Fire does does it to the US Secret Service.",In the Line of Fire

The same government that trained me to kill trained you to protect.",8,9 July 2012,"In the Line of Fire is directed by Wolfgang Petersen and written by Jeff Maguire. It stars Clint Eastwood, John Malkovich, Rene Russo and Dylan McDermott. Music is scored by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by John Bailey.Veteran Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan (Eastwood) is pulled back into President protection duty when a deadly assassin, Mitch Leary (Malkovich), surfaces and announces his intention to kill the current incumbent of the Whitehouse. But Frank is feeling his age and he is haunted by his failure to stop the assassination of John F. Kennedy; and Leary knows this and uses it to toy with Horrigan's mindset.Good old fashioned thriller that we could do with more of these days, In the Line of Fire is a classic cat-and-mouse plot elevated to greater heights by Eastwood and Malkovich. Horrigan, a bastion of good with a determination to succeed and once again prove his worth, Leary, troubled but cunning and clever, it's a mental face off and the prize is not just the Presidents life, but also redemption. The script is sharp and the film hits its straps when Horrigan and Malkovich are in conversation, they have a definite link to each other, a common ground, even if Horrigan refuses to accept it. The writing shows intelligence and worth, with a Leary back story making him a scary uber villain. Russo always engages as fellow Secret Service Agent, Lilly Raines, her tender scenes with Eastwood well acted, while McDermott scores well but his character is one that features all too many times in cop/agent thrillers.Eastwood enjoys himself because he is asked to play himself, and the film is better for it, Malkovich, once again, proves he has few peers when it comes to playing off the chain baddies. 8/10",In the Line of Fire

If you can believe Clint Eastwood as a Jazz Pianist you might give this a Pass because it has much more going for it.There are a number of Suspenseful Set-Pieces and John Malkovich without doubt steals the Film from the One-Note Eastwood who really struggles delivering Lines at times and is unwatchable as He exchanges Loving Stares with Rene Russo. Overall, this is kept from sinking to Cringe inducing Territory by a Multi-Faced Malkovich that is as Creepy as they come. It moves along at a brisk pace and it needs too as it moves quickly from badly Written exchanges and exposition Scenes among Good Ol Boy Ballbusting and a predictable Sub-Plot with a Partner that is never fleshed out and comes across as totally Contrived.A Watchable Film that tries just a little too hard to be Heady, and the best of it outweighs those excruciating Filler bits and delivers an Entertaining, but Puffed-Up Piece of Product.",In the Line of Fire

Eastwood tends to be great, sometimes excellent. This goes for both his acting and his directing. They both hand in solid work here. The concept isn't bad, and the cat-and-mouse game works well. Malkovich performs rather well, and his and Eastwood's playing off each other adds to the film. I suppose this won't introduce anything new, really... but it never really claims to, nor needs to. It's two great actors, each playing a basic type of role that they have proved at other points in their careers that they can manage remarkably well, and with a magnificent director at the helm. Really, it's entertaining, well-done, and it just plain delivers. Editing and cinematography are good. Acting and character writing is, as well. The film manages to be suspenseful and intense, and if you let yourself, you will probably be entertained and engaged, even if there are superior films out there. The pacing is pretty much spot-on. I recommend this to any fan of the principal actors, the director and/or this type of film. 7/10",In the Line of Fire
22,view_and_review,Presidential,7,29 September 2015,"I wonder---has Clint Eastwood ever played a married man? I don't care to research it myself, but I'm sure there's a big time Eastwood fan out there that knows the answer. I've seen roughly a dozen Eastwood movies and he's never played a role in which he was married. Divorced or widowed, yes, but married, no.""In the Line of Fire"" is about an old divorced secret service agent named Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood). He's basically Dirty Harry but a secret service agent. He's gruff, mean, and a pain to everyone including his superiors.Way to show your range Eastwood.He is opposed by an intelligent, spurned, and determined assassin played by John Malkovich. Malkovich's character is determined to kill the president even if it costs him his life while Horrigan is determined to save the president even if it costs him his life. The game is on. The assassin is very good at this game and he engages Horrigan every chance he gets. Horrigan is also very good, but he's also very old. Too old to be believable in fact.Because Horrigan is single and so is his new coworker Lilly Raines (Rene Russo) there has to be a romantic connection between the two of them. Why else would you have a female secret service agent as attractive as Rene Russo? Ignore the age difference and the cringiness of a 63-year-old man humping a 39-year-old woman. Russo is a professional and it seems that her only roles are to be the female love interest (I'm just basing that off of the very few movies I've seen her in: ""Major League,"" ""Lethal Weapon 3,"" ""Tin Cup,"" and this movie).Malkovich made this movie watchable. His persona and voice seemed to fit well for a sociopath. Eastwood was Eastwood; the same gruff-voiced, deadpan, emotionless automaton he always plays. Russo was window dressing so there's no need to comment on her. Just in case it's unclear, I did like the movie. Sure, I liked it more in '93, but it still holds water as a decent suspense thriller.",In the Line of Fire

John Malkovich plays a man who is determined to assassinate the current president and once he finds out Eastwood's character was one of the men who was with JFK during his assassination he begins taunting Eastwood's character. Rather good movie, though it is made much better thanks to Eastwood and Malkovich's presence in the film. There is a bit of action in this one and some humor as well. The movie at times moves a bit slowly though, but it is nothing that is really going to detract from the movie a whole lot. Rene Russo also stars in this one and plays a love interest for Clint and plays an agent also looking out for the president, her and Clint's scene where they try to get intimate is one of the more humorous parts in the movie. There is also an interesting scene in which Malkovich makes a rather unique gun capable of evading detection and it all leads up to a rather thrilling conclusion. A very good end to the film to say the least. Malkovich was up for an academy award for his role as the would be assailant, but the award ended up going to Tommy Lee Jones for his role in the ""Fugitive"".

The case gets cracked, the assassin makes his attempt, there's a hostage standoff in and around the Bonaventure hotel (nice to see it like this in a movie) and Eastwood - who up until this point was best at scowling and slamming phones - actually becomes a sympathetic character.I don't know if I want to sit through it again, but all that back-end action is enough to leave me (almost) satisfied.6/10",In the Line of Fire
27,JamesHitchcock,One of the more intelligent political thrillers of the nineties,7,29 December 2006,"In the cinema, as in most areas of life, one occasionally comes across some strange coincidences. Two years after ""Dances with Wolves"", one of the two great Westerns of the early nineties, Kevin Costner, its director and star, appeared in ""The Bodyguard"", a film about a former Secret Service agent named Frank who is haunted by guilt following the assassination attempt on President Reagan and who now has to try and prevent another assassination. A year after the other great Western of the early nineties, ""Unforgiven"", its director and star Clint Eastwood appeared in ""In the Line of Fire"", a film about a Secret Service agent named Frank who is haunted by guilt following the assassination of President Kennedy and who now has to try and prevent another assassination.There are, of course, differences between the two films. In ""The Bodyguard"" Costner's character, Frank Farmer, has left the Secret Service and now works as a private bodyguard for a female showbiz star. Eastwood's character, Frank Horrigan, still works for the Service. Whereas Farmer is still a comparatively young man, Horrigan is an elderly man approaching retirement, worried about whether he is still physically fit enough to cope with the demands of the job. (Eastwood was sixty-three at the time). Just as ""Unforgiven"" was Eastwood's final entry in the Western genre in which he made his name in the fifties and sixties, so he seemed to be using ""In the Line of Fire"" and ""A Perfect World"" (made in the same year) as his farewell to the cop thriller, another genre which he had come to make his own in the seventies and eighties.In ""In the Line of Fire"", Horrigan must thwart a plot to murder the current President by an assassin. There is also a sub-plot about a growing romance between Horrigan and a younger female colleague, Lilly Raines. (Rene Russo, thirty-nine at the time the film was made, was often regarded in the nineties as one of Hollywood's ""glamorous older women"", but this did not prevent her from being cast here as the love-interest of a man old enough to be her father).This may seem like the plot of an ordinary political thriller. Although there is plenty in the way of thrills and excitement, it is raised above the level of the ordinary by Wolfgang Petersen's taut direction and by the standards of acting, particularly the duel between Eastwood and John Malkovich as the assassin, who calls himself ""Booth"", after the murderer of President Lincoln. Unlike the real John Wilkes Booth, however, this man is no political fanatic. He is a psychopathic former CIA operative named Leary with no ideological motive for killing the President, who always remains an anonymous figure. (We never learn whether he is a Republican or Democrat, or even his name). Leary's motivation seems to be taedium vitae, a belief in the purposelessness of life and a desire for notoriety at all costs, even the cost of his own life, and he gets a thrill out of taunting Horrigan (to whom he has announced his intention to assassinate the President) and playing psychological mind-games with him. He knows that Horrigan's weakness is his sense of guilt stemming from the Kennedy assassination, and plays on it ruthlessly. Malkovich plays him as intelligent but unhinged, at times insinuating, at others raving, and he contrasts strongly with Eastwood's decent but haunted Horrigan. The result is one of the more intelligent political thrillers of the nineties, on a par with Eastwood's later effort, ""Absolute Power"". 7/10",In the Line of Fire

Thirty years later, a psychotic and loner named Mitch ""Booth"" Leary (John Malkovich) threatens the life of the current President, and Horrigan decides to confront his past and protect the President at all costs.This movie is full of edge-of-your-seat excitement as Horrigan tries to track down Leary, and is an fascinating roller coaster ride in every scene involving the President, making you wonder if danger will strike.I think the acting was superb, and I especially liked the chemistry between Clint and Rene Russo, whose character understands Horrigan. She gives the film the right amount of drama where appropriate. Arrogance never sits well with me, which is why I despised Gary Cole's character, Bill Watts. If Clint would have knocked him a few rounds, this film would have been a more satisfying viewing pleasure. In addition to the intensive thrills and drama, this movie could have used some more action scenes - lots of all talk and no action, But, what made up for it is the high-tension climax.Overall, a pretty fascinating thriller with some of Eastwood's best work.Grade B",In the Line of Fire
30,sddavis63,Decent Cat And Mouse Game With Some Flaws,6,28 February 2015,"Leads Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich were both very good in this. As Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan and potential presidential assassin Mitch Leary they play an interesting enough cat and mouse game. The back story has Horrigan as the last surviving member of the detail on duty when President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. Already tormented by the memory, he's tormented further by Leary, who toys with him as he openly shares his plan. That interplay is well done, but it does seem to drag on for too long, perhaps because Leary's motive in tormenting Horrigan wasn't especially clear. Why so much obsession with Horrigan? I never really understood that. Why not just seek out the chance to assassinate the president? Another point I wasn't clear on is why Horrigan - clearly aging and out of shape - would be put back on the presidential protection team, against the wishes of the head of the detail? It moves the story forward but honestly makes no sense.The weakest part of the movie revolved around agent Lilly Raines, played by Rene Russo. Russo's performance was fine, but the character didn't hit home with me - especially when a ""quasi"" romance between Raines and Horrigan was introduced. Why do that? The age difference made it unlikely to say the least. It doesn't really move the story forward at all, but it does seem to detract a bit from the character's credibility. I mean, I can understand Horrigan's interest. Russo is lovely. But I couldn't wrap my head around why Raines would be the least bit interested.After playing the cat and mouse for a couple of hours, it all leads up to an exciting enough climax. All the performances here are fine, but the story seemed to me to be a bit lacking in some ways. (6/10)",In the Line of Fire

33,Robert_duder,Eastwood nails a nineties thriller and makes it a classic,8,18 March 2008,"I admit I have a biased opinion on this film. First of all I am an Eastwood fanatic...I love the man...he's amazing. I am also a Kennedy fanatic so the content of the film made it even more interesting to me because they did an incredible job of using The Kennedy Assassination as a back story to this one. Still the film is really well done and technically speaking done on a relatively low budget considering some of the shots they create. But if you watch the special features on the film you'll see that they used a lot of computer graphics to simulate casts of thousands, and used old Bill Clinton speech crowds for their President speech crowds. It's flawlessly done and you'd never know it unless you were really looking. The film is not about the backdrop, it's a character study from two very different perspectives. You have an aging Secret Service agent, divorced, left alone, alcoholic, constantly haunted by the fact that he was too slow to save President Kennedy in 1963. He doesn't whip himself into shape...he's old...and he looks old and acts tired and that is exactly what he is. Then you have the flip side of the coin where you have an angry, driven, assassin trained by the United States who wants nothing more than to give his life to end the President's life. It's cat and mouse, and it's psychological and just really interesting to watch.Clint Eastwood is a god. I mean the man never changes his performances much...his performance in In The Line of Fire as secret service agent Frank Horrigan is a more tired and broody version of Dirty Harry but somehow he does something with his characters. You see something in his eyes where he just draws you into his character and makes you believe it and become a part of it and that's exactly what he does here. He has unparalleled screen presence! John Malkovich, who I am rarely a fan of, is incredible as the creepy and disturbed killer Mitch Leary. He is a master of disguise and that is no figure of speech because he has to change his appearance so drastically and so many times and does it realistically and amazingly!! On top of that so much of his performance is done over the phone or just his voice and he creates this incredible character that you almost feel compassion for at times. Best of all his character and Eastwood's character have incredible chemistry and are the perfect adversaries. A statement commonly made but I could have done without Rene Russo. Her character didn't have a lot of depth or reason other than as a rather ridiculous love interest for Eastwood's Horrigan and the two of them didn't really go very well together anyways. Russo had this habit in the nineties of showing up with every leading man you could possibly think of. This is one performance that was unnecessary.Director Wolfgang Petersen definitely has a talent for combining action with a really good story that draws you in. I think he is probably one of the more intelligent action directors given films like Air Force One, this one, and Troy...I was NOT a fan of his Poseidon remake but every great artist stumbles sometime. In the Line of Fire is just simply a great cat and mouse mystery, thriller with a little bit of action and other than the love interest they don't try to force Eastwood to be younger than he is because his character calls for a world weary character and that is what he is. Some definite edge of your seat moments mixed with a really good story and if you haven't seen it you'll wanna check it out because it is definitely worthwhile!! 8/10",In the Line of Fire
34,ElMaruecan82,"A close-to-perfect thriller, on both a psychological and action level",9,29 October 2016,"On the surface, Wolfgang Petersen's thriller seems (""seems"" underlined) to borrow elements from many cop thrillers: you've got the rugged and wore-down veteran with 'one failing mission' in the past to forever haunt him, a newly assigned sidekick and soon-to-be-love-interest, a nemesis efficient in being suavely creepy and even the Kennedy assassination to provide some realistic backstory. So, if you saw the ""Dirty Harry"" movies, ""The Day of the Jackal"", ""Die Hard"" and ""JFK"", ""In the Line of Fire"" will look familiar, only it doesn't, and it even manages to look fresh, original and irresistibly gripping. Anyone can be original, when you think about it, but making something new out of familiar elements, now that's a remarkable stunt to achieve. The credit goes to a few guys, but I won't start with the obvious ones. As a graduate in screen writing, I'm fascinated and enthralled by good scripts, and I believe these ones provide readings that are as exciting as novels or as watching the film itself. So, I never really bought that this film's script was worth an Oscar nomination, but one viewing in the 90's obviously made me overlook a few details. Watching the film again, it is an intelligently written movie, from Mr. Jeff Maguire.All right, you have a former Kennedy bodyguard who obviously failed in that sunny November Day in 1963, and a former CIA agent who plans to kill the President, but look how progressively the film gets deeper in these two characters, Frank Horrigan and Mitch Leary, both wonderfully played by Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich. It's not ex-bodyguard versus ex-CIA, it's more than that.You a man whose job consists on protecting and one whose job is to kill, but that's not all, these guy's professionalism rely on their willingness to give their own lives, it's obvious for the villain, but not much for the hero. The masterstroke of the plot is the way it dodges the phone-tracking device and allows them to engage in deep phone calls revealing that they have more in common than what they think, or what Frank thinks.Nourished by a similar patriotism, Frank and Leary are like the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde of America, and it all comes down to one question: how far would they go to achieve their destiny? And just when you think this is going too psychological, the script finds a way to confront these two living contradictions not through a conversation or a phone call, but through an action sequence. Let's not forget it's a thriller.The heart-pounding chase sequence culminates with the killer saving the life of the protector but who could have killed the killer; only it would have meant his own death. As Leary comments after, ""the irony is so thick you can choke on it"". The film is never overwritten, all these talkative moments are like the Greek chorus to a drama magnificently operated by two men, drama in the Greek meaning of the word: action. It's a cat-and-mouse, 'mano a mano' chase between two guys who will only come full circle with themselves at the end. We're absorbed by Eastwood's toughness, vulnerability and even little touch of self-derision, especially in his scenes with Rene Russo (who's more than the obligatory love interest) and by Leary, an efficient crossover between the Jackal, Hans Gruber and Hannibal Lecter.This is one helluva villain from a rightfully Oscar-nominated Malkovich, sociopathic, professional killer, master of disguise, as meticulous and perfectionist as a bottle boat builder. And it's because Leary has the edge over Frank that I loved watching Frank, trying to spot him, to predict his move and to eventually succeed, but the end is more important than the journey.In fact, I almost had a reservation about the way Leary waited a little before killing Frank. I thought this was a case of villain monologue and reading Roger Ebert, the late critic, who gave three and half stars to the film, admitted that there was no way such a killer would go to the higher place, instead of just running away. So, I watched the scene again, and from the way these two men were played, there was nothing gratuitous. Leary was willing to die after his failed mission, prison wasn't an option, and that makes sense. Secondly, there is no villain monologue, at that time, Leary knows he's just made Frank a hero, he saved his soul, his name, and wants respect before terminating him. It's easy to overlook that moment because we're focused on the double communication trick, another smart and creative bit from the writer.Frank is talking to Leary, while in fact, giving orders to Lilly (Rene Russo), but if we put ourselves in Leary's mind at that moment, we understand there's bitterness for having failed but the satisfying consolation to have at least contributed to Frank's redemption. All through the film, Leary made a point of having spared Frank's life, even saving him, so even Frank's ultimate victory belongs to Leary.But you've got to wonder why a man who was so ruthless and flawless in his mission, never cut that loose end named Frank. The key is in his nickname ""Booth"", Leary doesn't admire Oswald, but Booth, a comedian with panache. Leary, like all the men who believe they have a destiny, creates his own narrative, and given how this President is not of JFK's caliber, Leary needs Frank, for the kick of it. When you think about it, if the villain was 100% professional, there would be no movie, and we would have been deprived from one of the most unforgettable villains of the 90's.

35,MOscarbradley,Workmanlike rather than inspired.,6,1 July 2019,"More workmanlike than truly inspired, ""In the Line of Fire"" is, nevertheless, a good if fairly obvious thriller about a presidential assassin. He's played by John Malkovich and he's targeting, not just the President, but one of his bodyguards who also happened to be one of the bodyguards on duty the day Kennedy was assassinated. He's Clint Eastwood and this might have been a better movie had Eastwood directed it instead of just acting in it. The actual director was Wolfgang Petersen and he doesn't do anything here that's distinctive; everything he does is in service of the script. What gives the film its edge is Malkovich whose sly, scene-stealing performance earned him an Oscar nomination. Others in the cast, (Rene Russo, Dylan McDermott, John Mahoney, Gary Cole), are largely wasted.",In the Line of Fire

This allows our hero to feel incredibly genuine and for each action scene to seem extra difficult, not to mention extra dangerous. The plot itself is quite nuts-and-bolts, with the piece's attempts to hide the identity of its villain all but ruined by the actor's iconic voice, but it includes a palpable sense of tension towards its climax and it's also constantly forward-moving to the point of, at times, pure excitement. 7/10",In the Line of Fire

Not only was he in an action movie, he did very well. I really enjoyed the film from start to finish because of Eastwood and the villain played by John Malkovich.This is about an aging Secret Service guy who is haunted by his past. That past urges him to keep the current President safe at all costs with election nearing. Even if that means playing a cat-and-mouse game with someone who wants to kill the President.As I said previously, Eastwood did very well. Even better is John Malkovich. I can't decide on who plays the better villain, Malkovich or Gary Oldman. But anyway, Malkovich is very creepy as the villain.Overall, this is a top-notch thriller.

The movie even supplies Clint with two partners.However, despite the routine plot, In The Line Of Fire is not a rehash or retread of something we have seen before and it's not predictable (OK some of it is) what it is, is a tight, tense, well acted, well directed thriller, and whilst most action/thrillers these days are about stunts and action. In Tue Line Of Fire has a brain, and it sits in my Top 10 Eastwood movies. In my review of The Rookie, I also said a movie is only as good as their villains, and In the Line of Fire has a great one in John Malkovic, who was deservedly nominated for an Oscar. The one aspect of the movie I didn't like was the love story between Cline (62) and Rene Russo (39) it was totally unbelievable and out of place. Clint was on a roll as In The Line Of Fire became Clint's biggest grossing movie to date, grossing $102 million dollars at the domestic box office to end the year as the 7th highest grossing movie of 1993.

The film has Clint Eastwood as an ageing secret service agent and John Malkovich as a vengeful assassin pitted against each other in a massive test of wills and ingenuity, where the President's life is at stake. Unnecessary secrecy and competition between rival security agencies almost dooms the President, which is an authentic touch. This film was made when both Eastwood and Malkovich were at their peak. Probably Eastwood has never done a better job than he does here, and it is all so effortless for the old pro. There are some wonderful sound effects of him huffing and puffing as he runs along beside the President's car as a bodyguard, for which he is too old. I wonder if anyone else noticed the humour of those noises having been added. My 'guardian angel', whose name is Vigil, enjoyed this movie even more than I did, but then bodyguard movies are very much his thing. Rene Russo was a perfect choice for the female agent who falls for Eastwood, as she is so unobvious but so talented, and she shines. The tension is taut every inch of the way in this story, and the psychological struggles of Eastwood to redeem himself from an earlier protection failure are beautifully shown by his typical understated acting. With Eastwood, if he lifts an eyebrow by a millimeter, watch out! Of course, he is the master of the super-cool. Malkovich has the opportunity to indulge all the creepiness he could wish in the paranoid character he portrays, and he captures the man's central vanity to perfection.

48,jimbo-53-186511,A decent psychological thriller with some minor plotting problems,7,20 December 2015,"Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is still plagued with anxieties 30 years after the death of President Kennedy. Horrigan felt that he could have done more to try to prevent Kennedy from being assassinated and continues to blame himself for this tragic occurrence. 30 years later, Horrigan finds himself being taunted by a man who tells him that he is going to kill the president. In order to prevent another assassination, Horrigan sets to work in trying to discover the identity of the would be assassin whilst doing his utmost to protect the President.I've mentioned in my summary that there were some minor plotting problems with this film so I will address these issues first; it's established early in the film that Horrigan blames himself for Kennedy's death and sees this assassination attempt as a means to prove to himself, and to everyone else, that he can adequately protect the President. OK, that's fine, but I wasn't completely taken with the way that the story was set-up (it came across to me as Horrigan being on some kind of self-pitying guilt trip). This is only a minor problem because despite this Horrigan is still focused on the job at hand and therefore it's still very easy to develop a rooting interest in his character - I only wish the story would have been set-up in a different way. I also felt that Leary's (John Malkovich) motivations were a little thin and not entirely believable. The pacing of the film is also a little uneven. Now for the good bits....Where the film is at its strongest is in the various scenes between Horrigan and Leary. In these scenes, a slow-burning psychological battle of wits begins to develop between the two men (Leary clearly has the upper hand at the start, but Horrigan's dogged determination soon sees him begin to close the gap). Director Wolfgang Peterson makes many of these scenes cold and menacing by not showing all of Leary's face at the start - yes it's not original, but it's simple, effective and helps to create tension. The screenplay is also relatively clever and had enough intelligence and depth to make sure that my interest never truly waned.The performances across the board are variable, but once again it's John Malkovich that steals the show from everyone here. Malkovich is one of my favourite actors and his sociopathic performance here was wonderful to watch. Eastwood is also good here and I liked the way that the writers made his character feel believable - he was in his early 60's when this was made and therefore his character is human here rather than super human (he has heart problems and fitness issues) which makes sense given his age and his lengthy career in a somewhat stressful job.In The Line Of Fire is a very good film that is exciting, suspenseful and intense. There are also very few dull spots which isn't bad considering its running time.

A lot has been said for the main actors, and they deserve it. Eastwood, as the lead, serves as observer, so his lack of acting ability doesn't get in the way.

In one scene, this supposedly super assassin, an extremist at covering his tracks, kills two witnesses, yet leaves their barking guard dog alive.

In The Line Of Fire is his first American thriller at the highest level. Peterson broke out in 1981's Das Boot, the best German epic ever. The Neverending Story showed his versatility and In The Line Of Fire cemented his legacy and best-known genre to tackle: a political thriller. Only Wolfgang Peterson could have made a movie this exciting.I have no interest in politics, but I found this movie to be thoroughly engaging and very fun. It is about a Secret Service Agent (Eastwood) who is haunted by his failure to save John F. Kennedy. A psychotic madman (Malkovich) toys with him, saying he plans on assassinating the current president. Eastwood does a job well-done in acting, one of the best he's ever done (I'd say). But John Malkovich steals the show in every scene he's in. I'm surprised the American Film Institute didn't put him on their list of 50 Greatest Villains. He's sure better than some that made the cut.Many political thrillers aren't really interesting to me. There's too much talk about the different parties and subjects that only avid news watchers would like. In The Line Of Fire is about battling a hit-man. The political bit don't get in the way at all. Since there's many subplots about the characters that tie together very well, the strength makes it outweigh most other flicks like this. To top it all off, Wolfgang Peterson gives us a picture with a direction that only the best can do. Any perilous thriller like this is a sure winner, but Peterson does more. He treats Malkovich's character like an actual monster. Similar to what John Carpenter did with Michael Myers in the original Halloween, we do not really see Malcovich's character into part way through the movie. He uses lighting and camera tricks to keep him a mystery, a thing. After a while, at the right point, he had to have been shown. Does Peterson stop his clever tricks? No. That is just when they begin.3/4",In the Line of Fire

Well, good guys if you don't mind trampling The Constitution from time to time.Anyway, fast forward to the 90s. Eastwood's coming off the incomparable Unforgiven. Sure he has an Oscar on his fireplace mantel, but he's still gotta work for a living. So he sees this script and right away can see that he can pull it off in his sleep. Tough guy who can get ''punks like that off the street"" no matter what it takes.Granted, the 90s version of this character has a sense of humour. And a bit more of a winning twinkle. I don't remember there being any love interests in the original series, so Rene Russo in a pantsuit is a nice addition.

58,PredragReviews,"""All we have is the game. I'm on offence, you're on defence.""",9,13 June 2016,"The teaming up of Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich was the idea of, what can I say, a mad genius! The two along side each other convey a bitter and chilling relationship that keeps you in suspense all throughout the movie. Though I must say Malkovich, as always conveys the most noticeable character and achieves it well as the sick and twisted but clever assassin Mitch Leary, who attempts to ruin the life of the American President's bodyguard - Frank Horrigan (Eastwood). Horrigan is determined to protect the President's life no matter what - even if it means being In The Line of Fire for him, because of his fail at protecting John F. Kennedy's life thirty years before hand. With the odd funny moment and sparks of romance this film is great entertainment for those who like fast, hot action.The movie was very intense and a great cat and mouse game between Eastwood and Malkovich ensues, as the villain taunts our hero Horrigan, of mistakes made in the past. A great supporting cast, Rene Russo, Dylan McDermott, John Mahoney. I really thought the performance by Malkovich richly deserved the best supporting actor for his role as Mitch Leary.. but alas. The script is slightly cheesy with love interests, a last gasp attempt to resolve situations and defying the odds. Though these elements usually ruin pictures, the direction and performances are enough to save the film. The action sequences are well thought out, particularly the roof top chase and the scene in the lift. The fact this film doesn't overdo the action is an added bonus and is kept solid and consistent through Peterson's direction. If you are not a political person then there is no fear as this is none educational, more of an action and dramatic styled refection on past politics. This is a shame however as this could have stepped up the ante of the plot and driven the film on a serious everyday issue but instead was used to build on Frank's personality, his lack of belief in himself, which ultimately leads to a fairly awful and cringing saving ending.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",In the Line of Fire
59,bandw,Gripping political thriller,8,30 July 2007,"I started watching this late at night thinking I would just watch the first half hour, but I got sucked in and wound up watching the whole thing. Maybe this movie absorbed me because I don't watch many thrillers and this was a change of pace, but it can get its hooks into you on several fronts.Early on two themes are set forth that are attention grabbers. One is the back-story of a secret service agent, Frank Horrigan, who was in the detail protecting President Kennedy at the time of Kennedy's assassination. We see Frank in a picture from the time of the assassination. Whenever we see such a picture it is hard not to wonder what the story is behind the people we see - how did they come to be there and what happened to them? Here we get the inside story on Frank. The second theme is that of presidential assassinations in general. That topic seems to be endlessly fascinating and the assassination of Kennedy is perhaps not even second to that of Lincoln in spawning speculation and controversy, even almost a half century on. Frank's story hooks us into Kennedy's assassination in a personal way that brings the event into focus in ways we have perhaps not thought deeply about. What if Frank had been successful in protecting Kennedy? How would things have been different? It's hard to resist being given an insight into Frank's personal involvement, even if fictional, in one of the most significant events of the 20th century.Clint Eastwood does a fine job in playing Frank as a man tortured by about as big a ""what if"" as anyone is ever likely to have to live with. One of the strengths of ""In the Line of Fire"" is that it delves fairly deeply into Frank's psychology. The main tool in exposing Frank's tortured soul is his being taunted by Mitch Leary (John Malcovitch), an eerily diabolical psycho intent on killing the president circa 1991. Malcovitch plays Leary so well, and with such creepy wickedness, that you begin to wonder what he is like in real life. Mitch has seized on tormenting Frank as a form of gamesmanship, feeling that both he and Frank have been let down by a government that they once were willing to die for. Questions are raised about the psychology of someone whose job it is to take a hit for a president, perhaps a president they don't even respect. I also liked the relationship that developed between Frank and his partner Lilly (Rene Russo). They may not be Bogart and Bacall but they have some well-written, sharp dialog that adds some spice to the movie.Then there is the aspect of going behind the scenes at the highest levels of power in the U.S. This hook is what drove the popularity of ""The West Wing"" for its seven-year run on TV and is well exploited here. We are even treated to Fred Thompson playing a duplicitous White House Chief of staff.The pacing is brisk, but the story is skillfully presented and there is never any difficulty in being able to follow what's going on. The director seems particularly adroit in being able to present chaotic scenes without losing the audience.",In the Line of Fire

62,pyrocitor,It's all in the execution (in more ways than one),5,26 January 2006,"In the Line of FireIt never fails to astound me how a decent premise for a film can be ruined upon execution of it. (pun not intended) This was what struck me about 'In the Line of Fire'. The concept sounded excellent - a grizzled secret service agent (Clint Eastwood), still haunted by memories of his inability to prevent the assassination of President Kennedy is now confronted by another madman (John Malkovich) who also claims he intends to dispatch the current president by force. But of course Clint isn't willing to let Malkovich off the president so easily this time, and becomes even more determined to track down the madman and stop him.But unfortunately, the interesting story didn't turn out nearly as well as an actual film. The film is frequently far too obvious when it should have been much more subtle, when explaining things such as how Eastwood's character reflects on whether he would have been willing to die for Kennedy and Malkovich's character's backstory as to why he wants the president dead so much. These would have worked much better if the filmmakers hadn't tried to beat the audience over the head with these plot points, making them much less interesting. Also, whoever decided to put 63 year old Clint Eastwood in a love scene with 39 year old Renne Russo can only be described as sick and twisted, not to mention the two of them falling in love seems ridiculous due to their age gap. (Clint's best seduction technique seems to be winking every 5 seconds, which gets extremely annoying after a brief while) But apart from the terrible script and oversimplified characters, I was also astonished at for a suspense film how little suspense 'In the Line of Fire' actually contained. Again, the concept of the killer constantly phoning the hero, taunting him with clues and hints as to what he's going to do next must have seemed more original when the film was released in 1993, but for today's audiences, who have seen the concept executed much better in films such as 'Speed' and later 'Phone Booth', it really isn't as interesting as the filmmakers seem to think. And the fight scene at the end between Malkovich and Eastwood was one of the film's greatest letdowns, and seems to mainly consist of rude pushing back and forth. Of course, the absurdly predictable plot leads up to the required happy ending, another eye-roller. Eastwood is completely wasted in the role of aged secret service agent Frank Horrigan, playing off his patented tough guy persona and nothing else. He isn't a complete letdown, but it isn't at all difficult to imagine a more enthusiastic lead for the film. Renee Russo is also given almost nothing to do as the far too young love interest for Eastwood's character, complete with cheesy dialogue (""I can't believe I'm doing this!"") and all. Dylan McDermott also has almost nothing to do other than yell a lot and look frightened as the necessary young naive partner to Eastwood's grizzled old mentor figure. It's Malkovich as the psychotic assassin who easily steals the film, coming across as genuinely creepy and chilling - his silky voice over the telephone was surprisingly off-putting. Overall, 'In the Line of Fire' comes across as a far too clichéd and predictable weak Hollywood action film and nothing more. There is almost no suspense created in the ""suspenseful"" sequences, and all the ""plot twists"" are far too predictable to ever be enjoyable. There is the occasional good element present (Malkovich's villain is a plus) but overall, there's no real reason to see ""In the Line of Fire"" - there are several other very very similar action movies that turned out much better.-5/10",In the Line of Fire
63,seymourblack-1,Haunted Horrigan Seeks Redemption,8,12 October 2014,"""In The Line Of Fire"" is a real crowd-pleaser that contains plenty of action, suspense and humour but also distinguishes itself from most similar thrillers because of its engaging plot, its well fleshed-out characters and its excellent dialogue. Its greatest asset, however, is its totally deranged villain who plans to assassinate the President. His dual with a tough but vulnerable secret service agent is at the heart of virtually everything that happens and provides the movie with much of its impetus as well as some interesting insights into the psychological preoccupations of the two men.Veteran secret service agent Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is haunted by the memory of the day in November 1963 when he was guarding President Kennedy but failed to save him from being assassinated. That incident left him doubting whether he had the courage needed to risk his own life to save the President's and the guilt that he'd suffered since led him to drinking too much and suffering the breakdown of his marriage. When he receives a phone call from a man who threatens to kill the President, Horrigan seizes the opportunity to return to the Presidential Protection Detail because doing so could offer him the chance to redeem himself.The potential assassin turns out to be a disillusioned ex-CIA agent called Mitch Leary (John Malkovich) who's very bitter about the way he'd been treated by the government and is seeking to take revenge by killing the President. He's obviously read a great deal about Horrigan's background and sees certain parallels in their experiences. Leary is very cool, clever and cunning and clearly has the ability to carry out his threat. He's also determined and recognises that he has ""a rendezvous with death"".In his new role, Horrigan starts a relationship with a fellow agent, Lilly Raines (Rene Russo) and also runs into trouble with the Presidential Chief Of Staff, Harry Sargent (Fred Dalton Thompson) who orders him off the Detail when he raises the alarm at one of the President's re-election rallies after mistaking the sound of a bursting balloon for a gun shot. Horrigan then takes matters into his own hands and pursues his quarry until they eventually confront each other in the movie's exciting climax.In a movie which is full of good performances, the contributions of Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich stand out. Frank Horrigan is something of a misfit among his colleagues due to his age, his sexism and his lack of fitness which becomes most apparent when he runs breathlessly alongside the President's car. He knows he's seen as a ""borderline burn-out with questionable social skills"" but also knows that his instincts are intact and despite being regarded as a dinosaur and being subjected to Leary's mind games, knows he has the experience and confidence to hunt down his adversary.Clint Eastwood, in one of his most subtle performances, strikes the perfect balance in portraying his piano-playing tough guy's interesting combination of strengths and weaknesses and John Malkovich is wonderfully creepy as the dangerous psychopath whose CIA training and brilliant use of disguises make him a formidable threat and just the type of top class villain that this superior thriller deserves.",In the Line of Fire

A formulaic suspense film, but it holds one's interest well and the characters are well-drawn and played.

65,Stampsfightclub,Malkovich shines in great crime thriller,8,18 December 2006,"on the narrative:.A fast energetic plot involving many engaging characters to make it consistent to conform to the thriller genre. Eastwood plays the part of the aging detective brilliantly as he is assigned to find an obsessed man who has his heart set on assassinating the president. At times there maybe too much information for viewers to contain with and it is a film where you must concentrate. However when focused it is really exiting with fast paced action, contrasts in characters, both good and evil. The sentimental values over the pasts of the characters are a great device to create emotion and I felt particularly touched at many points during the two hours. The beginning is sensational as viewers wonder who the villain is and what his agenda towards the president is. The plot remains consistent and very engaging throughout. There are many crime conventions encoded such as murder, robbery, violence, police and detective scenarios which all brilliantly from into this film. John Malkovich.The star of 'Dangerous Liaisons' brought such a powerful motive to this film as the evil cunning assassin that I was completely spellbound. Rarely have I seen a character of this creative charisma. Only Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the lambs matched this performance, the only difference in brilliance is that Malkovich didn't win an Oscar. Malkovich was simply amazing. His tone of voice, his attitude in being relaxed and yet inside frustrated made him a joy to watch from start to finish. The beginning is essential to the personality of his character. Viewers are not given a proper glimpse of him, only side glances through mirrors and binoculars which add to his tension and cunningness, making him one of my favourite villains of all time. Clint Eastwood (Dirty Harry) was also outstanding as the aging cop who also has a lot to contain with in his life as does Rene Russo in her role as the sophisticated secret agent. watch it if...you love the crime genre and mysterious villains",In the Line of Fire
66,KnightsofNi11,A decent political thriller,7,15 February 2011,"Suspense. History. Conspiracy. It's the perfect trifecta for your typical political thriller, which is what In the Line of Fire is. It's directed by Wolfgang Peterson, a German director who hit his highest mark in 1981 with Das Boot, a thrilling story about soldiers stranded in a German U-Boat during WWII. In the Line of Fire won't be the most memorable film you'll ever see, but it's a good film regardless. In it, Clint Eastwood plays Frank Horrigan, a long time member of the Secret Service who was alongside President John F. Kennedy when he was assassinated. Frank has always been haunted by this, and those fears really come back to life when a psychotic and elusive man named Mitch Leary, played excellently by John Malkovich, contacts him and tells him he plans on assassinating the current president. Frank makes it his mission to catch this nutcase and protect the president at all costs as he campaigns around the country. As a whole this movie falls just short of great, but still in the range of well worth watching.An entire movie from the perspective of the Secret Service agents is something I haven't seen much of, so that was one of the most interesting things about this film. Most of the characters in this film are given very human qualities, breaking the mold of the robotic, stoic Secret Service character stereotype. This is a film that shows the inner workings of the Secret Service and some of the conspiracy that goes on within the service. Eastwood's character makes the film the most interesting, as he is someone who wants to defend his own reputation and disprove the theories that he doesn't have what it takes anymore, while also showing undivided loyalty to protecting the president. He is obviously a man who has devoted his life to his job and also someone who, ever since that fateful day in Dallas 1963, has been trying to prove himself worthy and put his past behind him. Eastwood plays the character at just the right level of remorse, intensity, and respect.Undoubtedly the most interesting character of the film, however, is John Malkovich's Mitch Leary. His character is excellent and truly menacing. Malkovich is an odd looking guy, as we all know, and he uses his strange appearance to become much creepier for this role. He is the kind of subdued, passive-aggressive psychopath who you can never feel completely comfortable watching. His dialouge is written fantastically, riddle with double entendres, parallel structure, and darkly insightful proverbs. He makes for the best moments of the film and his character is what draws in most of the emotion of the film, especially alongside Eastwood and the relationship that develops between those two characters. Leary wants to be remembered and he wants to be written into history, never to be forgotten. He drags Frank into the mix in order to share his experience with someone else on the presidents side. He's a true psycho, making his character a lot of fun to watch operate.In the Line of Fire is a good movie, but when looked at in the overall spectrum of political thrillers, it isn't something very revolutionary or groundbreaking. The story is fun, despite some kinks such as a romantic subplot that is awkward and serves no real purpose to the main storyline. The characters are fun and their dialouge is written very well, making for a consistently exciting two hours of film. Eastwood and Malkovich are fantastic and the interactions between their characters are the most intriguing and interesting thing about this movie. But the movie seems to lack a certain umph that is needed to make a movie memorable. I don't regret watching the movie, but I feel like I'll forget about this one within a week. It's something different, fun, and an entertaining two hour escape.",In the Line of Fire

It is, however, the underlying basis for this excellent thriller. With Clint Eastwood as the aging secret agent and John Malkovich as the assassin stalking the President, ""In the Line of Fire"" is nonetheless a taut thriller that makes the most of the skills brought to the table by both of its principals. Eastwood is again the stalwart individualist and continues to be marvelously adept in that role. Malkovich is a splendid villain, who kills efficiently and without compulsion. The final portion of the movie in which the two confront one another at the scene of the intended assassination is executed with great skill and dramatic intensity. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Although it's impossible not to guess (correctly) that Eastwood's character will survive and get the girl, his co-agent played by Rene Russo, the implausibility and the clichés do nothing to undermine the action.

Their conversations usually terse and to the point to put it mildly. The understated romance between Clint's and Russo's characters was delicately handled and a pleasure to watch unfold.

Although the risk is real, sometimes it is overemphasized as if the security would have been often inefficient. Personally I doubt it. So the plot prepared by the director Wolfgang Petersen is just a good fiction for entertainment. The film has two good actors, Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich backed by that attractive lady, Rene Russo, whose charm is always present. Expressed in a simple way, this film was the hunt of a cat (Eastwood) against the intelligent mouse (Malkovich), where the latter wanted for unclear reasons to kill the president of USA. After so many efforts Eastwood saved the live of the president and caught the cat Malkovich. However, it was a curiosity to see how the bodyguards of the president moved and how they protected him, which confirmed me that it is not so easy for any killer to be so close to the president of USA.",In the Line of Fire

The language is particularly bad, so my house wont be watching it again-most films like this appear to show an america where everyone blasphemes and swears continually. Malkovich has the best part as the deranged killer.

Malkovich brings a cold, but very intelligent mindset to his character.  Everything he does, he does for a reason, and he's not shy about killing.  Eastwood has to overcome the suspicions of his superiors in order to catch Malkovich, but no one wants to listen to him.

78,DavidSim240183,Class act all the way,9,1 November 2007,"In the Line of Fire is not the first film to tackle political/presidential assassinations but its enlivened by the excellent ensemble cast director Wolfgang Petersen has assembled. I especially liked it because unlike most thrillers nowadays, it actually accomplished what it sets out to do. It had me thrilled from start to finish.Agent Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) was there when Kennedy was shot. November 22nd is a date that's haunted him every day since. Not only because he failed to save the President, but he failed to take the bullet meant for the President.In the 30 years since, Frank has battled a drinking problem, lingering doubts in his own abilities, and the pain of a divorced wife and daughter. But on the date of the current President's reelection, he receives a chilling message from an anonymous caller stating his intentions to kill the President. And so spurs Frank into action, not wanting another dead President on his conscience.I suppose In the Line of Fire isn't terribly original, but Wolfgang Petersen's sure touch and fine direction gives the film a considerable charge. And although he handles the thriller aspects well enough, he makes sure there are other forms of pleasure to be had from the film.Eastwood gets a love interest in the form of fellow agent Lilly Raines, played by Rene Russo. And she holds her own quite well against Eastwood. Their gentle flirtations are surprisingly involving considering the subject matter of the rest of the film. It's nice to see an action thriller for once taking something like that into consideration without it detracting from the main thrust of the story.Eastwood slides into the role of a grizzled, world-weary veteran agent with total ease. But what separates Frank Horrigan from another of Clint's Dirty Harry impersonations is the fact that the man has a softer side. All because he hesitated when Kennedy was killed. We even get to see Clint cry in one of his weaker moments. Clint Eastwood is one of Hollywood's unsung celebrities, because he never shows a hint of pretension or vanity.And Petersen has supplied Eastwood with a worthy adversary. The very underrated John Malkovich is just brilliant as Mitch Leary, the ex-CIA assassin who plays intricate mind games with Horrigan. Malkovich being the exceptional method actor that he is gets to try on various disguises to stay one step ahead of Horrigan.The psychological games Leary comes up with to torment Horrigan are given considerable gravitas by Malkovich. He comes across as a concerned friend and then a cold blooded killer at the drop of a hat.Petersen never allows things to slow down for too long. He gives the characters time to breathe in between the inevitable plot mechanics, but there is considerable excitement to be had from watching the agents pin down Leary's trail. There's never a dull moment.And the cast do an admirable job avoiding the predictability that comes with the genre. As well as Rene Russo's tough and forthright performance, Dylan McDermott does nicely as Frank's partner Al. It's a slightly generic role. The young pup who gets in over his head, but McDermott is a charming enough actor to make you warm to him. All the more so when he meets a tragic end.John Mahoney (taking time out from my favourite sitcom Frasier) adds warmth and geniality to Frank's boss Sam. Then there's Gary Cole who has a tricky part to play. A cocky, snot-nosed agent who tolerates Frank, and doesn't always listen when it might have made a difference. Still, Cole understands the difficulty in playing such a role, and ensures the character never gets too annoying.The only real black mark on ITLOF is Fred Dalton Thompson's White House Chief of Staff. It's like Wolfgang Petersen couldn't resist including at least one stock, generic character. In this case, a pompous, self important politician only interested in the President's image. Thompson is too good an actor to be lumbered with such a one-dimensional character.But elsewhere, ITLOF is a film that's very difficult to find fault with. There are wonderful gems to be found as Wolfgang Petersen's inexorable direction moves towards its inevitable conclusion. The night of the Presidential election.It builds to a final showdown between Frank and Leary within the confines of an elevator. But its good stuff all the same. And Malkovich brings such fascinating dimensions and excellent dialogue to Leary that his final message to Frank is surprisingly sympathetic and even feels honest.In the Line of Fire is by far Wolfgang Petersen's best film. Its a template for the perfect thriller. One that keeps your pulse racing, but lets it slow for the intelligence to shine through.",In the Line of Fire
79,romanorum1,A Cat and Mouse Thriller That Intensifies to a Dramatic Climax,8,25 November 2014,"Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood), a veteran US secret service agent, has never recovered from that fateful day (22 November 1963) when President John F. Kennedy was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald at his watch. Blaming himself for not reacting sooner and taking the fateful bullet, Horrigan became occasionally brooding and turned to liquor, actions that drove away his wife and daughter. He stayed in the bureaucracy though and requests an assignment to protect the latest president thirty years after the Catastrophe in Dallas. Now in his early sixties, the grizzled and intense Horrigan questions his own decision and forms doubts whether he still has the physical vigor to stand up to the job demands. Secret Service Director Sam Campagna (John Mahoney) backs him and grants his request, but Assistant Director Bill Watts (Gary Cole), although reluctantly agreeing to the new assignment, is so strongly against Horrigan that he revels in his apparent faux pas (like running out of breath while running alongside the presidential vehicle). Chief of Staff Harry Sargent (Fred Dalton Thompson) is similarly not in Horrigan's corner. The president is facing a very difficult reelection campaign, and Sargent does not want him to look awkwardly or cowardly in the face of potential danger.Mitch Leary (John Malcovitch), a trained operative for the CIA who was laid off, claims he was double-crossed by the US government and wants revenge. What is this loose cannon's plan? He longs to kill the current president (Jim Curley, code name ""Traveler""). Calling himself ""Booth"" (after you know whom) he takes the offensive and continually torments Horrigan on the telephone, explaining exactly what he intends to do. Booth had studied Frank Horrigan for years, and is so clever and conditioned and twisted that he is able to burrow deeply into the latter's mind. A master of disguise, Booth continually toys with Horrigan, recounting parallels in their life experiences. At other times, he creates bummers. For example, consider the scene when President Curley is holding an AFL-CIO rally in Chicago. Booth uses pins to pop display balloons, badgering Horrigan into believing that gunshots are being fired. Horrigan's actions caused disruption and humiliated the president, although the agent did show his self-assurance and quick reaction, and was even willing to take a hit for ""Traveler."" Now Frank has a partner, Al D'Andrea (Dylan McDermott), and the two of them had undermined a deadly band of Phoenix counterfeiters early in the film. D'Andrea, though, is fated for a different destiny even though for more than two-thirds of the film Horrigan and he tail Leary. The psychopath divulges that he could have killed Horrigan many times but left him alone (""I have allowed you to live so you show me some g**damn respect!""). And at one point the aging Horrigan nearly perishes from a rooftop fall. Now when the denouement eventually arrives, will he have the efficacy to save the president? Malcovitch's acting is always of high quality. He is just so believable as a creep that one almost begins to hate him. Rene Russo may have come late to Hollywood (in her later thirties), but she already had polished acting tools and looks to match. Her role here is Lilly Raines, a capable and strong agent herself who is on presidential protection detail; later she becomes Horrigan's younger lover. Of course the beginning was rocky, especially after Horrigan made several offensive statements. But Raines eventually saw his masculine sensitivity, charm, and his real respect for her, and she shows her own capacity to fall in love.This movie is a nice vehicle for Eastwood, a good actor who easily handles similar roles. Director Wolfgang Petersen created a competent film with a novel idea of a man obsessed with his inability to save a past president from a real, historical assassination. Those pictures and footages (digital effects) of a young Horrigan inserted into actual pictures of Kennedy are believable. Also, the sets are convincing (White House, Air Force One, police escort, rallies). The only drawback may be that the movie runs a few minutes too long. Recommended.",In the Line of Fire

It's an exciting thriller, with a great cast and with an intelligent story to back up their excellent performances. To say that Eastwood never ""has been better"" (Maltin review) is taking it way too far - but it is still a very honest, believable and interesting performance. Malcovitch, well... he can embody the creepiest characters imaginable, and he does an enviable job of it here. It's not so darn unpredictable, but that doesn't matter much. The issue isn't if Leary is going to succeed in killing the president, it's about Horrigan's chances for redemption.

81,Miles-10,Thriller from a more innocent time,7,18 June 2017,"""In the Line of Fire"" is a taut thriller, featuring performances by two different types of great actors.Clint Eastwood is the seasoned star of action vehicles, working his screen image in a way that makes it seem impossible that anyone else could have played crusty Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan. (Yet several other actors were considered for the part before him, including Robert Redford.) Eastwood, who is now in his late 80s, was a virile 63 when this picture was released, and still believable as the love interest of younger co-star Rene Russo.The biggest plot hole – if one can call it that – is that everybody wants Frank off the case because he is, as his boss says, ""too old for this sh*t"". Even his girlfriend seems only to want to keep him around because she feels sorry for him. Nobody except for the wiretapping technicians seems to recognize the fact that since the self- proclaimed assassin keeps calling Frank, his presence somewhere in the vicinity is indispensable to protecting the president.In one of his more accessible and memorable screen performances, veteran actor John Malkovich plays Mitch, a villain whose intensity makes you believe he is capable of anything. Although he has been in over sixty movies and TV productions, most moviegoers have probably seen Malkovich rarely, usually in supporting or even cameo roles. He is almost anonymous despite having appeared in such popular movies as ""Con Air"" (1997) and the eponymous cult film ""Being John Malkovich"" (1999).There is a scene in which Mitch meets two hunters who see too much, and right before he kills them Mitch confesses that he plans to assassinate the president. ""Why would you want to do that?"" asks one of the hunters in stunned horror. It does not matter what these men think of the president, who is portrayed as a vapid chameleon. This movie belongs to a quaint time when the idea of assassinating any president of the United States struck the overwhelming majority of Americans as plain wrong even if you thought the occupant of the White House was an execrable son of a bitch.",In the Line of Fire
82,Jerique,Review,8,4 November 2009,"Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) is being harassed by Mitch Leary (John Malkovich), a bomber terrorist who literally believes he will not be caught. In the opening is everyone's favourite modern serial killer, ""John Kramer"" (Tobin Bell) from the Saw series. Through clever planning and influence, Frank is able to make the arrest of Mendoza (Bell).From thereafter, its a series of cat and mouse chase. Malkovich is a tremendous actor and incredibly versatile. Once again showing a different role in this film, he astounds me with his ability to interchange his characters with the next film.I've watch Malkovich play in Con Air as a menacing insanely smart Cyrus, in Of Mice and Men as the tragically challenged bunny lover Lenny, to name a few. He plays a very smart bomber terrorist who is very sane but is deluded into thinking he can elude his captures.Clint Eastwood is no one special me. He's too old to really do much action in films so the only thing he can really astound you with is his ability to create dramatic scenes. The characters he plays are simplistic and one-dimensional.Rene Russo plays Eastwood's love interest in the film and captivates me with her supporting actually being a bigger role, to me, than Eastwood's.While this might seem like an action blockbuster, it's relatively slow paced and plays on anticipation. You have to wait for the build up and the ending and it will pay off in the end. Along the way, you'll be mesmerized by Malkovich and Eastwood's chemistry and their scenes of cat and mouse.",In the Line of Fire
83,Gubby-Allen,Excellent Thriller,7,16 January 2002,"Yes, an excellent thriller, with Malkovich absolutely brilliant again.Yet again though Hollywood have plonked in an unnecessary romance storyline, which although doesn't ruin the film, doesn't do it any favours at all.Like 'Good Will Hunting' & 'Sphere' this has a romantic sub plot which lessens the quality of the film, but also is almost laughable with the age gap.Yes Clint is cool and an icon for anyone. But I promise you, any girl in her 20's or 30's, may have at the most, thought him attractive a few years ago, but is repulsed by the thought of sleeping with him. The bedroom scene was almost cruel to watch & reminded me of a wildlife documentary, it was that embarassing to view.Despite that, 'In The Line Of Fire' is a very good film, and one of the few, where every single scene in it, contributes to the storyline & quality.7/10",In the Line of Fire

However, it is well-made, well-plotted, and well-acted, which counts for a lot.It's the cat-and-mouse story of a disgruntled former-CIA assassin who feels betrayed chasing a Secret Service agent who was protecting John F. Kennedy when Kennedy was killed in Dallas. The agent has been understandably troubled by this failure during the subsequent years of his career and when the movie picks up in 1992-or certainly in contemporary America, this would-be assassin Mitch Leary (John Malkovich in a tour-de-force of creepiness in which he gives a transformative performance) has been consumed with frustration and anger and decides that he is going to assassinate the President. He imagines he has common cause with Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood at his cool, calm, good-naturedly grouchy best) who he believes should hold a grudge as he does because the Warren Commission, blamed Horrigan-unfairly, Leary believes-for the assassination of President Kennedy. The tension is ratcheted up through some phone calls from Leary to Horrigan-Leary wanting to keep Horrigan close but not to betray his location and plans.Rene Russo is excellent as Lily Raines a fellow agent with whom Horrigan develops a grown- up relationship. It is nice to see a relationship between two equally competent peers (even if Russo is a fair deal younger than Eastwood at the time of filming). Russo is a calm, capable agent who is able to go toe-to-toe with the quick-witted Horrigan in friendly banter. It is a nice part for Russo, allowing her to play the role of a capable professional woman and not just the default romantic interest of the older man. The acting by the leads, Wolfgang Peterson's competent direction, the thoughtful use of music in plot development, and excellent cinematography make this a film I can watch over and over.",In the Line of Fire
85,HelloTexas11,strictly average,5,1 December 2007,"'In The Line Of Fire' is a film that sounds better than it really is. It has all the prerequisites for an exciting thriller- an oddball assassin planning to kill the President, a Secret Service agent determined to stop him, a long cat & mouse game between them, a beautiful woman the agent has an affair with... all tried and true plot devices. The Secret Service agent, Frank Horrigan, is a hard-headed loner, the last surviving member of the detail that guarded John Kennedy when he was shot and killed. All these potentially exciting elements never really come together, and the film has a cut-and-dried, paint-by-the-numbers feel to it. The various subplots come across as clichéd; for instance, we instinctively know, early on, that Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) will fall out of favor with his superiors. We know he and the beautiful Secret Service agent Lily Raines (Rene Russo), even though she apparently can't stand him, will have an affair. We know the nutcase assassin (John Malkovich) will come within a hair's breadth of killing the President. And of course we know Horrigan will prevent it, on duty or not. Granted, the movie delivers all this competently; Eastwood, as always, is fun to watch and some of his dry dialogue is effective. But an air of the routine permeates the film. There is nothing particularly scary about Mitch Leary; he's more annoying than anything in his phone calls to Horrigan, when he taunts the agent for failing to protect Kennedy all those years ago. Nothing in the film is very subtle or mysterious. It is suggested that Horrigan is too old for his job and sure enough in the next scene, he is running alongside the presidential limo, obligingly huffing and puffing to show his age. The film wants to be a cross between 'Silence of the Lambs' and 'The Manchurian Candidate' but has none of those films' layered textures or rich characterizations. It plays like a decently produced TV movie and, taken on that level, is moderately entertaining.",In the Line of Fire

Eastwood is at his gruff and cynical best, but this time he allows himself and his character to be more vulnerable, and he's not just an indestructible Dirty Harry clone. Malkovich is also creepy and eccentric, and is perfect opposite Eastwood. Renee Russo is also good.Equal parts a political and action thriller, the action scenes are short but visceral. The first foot chase, the rooftop chase, and the climax are all well done, with the final fight being super satisfying. Eastwood pulls off some pretty cool stunts for his age here, and he still retains his position as one of Hollywood's coolest and most charismatic stars.Definitely an above average thriller, it is very much a film worth your time, and worth more than one viewing.",In the Line of Fire
87,Gunn,One of the Great Action-Adventure Thrillers!,10,21 April 2009,"I really love action/adventure films and this is one of the best. Of course, we love the stars of this genre, Bruce Willis, Sly Stallone, Clint Eastwood, Kurt Russell, Arnold Schwarzenegger and the rest, but its the story that really counts. The best are somewhat feasible but we can tolerate those that are a little ""over the top"" as in the comic book style of action. The more twists and turns, the more dire situations the heroes are involved in and the more shocking moments in the film; the more we action/adventure fans enjoy them. ""In the Line of Fire"" has ALL the elements required for a rip-roaring action thriller. It has Clint Eastwood as a near-retirement Secret Service Agent whose one bad moment of failure haunts him. It has one of the most evil, despicable, maniacal villains in John Malkovich, the type in which you can't wait to see him, ""get his due"". It has Rene Russo as the 'love interest.' It has twists and turns, an occasional shock and even a touch of warmth and humor. It is extremely well paced by director Wolfgang Petersen and even has a score by the great Ennio Morricone.

88,arthurclay,It's fannntastic!,10,25 May 2005,"A great performance by Clint Eastwood and particularly John Malkovich in my opinion his finest one to date. Malkovich had this one nailed right down to the floor it's incredible. Eastwood is Agent Mike Horrigan, an aged and cynical Secret Service Agent who is finishing out his career busting counterfeiters and chasing down routine assignments. But one assignment which appears to be run of the mill at first turns complicated and deadly serious. Horrigan and his new partner Al are sent to investigate a threat on the President by a ""wacko"". As fate would have it Horrigan has stumbled not upon a delusional nut but a professional lone wolf who has a big bone to pick with the White House. As Horrigan dives deeper into ""Booth's"" world he attracts the bad guy's unwanted attention and unbridled admiration for him. Horrigan was JFK's top agent and present in Dallas, Texas when he was assassinated and blames himself for what happened. Now he feels it's up to him to stop the current Head of State from joining the list of dead Presidents. But this killer has turned the tables on Horrigan and now he's the hunted one in a life or death cat and mouse game. Who will win? Who will die? It's a race against time to save the Pres from a chameleon-like enemy who can get to anyone. My favorite Secret Service movie and as good a nail biter as any.",In the Line of Fire

But if you're going to work with the best, why not work with Petersen? That logic appears to be sound, as this film is one of the more seamless dramas Eastwood has done. Everything fits, from the opening scenes as an undercover agent to relationship with John Mahoney to the interaction with John Malkovich. The love relationship between him and Rene Russo is neither forced nor overly romantic, but the feeling blends perfectly into the resolution of the film. Fred Dalton Thompson is not stranger to political roles, but might have played this one with a little more panache. Overall, this film is well-written and directed, plays well to the adult audience, and leaves a favorable impression, like going to a good restaurant on a night when the chef has gone all out. You leave satisfied, and plan to come back again. Rated R for violence and language, this film is not for the preteens, and while the teens would not be shocked at the violence, they probably won't want to watch a bunch of ""old people"" for 128 minutes.

91,Idiot-Deluxe,Gripping! One of the best action/suspense film's of all time.,9,23 December 2016,"In the Line of Fire is an insanely entertaining action/suspense film from 1993, starring (the great) Clint Eastwood as the aging secret service agent Frank Horrigan, cast opposite of him, in the role of the villain, is John Malkovich who delivers what's probably the most inspired performance of his career, as the fiendishly vindictive rogue agent/assassin, Mitch Leary. Also starring is a young and still very beautiful Rene Russo and she quite capably fills the roll of the young-female-secret-service-agent and she's also Clint's squeeze or ""love interest"" in the film - although it is a highly contentious relationship between the two at first. But, as if you couldn't guess it, Clint's charm and heroism eventually win's her over. Also starring as Eastwoods partner, in what's probably his only notable film role, is Dylan McDermott, who, when in the presence of such an inspired cast and helmed by a director of Wolfgang Peterson's caliber, even he rose to the occasion.This film is masterful by the way it's creates such a potent atmosphere of tension between the two main character's, in which we see Eastwood pitted against Malkovich, in the classic good-guy vs. bad-guy format and the events that transpire, play out in the form of what's an incredibly exciting game of cat-and-mouse; and since it revolves around assassinating the President, the games stakes could not be any higher. I say ""game"", because that's how Malkovich's character, Mitch Leary, treats it as and he's unfailing sporting of his grand scheme of assassination towards his nemesis Frank Horrigan and agents of the Secret Service; and he constantly keeps them in the loop all the way through to conclusion, which brilliantly leads up to the films climatic ending. But there's more to say before we get there. Just remember that there's apparently an established code of etiquette among psychotic assassin's - one which colors greatly this movies mood.Throughout the movie Leary taunts his pursuers through a series of phone calls, that are always flavored with cryptic threats, which tends to cast a dark pall over the film. Though it goes well beyond that (especially in the second hour of the film), as the tension only intensifies, when it becomes obvious that there's a killer on the loose. Malkovich plays his role with a remarkable level of energy and conviction and his looming presence cast's a very long shadow over his enemies which, impressively, is the Secret Service AND the FBI. Yet it's on the conscious of agent Horrigan, that the threat of Leary weighs most heavily, as the ever-present threat of this shadowy specter remains at large. All this tension effectively builds up into a vast morass of terrible uncertainty which must be vanquished, if the nightmare that is Mitch Leary is ever to end. If that doesn't spell it out for you here's another, the tension that's created is: Positively Palpable.Throughout the second half of the film the ante is upped and Leary is actively on a killing-spree, murdering several people who he perceives as being in the way and/or knowing too much and for Horrigan, one of his victims comes very close to home. Who might it be? All while following the president's re-election bid/campaign trail around the country, which at a series of campaign rallies, leads us up to some of the films best and most exciting moments; once again pitting old, steely-eyed Clint against his nemesis - Mitch Leary, who also happens to be a master of disguise. With Horrigan's obsessive nature towards catching (or killing) Leary, not to mention all the additional safety precautions he ask's for on the Presidents behalf, this invariably (and quickly) causes a lot of internal friction between himself, other members of the Sercret Service, all the way up the ladder to the White House Chief of Staff (played by the late Frederick Dalton Thompson).In lieu of Horrigan's efficient investigating and Leary's devious, but very sporting-like MO, this effectively ensures that the game will always be kept very close and the stakes are always at their highest: Presidential Assassination; this again, creates profoundly intense levels of suspense, which are potently and thrillingly sustained until the very end of the movie. In the Line of Fire is a lot more than just a great action film with ""all it's guns blazing""; it's a film that has very few rivals when measured in the terms of it's compellingly gripping levels of suspense and 23 years after it's release, it still, very much remains among Eastwood's best films. A tall order for any movie and the only other movie of Clint's that has anywhere near this level of suspense and nervous tension, is the first Dirty Harry film - but even that falls well short of In the Line of Fire. Which, as time has proved it to be, a true heavy-weight contender in the realm known as: The Suspense Genre.",In the Line of Fire
92,Panterken,Malkovich makes this an above-average thriller,7,18 October 2007,"'In The Line Of Fire' tells the story of the game between an old presidential bodyguard and a former-government assassin turned psycho. The secret service agent/bodyguard (Eastwood) is on defense and the assassin (Malkovich)is on offense. The stakes? The president's live.I really like this movie...I've seen it numerous times on TV and have recently bought it on DVD. Yet, it's not an excellent movie. The plot is way too thin and the attempts to thicken it are downright ridiculous. The whole love-story isn't very plausible and the way they brought an extra character into the story, just to be able to kill it off is kind of insulting to the more or less intelligent viewer. Though I feel these mistakes can't be forgiven, I can easily look past them to Mr. Malkovich exquisite performance. I've always deemed him to be a great actor but in this movie he's really on fire. There's a reason why he got an Academy Award nomination. Rene Russo and Clint Eastwood were okay, but I don't deem their performance to be memorable. They're never at the best of their abilities.If you don't expect too much, you'll certainly like this movie.

I still love it and remain at the edge of my seat throughout. That plastic gun idea was a classic.  I'm sure if someone could really make a plastic gun, there would be a lawsuit against this movie, because it definitely puts bad ideas into assassins' and terrorists' heads.  But with airport security getting tighter and tighter, they might actually check the rabbit's foot keychain for bullets.  Hell, even nail filers are considered lethal weapons nowadays.  There is a great degree of tension throughout the film.  Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich are both great.  Eastwood is terrific at playing these conflicted characters, and let's face it--his snarling dialogue delivery is always fun to hear.  I'll always remember the ""You have a rendezvous with my a*s, motherf**ker"" line.  And it's so much fun watching Malkovich play the slimy villain.  His Oscar nomination was well-deserved.  Along with Ray Liotta, there's nothing more fun than watching Malkovich explode into a fit on screen.  His descents into relentless anger are classic.  I think what works is he starts out very pleasantly and mild-mannered, and next thing you know--he's a monster.  I can see why he was chosen to play Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde (in ""Mary Reilly"" which I have yet to see).  Dylan McDermott is also great as Clint's naive partner.    I think the subplot of Eastwood's character being an agent during the JFK assassination was a little much, but that's merely a minor flaw.  I have a lot of fun with this movie.

Malkovich brings a cold, but very intelligent mindset to his character. Everything he does, he does for a reason, and he's not shy about killing. Eastwood has to overcome the suspicions of his superiors in order to catch Malkovich, but no one wants to listen to him.

This film was filled with way too many mistakes that also took one too many liberties with the facts. Clint Eastwood plays Frank Harrigan a Secret Service agent that at one time was assigned to protect President Kennedy. When President Kennedy was assassinated frank felt he did not do his duty by protecting the President and has carried the guilt ever since. Now 30 years have passed and Frank Harrigan is still a Secret Service agent again assigned to protect the President, and this time he will not make the same mistakes. Here is the first problem I have with this film. Frank had a lot of health problems being an old man now, and at one point while running along the President's Limo he can be seen coughing and gagging barely able to keep up. Now do you really think that such an old tired sick man would be allowed to protect the president? I don't think so. The second problem is Rene Russo's character as Special Agent Lilly Raines. She serves no useful purpose except to look sexy for the camera, and there is even an absurd scene where she is on duty in a tight dress (which the secret service would have never allowed) and Frank asked here where her gun is hidden and she replies, "" Wouldn't you like to know."" Give me a break.

In this story, Malkovich plays an assassin, and he is awesome to watch, thanks to his different disguises and the terrific dialogues he was given. Directed by Wolfgang Peterson (Director of Troy) it is one of those movies of 90s that would remind you of Eastwood's trademark role Dirty Harry Eastwood stars as a veteran Secret Service Agent who was on the job in Dallas as a young man when John F.

He's gotten back on the White House detail now and when a potential assassin's landlady rats on her tenant to the Secret Service, it's Eastwood and partner Dylan McDermott who draw the case.But the assassin is no ordinary crank case. He's a professional at his job, trained by and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich earned a well deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor but sadly he lost that year to Tommy Lee Jones for The Fugitive. Malkovich might have been better off, but he saw Eastwood as the agent in charge breaking into his apartment while on the job and he insisted on making the whole thing personal. He calls and taunts Eastwood throughout the film. And after a while what Malkovich says does causes Eastwood to get real personal. John Malkovich is also magnificent in perhaps his most famous and celebrated psycho role. Screen chemistry of these two incredible actors is enjoyable to watch- especially in the phone call scenes. ""In the line of fire"" has huge amount of splendid moments. Scene where Eastwood is hanging on the edge of the roof and points his gun at Malkovich's mouth who's only trying to help him is a classic and so is the elevator scene in the end of the film.

The character, Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan, is haunted by the fact that he was on the detail that failed to protect President Kennedy in Dallas, and now he's forced to match wits with a professional assassin that is openly declaring that he will kill the president. However, the film doesn't make him a depressed, brooding, and obsessed character. He's charming and personable, and is realistic as a guy that has experienced a lot in life and is comfortable in his own skin. He's even quite convincing when he flirts with the pretty younger agent played by Rene Russo. The killer, played by John Malkovich at his best, is cerebral, deliberate, and enjoys playing high stakes games of life and death. He even goes by the name of another presidential assassin, John Booth.

The film is also very authentic where it deals with the Kennedy assassination, and Clint Eastwood is very believable as a Secret Service agent. The climax of this film is so exciting that it will have your adrenalin pumping and your pulse racing. This is probably the best political thriller of the decade.",In the Line of Fire
116,tnelson2-374-411051,Top notch thriller.,10,4 November 2021,"In the line of fire is an absolutely top notch thriller that still holds up nearly thirty years after it's release. It's got a fairly outlandish yet still somehow believable plot that is tautly directed, superbly acted, and is for my money one of Clint Eastwood's top 5 films, which is no mean feat considering his body of work.All the main cast here are excellent, rene Russo is a great foil for Clint's grizzled, yet still cheeky character, which I think is one of his last really great acting roles, he's in such commanding form here, he's emotional, aggressive and really funny at times and has some great one liners too. Along with 'unforgiven' it's hands down his best performance of the 90s and maybe even the 80s too. John malkovich is truly outstanding - He's creepy, unhinged, ruthless, methodical and brilliant. He is an absolutely fantastic antagonist and is a pure force of nature - easily one of the best villains in any film, regardless of genre, he's that good. I think it's one of the best performances of his career, if not his best. His and Clint's performance are the heart of this film and it's absolutely glorious to watch it unfold, they elevate this film from the merely good to the great. This picture is full of tension, action, violence, romance, humour and heartbreak, you name it, it's superbly entertaining and inventive from start to finish.There's even some really solid character work with the more fringe characters which adds plenty to the story without bogging it down.The action scenes are tense, never OTT and service the story perfectly with some good twists on the way. I like that it's set within real time events with the Kennedy assassination too. The score is also very good indeed.Honestly? I not only think this one of the best thrillers of the 90s but of all time. I'm struggling to fault it in any way. It's a a ten out of ten for me.",In the Line of Fire

Obviously its not as good as the likes of Shawshank, the godfather and se7en but still similar to films likes of phone booth, rocky 2 and die hard 4.0 have been hard done by by the the critics.I would highly recommend this film to anyone who really listens to the dialogue and enjoys suspenseful thrillers.

Thirty years later another anti-social lunatic wants to assassinate the current president. The secret service agent loses his partner along the way,to the crazed gunmen who schemes,lies and murders anybody in his path who'll stand in his way of his mission. The movie  accompanies with a great memorable score,and a restrained but meaningful romance between Russo and Eastwood....which displays how difficult it is to have a romantic life in that kind of work. Malchovich is great,sure many other candidates could have played the role that he played,but how many could acted with such craftiness,and intellect that he displayed in the movie?Needless to say,I thought this was a great movie...everytime it's on television I have to watch it..and I own it on dvd!

126,talhaahmad-29969,Entertaining Action Thriller,7,26 September 2021,"In the Line of Fire is an entertaining action thriller that will keep the viewers hooked throughout the length of the movie. Nostalgic viewers who long for the action movies of the yore will love watching or rewatching this. This type of action thriller has a specific brand that is associated with the late 20th century era.This was my first Clint Eastwood movie and I can see his charm and appeal that made him a household name. Eastwood has an overwhelmingly positive presence that carries the movie smoothly. His voice is heavy, gentle and melodic. His effortless portrayal of Frank Hooligan - a long time Secret Service agent with a dark past - bears the marks of a veteran.John Malkovich as Mitch Leary puts up a brilliant performance as the antagonist to match up with Clint Eastwood. His cold voice and manic demeanor provides a good contrast with Eastwood's commanding tone and controlled manner. Rene Russo as Lilly Raines amd the other supporting actors did her bit as well.Modern viewers might find some of the scenes and even the whole dynamic between Clint Eastwood and Rene Russo problematic. This doesn't take away from the quality of the movie but will stick out for some viewers.Wolfgand Peterson did a brilliant job in maintaining the pace of the movie. Nowhere does the movie feel dragged out or going too fast. Peterson keeps the viewers hooked not by excessive action scenes but by simply using the prowess of the two leading actors. The scenes between the two are well written and directed.For viewers who want to reminisce about the action thrillers of the past, this movie might be a good place to start.",In the Line of Fire
127,Buddy-43,Thrilling drama that has a brain,10,6 August 1999,"I am a huge fan of big, loud, trashy, completely stupid action movies such as The Rock, Con Air etc.  All of these are great fun to watch but, when you think about it, extremely silly.  IN THE LINE OF FIRE tells a story and it tells it well.  With plausibility as well as excitement and suspense it also addressed several important moral questions that really make you think. The last shot of the movie is Eastwood and Russo sitting together on the steps of the White house watching the pigeons to gentle, peaceful music and I felt a deep feeling of satisfaction.  This was because I cared about the characters and I was happy for them that their story had come to a happy conclusion.  It felt like a true story.  As the aging secret service agent tormented by the fact that he failed to protect JFK on that fateful day in Dallas, Clint Eastwood is fantastic.  He brilliantly conveys his paranoia and his personal need to stop his adversary.  On the other side of the spectrum is John Malkovich, as the creepy predator who tortures Eastwood about what happened in 1963 by openly telling him of his plan to kill the current president.  This Oscar nominated performance really gets under your skin.  Throughout the movie, Malkovich talks to Eastwood as if they are friends.  He doesn't threaten him, he doesn't lie to him, he doesn't laugh at him, but he tortures him with his unbearable friendliness right up to the last moment.  As well as this thrilling main plot, there is a charming love story involving Rene Russo, another agent and Eastwood.  Despite the age difference, they have superb chemistry on screen and the director wisely does not let this dominate too much but keeps it as part of the backdrop which works nicely. To sum up, I love this film because it has a mind.",In the Line of Fire
128,pacinofan58,Even Clint Eastwood Makes A Bomb Now And Then,2,21 May 2007,"There is so much wrong with this movie, I hardly know where to begin! We are supposed to believe that an agent too old for his job, and easily winded, would be employed by the secret service in the first place. After that.....the ""super cop"" stereotypes come fast and furious. Of course Eastwoods character once guarded JFK....and of course, we are told how he was JFK's ""favorite agent"", and we are told how he...of course, took the blame when JFK was found with a girl in the white house. Everyone is here....the psycho ex CIA assassin over acted by John Malkovitch......the ""asshole"" Chief Of Staff who seems to be more concerned with poll numbers than a threat to the presidents life, the lead agent who we are supposed to believe thinks that Eastwoods character is ""over reacting"" to a threat to the presidents life...AFTER he and every other agent have already listened to the psycho's threat on a tapped phone call. And finally......as if we hadn't already figured out the ending 5 minutes into the movie, Eastwoods character ends up saving the Presidents life! By that time, you won't care anyway, because you will be too busy shouting ""bullshit"" at the screen as one unrealistic scene after the other flashes by. Take a Pass...you'll thank me for it.",In the Line of Fire

Great performances and overall hard work all around. This movie has everything going for it. An awesome screenplay, a captivating, stunning performance from John Malkovich, and a creepy yet thrilling aura surrounding every scene. This movie could have easily catapulted into one of my favorites ever. It is a very entertaining movie.Of course, it does have its flaws. The biggest flaw to this movie is Rene Russo's character. Now I recognize the need for strong female characters. But she's not exactly a strong character at all. In fact, her character is never really significant throughout the entire film. I respect Russo as an actress, and I'm sure if the screenplay was further refined, her character could have been developed further. Still, I recommend it. It makes for a fun movie night, and it's ever enjoyable despite some flaws, which you can easily get over by paying attention to how awesome Eastwood and Malkovich's battle of wits really is.",In the Line of Fire
132,Tezza_60,"I sat bolt upright in the cinema, had there been a more suspenseful film?",9,25 January 2003,"The person responsible for writing the storyline to this great movie must be a outstanding teller of tales. In my job as a teacher I tell stories to the kids direct from my imagination. I try to get the kids pondering what the next twist will be. This film does exactly that. John Malkovich plays one of the best ""bad guy"" roles in the last 30 years, a real credit as lots of his other roles are not of this genre. His portrayal as Lennie in ""Of Mice & Men"" seems light years away from the psychopath he brings to the screen here. The role played by Clint Eastwood is straight out of his ""Dirty Harry"" days but the romantic aspect, played very convincingly by Russo, bring s a new dimension to Clint and saves the film to some degree. There are plenty of films depicting cops dealing with nutters, some involve protecting heads of state but none come close to the drama which unfolds in front of the viewer. This is another gem which failed to make the box office ring over big time, here in Oz anyway,and will be shown on late night free to air telly. When talk is made of Clint's movies this title will be overlooked in favour of ""Harry"" and a few westerns (all good films by the way). When the same talk is made of Malkovich films however, along with ""Mice"" this one should be a standout. A thriller from go to whoa.",In the Line of Fire

There are very few films which I even consider watching several times and this is one of them. Everything in this movie is just right: Clint as the superb leading actor, Rene Russo as his non-stupid female partner(this is a very rare combination - sad,but true!). Of course, John Malkowich deserves a lot of praise for his excellent villain but let us not overlook Eastwood`s initial buddy, played by Dylan Mcdermott, who in my view fits the role perfectly.The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic - but sadly never released on an original soundtrack CD (shame on the producers!). The plot makes sense and there is no loss of pace, the audience is kept in constant excitement of the outcome of the duel between Eastwood and Malkowich.

137,victor-shaw,"Gripping, Intense Eastwood Thrilla!!",10,21 March 2012,"""In The Line of Fire"" is a great action packed thriller film with superb acting and direction from Wolfgang Petersen (Air Force One).Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan was a bodyguard for many years, and he was present at the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, but did not respond to the shots, and as he was the closer bodyguard, this still haunts him. One day he receives a call from a crazed stalker and trained army assassin, calling himself Booth, and threatens to kill the president. Now Frank along with the department, including Secret Service Agent Lilly Raines (Rene Russo), are trying to find this assassin, real name Mitch Leary (a sensational performance from John Malkovich).Frank also gets onto the team that protects the current President (Jim Curley). There are some great chase sequences, near catches and complications to ending the whole thing, including a great scene where Frank could kill Mitch, but fall to his death, and his partner Secret Service Agent Al D'Andrea (Miracle on 34th Street's Dylan McDermott) is killed as a result. The final scenes at a conference with the President is most gripping, seeing if Frank can make it and save the leader, and seeing if disguised Mitch can succeed in killing him with his own made gun. Also starring Gary Cole as Secret Service Presidential Detail Agent-In-Charge Bill Watts, John Mahoney as Secret Service Director Sam Campagna, Gregory Alan Williams as Secret Service Agent Matt Wilder and Saw's Tobin Bell as Mendoza.Doesn't get any better, I give it a solid 10!",In the Line of Fire
