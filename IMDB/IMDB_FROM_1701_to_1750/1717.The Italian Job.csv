0,TheLittleSongbird,"Enjoyable, if inferior to the 1969 film...",7,14 June 2010,"The 1969 film I don't revere as a classic but it was very entertaining, and I have to say this film is just as enjoyable. While inferior in some aspects I actually noticed one or two improvements. The plot does meander slightly in the second half, and I found Edward Norton's villain too sleazy and one-dimensional. The film is also a tad too long by about two or three minutes. But it is very fast paced, looks great, has a great soundtrack and has some wonderful set pieces, very like the 1969 film. Where the improvements come are in the direction and the script, here the direction is super-charged, in the 1969 film I found it too flashy, and the script was smarter and more consistent. And the acting wasn't bad either. Mark Wahlberg takes on the Michael Caine role with real enthusiasm and charm and Seth Green is very funny in a very different role. Not to mention Charlize Theron, who is very beguiling as the sassy safe cracker. Overall, entertaining and enjoyable. 7/10 Bethany Cox",The Italian Job
1,bkoganbing,"""We're All A Little Emotional In This One""",7,13 August 2011,"Having not yet seen the original The Italian Job that Michael Caine I have no frame of reference to compare it to. Still this version is fast moving and fun and you got to tip your hat to a bunch of professional thieves who know their business and steal without it being bloody. Donald Sutherland has assembled a crack team of thieves all with special skills that include Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Mos Def, Jason Stathem and Seth Green. The six pull off a well timed heist of 35 million dollars in gold bullion bars. But then Norton gets real greedy and in turn steals the bullion from the rest, killing Sutherland and nearly all the others. Of course they're out for revenge, but revenge is a dish best served cold. Still they're all a little emotional on this one given the circumstances.New on the team is Charlize Theron who is Sutherland's daughter and she brings safe-cracking skills into the mix. They will be needed before the film is over.Edward Norton in his career has done a nice variety of sociopathic types from The Score, Primal Fear, and American History X. He's some piece of work in The Italian Job, but Norton is an actor who creates a peculiar fascination with the evil he does.The key man as the team attempts to heist the bullion again from Norton is Seth Green the computer hacker. What he does I can't say, but it's the equivalent of directing a mouse in a maze.This version of The Italian Job can safely stand on its own merits as entertaining and thrilling. Even without me seeing the first one as of yet.",The Italian Job
2,Leofwine_draca,Solid if unremarkable remake,6,10 August 2016,"The Italian Job is the ill-advised Hollywood remake of the much-loved Michael Caine classic about a gold heist in Italy. Now I, like most people, really enjoyed the original film and I expected that this film wouldn't and couldn't hold a candle to it. Surprise, surprise, it doesn't, although it is a solid action film. This movie can best be thought of as a precursor to the FAST AND THE FURIOUS franchise as it feels very similar to those films. The dialogue is snappy and the action is fast paced, with lots of enjoyable car chases. This and the GONE IN 60 SECONDS remake would make a good double bill.A word on the cast: Edward Norton is ill at ease, making a film he has no interest in, but Mark Wahlberg is a solid enough and charismatic lead. Donald Sutherland is ever the professional and Charlize Theron does well in a star-making turn. The real stand out is Jason Statham as one of the crew; he did well enough to turn his back on ensemble movies for many years, instead making a series of fun action vehicles occasionally more entertaining than this film.",The Italian Job
3,SnoopyStyle,fun chase heist movie,7,5 September 2013,"John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) and team successfully steal $35 million in gold in Venice, Italy. They get double-crossed by team member Steve (Edward Norton) and John is killed. After finding Steve in L.A., Charlie reassembles the team to rob Steve and get revenge. However, he needs the help of John Bridger's daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron), a professional safe cracker who uses her skills for good. This also stars Seth Green, Mos Def, and Jason Statham as members of the team. That's a great group of actors, and they had a fun time driving Mini Coopers thru L.A. traffic and under L.A.

4,claudio_carvalho,A Breathless Adventure With Nice Thieves,9,20 June 2004,"In Venice, a very specialized team of thieves, composed of Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg),  John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), Handsome Rob (Jason Statham), Lyle (Seth Green), Left Ear (Mos Def) and Steve (Edward Norton) heist US$ 35,000,000.00 in gold bars in a cerebral plan and without any shooting. However, they are double crossed by Steve, who steals all the gold and kills John. One year later, they find Steve living as a millionaire in a mansion in Hollywood. They invite the straight specialist in safes, Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), daughter of John, to join the group and steal the gold from Steve, in a sort of payback. In their plan, they intend to provoke a traffic jam and the Minis have an important participation. This story has many cliches, is totally unbelievable, but what could a viewer expect from an action movie? Exactly what this movie offers to the audience: a breathless adventure, funny, full of action, a great entertainment. Of course, we cheer on the nice and daring thieves against Steve, the real bad guy in the story. The DVD has many extras and shows that practically all the action scenes were performed by the cast, who had a specific training. Charlize Theron is very beautiful in this film (as usual). I liked this movie a lot. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): `Uma Saída de Mestre' (`An Exit of Master')",The Italian Job
5,lee_eisenberg,I once thought that the title referred to a certain sexual act.,7,26 February 2006,"I always like a good heist movie, and this remake of the Michael Caine classic does a pretty cool job. ""The Italian Job"" has a group of thieves seeking to take revenge on a former partner-in-crime who double-crossed them. In a way, the whole movie is a giant car chase, but it's clever enough so that it never gets ridiculous or idiotic. Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Mos Def, Jason Statham, Seth Green, and Donald Sutherland all do a great job. I know that these stunts are all really dangerous, but I still wish to assert that it would be neat to experience this movie, especially the whole scene in the metro. To paraphrase a famous quote: ""It's all in the cars."" As for the sexual act to which I believed that the title referred, I think that you know which one I mean (I'm probably not allowed to say it here).",The Italian Job
6,jboothmillard,The Italian Job,5,21 January 2008,"I was expecting this remake of a British classic to be a pretty boring or rubbish film, but it actually was okay. It may have the three minis (red, blue and white coloured), and it may still be a robbery of gold in Italy, but it is a completely different story. Basically Charlie Croker (Planet of the Apes' Mark Wahlberg) leads a team of expert thieves pull off a daring heist of 35 million dollars in gold, but Steve (Edward Norton, as an agreeably one dimensional villain) betrays the team and gets away with it. A year later, Charlie reunites the team to pull off a bigger job in Venice, Italy, this time obviously using the three minis, some traffic light access, and some explosives. Starring Charlize Theron as Stella Bridger, Seth Green as Lyle, The Transporter's Jason Statham as Handsome Rob, Mos Def as Left Ear, Saw II's Franky G as Wrench, Home Alone 3's Olek Krupa as Mashkov and a very brief Donald Sutherland as John Bridger. To be honest, it is only interesting for the cast of well known stars, the opening and concluding robberies, the big chase, and that's it, and it didn't have a cliffhanger ending, literally, at all, but it is still quite a fun film. Worth watching!",The Italian Job
7,ccthemovieman-1,Very Entertaining Heist Movie & A Big Plug For MINIs,9,20 January 2007,"I wonder how many MINI Cooper automobiles were sold thanks to this movie? It couldn't help but add to the sales of this little car, which is featured in this film, along with an attractive cast.This is a very, very entertaining heist-and-chase film. It features a ""cool"" cast with Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green and Jason Statham.The best chase scene is right at the beginning with a boat pursuit in Venice, Italy. The film doesn't overdo the violence, has a pretty intelligent script (with a few short exceptions). features interesting characters and is nicely firmed. The cat-and-mouse game between Norton and Theron's characters is suspenseful and fun to watch.Once again, however, we are manipulated into rooting for criminals portrayed as ""the good guys."" How many times has this happened since the days of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" in the 1960s? It's twisted Hollywood, for you. In here, one of the criminals (Norton) stole and killed the leader and father figure (Donald Sutherland) of the gang, so he's the worst of the bunch and the film's villain. Also Theron's character is in the typically overblown-feminist mode of Hollywood in which women can do all things (including driving a car) better than a man. A third minor irritation is Seth Green's smug, smart-ass attitude which we also are supposed to go along with because it's hip and cool. Despite these hindrances, it is an extremely entertaining movie and it also doesn't overboard on the profanity or sex....and, yes, those little cars are cool. Everyone I've talked to who has seen this film, enjoyed it.",The Italian Job
8,rmax304823,Blisteringly Fast Caper Movie.,6,10 November 2010,"This is one of those movies in which a car rarely starts from a standing position without burning rubber. And, as far as I could tell, there wasn't a single U turn in it. If the driver wants to reverse his direction, he (or she) simply spins it around in a sort of pivot. Not to give the driving team too much credit. The three principal cars are souped-up Mini Coopers of different colors and must be easier to pivot than, say, a greyhound bus or an earth mover.There's no need to spell out plot details. A team of half a dozen or so ""professionals"" pull off a spectacular heist of some 35 million dollars in gold bullion in Venice, Italy. I believe Venice was chosen as the location because it gives the film makers a chance to shoot sizable speedboat violating all the traffic rules on the narrow canals of the city. The boats chase one another at high speed, upsetting gondolas, smashing fishing docks, shooting through the air over obstacles, sinking battleships, and whatnot. Except for the police boats that seem to run in circles, I couldn't figure out who was chasing whom or why. It hardly matters. The point is the chase per se.The professionals meet on some Alpine mountain top to savor their success, with their mentor, Donald Sutherland, presiding over the proceedings. The young leader is Mark Wahlberg. Lamentably, there is a traitor in their midst, the freaky looking, mustachioed Edward Norton. He kills Sutherland and does his best to knock off everyone else.But they outwit him and survive, tracking this new multimillionaire back to his sumptuous lair in Southern California, home to many sumptuous lairs. They recruit Charlize Theron, Sutherland's daughter and now a security expert, in their attempt to steal the gold back.Norton, being nobody's fool, twigs to the arrangement and tries to foil their plan. The plan, by the way, involves a good deal of that impossible high tech stuff that appears only in movies like this. Their computer expert hijacks -- is that the word? -- hijacks the entire traffic light system of Greater Los Angeles as well as the subway system. Not only didn't I realize that these things could be hacked, I didn't even know Los Angeles now has a subway system for the little people. All of this leads to another, even more monumental chase, with the Mini Coopers zipping around on streets, sidewalks, subway tracks, and the ever-popular Los Angeles River like three cockroaches, pursued by a black helicopter and some expendable motorcycles.The acting, what there is of it, isn't objectionable, except that when the good guys finally corner the villainous Edward Norton and confront him with their victory, they smirk abominably. That's the director's fault, not the actors'. And certainly not the actress's. Charlize Theron, former ballerina, is seen drilling a particularly difficult safe. She should feel at liberty to drill any of the many safes in my possession. I love ballerinas. Charlize, O moon of my delight, I'm easy to reach. I'm a dancer too. I was once seen doing the froog. And I'm deliciously witty and gay, especially drunk. And my Mom and Pop have been known to kvell over my impression of Kirk Douglas.I will happily grovel before you and will ask only this in return: Try in the future to appear in movies in which the pattern exhaustion isn't so evident. Thank you, dear.",The Italian Job

10,blanche-2,Enjoyable heist movie,8,20 August 2007,"Criminals are betrayed by one of their own and become set on revenge in ""The Italian Job,) a 2003 film starring Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Donald Sutherland, Charlize Theron, and directed by F. Gary Gray. Gray never lets the pace up, keeping the viewer hooked all the way.The beginning of the film is really the best, when the thieves pull off an astounding heist of gold bullion in Venice. The scenery alone is worth the whole film. Then the action shifts to Los Angeles some time later. The thrills never really let up. It's reminiscent of ""Ocean's Eleven"" where, if you stop and think about what the criminals are doing, you realize it's completely impossible, but you go along with it because it's so clever.What made the film especially interesting for me is that the story and execution really depended on the actors not at all. Someone commented that Charlize Theron was doing an Angelina Jolie role - all of the actors, while okay, were doing roles that could easily have been played by someone else. This includes Donald Sutherland's short but sympathetic role. Some films are dependent on special effects; this film is dependent on moving breathlessly from one thrilling car chase or dangerous situation to another. This was particularly true at the end, when every time it looked as if the situation was resolved, there was another roadblock to overcome.I did not see the original film but will seek it out. This ""Italian Job"" is clever, with some humor thrown in, and very exciting. A highly recommended rental.",The Italian Job
11,Quinoa1984,"See the preview to know the story, see the film out of curiosity...",6,15 October 2003,"This remake of the 1969 caper film (I haven't seen the original) is the kind of movie you watch on a night by yourself when nothing else is on TV.  You know you could watch better, or pop in a DVD, but since it's on you might as well see it through till it's pre-ordained climax.   If anything, it has its moments, notably from a A-list cast.After a successful heist in Venice, Sutherland's character wants to call it quits, or at least take a break.  But when Norton's character sets the crew up (which includes Wahlberg, Green, Def, and Statham) and kills off Sutherland, it puts the old crew into a shattered state.   Cut ahead months later and Wahlberg and Theron decide to get back at the conniving Norton, who has his own bit of wealth in Los Angeles, and assemble the old crew.Despite the obvious story, there are aspects of the Italian Job that kept me entertained, if not entirely excited or enthralled at the turns of the film. The supporting work from Green and Statham gets some laughs, and Norton delivers some fine work as well (though another heist film he co-starred in, The Score, is much better), and the action set-pieces remind the audience that Gray is a competent director.   Bottom line, this is one of those blockbuster-typos that came out during last summer and gave a just enough of a squeeze of popcorn-fun to compete with the other blockbusters.

13,michaelRokeefe,It's not just for the money. It's the job that counts.,6,26 March 2005,F. Gary Gray directs this rehash of a 1969 Michael Caine project of the same name. A group of expert criminal nice-guys led by career crooks Charlie Croker(Mark Wahlberg)and John Bridger(Donald Sutherland)successfully pull off the heist of $35 million in gold bricks in Venice. A crooked partner Steve Frezelli(Edward Norton)gets greedy and swindles the others out of their shares by hijacking the heist and leaving them for dead.

Charlie convinces John's safe-cracker expert daughter Stella(Charlize Theron)to help the crew steal the gold back. The movie seems to get better and really picks up the pace with mini Coopers racing through an engineered Los Angeles monster traffic jam.

It stars Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green, Jason Statham, Mos Def, and Donald Sutherland. It is a remake of the 1969 film of the same title and it is about a team of thieves who plan to steal gold from a former associate who double-crossed them.Charlie is the mastermind of a daring Venice heist and overseen by John, a lifelong criminal who plans to retire from the fold with the earnings from his most recent take. Basking in the glow of a job well done at a secluded retreat in the Alps, the thieves -- including the aptly-named Handsome Rob, tech-geek Lyle, and hearing-impaired quipster Left Ear are ruthlessly double-crossed by one of their own, the taciturn, calculating Steve Frezelli. Time passes and each member of the group finds himself pursuing other opportunities in the States, until Charlie rallies them together for a revenge-motivated scheme designed to bilk Steve of all his misbegotten earnings. In order to cinch the deal, he even enlists John's reluctant safecracking-prodigy daughter, Stella, for an elaborate, incognito Los Angeles heist. But the paranoid Steve proves himself to be one step ahead of them at just about every turn, and Charlie finds that he'll have to make some daring last-minute changes to their plan if the team is to succeed.F. Gary Gray has crafted a fun summer film packed with action, comedy, and a talented ensemble cast.Also,it offers some agreeably mindless fun in which the villains are truly villainous, the payback is satisfying in a purely infantile way, and the familiarity of everything is oddly comforting.Overall,it was an entertaining film thanks mainly to the charismatic cast.",The Italian Job

The surviving members regroup and convene in L.A. to enact revenge and recapture their gold ... the job is on!This could have been a complete disaster, I'm British and the wave of revulsion that boomed in my homeland upon hearing of this remake was explosive; ""how dare they remake a British institution"" was the cry. Things were not helped in the run up to the film's release by main star (and draw card) Edward Norton, proclaiming that the film was a contractual obligation and that fans of his work would be better advised to give The Italian Job a miss...Had to be a stinker then surely? Actually no it isn't. Director F. Gary Gray hasn't remade the ""Italian Job"" of 1969, in fact he hasn't even re-imaged it, the minis are in there, the gold is in there, but all the stand out moments so beloved by many in the 69 film of the same name are not to be seen at all. So what we get is a very cool heist-come revenge movie, that's maybe a tad too glossy at times, but it has got a pretty sharp script, tight action sequences and a group of actors working very well as a team. Mark Wahlberg, Mos Def, Jason Statham, Seth Green and the delectably delicious Charlize Theron all come out smelling of roses, whilst Edward Norton really had no cause for concern because his portrayal as Steve is a smarmy delight.I have jokingly titled this film ""Ocean's 5"", but that is in no way detrimental to ""The Italian Job"", it lacks the jazzy coolness of ""Soderbergh's Ocean's 11"", but it's a fun and enjoyable picture all in its own right, thus the rating of just under 7 IMDb is actually spot on. 7/10",The Italian Job
17,jotix100,The original was better.,6,12 June 2003,"Hollywood doesn't learn its lesson very well. This remake of the original English film with Michael Caine and Noel Coward, among others, should have been left alone, as it suffers in the translation to the American screen big time.This film also points out how can a great actor of the stature of Edward Norton, work so differently with two directors. In the 25th Hour"", he gives a great performance under Spike Lee's direction. Here, evidently surrounded by such mediocrity and directed without any spark by F. Gary Gray, he acts by the numbers. His being in this film was the only reason I adventured to go, in spite of reports of his conflict with this production. It is very noticeable how bad things must have been on that set.As capers on screen go, this one is only about car and helicopter chases. It just doesn't add anything to the genre. It also suffers from Mark Wahlberg's almost expressionless approach to this ""genius"" he is supposed to be within the gang. He exudes such blankness about himself that it's surprising that he is constantly cast in these types of roles where he could be more effective in another type of film.",The Italian Job
18,CinemaSerf,Adequate modern day heist caper.,6,17 October 2021,"Aside from carrying through the ""Bridger"" name (and he had nothing to do with the robbery either, being incarcerated during Her Majesty's pleasure), this has nothing at all to do with the 1969 film of the same name. This is just an excuse to assemble a decent cast, and have some fun. To that end, it works OK. A gang of clever thieves plan end execute a daring heist to steal a great deal of gold from an house in Italy. On their way out of the country, though, they are betrayed and left for dead in an icy reservoir. Spin on a year, and our gang - minus their leader Donald Sutherland (""Bridger"") have tracked down the traitor, and are determined to get their loot back. It's quite a charismatic effort this - Jason Statham as ""Handsome Rob""; Seth Green as they nerdy ""Lyle"" and Yasiin Bey ""Left Ear"" work with well the daughter of their murdered comrade ""Stella"" (Charlize Theron) to mastermind and execute this audacious theft. Sadly, though - Mark Wahlberg is pretty charm free, as is Edward Norton and the film takes far too long to build up anything like enough pace to get it interesting. The last twenty minutes are quite exciting, but for my money it was all too little too late. Good looking production, though - pity even the minis could not spice it up.",The Italian Job

A really entertaining movie but also a forgettable one.What makes ""The Italian Job"" a forgettable movie? Well, most likely it's the story which makes it forgettable, it's quite standard and not handled in the best way. With so many great and fun characters you would expect a better movie.The action sequences are nicely done, you can tell F. Gary Gray is a real action director. The movie has a good fast start and ending and nicely done car chases involving Mini's. I have a friend who drives a mini-cooper which now makes him officially a cool guy in my book.This movie shows that Seth Green is actually a good actor. Too bad that Mark Wahlberg and Edward Norton were not the two best casting choices from the movie, an extra shame because they were the two main characters in the movie.The movie has some nice musical moments by John Powell and a good pace and atmosphere but overall that can't help it that this movie is a forgettable one. I don't think it's a good idea that they are making ""The Italian Job II"" right now, a pointless sequel to a forgettable movie, even though I will probably still watch it when it arrives on DVD.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Italian Job
20,view_and_review,No honor amongst thieves,8,13 March 2007,"For the most part, I hate thieves. Yet it amazes me how Hollywood can get me to appreciate the skill involved in stealing, even if for a couple of hours. Movies such as ""The Heist"", ""Ocean's Eleven"", and ""The Italian Job"" are just the movies to make me forget about my despise for thieves.Edward Norton plays the familiar weasel role that he played in another burglary movie, ""The Score"", with Robert DeNiro. In this movie he plays Steve, a member of a gang of master thieves led by John Bridger (Donald Sutherland). After the gang successfully lifts untold millions in gold from Italy, Steve double crosses them all and takes the gold for himself.What makes a movie about stealing good is the creativity that the thieves use in stealing. Even though they are committing a crime, there is a certain level of appreciation for a person doing a craft well. ""The Italian Job"" was about innovative ways to do the impossible, much like the other theft movies I mentioned. The acting was acceptable from Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Seth Green, Mos Def, and the others, but the focus was never on the actors. All of the movie's stock was in the scheme.

Sure, it uses some of the same elements -some characters with the same names, 3 minis, a carefully planned heist, a robbery/chase where they drive through all sorts of unexpected places, traffic chaos arising from overriding the official system etc. But all those elements are used in a completely different story to the original with completely different character dynamics.I liked it. Importantly, there was so much that was different in the story that I never felt the need to compare it to the original.Mark Wahlberg, low-rent action protagonist, was marginally less inexpressive than usual, and the rest of the cast gave reliable performances. A special mention must go to Seth Green, occupying the Benny Hill slot as official bollixer of traffic lights - a quite different character (no big ladies for a start off!) but still a very funny performance.The original is still out there, folks, and it's still great, but this version has a lot going for it - don't discount it.",The Italian Job

Today's giant movie screens and earth rumbling sound systems make action films an exhilarating experience.  Throw in a nice story and some eye candy and it is truly a blast.  OK the story is just a reshaping of the original with Michael Caine, but the added humor - mostly supplied by Seth Green (""Austin Powers"" and ""Knockaround Guys"") and the super cool guys - Jason Statham, Marky Mark and veteran Donald Sutherland add a punch to this one.  Who am I kidding?  The big difference here is the eye candy!  The mini-Coopers and Charlize Theron add a touch of Bond.  Whether the stunner is driving the fun cars or cracking a safe in her hotel room, she is captivating.  The films weak link is the usually dependable Edward Norton who seems to be sleep walking through his role. Maybe he has reached the point where he feels he deserves more screen time. His role is important, but his lackluster performance doesn't ruin the film at all.  Would have enjoyed seeing what a meatier performance could have added to the film, though.

23,anaconda-40658,Not As Good a Job as What Michael Caine Delivered.,4,23 June 2015,"The Italian Job (2003): Dir: F. Gary Grey / Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Jason Statham, Donald Sutherland: The title doesn't describe the film as a whole but it is a remake of a much better film. The characters had potential but none have personalities. They are double crossed after a heist. Those remaining narrowly avoid death and plot revenge a year later with plans to steal the gold bars they originally stole. Setup isn't new but structure details the operation. The conclusion more or less glorifies crime. Director F. Gary Grey previously made the cliché filled farce The Negotiator. Mark Wahlberg is no Michael Caine but he does pull off the desire for revenge after a hefty double cross. After devising the plan he is assisted by Charlize Theron who plays the daughter of his deceased boss who was murdered during the opening sabotage. Both are driven by revenge, which serves against any sympathy in the end. Edward Norton plays a double crossing sleaze who learns that his intelligence is outmatched. Other roles are not as broad although Jason Statham is featured among the supporting cast. Donald Sutherland plays their former boss and Theron's father but the role isn't very broad. It substitutes the original's humour for action with little purpose. The result is an action film that doesn't represent Italy let alone get the job done. Score: 4 ½ / 10",The Italian Job
24,gradyharp,The Snap and Polish of a fie Topkapi-type Caper,9,1 January 2012,"THE Italian JOB has style and a grand sense of speed and action in one of the better caper films of recent years. Where other heist-based films push the button for unremitting tension, THE Italian JOB combines sleekly written dialogue and character interaction which makes all of the tension scenes (and there are plenty) all the more credible. The photography of the inevitable car chases and 'inside shots' of the capers is terrific, with the scenes set in Venice, Italy among the best. The cast is electrically charged without that all too familiar over-the-top push. Donald Sutherland and Charlize Theron (father/daughter team) are superb, and Mark Wahlberg, Jason Statham, Seth Green, Mos Def, and Franky G establish a camaraderie that is destined to overcome their betraying partner Edward Norton. With a cast like this you almost don't need a script, but the writing has a fine balance of bite and wit. For sheer explosive entertainment by a crew of winners this movie is among the best in this genre. Grady Harp, January 12",The Italian Job
25,SimonJack,Modern technical version of original film,7,15 May 2015,"This Paramount film is a remake of the 1969 movie of the same name that was a very good comedy caper. This 2003 version of ""The Italian Job"" doesn't measure up to the first film, but it is entertaining in its own right. This film is sans the comedy, and in place of that with the clever scheming in the original, this second rendition is all modern. That means lots of technical, electronic, mechanical, scientific caper stuff. I do enjoy these films, but find that they tend to be awful formulaic absent a good and different plot.The highly technical aspects of some films render them almost sci-fi movies. This one is an example. While the final plan of this plot may be technically feasible (very doubtful at that), it's so implausible that it is more sci-fi than crime caper. Of course, that makes it more of an action thriller as well.The cast are a quite good. Donald Sutherland isn't on screen very long. Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, and Charlize Theron play their roles very well. The rest of the cast fit their roles to a T. The film location scenes in Venice and the Alps are beautiful, and reminiscent of having been to those places. The crowded Los Angeles streets and scenes are Los Angeles.This is an enjoyable action film to watch, but there's not much suspense to it. Be sure to watch the 1969 film that stars Michael Caine, Noel Coward, Benny Hill and Raf Valone.The best line in this film is from Sutherland's John Bridger: ""How many times do I have to tell you. I trust everyone. I just don't trust the devil inside them.""",The Italian Job
26,whpratt1,Lots of Action,7,21 November 2008,"Enjoyed this wild adventure from Italy, Philadelphia, Hollywood with plenty of car chases, comedy, drama and a small amount of romance. Charlize Theron, (Stella Bridger) was the good looking gal throughout the entire picture wearing a French Twist as her hairdo and being a fantastic safe cracker. Stella took a liking to Charlie Croker, (Mark Wahlberg) put kept him at a distance because she had a great deal of revenge against a certain man who harmed her family. John Bridger, (Donald Sutherland) played the father to Stella, however, she was a very young girl at the time and he had other endeavors to keep him busy. This is a very entertaining film with a OH-6 Observation Helicopter from the Viet-Nam era chasing down Hollywood Blvd after a car and causing major traffic jams.

27,namashi_1,Killer Time-Pass...,8,11 July 2010,"A remake of the 1969 British film of the same name, 'The Italian Job' comes up a winner. The 1969 cult-hit, in 2003 was revised with it's technology and style. I haven't had the pleasure of watching the original which personified the 'heist' theme, but I surely can say, I know what 'The Italian Job' is all about.The film is about a team of thieves who plan to steal gold bullion from a former associate who double crossed them. The film scores big time, mainly because it entertains you from start to end. Stylish and Accomplished, filmmaker F.Gary Gray pays homage to his favorite film and has done his job exceedingly well. He's a fan of the film he's making, and that's quite visible throughout. The action sequences are amazing. The climax, is spell-binding.In the acting department, Mark Wahlberg is fantastic. The actor lives his character from start to end. Charlize Theron looks a billion bucks, and delivers a truly fine performance. Seth Green is terrific and provides comic moments. Jason Statham is perfect. Mos Def is good. Edward Norton is a bore this time. Donald Sutherland is okay in a cameo.Watch this heist remake... it entertains and has it's moments to leave you talking and thinking about it. Thumbs Up!",The Italian Job
28,JamesHitchcock,There are remakes and then there are remakes.,5,29 November 2010,"There are remakes and then there are remakes. At one extreme is Gus Van Sant's recent shot-for-shot version of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", not so much a remake as a carbon copy. At the other extreme you would have something like the Robert de Niro/Sean Penn ""We're No Angels"", officially a remake of a Humphrey Bogart comedy from the fifties but having virtually nothing in common with it beyond the title and a storyline about escaped convicts.The 2003 ""Italian Job"" comes somewhere in the middle, although perhaps nearer to the ""We're No Angels"" end of the scale. Like its British namesake from 1969 it is a heist film about a bullion robbery. It keeps the names of some of the characters and part of it is set in Italy. It features a complicated plot to steal the gold involving the modern version of the Mini Cooper, a piece of product placement quite as blatant as that in the original film. The plot, however, is quite different; there is, for example, no equivalent of the famous ""cliff-hanging"" ending.In this version Charlie Croker and most of his gang are American rather than British, although there is one Englishman among them, played by Jason Statham. This is perhaps unsurprising; the film was, after all, made by an American studio, Paramount Pictures, although given that the original was never a great success in the States I am surprised that Hollywood showed any interest in remaking it. There are in fact two robberies featured in the film, the first taking place in Venice where Croker and his gang succeed in stealing a large amount of gold and making their getaway in speedboats in a sequence doubtless inspired by a similar one in the James Bond film ""Moonraker"". Unfortunately, one of the gang, Steve, betrays his colleagues, shooting one, John Bridger, dead and making off with the gold himself. (Bridger, older and more experienced than the rest of the gang, is the rough equivalent of his namesake played by Noel Coward in the 1969 film, although unlike that character he is not currently serving a jail sentence).Croker and his surviving comrades swear to get revenge by stealing the gold back from Steve. In this they have the assistance of Bridger's beautiful daughter Stella, a character with no equivalent on the original film, which had no major female characters. Stella has inherited her father's skills as a safe cracker, although unlike him she has hitherto only used those skills for lawful purposes, using them to assist the police. Her desire for revenge on her father's murderer, however, leads her to throw her lot in with Croker. (Inevitably, the two fall in love). The rest of the film tells how the team manage to double-cross Steve, retrieve the loot and make their getaway through the streets of Los Angeles in a trio of Mini Coopers.As in the original, the three cars are red, white and blue, but here no patriotic significance attaches to those colours. The original film was markedly nationalistic in tone- the message seemed to be ""We Brits may no longer have an empire, but we are still better at stealing things than Johnny Foreigner""- but, fortunately, the remake does make similarly jingoistic claims on behalf of the American criminal fraternity. Nor does it replace ""Rule Britannia"" and ""God Save the Queen"" on the soundtrack with ""America the Beautiful"" or ""The Star-Spangled Banner"".Because the two films are so different in terms of plot, it is difficult trying to compare them. In the end I gave both the same average mark because I did not enjoy either very much, although I disliked them for different reasons. The 1969 version is marked by a certain amount of originality, and has two charismatic stars in Coward and Michael Caine, although I dislike the nasty xenophobia which lurks just below the surface veneer of smug patriotism.The 2003 version is at least free of xenophobic tendencies (something one cannot say about all recent American films), but has little except its connection to its famous predecessor to distinguish it from a morass of similar movies. Apart from Donald Sutherland who gets killed early on, none of the cast displays any charisma, least of all Mark Wahlberg who replaces Caine as Croker. As usual, Charlize Theron looks better than she acts, and I was surprised to see Edward Norton, an actor I normally associate with more intellectual fare than this, as Steve. (Apparently he was obliged to take the part for contractual reasons). As with the original, most of the interest lies in the action sequences, especially the getaway, but overall but this is little more than a standard-issue heist movie. 5/10",The Italian Job

He was such a jerk, can't use the word I really want to use with him, so he's past a jerk. :D I would recommend ""The Italian Job"" to action lovers.

30,=G=,Junk food for the tween mind,5,7 October 2003,"""The Italian Job"" (2003), a commercial product after the tween/teen buck, is an uninspired action flick with a very soft PG-13 rating and a simple-minded make-it-up-as-you-go plot about a bunch of thieves (the good guys) who are after 7 tons of gold and another thief (the bad guy). A mindless mess of Hollywood action busyness, this flick might have been worth watching if any of the stunts or chases or techno-babble had been new, creative, or unique. However, this turkey is just more of the same-o same-o we've all seen before sprinkled with some contempo buzz words in a new wrapper.

31,cherold,acceptable caper film,6,8 July 2005,"This film is one of those that gets such a slow start that I considered giving up on it. In spite of the presence of Donald Sutherland, the first half hour is a rather dull setup for what follows.Fortunately, the movie picks up as planning starts for the caper that is the centerpiece of the film. I developed some hope for the movie during a series of vignettes introducing members of the gang. From then on things were pretty good, and the extended caper sequence itself was quite entertaining.Still, the movie feels hollow. Theron is unconvincing, simply because she looks like she just stepped out of a shampoo commercial. The cars in the movie all have that shiny look of something in a car commercial. It's not that I object to glossy caper films; the 1960s was very good at those, but this movie lacks the overall polish so the glossy slick elements don't feel integrated into the whole.

Mark Wahlberg seems to spoil every film he plays in, and Charleze Theron will put completely her career on a dead end if she continues to pick scripts like this.

39,sol-,Less a remake; more a homage,7,27 December 2015,"More a homage to the 1969 heist caper than a true remake, the 2003 'The Italian Job' fascinatingly takes place in a universe in which the Michael Caine film exists with our heroes plotting to carry out a heist and ""do it like 'The Italian Job'"". What similarities exist between the films are entirely due to the characters here taking inspiration, and the parallels are very few, one chase sequence aside. With an essentially new plot, we are treated to better fleshed out characters. Donald Sutherland only appears briefly, but the surrogate father bond between him and Mark Wahlberg (in the Caine role) is so strong that it provides ample motivation. The chemistry between the characters sizzles more here too. There is a lot of great repartee and some genuine laugh-out-loud bits, such as Seth Green imitating Jason Statham, accent and all. More interesting as the characters may be though, the performances are not quite as good. Wahlberg is particularly ineffectual - too withdrawn and uncharismatic for the leader of his gang, and his predictable romance with Charlize Theron lacks sparks. Some of the stunt work is also a tad over-elaborate. There is an instance in which Wahlberg survives a glass window shattering in his face without any cuts or bruises. For the most part though, this is a very impressive remake, just as effective upon revision, and if it were not for a corny ending, one might even argue it as superior to the original.",The Italian Job

It was amazing to see Wahlberg, Stratham, and Franky G all together because they are all very muscular individuals. Gawtti had a really good performance and he reminded Me of the legendary wrestler Yokozuna. The action is really good and the car chases are excellent.

41,Floated2,Great heist film,7,9 September 2010,"Those are just a few to grace this cast. I don't know what it is about heist film always having all-star casts but gotta love it. On to the movie, its about a group of thieves who steal $35 million in gold only to have a member of their crew (Norton) double-cross them to take the gold for himself and leave the crew for dead. Well don't you know it the crew survives (minus one) and want payback. Thus introduce car chases, neat gizmos, cool cars, and lots of humour, while attempting to be serious.I didn't have high expectations for this film because by the trailer it looked rather cheesy, but that doesn't mean that I didn't want to see it. I have to say that I like most of Mark Wahlberg's films, but I don't like him as an actor. He was mostly mono-tone throughout the whole film, even when trying to be saddened or mad. He showed virtually no personality, no charisma. The rest of the cast was a joy to watch, fitting their characters perfectly. I have to highlight Seth Green and Jason Statham. All of Seth Green's films are just so great because he comes off so slick and smooth in his character. Edward Norton is a great villain and really worked by the response of the audience at my theatre, I heard one person calling him an asshole after killing someone (won't say who).The car chase scene was worth the wait, nothing really special but pulled off well. Its a change of pace from SUV's or Ferraris. The one thing that might happen is throughout the film you will either say ""yeah right, like thats possible"" or you will be enjoying the film and not care. I enjoyed this film with a few exceptions, I would of liked to see a lead with more personality but it didn't hinder the film. There is actually a pretty good back plot (won't tell what), and great side characters. I will say one thing, ""skinny Pete"", you will know what I mean when you see it. As a rewatch 06.11.20' and nearly 10 years since the initial watch in September 2010, opinions remain the same. Great fun, entertaining and occasionally light heist film.

It was a modern remake of one of the most famous British crime films of all time which STARRED one of the most famous British crime actors of all time; Michael Caine. However, I was proved wrong and I'm glad that I was.The ball is set in motion very impressively in the city of Venice when the gang and main actors attempt to rob some gold. One of the actors in this case was Jason Statham who played the character of 'Handsome Rob' I enjoyed his performances in two other great films of 'Snatch' and 'Lock, Stock' and he gives another great performance here as well. Each character has a certain uniqueness about them and we really seem to 'get to know them' as the film wears on.Impressive stunts and chases, madcap ideas in the form of manipulating L.A's traffic light system AND quite a few moments where you just can't work out what'll happen next or what'll happen now that a certain event HAS just happened. Each scene there is something new and unique about it that was different to the last scene. Something happens that moves the plot along. Something is either said or done by one of the characters that will make you either chuckle or continue watching with interest, something that I can only praise the scriptwriters for.I thought this new version of The Italian Job was well worth the money and the time spent watching it.

44,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Italian Job"" nails down all the elements of a fun, modern heist film",8,13 August 2008,"""The Italian Job"" is a great getaway film and we're not just talking about robbery getaways. This movie never bores and is solely focused on action, technology and crime strategy lore, moving along at a brisk pace and giving the bare amount of drama to provide fuel for its characters and story line. It's a 110 minute vacation that has all its bases covered, delivering a smooth ride with little to no chinks. While it may be a remake that doesn't really improve on the original, it successfully defines itself in a modern context as a fun heist flick.The film takes us straight to Italy for a job being done by well-acquainted accomplices. There's the mastermind John (Donald Sutherland), his protégé Charlie (Mark Wahlberg), the odd explosives expert named Left Ear (Mos Def), the trying-to-be-cool hacker (Seth Green), the lady's man driving expert Handsome Rob (Jason Statham) and the inside guy (Edward Norton). This is a pretty good ensemble with a wide array of talents. Wahlberg doesn't carry this film and that's how it should be. It's a very ""Ocean's Eleven"" style formula, but director F. Gary Gray gives this film its own more relaxed vibe, limiting the comparisons.The job is successful, but after the getaway, Norton's character goes rogue and takes the loot for himself. He retreats to California and the guys plan to get it back, with the help of Charlize Theron. The rest of the film they devise their plans and execute them, with the script incorporating character development into those scenes. Still, it's not particularly dialogue heavy and no moments ever lag.This is not a very flashy heist film like ""Ocean's Eleven."" The action and car chases are much more subdued, with little gunfire and no extravagant crashes or explosions. It's not going to wow you, unless you're a 30-year-old single woman who loves Mini Coopers, but it's definitely creative. The elements of the heist will interest you if you're into that whole crime strategy stuff, though there's no unforeseeable twists. Best of all, the drama is minimal and not distracting from the film's objective of pure entertainment.So ""Italian Job"" doesn't exactly raise the bar with action/heist films, but it understands the genre and knows how to deliver it the right way, providing exactly the kind of entertainment one would expect watching this kind of film.",The Italian Job
45,Anonymous_Maxine,"Follows the formula, but at least does it with style and creativity.",9,23 June 2003,"Contains spoiler The first thing I heard about The Italian Job was that it had a car chase in it that was supposed to be better than the one in The Matrix Reloaded. I'm not sure I would go that far, but there is no denying that there is some great action in this movie. It is, admittedly, an hour and forty minute Mini Cooper commercial, and it definitely follows the typical formula of a heist movie, but there are subtle differences that make it more than worth watching.Seth Green plays the part of Lyle, who I'll just describe as exactly the same character that he played in Enemy of the State to save time, but he provides some of the most entertaining scenes in the film. The creation of the `Los Angeles' largest traffic jam ever' (although I'm SURE I've been stuck in worse than that in that place) is the movies main attraction, and Lyle creates it with suck geeky style that he makes it cool to be a computer nerd again.(spoilers) Charlize Theron plays Stella Bridger, the daughter of John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), whose vicious murder provides much of the drive for the conflict of the entire film. Stella plays the beautiful blonde with a whole world of possibilities open to her because she's so intelligent and strong, and then she is sent into an emotional turmoil for most of the film. So basically exactly the same character she played in The Devil's Advocate, Reindeer Games, The Astronaut's Wife, Mighty Joe Young, The Legend of Bagger Vance, Men of Honor, 15 Minutes, etc.Donald Sutherland is, of course, his usual badass self, with a calm and collected cool that is rivaled only by such greats as Jack Nicholson and Clint Eastwood. He is an actor who naturally portrays characters who have plans that go just a little beyond what is spoken aloud (except, of course, for the character he played in Backdraft). In a movie that's populated almost entirely by stereotyped characters, it's nice that at least one of the caricatures is not routine and boring.Mark Wahlberg is another caricature, but he is also not boring just because it's so much fun to watch him be p***ed off and seeking revenge. I've always thought that he had a tiny bit of a hard time playing anything other than a former-musician-turned-actor, but he definitely has his own style which fits perfectly with his role in The Italian Job.And then there is Edward Norton, one of today's few young actors who promises to ultimately obtain as much skill in portraying diverse characters as people like Tom Hanks and Dustin Hoffman, who are so good at what they do that they can literally play any role in the world should the need arise. One of the only things that I was a little apprehensive about when I went to see The Italian Job was that I knew Norton was going to play the bad guy, and I have always been so staggered by his performances in movies like Primal Fear and American History X that I was a little bummed that I would have to watch him caught and probably killed in this movie (thankfully I was spared the latter, which is more than can be said of movies in similar situations, like Training Day).Despite my opinion that Edward Norton's role as the bad guy was initially a little disappointing to me, it also turned out to be one of the best parts of the movie, and not only because Norton is such a spectacularly talented actor, some credit also goes to the writers in this category. As a whole, The Italian Job doesn't stray too far from the typical heist movie formula, but the thing that really makes it interesting as we're led to the ending that we always knew we would see is that the villain, Norton, is not a complete moron, as villains quite often are.When the rest of the team finds him, a year after he betrayed them to steal the $35 million worth of gold that they stole together (in an opening sequence that rivals any one in any James Bond movie ever made), we get some pleasant surprises in a movie that never really promised to have many. Stella goes to his house as the cable-repair technician and ends up on a date with him, and when they're out to dinner, she doesn't easily deceive him with her beauty as long as she needs to, giving him wildly revealing death looks all the while as you would see in the typical heist movie, but he has caught on to her and tricks her into revealing her identity as well. Norton plays a villain that is aware of his surroundings, he's not reckless and ignorant and protected only by the mistakes of his pursuers, as would normally be the case.This intelligence goes on into the thrilling final action sequence, where he places his gold in one of three armored trucks in order to confuse his pursuers, who he knows are watching every move he makes. I was a little disappointed that the movie took the nosedive at the end where it is explained that every character took his share of the gold and went and bought exactly what they wanted (they did everything here but include the phrase Happily Ever After), but I guess that's the price you pay for getting to have an interesting and entertaining ride to the ending that you already knew you would see. As a whole the movie is about as predictable as they come, but at least they came up with some new things along the way. Given the amount of movies of all genres these days that don't even bother to do that much, this one is a breath of fresh air.",The Italian Job

Time pass and they manage to locate their betrayer. And now it's up to them to pull a heist against one of their own to get their loot back. It's workable, if not particularly inspired.And that's probably the biggest problem with this film. It's workmanlike. Everything in it is as it should be, but at the same time it's very formulaic and nothing new is really added to the tired and old clichés.That being said, it's a fun film to watch. All the actors are clearly having fun with it. Most notably Seth Green, who's having an absolute blast with every scene he's in. Edward Norton is as great as ever, although the script doesn't give him much to work with. I do hope they had given the main characters, mainly Wahlberg and Theron, a bit more to chew, but as I've said: workmanlike.The Italian Job is a great watch if you're a fan of caper films. If you're not, it's still a relatively short, breezy film that's sure to keep you entertained.",The Italian Job
48,elshikh4,"An Old Joke ? A Rat Race ? Well, It's The American Job !",6,21 September 2007,"Once upon time, there was a nice crazy movie named (The Italian Job - 1969), and it was just pure fun. As the years passed by, it became a classic, to the extent that some of its simple lines turned into the most memorable ones in the history of cinema! So why after 34 years, Hollywood would remake it?Ok, consider it as one of the usual events in the 2000s, when Hollywood declared bankruptcy, or just about to, with very few original screenplays for the commercial movies. So you would have all the time: A remake of an old movie, part 2 and 3.. etc. of that remake of that old movie, sequels for another movie which have nothing to do with it except for the utilization of its popularity, and some movies that are based on previous comics, video games, TV series, American movies, or French, British or Japanese movies.. and so on and on and on. It seemed that the producers began to see ""new ideas"" as the devil, so they aimed at secure formulas from old sources!With its joyful atmosphere, new third act, and unfinished ending, the original British movie was an explosive cinematic joke. And when you repeat an old joke, what you'll have is unfunny one. So maybe this Italian Job's makers realized that early; therefore, made totally another thing. But was that thing excellent as a whole? I don't think so!For one reason, the pale cast, or perhaps they're good stars who were so pale in here! (Mark Wahlberg) as (Charlie Croker)?! Com'on! His face had no features to act. And who played that character before?! The honorable Mr. (Michael Caine)! Poor (Wahlberg) was in a real deadlock, especially with his icy performance as the cool (Croker) who was here cool as inanimate or lifeless! (Edward Norton) said once that he hated the part, and just made the movie to terminate his contract with the production company. You can watch him here on the brink of mocking at the traditional role and dialogue. One of these times is so obvious at the restaurant scene. And, for the love of God, aren't both of them, (Wahlberg) and (Norton), so terribly young to be those expert thieves?! Also, I felt pity for (Charlize Theron). What a fake performance she gave!So nearly that entire cast was deadly cold, and by all means director (F. Gary Gray) was the responsible. However, as always, the producers thought that the good action would save the day, forgetting that it wouldn't save EVERY DAY. As if watching (Theron) doing her driving without stunt would compensate for her insipid acting!There is no deep connection with the original; I should say the inspiration instead, except for the plan of stealing gold by breakdown the traffic, and escaping in mini cars. But while the script has a new ball game, with Five Samurai in heist / revenge against an evil guy, the conflict is flat. You know so well that this intolerant, less intelligent, evil guy will be vanquished easily by this confident and creative team, which cracks the movie's foundation, and weakens everything; even the general amusing feel after the viewing. Because one of the ""writing"" secrets is in the antagonist's characterization. Feeding him with more power and smartness makes the conflict more hot and attractive. But this script just didn't care about any of that!Nevertheless, it has some fine fun. (Seth Green) was great, stealing the show from the rest. And technically, it's dexterous; all the action is expensively done, and masterly directed, as the only perfect thing in here. But when it comes to the climax, I found myself saying: ""OK, I've seen that before, and it had a spirit too!"".Well, it's an old joke trying to be a new one by adding some slight fresh things; like a different plot, or technical updating, but totally without (The Italian Job - 1969)'s surprise effect, or pristine craziness, which made it more naughty, clever and original. This time, while being fairly entertaining, it's merely another project done with no desire to be extraordinary. I though they shouldn't connect it to the 1969 movie in the first place, that wasn't for the sake of anything but fooling us, and degrading them!It's like the situation between (It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World - 1963) and (Rat Race - 2001), 2 years earlier. Which reminds me; when we'll witness the end of this wearisome rat race of remakes as the biggest, and feeblest, American jobs ever?!",The Italian Job
49,meeza,Mini-Cooper Saves The Day!,6,20 July 2004,"`The Italian Job' is not based on the documentary of my favorite restaurant Pauloluigi. Hey Paulo! Free plug there! What about sponsoring my weekly movie review show? Anyway, `The Italian Job' stars Mark Wahlberg as Charlie Croker, a renegade brigand who is on a vengeance journey against a former colleague who violently betrayed him. We have experienced this plot development before numerous times, so that is why I feel they should have changed the title of this film to `The Battalion Job'.  Yes, the same old redundant premise of a protagonist seeking revenge to a former friend who is now a present foe. Charlize Theron co-stars as Stella Bridger, the safe breaker who joins up the Marky Mark `Steeler' team. Even though  it is a safe bet to say that Charlize looks hot, her work here was a dull & unchallenging one. Obviously, unlike her daring Oscar-winning performance in `Monster'. Edward Norton disappoints here as Steve, the bad boy nemesis. However, I must state that `The Italian Job' does present a marvelous exhibition of product placement. Which product you ask? As if you did not know; let's just say, we will call it: `Mini-Cooper'. These stylish transports will drive you crazy to purchase one. `The Italian Job' had plenty of pasta but was a bit cheesy.

50,jimbo-53-186511,Slick and lots of fun,7,16 June 2015,"Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) assembles a crack team to pull off one last job; a daring heist of a safe which contains $35 million dollars worth of gold bars. However, shortly after the heist has been completed, one of the team turns against the others and escapes with the gold and leaves the remaining members of the team for dead. Following this betrayal, Charlie and his crack team which includes computer genius Lyle (Seth Green), explosives expert Left Ear (Mos Def), and getaway driver Handsome Rob (Jason Statham) set to work in recovering the gold back from the 'rat' in the group with the assistance of safe cracker Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron).I saw the 1969 version of The Italian Job some time ago and remember finding it reasonably enjoyable (although I recall it having a rather bizarre ending). However, I have to admit to possibly enjoying this remake/reboot slightly more....I think the biggest strength of this film lies with the characters and their dialogues; as we're introduced to each character we're given a little bit of background information on each character in order to explain away their relevant 'expertise' but it's done in a way that was both funny and clever. I quite liked the way that each character was set-up in this way. I also felt a great sense of camaraderie between the cast; the whole production was done in a very slick and tongue in cheek manner; I thought the scenes between Green and Statham were the funniest and strongest scenes, but the rest of the cast were all great as well.Another big strength with this film is that it's just so much fun; some heists films have a tendency to become over-plotted and throw in twist after twist. However, with the Italian Job we're just given a straight-forward plot, but yet it's still entertaining enough to keep you interested.The chase sequences are fun, the direction, editing and basically all technical areas are also excellent resulting in a film that's not only fun, but it's also quite a good looking film too.Perhaps having low expectations helped here - I thought the original was a good film rather than a great one so I wasn't expecting much here, but the plot moved along almost as fast as the Minis, the script and the camaraderie between the cast were also top notch and above all else it was fun. Definitely worth watching (especially if you were a fan of the original).",The Italian Job

Mark Whalberg takes the lead here as a master thief out to retake the gold stolen from his gang after they pilfered it from a palazzo in Venice.The entire cast is of course fantastic and works well together, playing off each other and I enjoyed the non-romance between Wahlberg and (a very beautiful) Charlize Theron.The opening heist that takes place in Venice, including speed boat chases through the canals, safes falling through multiple floors of buildings and underwater shenanigans is thrilling and super well done as is the ensuing double cross (poor Donald Sutherland) and escape.I also liked the (I guess iconic) Mini Cooper chase scene towards the end, on train tracks, down stairs etc. Very cool.Ultimately this was an okay movie for me, not fantastic as it dragged a bit in the middle but one of those classic (remakes) that you just have to see. 12/26/14",The Italian Job

Edward Norton is wasted as a one-dimensional villain; even Wahlberg's character disparages him as lacking imagination. At least for once a distinction is made between Ukrainian and Russian criminals.There's a fun cover version of Pink Floyd's ""Money"" by Scott Weiland, Slash, Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum (last 3 are ex-members of Guns 'N' Roses) in the movie twice at least, but is NOT on the soundtrack CD.It is nice to see that the robbers' goal is to catch an Amtrak train; public and freight transportation could use the plug.

A former master-thief returns from retirement when the opportunity to steal a lot (and I mean a lot) of gold appears. The heist is highly successful but the group is betrayed, the gold taken and the old master-thief shot dead. Now it is time for revenge. However, the group that originally did the heist need help from the daughter of the dead thief.Unfortunately, the movie in itself fails to produce any major surprises. One can sense some possibilities for plot-twists but they are never realized. In addition, the actors do not make any award-winning performances. None is bad, in my opinion, but they do not make anything extra out of it either. This doesn't mean the movie is bad. It is really entertaining to see the spectacular solutions the have to make their heist work. The stunts is good any the plot is entertaining even if it as mentioned fails to surprise. In addition, there are at least a few nice cinematic touches (or did I invent them for myself?) one might enjoy.So, if you like heist-movies, or action in general this is a movie for you.

I assumed people like Mark Wahlberg, Charlise Thieron and Ed Norton were in this movie, but they looked like something ripped out of `Simone.' Has Pixar finally replaced the human actor? It sure as hell felt like it with this film, as everyone involved went through their scenes with tongue-in-cheek dialogue and virtually expressionless looks of pain on their faces. Norton had a reason for blowing off this movie due to a contractual obligation, but what was everyone else's excuse. When Mos Def is your most sincere and most likable character, what does that tell you?

57,adamjohns-42575,Not very Italian.,4,7 March 2021,"I'm not sure that there's enough of the original here to call this ""The Italian Job"", instead it's a bit more like 'James Bond' gets together with 'Ocean's 11' with hints of 'Now You See Me' and they used the character names from the Michael Caine version to make it seem like a remake.That being said, as films of this ilk go, it's generally not that bad in its own right (If you discount any connection to doing a job in Italy). I might have been more impressed if I had seen it upon its release instead of 14 years later. Years that have been filled with some pretty amazing double-cross, heist and mobster films. As such I've kind of seen all of this before.Mark does a good job, but there's nothing about him that stands out as particularly different to any other character he has played.
Seth Green is incredibly enjoyable as the comic relief too.
Mr Norton on the other hand. I just want to repeatedly slap him around the face with a flip flop and not just in this film. Something about him just rubs me up the wrong way. In this film I want to rip off the stupid bit of hair below his lip.Also, the mini chase is far too short.If you're in to your 'Fast And Furious', 'James Bond' and anything by Guy Ritchie or featuring Jason Statham then you will probably enjoy this one, but if you want to see a remake of 'The Italian Job' featuring Michael Caine, then give up and watch the original instead.",The Italian Job

This is a movie where,like Ocean's 11, you can't leave your seat for even 1 minute or you'll miss something important(trust me I did.)

And I'm sure a ton of other stuff I wasn't paying attention to while watching this last night. The marketing boys at Mini Coop must have gave the director a set amount of minutes that the car was required to be in the movie for. It is frankly annoying and takes you out of some of the movie. There is a scene where the stupid mini coopers jump out of a tunnel and crash face first into the ground but a minute later you see absolutely no damage on them.

61,rosscinema,Unrelenting action!,6,23 June 2003,"This is your basic remake of an old caper film and while it has nothing new to offer as far as the plot is concerned, the action sequences are thrilling to watch. The story is about an older thief named John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) who is in Venice with his gang and they steal 35 million dollars in gold bars but when they are in the Alps they are ambushed by a bunch of armed men headed by Steve (Edward Norton) who is in their gang as well. John is killed and Steve takes off with the bars. A year later Charlie (Mark Wahlberg) gets the gang together again and have tracked Steve down in Los Angeles. The gang consists of Handsome Rob (Jason Statham), Left Ear (Mos Def), Lyle (Seth Green) and they also enlist Johns daughter Stella (Charlize Theron) who is an expert safe cracker. They elaborate a scheme to steal back the gold bars and the action never lets up. Sounds like a very familiar story and it is but director F. Gary Gray does a very wise thing with this material. Its loaded with car and boat chases with helicopters and the way they steal the gold bars is actually pretty creative. The action never really ceases much so the film never becomes boring. Forget about logic, this is one of those summer films that you can just sit back and enjoy. Its nowhere near being a great film like Michael Mann's ""Thief"", but it is a little better than ""Swordfish"" minus a beautiful actress getting topless. Edward Norton has stated that he only did this film out of a contractual agreement but he does seem to be having fun playing a real bad guy. His character Steve is your cliche' backstabber but he is enjoyable to watch. Seth Green has the funniest moments in the film as Lyle who insists that he is the original Napster and doesn't generate much respect from his fellow gang members. If you go and see this film you can expect the same story you have seen many times before but the characters are engaging and the theft itself of the gold bars is done in a very exciting manner. Sit back and have fun!",The Italian Job
62,lemon_magic,"Slick, amusing caper film; Gray's best movie featuring Davis' best soundtrack",7,11 December 2005,"My reaction to this remake of ""The Italian Job"" is probably hopelessly mixed up with the events occurring in my life when I saw it; This is the first movie I saw after I had just landed a job after 8 months of unemployment and going back to school for retraining. Money was still tight, but I no longer had to choose between seeing a movie in the theaters and paying bills (or eating lunch), and the sense of relief and gratitude I was feeling at the time was enormous. In consequence, my enjoyment of ""Italian Job"" was probably far out of proportion to its actual worth. Still, I picked it up used on DVD a few weeks ago and watched it again, and I still enjoyed it immensely. I have never seen the original (though I have heard it is an absolute classic), but its modern day counterpart is eminently watchable if you have a taste for modern day production values applied to older films plots and themes. What initially won me over to this movie was the soundtrack - IMO Don Davis writes some of the most supple, textured and aurally pleasing soundtracks around. IJ opens with a sly, witty, pulsing arrangement that combines strings, guitar harmonics, brush work and quiet moments - it won me over completely from the opening seconds. And the whole movie is like this - I haven't heard this kind of ringing, chiming, pulsing soundtrack music since Stewart Copeland left the Police and started doing soundtracks for movies like ""Rumble Fish"". There are at least a dozen irresistibly scored motifs in here, along with some pop song remakes that range from ""all right"" to ""inspired"". For people to whom the soundtrack is important, this movie is a delight. On to the movie: I can take or leave Mark Wahlberg, but he's okay here as the leading man, and the movie doesn't ask him to do anything he can't do well. He's the weakest ""major"" actor in the film, but that's because the rest of supporting cast is so strong, especially Donald Sutherland in a bit part. Mos Def, Jason Steadham, Ed Norton, Seth Green and Charlize Theron all turn in solid, fat-free performances. Norton seems to mostly be phoning it in (rumor has it that he didn't really want to be in the film), but he's still a natural even at 1/2 power. My one quibble with the casting and acting is with the character ""Wrench"", who seems to be a male model pretending to be an actor. His part seems to be shoehorned into the movie, and he has little chemistry with the rest of the cast (although you can blame some of that on the size of the part and the ""late walk on"" nature of the character). If I were a cynical sort,I would wonder who the actor slept with to get put into this movie in such a supernumerary role? Nah, never happen...Production values, camera work, stunts, plot...everything cooks along quite nicely and Gray and his production crew pull things together pretty seamlessly (with the exception of the ""Wrench"" character, see above). The dialog has a nice, light touch that rewards your indulgence, and there are several satisfying major and minor plot payoffs along the way. (My favorite moment - when Norton's character tells Wahlberg's character that he's just lost the element of surprise. Wahlberg proceeds to cold cock Norton with a right cross, and then asks him, ""Were you surprised??"" Hmmm, maybe you had to be there...) Of course the movie requires a certain level of ""suspension of disbelief"" to work, but if you just relax and go along with it (and don't think too hard about the mechanics of cracking a safe underwater, or the likelihood of anyone being able to successfully hack and manipulate LA traffic via a laptop, etc), you'll have a fun ride. ""The Italian Job"": it's lightweight summer fluff, but it's very good for what it is, and it doesn't try to be anything else. It isn't good enough for an ""8"" but I'd give it a ""7.5"".",The Italian Job

In fact, give it any other name and the only similarities between this movie and the Michael Caine version would be the presence of mini's. The story is pretty predictable and forgettable, but it is the characters that make the story watchable. Or at least, some of the characters.Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron, though OK, aren't the larger-than-life characters you'd expect from a film like this. Accordingly they pale next to the likes of Jason Statham, Seth Green and Mos Def, all of whom seem to compete amongst themselves to see who can steal scenes off each other. Seth Green seems to win most of the time but Mos Def in particular was a pleasant surprise. I'm no great fan of musicians turning to acting, especially ones with weird names. But he gave a great performance and gives me hope for ""The Hitch-Hikers Guide..."" out later this year.As mentioned, the plot is best forgotten in favour of watching the characters interact, which is where the film really scores.It's good enough that I'll watch the sequel when it arrives, but just for the characters, you understand.

64,philip_vanderveken,"Maybe not the most original movie, but a very good one in the genre of the heist / action flicks",8,26 April 2005,"A few years ago I saw this remake of the sixties classic with the Mini Coopers for the first time and I remember liking it a lot. Now, about two years later it was shown on television and I just wanted to know whether I would still like it as much as when I saw it in the cinema. Well, the answer is yes.The movie is about a team of robbers that will do one final job in Venice, Italy. The plan is flawless and the execution perfect. They escape and won't have to work for the rest of their lives. But there is one problem they didn't take into account: Someone within their own ranks doesn't like to split the loot, but wants to keep it all for himself, even when that means he will have to kill the rest of the crew. But all but one survive and they are out for revenge. One year later, in Los Angeles this time, the surviving team members create a smart and devious plan to steal back the gold and get their revenge on the traitor...The story on itself is of course not very original, since this is a remake of the original 1969 movie, but it has plenty of goodies to offer to make you forget about that. This is a typical heist / action movie but it certainly is one of the better ones in its kind. The action is very nice, the landscapes and Venice are real eye-candy, the story is OK and the special effects are stunning. Even the acting is very good, something which you'll not often see in an action movie. I must admit that I really liked what I saw and I give this movie a well deserved 7.5/10.",The Italian Job
65,screenman,You're Only Supposed To Rip The Bloody Title Off.,5,20 January 2008,"Like many people, I was prejudiced by the title. It betokened yet another hammy Hollywood re-make of an earlier and far more engaging movie, but with the dubious improvements of a bigger budget, more pyrotechnics, and some inevitable CGI.And - that's more or less what we got.It began slickly enough with a tense little heist episode set in the back-waters of Venice. This served as entrée to a boat-chase that was so clearly ripped-off from 'Puppet On A Chain' and a couple of inferior Bond movies that the makers might have borrowed one of their less iconic titles instead (Oh gosh; surely that wasn't another gondola being chopped in half!)The gold they made off with was actually Ukrainian. And that was were the 'Italian Job' ended.What followed was a needlessly violent double-cross, a bout of self-indulgent grieving that I thought would never end. And, of course, revenge - a very long revenge. There were one or two occasions when I was genuinely bored.That initial heist in Venice was simple, self-explicit and therefore quite involving. However, the rest of the movie was played out in San Francisco (yawn) which is obviously a much cheaper location, being just down the road from Hollywood. There's no obscure, crooked bureaucracy or foreign language to get your head around either. But I've seen it in so many movies by now that I could surely draw a street-plan from memory. And it was here that a presumption of audience stupidity set in, and things began to happen with practically no explanation at all. It was high-technology, you see. Viewers had to be computer whizz-kids. You either understood it or you didn't. I lost count of the frequency with which I saw fingers deftly running-over keyboards with little or no explanation. And likewise there were brief shots of data flashing up and across screens, but again with no additional clarity. Basically, the message was that a laptop in the hands of big enough nerd could work miracles. I wasn't convinced. Then, without the least introduction, new characters just popped-up to fill plot gaps, including one huge fat 'fixer' like Jabba the Hut. Fifteen seconds of fame for him (and perhaps a crash-diet to follow). After the 'Puppet On A Chain' chase rip-off, we were next treated to a 'Bullit' chase rip-off through the streets of San Francisco, and finally a rip-off from the original 'Italian Job' with mini-cars chasing through storm drains. I also spotted a number of other little out-dated and stolen clichés, but frankly - just one day after viewing - I have already forgotten what they were.Memorable, this isn't. Since 1969 I have seen 'The Italian Job' many many times. I know how it goes and how it ends. But it's such a fun feel-good movie that it still entertains me today. This? I don't expect to see it again.'Story' I was once told, is something that happens to somebody you have been moved to care about. And there's the rub. Like so many other modern movies; I couldn't care a hoot about any of these implausible two-dimensional plastic characters: not them, or what happened to them. The standard Hollywood 'pouting totty' was the least plausible of all. Though naturally; she wasn't just a pretty face; she also happened to be an expert safe-cracker and rally-cross driver too. A sort of latter-day Lara Croft. Quite. It's no more than I've come to expect in this age of emancipation.Perhaps they should have called it 'All The Crime Caper Movies You've Ever Seen Rolled Into One Job', or maybe 'Ocean's Eleven Clichés'.There are worse offerings to watch, but you could pile-up a much bigger stack of better ones - unless perhaps you're a computer-nerd.Nice title - shame about the film.",The Italian Job
66,Luigi Di Pilla,This job is well done...,7,14 August 2004,"If you like fast paced action thriller this one is a must see. It offers from beginning to the end a nonstop ride. It starts in Venise with nice shootings. Edward Norton gave here perhaps his best performance as a villain. The last time I saw him in a good role was as the serious cop in Hannibals ""Red Dragon"". I think he made big steps in the last years. The picture is superb and the direction well executed. I didn´t see the original version but this remake is very entertaining and suspenseful. I liked very much the chases through the city L.A.  For all these reasons I will add it to my best of dvd collection. My vote 7/10.",The Italian Job

68,sme_no_densetsu,A fun riff on the classic original,8,2 February 2020,"For those who are unaware, this movie is a remake of a classic British film starring Michael Caine. The 1969 original is a nifty heist caper that contains what is, in my opinion, one of the best car chases ever committed to celluloid. You would be right to assume that a remake would struggle to live up to the high standard of its predecessor but in this case the remake sets itself apart by not sticking too closely to the source of its inspiration.This time around, the titular 'Italian Job' happens right at the beginning of the movie and serves as the impetus for the events that follow. The simple premise is this: Following a betrayal by one of their own, a team of high-tech thieves plan to take down their former ally and hopefully get rich in the process. There are definitely many elements from the original that found their way into the remake's script but the plot is distinct enough to keep you interested. What's more important is that the remake captures the same light-hearted feel of the original with its combination of comedy & heist-centric action.The cast is better assembled than you might expect. This is definitely a Mark Wahlberg star vehicle but there were a couple of casting coups in the form of Charlize Theron (in her Oscar year) and the always-interesting Edward Norton. Granted, Edward Norton only took the role to fulfill a contractual obligation but he still excelled as the film's villain. Mark Wahlberg may be no Michael Caine but he was charming enough to anchor a cast that had undeniable chemistry with one another. The supporting trio of Jason Statham, Seth Green & Mos Def ended up being the unsung heroes of the movie. Add in Donald Sutherland and you've got a cast that's more than capable of stealing the show.Being a $60 million production, ""The Italian Job"" had plenty of resources to draw on in bringing its heist to life. There's lots of stunt work here but it isn't just in the movie for its own sake. The heist does indeed come off as a carefully orchestrated affair, which is a credit to both the screenwriters and the crew. Personally, I don't think that it quite reaches the heights of the original but that was admittedly a tall order. The bottom line is that ""The Italian Job"" is a well constructed piece of Hollywood entertainment.It seems that most people who dislike this movie do so on the basis that it supposedly pales in comparison to the original. To me, the movie manages the tricky balancing act of being faithful enough to be recognized as an homage without being overly faithful to the point of predictability. Taken on its own terms, this 2003 version of ""The Italian Job"" is quality popcorn entertainment.",The Italian Job
69,michaeltrivedi,Pretty Darn Good,7,28 December 2019,"The one quote I cannot forget from this movie is said to Mark Wahlberg in the beginning or the end. It's something like, once you find a girl you love, never let her go. Something like that. It's a great quote, nothing really to do with the movie though.Here is a heist movie at its best. It's a little campy, and not too serious. You don't expect any grave danger which kind of sucks. But it's a fun trip.Would recommend7 stars",The Italian Job
70,inspectors71,Where Was I . . .,5,18 March 2014,"for the last 111 minutes? I seem to remember watching The Italian Job, a remake of a heist movie from the late 60s, now set in Los Angeles, and starring a bunch of pleasingly vacant actors and cute little cars. But that's not possible because I have so little memory of it already (last night, was it?). I do recollect having a pleasing sensation of seeing Charlize Theron, bra-less in a tank top, but they make mannequins with nipples, and I was in a clothing store a few days ago. Mark Wahlberg was there, all angry, wounded puppy-dog handsome. Donald Sutherland popped up, then popped out after crossing paths with ferret-faced baddie, Edward Norton. Venice, Italy and Hollywood, California both looked nice. There were millions of dollars in gold bars, some scuba gear, laptops that could do things I don't think can be done even 11 years after the movie came out, a couple of bullet holes, a number of giant Samoans, cusswords looped out with non- cusswords, and a feeling that this was all just so much fun for a bunch of popular actors and their action-movie-addicted audience.Yet, I can't be sure. I think The Italian Job was an equally pleasant and vacant bit of duck fluff for summer consumption. I know Wahlberg has so much animal magnetism that if he screwed a light bulb in his ear, the damn thing would light off instantly. Theron exudes such a dangerously sexy vibe that, even though she has nothing to do here but act as if she's happy to be invited to work with the boys, we don't mind because there's something primal in her provocativeness. Norton could narrate a documentary on Pope Francis, and the viewer might want to clean his ears out with Lysol, all because he's so . . . um . . . icky.I just don't know for sure if I saw this movie. It's gone. It faded away. I'm not disturbed by my confusion, just confused about where the time went.",The Italian Job

There are many fast-paced action sequences in a gracious plot; less commercials, especially all those Mini ads, would have made this robber's film distinguish itself from others of the same genre, but due to its engaging characters and to its light humor, it gets to be quite riveting. Mark Wahlberg demonstrates its ability in the role whereas I did find Edward Norton wasted in that role. Lastly, Charlize Theron is even more beautiful than anybody imagined she would be.",The Italian Job

Nothing new is brought to the table here.  It's a fun to watch movie, though at times it begins to get boring.  I still wish Mark Walhberg would get into more movies.

After the below par A Man Apart, F. Gary Gray redeems himself with this slick hesit film. The problem with Gray's last film was the script and given the right material Gray shows his talent as a director , hence his work in his previous films The Negotiator and Set It Off. The Italian Job sharp and witty written by Donna & Wayne Powers is a huge improvement over the previous film Valentine, the Powers duo get great performances out of everyone in the cast from the star Mark Wahlberg to Franky G. Walhberg and his team which consit of Mos Def, Seth Green and Jason Statham decide to reccuit Charlize Theron  to bring the evil Ed Norton. The trailer pretty much gives away the plot of the film so I won't ruin it here but the film is a lot of fun and considering the lack of gun battle violence that's really suprising.

75,classicalsteve,Sort of Ocean's Eleven Meets Die Hard-- Descent Heist Flick But Nothing Special,6,11 August 2015,"Ever since the brilliant remake of ""Ocean's Eleven"" with Clooney, Damon, Cheadle, et al, heist films have been in vogue. There are about two or three per year since circa 2001, a few have been outstanding, most are about average, and a few are duds. They are entertaining, more or less, but sometimes they rely on too many known plot devices. Some of the exceptional ones include the first ""Ocean's Eleven"" film (not the Sinatra one), ""Inside Man"", one of the cleverest of such films, and ""The Score"" (also with Edward Norton, by the way), which keeps you guessing all the way. (If you want to see a really great heist film set in Victorian England, I suggest ""The Great Train Robbery"" with Sean Connery and Donald Sutherland produced in the 1970's.) Some average but descent fair include ""Tower Heist"", and ""The Art of the Steal"". Among the less memorable ones include both of the ""Ocean's Eleven"" sequels, ""Ocean's Twelve"" and ""Ocean's Thirteen"", and the remake of ""Fun with Dick and Jane"". The present film, ""The Italian Job"", despite a few nice moments, fits into the middle category of being marginally enjoyable but not great.Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie Croker, an up-and-coming sophisticated thief who uses high tech to achieve his plundering aspirations. His mentor is older thief John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) who helps him plan for a heist to lift $35 million in gold from a safe which happens to be in the hands of the Italian Mafia in Venice, Italy. Like Ocean's Eleven, they use a team of safe-crackers and embezzlers who enact the theft. Everything goes as planned, almost too easy, until after the heist is completed, everything goes wrong.Without giving away what happens exactly, the thieves lose the gold, which is possibly the best part of the film, The film then focuses on about the thieves finding out where the gold resides and how to retrieve it while also getting revenge on those who stole the gold from them which was stolen originally from the Italian Mafia, who also must have stolen it from other people. They also solicit the help of Bridge's daughter, a crackerjack safe-cracker, to lift the gold. The film then uses a lot of Ocean's Eleven-type devices, describing each of the henchmen which will be involved in the heist to retrieve the gold lost from the original heist.While the film has a couple of unexpected twists, particularly at the beginning, unfortunately it lapses back into tried and true formulas. There's lots of the standard car chases, some subplots and a few characters get ""offed"" for their troubles. Despite the shortcomings, Edward Norton offers a stellar performance in the clothes of one of the most ruthless characters I've ever seen him play. His performance saves the film. At the same time, I felt some of the other characters were rather flat, especially Mark Wahlberg as the Danny Ocean equivalent in ""The Italian Job"". Sometimes I find Wahlberg just a bit too humourless and rather stiff. Clooney in the first ""Oceans"" film is always playful with lots of unexpected comic relief. The film in question is a descent effort, but again the script needed more work, and the ending was a bit predictable. I was hoping for a major unexpected twist at the end, but it never happens. The film tries to be another ""Ocean's Eleven"" using its devices but little of its charm. I guess my expectations are too high.",The Italian Job

77,CitizenCaine,A better than average film,8,19 September 2003,"The Italian Job is an ultra slick crime/revenge film, which is not a remake of the original as some believe. There has been much discussion about this, but all one has to do is see the cast from the original to know that that film was more of a comedy. This film focuses on the heists themselves, the planning, and the cat and mouse anticipatory skills one needs when committing such acts. The acting is satisfactory from a group of top flight actors: Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Donald Sutherland, etc. , but no more than that. The material is beneath Norton, and he's really not on screen enough to warrant an actor of his caliber. Theron seems an odd fit in the film, but has one of the best scenes with Norton in a restaurant. There are several terrific action scenes involving boat and car chases and great location filming. An interesting trivia note: there's a glimpse of the recently renovated Roosevelt Hotel, the site of the very first academy awards ceremony. It was brand new at that time. The script doesn't allow for a lot of character development, and this is the type of film where the characters exist to serve the plot.

The characters are portrayed by a well-rounded ensemble cast who usually resist chewing the scenery. The directing is competent and abetted by a great soundtrack. No overreaching by Mr. Gray, he delivers a straight, just-for-entertainment story, and does it very well.",The Italian Job
79,stamper,This is not a remake,6,14 February 2004,"Maybe it was because Michael Caine turned 70 or maybe it was because there was a remake' of The Italian Job in cinema's around the world, but halfway the August of 2003 the BBC aired this film. That gave me a somewhat unique chance to go and see this version of The Italian Job before seeing the remake', since the 1969 version was not for rent or buy anyplace I could think of. Now there were basically two reasons for me to see this film, first of all because I think Michael Caine is a good actor and second of all because it is rumored to be a classic. Well I did not find this film to be a classic. Sure the car chases were well filmed (and probably spectacular for 1969), but they didn't do much for me. Neither did any of the acting or the story. Also I found the music to be quite irritating at times (especially in the applauding scene near the ending, which dragged on and on and well you get the idea!). Nevertheless, this is not a total stinker, it just isn't anything special. If I were you I'd skip this one and see the remake', something I did a while after seeing the 1969 version.
The thing with the remake' is that is actually not a remake. The only things these films have in common are the heist, the Mini's and the title. That's is. The underlying story in the 2003 is a lot better and more elaborate than the story in the 1969 version. It also leaves much more room for character development and all of that adds to the excitement of the film. Also the actors are a lot better in this film, than they were in the original. No offense to Michael Caine, but the average actor in this film, was much better than the average actor in the 1969 film of the same name, even when Edward Norton made a somewhat pale' performance. I hate to say it, but his character in this film, was about the worst I've seen him portray yet (which does not mean that he was bad though). Charlize Theron on the other hand surprised me a bit, with the depth and emotion she brought to her character.
The action scenes were good as well and the heist(s) were very well planned, executed and filmed as well, but despite all of these good things I did not feel that this was a great film. It just lacked that extra edge and excitement at times. That extra edge, ironically is originality. Whereas this film succeeds in portraying a very original story and original heist(s), some of the characters missed a bit of originality, as did some of the dialog and a twist or two. In conclusion I'd have to say that the 2003 version of The Italian Job is not a classic, but definitely worth a look, since it is better than it's predecessor carrying the same name.

81,gregsrants,Good movie - Too bad Mark Wahlberg was so distracting,7,29 December 2003,"There is a scene at the beginning of The Italian Job that let me know I was seeing something different from the average action, heist caper. During the opening chase sequence, a boat goes flying in the air and lands aground without exploding into a great ball of Hollywood pyrotechnic fire. This may seem obscure or insignificant to most, but after viewing such biennial action films as Bad Boys II and Terminator 3 this past year, where everything including a kitchen sink was blown to pieces, it was refreshing to see an explosive opportunity passed on by such a young up-coming director. That director by the way is hit and miss F. Gary Grey who had success in 1996 and 1998 with Set It Off and The Negotiator, but came back to earth pretty hard with the gawd-awful Vin Disel vehicle, A Man Apart in 2002. To his credit, the fact that Paramount would hand the reins to such a young director to bring to the screen a remake of a Michael Caine 1969 film that is still revered by many today, is an indication of the talent he must contain. And the result, is a fun heist yarn that gives you your monies worth for two hours. The similarities to the original film are minimal. Mark Wahlberg takes over the role by Michael Caine as Charlie Croker, a thief who has assembled a team to help steal a shipment of gold stolen from them years earlier. The assembled crew all come with new cool 21st century names and talents. Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron) is the daughter of former slain crewmember John Bridger and is an expert at cracking safes. Handsome Rob (Jason Statham) is the getaway driver, Lyle (Seth Green) is the computer expert and Left Ear (Mos Def) is the explosives expert that got his name due to a botched explosion in his youth. Together, they conspire against Steve (played by Edward Norton) who assisted in the original heist then turned on his team and confiscated the gold leaving the others for dead in the frozen waters of the Italian mountains. As caper films go, The Italian Job zips along at a fast pace and keeps us entertained with its thought process on how to pull of the perfect crime. In homage to the original, there is an extended chase scene by three mini-Coopers through the Los Angeles subway system and into rush hour traffic that might not make the best of list that contains such classics as Bullit and To Live and Die in L.A., but does offer an entertainment value of exceeded expectations. All this culminates in a concluding chapter that is both enjoyable if not foreseen. The Italian Job's biggest drawback however is the incredible cardboard acting of its lead, Mark Wahlberg. Consistently the weakest link in better than average films (Three Kings, Boogie Nights), Mark falls this side of Ben Affleck as one of the worst actors that get plumb roles in new-Hollywood. On subsequent viewings of his filmography, I can't help but think of the lack of talent presently being exploited on screen to moderate success. Ashton Kutcher, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are just three more examples of why we still stand in line to see Jack Nicholson play himself over and over again in films like Something's Gotta Give. But I digress. The review in hand is The Italian Job and despite its inferior lead actor, the movie does deliver on many levels and if it's domestic box office is any indication (over $100 million), audiences tend to agree.

82,Rogue-32,Raises the bar on the Gold standard,8,2 June 2003,"""The Italian Job"" is carried out by real pros, a delight from beginning to end, with superlative casting, clever dialogue and one beautifully-directed scene after the other. The film, a re-tooling of the earlier Michael Caine movie of the same name, has the simplest of plots: get the gold, lose the gold, get the gold back. It's the way it's done that elevates this one: all the characters are well-written, it's got the perfect amount of tongue-in-cheekedness (is that a word?!), the style AND the substance are there in equal part, and it's supremely easy on the eyes to boot.Particularly outstanding: Charlize Theron (dazzlingly gorgeous as always, with a well-played touch of vulnerability underneath her character's more-than-capable exterior), Donald Sutherland (elegant and cool in his brief appearance), Seth Green (as the self-titled ""real"" Napster, who gets to play God with the Hollywood traffic grids in his very own ""matrix""), and Mark Wahlberg   (in a perfectly nuanced performance, controlled and clearly on top of his game). And oh yeah, Edward Norton as the slime-bucket who gets his just desserts is sufficiently and sublimely sleazy.  (Think he's been taking Dustin Hoffman lessons in his spare time.)

It's basically the same concept involving chase scenes with Mini Coopers, but this film has a lot more to it than that. It's completely modernized, and it involves the use of technology in the criminal mastermind as well as romance and revenge. The character story is more in-depth in this version, and the characters have a sense of reasoning for their actions. There is also a lot more action throughout the film in this version than there is in the 1969 version, and there is a different story and subplot and ending. I don't think the two versions can be compared, and I do not call this a remake.Although it contains a lot of action and good characterisation, I found that the action got old quickly. It's still a good film, but it felt too ordinary and unoriginal in some places. It just feels like a typical 1990s/2000s movie following the certain mold of character scenarios and stereotypes.The Mini Cooper chase scenes are done well, and I guess it helped Mini sell their cars in America, although I've always loved the Mini Cooper and now everyone else seems to.

The film also borrows from the original in that a big city's computer controlled traffic system is hacked although computer technology has evolved since 1969!Not quite as 'British' as the original.

As a cool actioneer it works pretty well, much better than the original indeed since action then was thought as a big farandole joke in line with the rest of the movie. But they added other stuff around the heist in it: above all there is not one single big heist, it's more about a setup for the original idea of having minis speeding in narrow subway tunnels; then things that are not sparklingly cool also clutter up without adding much.To make it short without giving away plot points there's a line that says fine for a thief means ""Freaked-out Insecure Neurotic Emotional"".

The story has been done a number of times before but not often with such crisp acting, great stunts and the infusion of up-to-date cyber-technology gone amuck (or gone in the service of crooks).John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) is the substitute dad for a young fellow safecracker, Charlie (Mark Wahlberg).  Dispensing sharp advice on pulling off a huge gold bar heist in Venice, he also counsels his protege on the true meaning of life.  Steal, he exhorts the worshipful younger thief, not just for wealth but to be able to savor a rich (no pun intended) life.Bridger has been a largely absent dad (because of long tenure in correctional facilities) to his locksmith daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron).  Before embarking on the big Venice job he calls her to say a present is on the way.  She's worried that's he's skipped out on his parole officer but is remarkably sanguine about his resumption of career opportunities.  They seem to have a great relationship - no mention is ever made of mom.It's no spoiler to report that the larceny is successful but runs into a problem when confederate Steve (Edward Norton) and his thugs decide splitting the $37M loot isn't the way to go.  So they kill poor John and think they've also wiped out Charlie and his oddball associates, an explosives expert, a computer nerd and a master of the wheel.  Well, we know they haven't and the movie follows their complex scheme for revenge. Steve's the target and, of course, an eager and alternately vulnerable and steely Stella is the key to the program.From high speed chases along Venice's canals to near mayhem on L.A.'s freeways, the action comes fast.  Lile the Geek (Seth Green) runs through techie madcap tweakingethat my kid thought not impossible.

Of course, it isn't as bad as an amorous night with the little AOL man, but when you're second billed to MARK WAHLBERG, your career's in hock. Although when other actors such as Seth Green, Donald Sutherland, and Jason Statham, you can look and see that it's not all bad.What I'm talking about it The Italian Job, F. Gary Gray's addition to the ever-popular genre of heist movies. In fact, Gray is a big fan of these type of movies, naming Snatch the greatest heist flick ever. Unlike straight heist films like Heist, The Italian Job has humor and takes itself more humorously. Of course we don't understand everything that the computer whiz/geek Lyle says, but neither do the people in the movie, adding to the mocking tone of the movie. It's not exactly a parody of crime movies, just an homage.Donald Sutherland must have been aching for a paycheck. He stars as John Bridger, an aging thief who is doing.guess.one last job! Clichès run high, but so does fun (I'll get to that later). He's with his team doing a job in Italy, and they successfully steal about $35 million. One of the team, Steve (Edward Norton) turns against them, shoots and kills John, and runs off with the gold. The rest of the crew plan to steal the gold from Steve because of revenge, including Stella, John's daughter.PT Cruisers used to be the fad car, but now Mini Coopers are becoming steadily more popular. Thanks to The Italian Job, where everyone drives one, that is. The car chases weren't that many, but the culminating one was great. When three Minis were driving on the subway tracks, it was just amazing, I really loved it. Of course, there was a lot of advertising. It's basically a two-hour car commercial, with a few Pepsi adds added in.However, there's an interesting note I found. Wahlberg, who plays Charlie, the ringleader, said that The Italian Job had some of the most amazing special effects he had ever seen, while Norton repeated several times that he joined this movie only because of contractual agreements. Wahlberg is most definitely not a leading man.his acting's like a log on a stream. It starts off high but then falls down. Theron, who plays a beautiful safecracker, also isn't that great of an actress. When the high point of your career is a RECENT Woody Allen film, you're in trouble. Norton, my second favorite actor, heaps on the camp, but still doesn't come off that well. Other actors, including Mos Def, Stathem, and Green, were all funny, especially Green.The Italian Job is very fun and entertaining, but can't stay away from clichés. Sutherland does one last move, Norton has a moustache, Green is geeky, Theron is beautiful, there's a token African-American. Also, the ending is more predictable than, well, a Disney movie. Overall, The Italian Job is a fun two hours. If you're looking for more than that, stay away.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for violence and some language.",The Italian Job

The characters are very well distributed and there no left out make you feel very assuring watching it. Seth Green was hilarious and very convincing, also Charlize look at her best.The good thing was this movie has very believable action scenes  like the car chase, helicopter chase, boats chase and best of all it not overly done. Maybe also the changes of different places make this movie more interesting.So next time if you have doubt what heist movie to rent from the video store, I say this is it.

95,vampyrecowboy,They are greedy pricks.,7,11 January 2006,"While the car chase and boat chase was interesting, it doesn't keep the story tight.Now I'm all for action, and car chases too...but in order to justify their anger, they put thousands of lives at risk just to get even.In order for this team to complete their goal, they had to cause major destruction and heartache to thousands of people that have no involvement into their personal lives.Do the other folks who are hindered in traffic due to car accidents and traffic pileups and road constrictions share any of the gold? NO! Do the people injured in the vehicle accidents have to deal with problems resulting from the accident? YES! Now people's lives are thrown of course, their insurance rates go up. Their personal problems are increased and they just wanted to carry on with their simple lives that had nothing to do with anybody else's gold or murder.Do people going late to work have to deal with problems due to being held up in the subway or traffic? Yes, they do...but how are they to know why all this trouble for them came about? They don't...but it affects many many people who should not be affected due to greed...and that is what is was all about.If the team wanted to get even with this guy...there are thousands of ways to do so without disrupting the entire traffic flow and emergency system of the city.They were selfish and greedy and stupid...all while trying to look cool.So with Charlize at the wheel and some few chases which were pretty awesome...the rest of the story is pathetic.The moral? It's OK to screw somebody over as long as you disrupt everybody else's life in order to get what you want.This story got lost after 25 minutes and somehow the writer thought that to make it interesting, he had to cause major havoc and destruction.You'll make your own judgment...My votes are for Charlize and the cars...the plot is thin...Now there is to be a second film made...why? They got away with 27 million dollars. Is that not good enough? Whya re they so greedy? I found this repulsive overdone Hollywood mentality garbage with pretty scenery blended in to make it easy to swallow.",The Italian Job

It was a British-Italian production from Paramount, then ""A Gulf + Western Company,"" directed by Peter Collinson with Michael Caine as Charlie Crocker, and Noël Coward as Mr. Bridger, a figure in prison well-respected - there lies the British humor to the plot. The opening and ending frames were also memorable: Rossano Brazzi driving a cool red sports car while Matt Monroe singing ""On Days Like These"" (music by Quincy Jones, lyrics by Don Black), and pardon the pun, a cliff-hanger of a bus with the essential glistening load and Caine uttering, ""hang on a minute, lads, I got a great idea"" ending with a rallying chorus singing the catchy tune ""The Self-Preservation Society""...amusing, indeed.""The Italian Job"" 2003, also produced by Paramount Pictures, directed by F. Gary Gray (""Set It Off"" 1996, ""The Negotiator"" 1998) with refreshed screenplay by Donna and Wayne Powers of Troy Kennedy-Martin's original script, successfully delivered matching fun and humor with a smaller concentrated team of six - well, it's Mark Wahlberg as Charlie with three essential partners: Seth Green the computer whiz ""Napster"" Lyle, Jason Statham (of ""Transporter"" 2002) as Handsome Rob the car expert, Mos Def as Left Ear the explosive expert (that 'don't do dogs' as the trailer suggested). Also there's Donald Sutherland and Charlize Theron, as father and daughter John and Stella Bridger - both expert safe crackers, and from the trailer, we know already, Ed Norton as Steve the betraying nemesis. We actually get double scoops of action thrills of two heist setups in this version. An exciting start and the pacing throughout keeps audience going, rooting for Charlie and co. Here we also have three mini-coopers in blue, red and white. They also gave fêtes of acrobatic agility: speeding down subway steps, flying high jumps, swirling through splashing cylindrical tunnel, down to the ""open the door"" routine that finishes off a pursuant on bike. The Powers' script had fun with the key players, giving each specific characteristics that provided chuckling amusement. The plot may be nothing new to a heist story, but it's tight and just as suspenseful with its modern day techno approaches. The father and daughter drama gave Theron a more substantial woman's role than Angelina Jolie's in ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"" (2000). All in all, this is an entertaining Hollywood caper with satisfying ending guaranteed.",The Italian Job

102,CinematicInceptions,"Fun, well acted and strongly executed.",7,13 November 2014,"Well executed is the phrase that comes to mind with this movie. This applies to both the execution of the film itself and the crime it depicts. The acting is solid all around and there are a few moments of remarkable performance. The crime is also done in a very professional and practiced way. The crime is the first major element I will address. It is done with a motive of vengeance, but I will get into that later. The object of the robbery is $27 million worth of gold. The style in which the crime is performed is very different from Ocean's Eleven, especially since it's not a casino setting, but that's just something for any prospective viewers to be conscious of. It is pretty technologically based, though I saw it eleven years after it came out so I was relatively unfazed by this. There isn't really any time in the robbery where something goes seriously wrong which may or may not appeal to any given crime fan. We see a lot of the planning that goes into the heist, another striking difference from Ocean's in which we are kept in the dark as to the master plan until the end. The second element to discuss, since I have already brought it forward, is the filmmaking execution. The script is written well and flows naturally. The lines are not quite as dramatic or deliberate as in many movies. The conversations between Steve and Charlie are the most deliberately scripted and even these scenes aren't too bad as they go. John Powell's score has the usual crime movie feel with some light guitars mixed with some horns and drums like in Ocean's and Tower Heist. As stated above, the acting is very good, but I will address that in context with the characters. We have a pretty brief look at Donald Sutherland's character, John Bridger, since he gets killed pretty early on (this becomes the stimulus for the crime). He is the well established the leader of the original team most likely because of his experience, though I don't really like his little quote about why the team should steal. The quote's interesting, but I don't quite agree with it. Charlie Croker is a natural crook who seems to steal for the thrill of it and is solidly played by Mark Wahlberg. He is given a little more personality than some lead roles, but not as much as he probably should have gotten. However, it is clear that he cared strongly for John and feels justified in robbing Steve in retribution. Edward Norton does a great job playing the villainous jerk, Steve. I hated Steve's character from very early on, which was good. He all but admits that he had no good reason for stealing the gold and killing John. His one big problem is that he doesn't adapt to the circumstances. Even after he finds out that his old team is still alive and out for his blood, he does nothing to throw them off. In short, the team is able to easily predict his movements and it comes back to bite him. The rest of the characters lie in the team. Stella Bridger, John's daughter is a safe cracker who at first is averse to Charlie and the idea of stealing the gold. But eventually, she joins the others in a quest for vengeance of her father. Charlize Theron portrays her as a confident woman who asserts herself as a leader of the crime. Plus, she does a pretty good job driving her Mini Coopers, which adds a nice touch. Left Ear, played by Mos Def, is the pyrotechnics guy of the bunch and we see a few of his techniques interspersed throughout. He has a mild personality, best exemplified in his encounter with Skinny Pete. Handsome Rob is the team street racer and is played pretty well by Jason Statham. He's more than a little cocky and doesn't mind showing off. Lastly is Lyle the hacker (but of course we have to refer to him as the Napster). He's kind of jealous of the rest of the group because his one big accomplishment got stolen from him by his college roommate. Nonetheless, he contributes a key piece of the crime in his traffic light algorithm that allows the team to get away with the gold. His best scene is the one where he mimics Handsome Rob talking to the cable lady. This leads nicely into the sub-element of comedy, of which there is a little. There are a few pretty good one-liners (""Surprised Steve?"") and a couple of fully comical scenes. The most prominent of these, and my personal favorite, is the scene where Charlie tells Stella about the criminal histories of the rest of the team. Skinny Pete and the one Hispanic guy are also both introduced mainly for comical elements since they play pretty small roles in the crime. So basically, it's a good flick to pick when you're looking for decent crime or decent comedy. If you're somewhat interested in either element, it should satisfy since it's well executed. Again, it is distinctly different from Ocean's Eleven so it won't necessarily appeal to Ocean's fans. But overall it's fun and smooth. Overall Rating: 8.3/10.",The Italian Job

104,PyrolyticCarbon,"Not a patch on the original, but not bad entertainment",6,15 April 2005,"I was biased to this movie from the announcement of production. I mean a film that is touted not as a remake, but as being influenced by the original and truly wonderful Italian Job, immediately struck me as another idiotic Hollywood idea. My feelings were twisted even more when I heard that the heist in the new movie was happening in LA, so what was with the title? You've pretty much guessed that at this point I thought very little of the movie, had I known Donald Sutherland was in it then some of my respect may have been won back, but I didn't.In the interests of my movie reviews, I was determined to see it, after all even if it was awful it needed to be seen. So I rented the DVD and began to watch. I was surprised. To be fair Sutherland carries all of the movie he's in, and Mark Wahlberg struggles to get anything near acting while he's on screen with him, his mumbling monotone voice fumbling embarrassingly through their scenes. It's only until Sutherland is off screen that Wahlberg begins to gather some acting talent back.However most of the cast still seem like they're walking through it. Even Edward Norton seems to tackle this with a half hearted gesture. To be honest there are two people who really stand out in this movie, and that's Jason Statham and, believe it or not, Seth Green. They're both lively and watchable characters. The others appear flat and emotionless.That's not to say it's an enjoyable movie, in the entertainment sense it's quite fun. Some of the heist moves are set up well, and the stunts are particularly good, mainly because of the effort put in by the behind the scenes team to make them all as real as possible and try to avoid any special effects.",The Italian Job

Receiving lukewarm reviews on its 1969 release, Peter Collinson's sensational crime caper has worn well, blessed with enough 60s swagger, swinging music and quotable lines to make it quaint while equal amounts of laughs, story spinning brio and cunning stuntwork keep it fresh.Add stunning Continental vistas and the kind of crowdpleasing antics that only really take flight in the cinema, this opportunity to catch it on a big screen is not to be missed.Penned by Z Cars writer Kennedy Martin, The Italian Job is a story of charmingly absurdist conceits; a gang of cockney villains, led by small-time thief Charlie Croker (Caine), undertake a daring gold bullion robbery in the heart of Turin dressed as England footie supporters and driving a trio of Union Jack colour-coded Minis (surely the most identifiable getaway cars in the history of crime). Yet this hokey idea is embraced and played up to the hilt - witness Croker's run-ins with the comedy mafiosi - embellished by a clutch of original characterisations: chiefly Benny Hill's potty Professor Peach, with a roving eye for XL ladies, Noel Coward's hilarious imprisoned, criminal mastermind, the regal Mr. Bridger - watch him take applause as news of the gang's ""success"" breaks through - and Croker's gang of campish crims, eons away from stock in trade hardmen.Yet above all these are The Italian Job's two dazzling trump cards: Michael Caine's cocksure embodiment of cool Britannia and the truly breathtaking getaway sequence. Here is a rare heist flick that concentrates on the escape above the crime itself - in which the smallest output of the British motor industry slaughters the fuzz through streets, subways and sewers before meeting a tantalising fate on the edge of that cliff.Indeed, after all the Yank flagwaving of Armageddon and within a homegrown cinema dogged by reserved worthiness and humdrum mundanity, revel in a film that exuberantly celebrates the fact that it's ace being British.As a film, The Italian Job is hardly a work of unalloyed genius; but as a reminder of the time when Britannia really was cool, it's peerless.",The Italian Job

Helping them are Lyle ""The Napster"" (Seth Green), ""Handsome Rob"" (Jason Statham) and ""Left Ear"" (Mos Def).You can be sure that the producers remade this film after ""Ocean's Eleven""'s success, but unfortunately, ""The Italian Job"" lacks the style of the 2001 remake.  Sure, the writers give their characters 'cool' nicknames that are explained in brief flashback sequences.  Lyle claims he invented Napster, but it was stolen from him.  Left Ear lost the hearing in his right ear because he set off too many explosions as a child.  Handsome Rob is, well, handsome.  Unfortunately the nicknames just don't cut it.  Everything from the wardrobe to the background music in ""Ocean's Eleven"" was cool, but ""The Italian Job"" tried too hard.Still, it managed to be a very fun and funny movie.  The wisecracks from Left Ear and Handsome Rob are hilarious at times, and every word that comes out of Seth Green's mouth is amusing (as always).  The action is good too, involving tiny cars known as Mini Coopers racing through streets and subways.The acting is probably the low point, but nothing as bad as ""Gigli"" or ""From Justin to Kelly"".  The best performances probably come from the three side characters played by Green, Statham and Def.

Also another funny part was in the end when they are showing the credits Lyle buys this big stero system that blows women's clothes off!

âª
All in all, this high-speed remake of the Michael Caine classic goes full throttle from the start and navigates through its fast-paced story as smoothly as MINI Coopers cruise through the crowded streets of Los Angeles, as the determined, suave direction of Gray, the clever and detailed plot as well as the absolutely likeable characters make this film a hot rod of a voguish revenge campaign that is as charismatic as it is satisfying, and brings joy to those who love themselves some rush of adrenaline in movie form.

Those who know me and my general taste in films might be surprised by my rating of this film. An action film with Mark Wahlberg that is an early thousands remake of a beloved classic from the sixites? Well, yes, it is not my regular genre and not one of the most critically films of all time, but this film has a special place in my heart. Roughly three years ago, I started watching and commenting on films on this page, and this film was one of the earliest post, from a time where I had only a dozen of people as my community, and honestly, this film furthermore helped me through a tough era and gave me a reason to smile after a long time. That is why I can tell you: this review will be what one may call ""biased"" and some might say my rating is a little to high, but as it is my own opinion, I don't care. The most important thing is that I just love this film. Marky Mark assembled a funky bunch of capable people with funny nicknames and I am all in for it, and I mean, that cast is dope as hell. Next to a small role by New Hollywood legend Donald Sutherland, you have Furiosa herself, Charlize Theron, action warhorse Jason Statham, ""Fight Club"" star Edward Norton as the slimy antagonist, ""BTVS"" and ""Family Guy"" icon Seth Green as the nerd and Yasiin Bey (formerly known as Mos Def) as the explosive expert. Let me tell you, for ""just an action film"" they play their roles greatly and the film defines its style through its extreme star power. Aside from that, the plot is quite simple: After the gang of thieves have been betrayed and left for dead by their former ally, they plan a retaliation campaign against him. The thing is, neither primitive violence or mindless shootouts are a part of this, quite the contrary, they do what they do best: planning the perfect and most spectacular heist. And that is what I like the most about this film. All operations, plans and strategies are sophisticatedly elaborated and precisely planned to the last detail. From a boat chase sequence that only serves as a diversionary manoeuvre for the juggers to do their job completely underwater to MINI Coopers stylishly manoeuvring through the streets of the city of angels, there is not a single second in this film that made me smile for its pure cunning. The direction of Gray and the cinematography round that up perfectly, and it sparks a feeling of unadulterated joy in me to see them execute their insane plan. I know that I am in fact rooting for the bad guys, since robbers are still crooks in some way, but the thing is that it is not about the theft in the first place but about personal issues. Croker planned all this to avenge the death of his late friend and mentor, and this determination is absolutely cool. It is not about wealth, it is about honour among thieves, and when I see Edward Norton getting what he deserves in the end and the gang celebrating their huge success, I feel this childlike happiness in me. I don't always need masterfully written dramas or hilarious comedies to feel good, sometimes I just need a cleverly designed and smartly executed action crime flick like this. I am amazed myself and astonished to see that it was able to keep the same rating from three years before, but as the phrase goes, exceptions prove the rule. And this fun flick is my personal exception.",The Italian Job

Gary Gray and screenwriters Troy Kennedy-Martin and Donna Powers have taken the best out of Michael Caine's original (three Mini's in a car chase, one thought-out heist) and glamourised it (Hollywood A-listers, pristine, clean shots) but with out the charge and the adrenaline we assume that's there. Wahlberg is a flat front-man. Edward Norton makes for a surprising bad guy, annoying and outsmarting Croker (Wahlberg) and his team left, right and centre. The other cast members struggle due to a lackluster script and and its inability to succeed our expectations.

I'll light up so, accept I had fun after all. One week ago I hired the 1969 version with M. Caine, for memories sake, I like Michael and did enjoy the return.(I'm over 60)Then the TV screened this one last night. Well I did the unthinkable I kept comparing them with a fairly biased attitude too with lot of knit picking, and almost spoiled it for myself. What really got me is that I actually forgot I had already seen it! Which probably means that I went through a fairly similar experience on the first watch and subconsciously tried to erase it out of my mind, How that for self control! But the minis came on, the bad guy coped it fair and square, the girl looked and drove ""good"". That's right what more do you want. I was wandering why they did not try to make a new movie on its own right rather than a remake (I understand it's claimed not to be a remake) well without the minis it would not in my way of thinking, and perhaps it would have been a more interesting work.

There wasn't a whole lot you could do with the trite dialogue.  It was an action movie.  When there wasn't action on the screen the movie lagged.  Charlize Theron was sufficiently babish to sustain interest in non-action scenes.   The characters were a clichéd lot of  movie types.

120,the amorphousmachine,"Fun remake, but could've been better!",6,1 February 2005,"The remake of 'The Italian Job' is certainly not better than original, but it is actually a fairly easy film to watch. The original was problematic because there was no driving force to the plot- except the crime itself involving those celebrated Mini Coopers, and Caine's charismatic performance. In the remake, the plot is driven by revenge, and that works fairly well. Of course, the trademark minis are featured again and that works well in the climax! Although the location is changed from Italy to America! Mark Whalberg's Charlie Crocker is no Michael Caine's Charlie Crocker in this movie, and he doesn't really add much to it (I know Mark Whalberg has more potential than this). Donald Sutherland is short-lived as the new John Bridger. Charlize Theron is okay, and Edward Norton makes an okay villain (pity, you can tell his disinterest in the movie creeps into his performance every now and then). It was the supporting cast that actually makes this film worthwhile- Seth Green as Lyle, Jason Stratham as Handsome Rob and Mos Def as Left Ear! They all added the much needed humour and kept the story going, and were memorable support- unlike the crew in the original film which only had Crocker and Bridger as memorable faces.F. Gary Gray, director of 'A Man Apart' (2003) and 'Friday' (1995), does well with the chase sequences, and the pacing of this film. Unfortunately, the main performances seem too restrained and lack conviction to make this film surpass the remake. Plot-wise, this version is better structured, but the original Crocker and the original Bridger are far more memorable. I think Gray could have aimed a little higher when remaking this movie! Purists may hate the remake, simply because it is a remake, however, 30 years later is a fairly big gap! It certainly doesn't dishonour the original like the remake of 'Get Carter' did! Like I said, not as good as the original, but easy and fun to watch! *** out of *****!",The Italian Job
121,nicolechan916,"Great action, intricate plans and good acting.",9,12 October 2015,"This film is really exciting and the plots are just so intricately thought out. What I really like about this film is how engaging it is, that it pulls you in by sheer force. From the beginning the film shows us how they pull off heists, and this sets the expectation for what this group can do. So while we are unsure of what they plan to do later on, we willingly follow knowing it will be great. Also, I think this was the film that made me appreciate mini coopers. The acting was great in this. Mark Wahlberg is a little mild, and does not really seem to be the robber type, but he played his part well. Charlize Theron did great too, unfortunately she is the only female in the film and so obviously is given the emotional role. Plus it was her father who died, so there is justification for her tears. But I must admit, her character was pretty tough and badass which I give props to. Jason Statham, Seth Green, Yasiin Bey and Edward Norton did their parts well too. Apart from minor background stories of the group and how they started their career, we do not see what motivates them to steal in the first place. When planning the revenge on Steve, the phrase 'it's not about the money' constantly comes up, so if money was not a big motivator for them, why did they become robbers in the first place? The rest of the film is motivated by revenge obviously, but without giving a reason for their start in crime, it depicts that these robbers aren't really robbers, since they are robbing from the biggest robber of them all. Also, Charlie is pretty much the only mastermind in the film which makes the rest of them there to provide muscle or just for comedic effect. Overall a really engaging and exciting film that did not exaggerate masculinity which I am grateful for. It would have been nice to have more than one female character though.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",The Italian Job

The plot was ok, but I felt the movie got a less bit interesting during the middle part of the movie and it lacked any exciting moments.

123,ikanboy,Bland acting and plot interspersed with heist scenes.,6,7 June 2003,"They borrowed the minis and the traffic jams and that's all that's left of the original. They even stayed clear of the tightwire ending. So why not just call it the ""Hollywood Heist""?The scenery in Italy is nice and keeps one interested for that part of the movie. Once it moves to L.A., it becomes just another heist movie, with none of the characters holding one's interest. Ed Norton is losing his initially interesting ""bad guy looks like a wimp"" persona. Mark Wahlberg is flat. Charlize is as usual adorable to look at but unexciting.
The holes in the plot are elephantine, so leave your brain at the door if you want to relax and be entertained. For example how does Ed Norton afford a house that costs more than the gold he stole while he still holds on to 3/4 of it? Or, why would the Italian police think that a 7 ton safe could be carted off on a 1 ton speed boat doing 90 degree turns.",The Italian Job

I knew immediately then, exactly who would make up the group: An Englishman, a black man, a nerdy computer geek, a gorgeous woman & a back stabber who does the dirty on them. What do you know? The token Englishman, black man, computer geek, woman & Grass are the 5. They could have been really daring and had all 5 in the one category for novelty, but still that's Hollywood. But credit where it's due, all the lead characters are exceptionally well written & good value.I've know idea why this film was called the Italian Job.

125,theinaniloquent,"""Get it, get out, get even""",6,8 May 2012,"I can't honestly say I had an expectation for this sort of film. The trailer made me sit with my left arm on the chin. It just looked clichéd, recycled, and last but not least same kind of film you see nowadays..But I watched it, and I have to say, the film was better than I thought it would be.Firstly, the cast was my favorite part. It had a lot of great actors, especially unexpected ones, that made this a much better experience. I mean, we have Mark Wahlburg, great actor with lots of diversity. Jason Statham, which was perfectly fitting for this sort of film. He's the king of action films. Seth Green. I couldn't believe he was cast, but I loved him in this film. He added comic relief (although there was much more comedic things going on) and a sense of style that made the cast all fit together. Mos Def? That was another unexpected actor. He pushed aside what people would call 'racism' but then added his little role to add to the team. Then Edward Norton. Great actor, who played a great villain. He seemed a bit too serious about what was going on in the screen, but nevertheless he added a great part to the film. The greatest charismatic team of all time. So with all that cast going on, what more could add to the film? I love heist movies. This one adds to the list of good ones, but never competes to the classics. But the plans were clever and new, and never stopped twisting and turning with action and intensity.But the film is just so forgettable. Even with the great cast, and the great action scenes, nothing makes up for it's clichéd doings. I will look back sometimes, and wonder why the critics liked it more than the audience, but I wasn't too fond of how forgettable I will see this film was. But looking for a little entertaining fun?

126,CleveMan66,"""The Italian Job"" is a remake which pays homage to the original, but creates an enviable legacy of its own.",8,16 February 2015,"The faithfulness of re-made films to their original material run the gamut from shot-for-shot remakes, like 1998's ""Psycho"" (starring then little-known Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche), all the way to movies that bear almost no resemblance to the original except for the title and basic concept, like 2013's ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" (Ben Stiller, Kristen Wiig, Adam Scott, Sean Penn). 2003's ""The Italian Job"" is somewhere in the middle, but closer to the latter. This movie is a remake of the 1969 Michael Caine vehicle of the same name, and known as one of Britain's most popular films. The 2003 version is, according to director F. Gary Gray, ""an homage"" that is ""inspired by the original"". The remake changes the location of the story's main caper, but keeps the focus on stealing gold bullion. The homage aspect of the remake can be seen in the names of some of the characters (even though their roles in the plot are different), the part of the plan that involves carefully controlling the escape route, the prominent use of the Mini Coopers, an escape through a small tunnel and a dramatic scene in which a vehicle is perched precariously over a large drop. But I'm getting ahead of myself.2003's ""The Italian Job"" begins with a creative and daring heist of $35 million worth of gold bullion in Venice, Italy. The gang consists of Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg, in the Michael Caine role), Steve (Edward Norton), ""Handsome Rob"" (Jason Statham), ""Napster"" (Seth Green), ""Left Ear"" (Mos Def) and the group's senior member (pulling his final job), John Bridger (Donald Sutherland). After cleverly making off with the gold, the crew is celebrating on a mountain road in the Alps (also a setting from the original film), when John praises Charlie (the group's new leader) for planning the perfect robbery and pulling it off ""without even holding a gun."" Unfortunately, the group doesn't get much farther than that. One of their own turns on them, leaves them all for dead and makes off with the gold.The story now jumps ahead one year. The original group's traitor is living large in his L.A. mansion, while those he thought were dead are planning to steal back what remains of the gold bars. John's daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron), an expert safecracker like her father, joins the gang. They also take on a mechanic named Wrench (Franky G), who the group needs to customize those Mini Coopers that are essential to the plan – and so prominent in the story that Gray referred to them as ""part of the cast."" After dealing with some unexpected challenges and having to completely change their plan, Charlie and his crew go after the gold in a climax that is even more inventive and exciting than the original robbery in Venice.""The Italian Job"" is exactly what a movie like this should be – a whole lot of fun! Every cast member is fun and interesting to watch and they have great chemistry between them. The story contains some clichés, but you won't care. The screenplay by Donna and Wayne Powers has some very funny moments amidst all the scheming and double-crossing. Gray balances it all perfectly, makes the whole thing entertaining and what comes out is a ""Job"" definitely worth having.",The Italian Job

129,MF210,"The beginning has style, but that does not help the rest of the film",5,22 November 2003,"My Rating: ** out of ****. The Italian Job was one of those summer movies I did not see but I heard it was good. So tonight I decided to give it a try. The result was a mediocre movie. The Italian Job opens with very stylish opening credits. It features nice cinmatography of Venice and has a clever constructed heist scene. Then it moves into snowy mountains which are also beautiful. Unfortunately, from then on it was mostly down hill. After the sylish beginning, the characters come on and we have to accept them. This is something that never happens. Why? Because the characters are not likable in the slightest. You do not care if they die. As a caper movie, Oceans Eleven was much better because the characters were all likable and had some very clever dialogue. The Italian Job occasionally has some clever dialogue but it is much less successful than Ocean's Eleven.
The performances do not help either. Mark Wahlberg is stiff throughout the movie.  Charlize Theron is looking beautiful and is convincing but again her character is not likable. Jason Stratham is fine, but his character is so arrogant that you can not stand him. Seth Green has his moments but hes not entirely likable either. Mos Def is good and he is pretty much the only likable character in the gang. Edward Norton is no better than ok as the villain. Donald Sutherland is good but really wasted. He is only around for a few scenes. The Italian Job is too long. It really is too long when you dont like these characters. The chase scene with the minis was overlong and not exciting. Even though I was not interested in the characters I felt the movie was hard to follow. The DVD I rented did skip(only for two minutes) but I feel it was more than that. If I was a little more interested maybe I would not have noticed. Overall, The Italian Job was not quite a failure. It is a good example of style over substance. It has some good moments but not enough for an hour and forty-five minute movie. If fifteen minutes were cut it could have been better.",The Italian Job
130,TuckMN,Stylish. Classy. Clever.,9,18 June 2003,"No one can play a slimy character as well as Edward Norton and he pulls this heist off better than ever before  he is able to make the viewer admire him and even envy him, yet be utterly happy that they are NOT him.This re-make of the 1969 film of the same name with Michael Caine and Noel Coward is far superior to the original  rare in this day of endless copies and re-makes. Mark Wahlberg plays the character that Michael Caine originally acted  and while Wahlberg is certainly not an actor of the same ilk as Caine is he is certainly more entertaining in this role than Mr. Caine was. He is written as intelligent, witty, charming and, even though Michael Caine epitomizes class, far more elegant and sophisticated than Mr. Caine was able to achieve in the initial film; kudos to Mr. Wahlberg.Charlize Theron is what I would want Cameron Diaz to be if I were ever lucky enough to wake up next to her  sexy, intelligent and just immoral enough to make her a truly fun romp. I totally approve.The supporting cast of crooks (Mos Def, Seth Green (!), Jason Statham and a woefully brief appearance by Donald Sutherland) is just delightfully fiendish enough to completely inveigle and entice the viewer to be completely caught up in their wicked, wicked ways.Whenever a film starts with a catchy and compelling opening sequence I am always wary  all too often it is a way of hiding the woefully inadequate film that is to come. Fortunately, even though `The Italian Job' started out on a high note, this time it did not let me down. It started cleverly and did not disappoint.The sound track was an absolute delight  hitting all the right elemental notes in all the right places  with themes that the viewer will recognize (in all the proper spots) mixed with new music that was completely appropriate to the action on the screen.Action is the key word. This was a film full of encounters and excitement  with never a slow moment or a let down.The use of the Minis as get away cars was a stroke of genius  where many screen writers or directors would have used a car a la James Bond the utilization of the not-so-exciting Minis gave an enormous sense of fun and exhilaration to the chase scenes.`The Italian Job' is the best time I have had at the movies so far this year and I highly recommend it to any and everyone that is looking for a good time replete with action, humour, romance and wit.",The Italian Job

It is great fun and I hated to see it end.The only two extremely minor objections were 1) I prefer Ed Norton as a good guy. 2) The only ridiculously ridiculous issue was their parking right in front of the gate. Of course, almost everything in a movie like this is ridiculous. That's a given. But, the staking out the gate so visibly was over the line.Still those are so minor that they almost are irrelevant.

That film was a so-so farce, but this one is a runaway hit. The action starts at the beginning and keeps the pace throughout the film. Mos Def and Seth Green are our comics in this film, but their abilities to shift from comic to dramatic are well played. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron are well suited to their roles and come off with a very reserved but appropriate sexual tension to add interest to the already interesting hi-tech portions of the film. Sutherland's role, while brief, is the perfect set up for the remainder of the film. Statham does what he does best, and his character is a mix between The Transporter and The Mechanic, with a splash of smooth to balance it out. As always, whether good guy or bad guy, Ed Norton's presence is perfect to create the correct tension in the movie.

There ""mos def"" was some other talent that coulda been used for that role. Seth Green's obsession with being called ""Napster"" was highly amusing. He lucked out. The fake one got shut down, lol. Charlize still felt like an outsider and her ending up with Mark just seemed like a last minute choice or an obvious choice, because they're the pretty people of the film. They had no chemistry whatsoever and them getting together was like, ""Ok...I guess..."". I like movies like this because it feeds into certain sociological theories like functionalism: everybody has a role. Movies like this are usually good, unless badly cast, because everyone gets a good amount of screen time because they're needed for the overall result. Jason Statham, hot as ever, was charming and smooth as Handsome Rob. Gotta love this cat. Mos Def really held it down as Left Ear. You could buy that he knew his way around explosives. Humans fascination with fire...lol. The action was a good pace. Made you want to be in the film and apart of the gang. The cinematography was rather lush for an action film, especially in Italy.

135,extravaluejotter,"No Sauce, just Plain Boiled Pasta",1,27 March 2007,"This is a woeful Hollywood remake of a classic British film. Everything that made the original ""Italian Job"" entertaining has been bled out of this festering sore of a movie ""scripted"" by Donna and Wayne Powers and listlessly ""directed"" by F Gary Gray. I am amazed that Troy Kennedy Martin (the screenwriter of the original film) allowed his name to be used in the credits for this pig's ear. Martin has worked on some of the finest film and TV projects of the last 40-odd years. Even being vaguely associated with this stinker is NOT A GOOD THING.The humour is forced, the drama is laboured, all the characters are cookie-cutter likable crims (with the exception of Charlize Theron's implausible, beautiful safe cracker/rally driver)and the plot only matches the original on the following points:(1) Three Minis (the modern BMW-made versions, but Minis nonetheless)(2) Use of the names Croker and Bridger for 2 of the main characters(3) Disrupting a city's traffic control system to provide a safe route through it.(4) Er, that's it.Otherwise, what you get is a bland and implausible American by-the-numbers heist movie in which a gang of jolly pirate chums eventually get the better of their evil associate. Believe me, it feels like an awful long time before they do. The cast do their best with what they're given but it seems that they all accepted it as a turd-polishing exercise after reading the script. None of the original film's quirky nature and distinctly British flavour has survived being fed into the Hollywood hamburger machine. Do yourself a favour and watch the original 1969 movie instead of this sucking chest wound.

136,Pavel-8,Good summer flick.,7,3 June 2003,"**Warning! Slight Plot Spoilers Ahead!**""The Italian Job"" is not the best movie you'll see all year, or probably even this summer. But it is a worthwhile two hours because it colors within the lines, knowing its limits and not attempting to exceed them.What carries the movie is the work of the cast.  In a movie about a crew of thieves, the individuals must have a good rapport with each other.  Without that cohesive feel, the audience doesn't believe in the characters collectively or individually, and the movie never has a chance.  But from the first scenes, in which the men joke around and rag on each other while infiltrating a Venetian palace, the proper chemistry is in place.
The characters themselves aren't anything novel; they're your basic gang of criminals, containing about half a dozen players, each with a specific and defining skill.  But each actor brings the proper goods to the table for his or her part.  Mark Wahlberg's understated acting and humor fits well with his part as the mastermind planner.  Edward Norton provides attitude and twirls his mustache well in his dark role.  Donald Sutherland is the father figure of the crew, and he looks the part of the suave and old-fashioned thief, who is still mentally spry.  Jason Statham, Seth Green, and Mos Def don't do much beyond their character's abilities, but they each nail those parts.  Statham as the smooth-operating driver; Green as the tech whiz geek with a chip on his shoulder; and Def as the demolitions man.  Charlize Theron slides in well in a part that doesn't ask too much of her.  She is primarily asked to to drive fast and look good.  That she does.  None of the characters are that deep or three-dimensional, but in this familiar sort of movie, two dimensions are all that is required.  As the title implies, the movie has a European feel to it, a la ""The Bourne Identity,"" in part because it was shot on location in Venice, along with Philadelphia and Los Angeles.  Also contributing to the Euro flair is the rhythmic, bouncy music, which adds to the upbeat nature of the flick and complements the rapport of the cast.  The look of the movie is also a perfect match.  The bright colors of all locales enhance the mood and add to the attitude.  The Minis not only provide a fun variation on the car chase, but also work as a necessary plot device.  The plot is more or less straight-forward.  There are a few surprises, but they are more of the swift-and-smooth-turn variety, as opposed to the drop-your-jaw hairpin curve.  Even with those, the movie speeds  along. Once the foundation is laid by the first act, everything continuously progresses.  Thankfully there are no breaks in the action for a romance, something the movie wisely avoided.  There aren't even any breaks for 'real life.'  The story has its purpose and runs that course without distractions. The lack of character depth prevents ""The Italian Job"" from being more than a good popcorn movie, but with all the complex details of the heist-planning, such superfluities would have dragged down the pace and quality of the flick.There are a number of implausibilities that I thought of both during and after viewing.  But the movie is so enjoyable that I didn't and don't care. In the real world, most of the movie probably couldn't have gone off that cleanly.  But ""The Italian Job"" doesn't take place in the real world.  It occurs in a stylish and light-hearted criminal world that appeals to the rebel in all of us.  ""The Italian Job"" is a movie, in the true sense of the word.  It has no pretenses of Oscar and contains no deep moral message.

Do not disturb mother-in law, mother nature or the Ukranian mafia is funny but is not in well put in the movie.  This movie is hollow because the actors how good they might be to save the movie cannot give the impression that this is a serious thing.  Even when somebody is killed it all looks too funny.

This is not a great movie, but it is good, and it is entertaining.  There are some good laughs, and it is generally a fun movie.  Works as a good date movie because of it softer crime nature.

The whole piece was based on the movie with the same title from 1969, and this proves that old pieces does not have to be bad pieces (as I'm afraid too many of you out there still claims) - with some new effects and some up to date characters this could be the actual hit in the world of movies in 2003. If you like speed, quick and intelligent comments (conversations), beautiful girls and some speedy chasing, this is the piece to look at.

There was little point in refilming the screenplay the way Gus VanSant had done with Psycho. Instead, director F Gary Gray and thescreenwriters have done a fine job taking the best elements fromthe original movie, then changing them to suit a new story.The result is a delicious mix of action, suspense and humour thatleft this fan hungry for more.

The cast is very good-looking (so much so that at one point when a new member of the gang is needed, you know it will be the best-looking person we've seen recently -- my wife and I had some laughs over that).

They must then try and steal the gold back and get revenge.The Italian Job (haven't seen the original) is a slick, and entertaining action comedy. Of course, it's not so much of a thinking man's movie, but pure popcorn entertainment. Thankfully it's not quite as dumb as most of those films are. There are little things throughout the film that gives a little bit of extra spice.The cast is good, having fun with their likable, albeit rather clichéd, characters. The biggest dud, however, is Wahlberg who simply can't bring any life or interesting features to the screen. A more charismatic lead would have been better.At two hours, the film is a bit too long. Especially the middle part that drags on for some time without really getting anywhere. Of course, the main reason for this film being made is the car chases (or blatant product placement). If you're really in to cars doing impossible stuff at high speeds, then you'll probably like it more than me (car chases are one of the most boring things you can put in a film), although these scenes are a bit less annoying than usual.The film looks great and technically there's not much to complain of. The biggest problem comes towards the end, when all that better-than-average writing is ditched in favour of stupid action and gaping plot holes. This happens in so many films that I'm starting to wonder if there's some secret organization out there, stealing the final reels of big budget films and messing them up on purpose... Anyway, it's a decent film that could have been better, so give it a try if you want. [5/10]",The Italian Job
149,davidemartin,An agreeable romp and a nifty heist flick,9,30 May 2003,"THE ITALIAN JOB is a good entertainment.  You won't learn any deep truths about the human condition, you won't really see any oscar winning performances, but you will be entertained.  Which really is what most movies should try to do.Okay, I've never seen the original Michael Caine ITALIAN JOB (I keep missing it on BBCAmerica), so I cannot compare the two.  What I can compare it to are recent heist flicks, like CONFIDENCE, THE HEIST, THE SCORE, the OCEANS ELEVEN remake, and (as my Dad pointed out) THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR.   It compares quite favorably.  You know the gang is going to get screwed by a confederate (thanks to the trailer, grrrr!) and that they are going to get their revenge.  The fun is watching how the intricate plot they plan is going to be carried out.  And the greater fun is watching how, when the first plan falls through, they improvise the second plan.I am especially impressed that the film is a true heist flick, like THE SCORE and THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, rather than a shoot-em-up like THE HEIST. When John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) says ""We pulled it off without drawing a single gun"", he sets the ground rules for the gang's later revenge plan.  Any dumb crook can shoot people; it takes brains to pull off a nonviolent heist.One interesting little cameo-by-proxy.  Watch closely when Steve Frezelli (Ed Norton) turns on his giant TV.  The image on the screen is a closeup of Michael Caine (I'm assuming from the original ITALIAN JOB).",The Italian Job

It is your basic revenge action robbery without police interference. Personally I think it was a wise idea to not show police, in this ""style"" of film, where you are cheering for the criminal to win.Good cast and acting, along with great stunts and effects. While this was my very first viewing of the movie on Netflix, I quickly noticed that many scenes have been duplicated in the video game ""GTA V"" right down to the buildings.

I did try to stick with it, hoping it would somehow improve further into the story, but no, it just became an unintended parody of itself.The intention seems to be an attempt at a more whimsical remake of the original film, but instead, it just came off ridiculously misguided and pointless. The clichéd caricatures of the various parts were just annoyingly simplistic, an insult to the cast of actors, all of whom are quite credible and talented. There was no depth of character development, nothing . . . just flat, cardboard representations of excruciatingly obvious non-entity clichés.I hope the actors at least were paid well for their time spent with this loser project.As for anyone actually watching this turkey, spare yourself the misery, and don't become a loser of your valuable time.",The Italian Job

It remains me a Hong Kong hi-tech stealing movie ""Downtown Torpedoes"".The death of John Bridger causes his daughter and his ""co-workers"" to retaliate with a vengeance to cook up an international $35 million Bali dancer gold bar heist carefully. Their plan is perfect, flawless and the car racing-chasing scenes though not stunning, it's well-designed. Bravo to the safecracking skills and the building blasting skills!One mis-cast is Edward Norton. He expressed that doing this project is out of responsibility but not choice. Well, this tells why his face does not match the ambiance. His face is not villain-looking, not cunning even though he wears a mustache. John Travolta, Clive Owen, Tim Roth all can replace him. Strangely, the top-notch team is too gentleman-looking, too soft, craftier faces are wanted.Thank God it's a decent action film of brain-teasing game and rivalry, it doesn't reek of sex, however, it might be due to this spicy void that the box office gave a less satisfactory report, and a re-release was desired. It's a sacred formula of Hollywood movie that: ""sex it up and sell it well"".If a love or sex scene is to be inserted to vacuum up more money, easy, Charlie and Stella strip, but first kick out Mark Wahlberg, put Ethane Hawke or Brad Pitt or Keanus Reeves instead. And bingo, bingo, money will come.It is evident that cinematography is not the selling point, and so my beloved San Marco Piazza, Venezia water canals are portrayed as drab district, mamma mia. If cinematography is done by Giles Nuttgens, the screen vision should surely be entirely different. The beauty of this world famous scenic city will be exposed to its fullest.

Probably my favorite heist film to date.The acting is all well done, especially from an A-list cast, with Mark Wahlberg, Donald Sutherland, Edward Norton, and Charlize Theron -- all expectations are met, and their performances are the ones we cheer and boo for.The action has great placement in the film. The pace is enjoyable, as we get scenes where they make the elements needed to get a job done, and scenes of very nicely filmed car chases.There's a lot of laughs to be had. The comedy works well, from the backstory of Seth Green's character -- who was the ""self-proclaimed"" original inventor of Napster, only to have his room-mate steal his plans while he was napping -- as well as Handsome Rob's freeway chases. All funny.All in all, The Italian Job is a movie I watch without any feeling of boredom or impatience, which is why I give it a 10-star review.

It's a quality heist flick with a very nice cast...and the mini coopers! You might say there's nothing really new here, but it's all done well. I've easily seen a dozen heist movies in the past few years, but this one is one of the best of the bunch. All of the actors played their characters well and really brought them to life with their little quirks. And the stunt work was phenomenal. From the minis to the boat chase in the canals of Venice, it was all very believable with the actors doing most of their own stunt work. This movie is a remake and I've been a little down on the large quantity of remakes in recent years. But the term remake is pretty loose here. The only real similarities are that it's a heist film that uses mini coopers for the getaway cars. The story is very different.

159,malcp,Surprisingly good,7,12 July 2011,"If like me, you were expecting a mediocre remake of the Michael Caine film, then this film should come as a pleasant surprise. Aside from a brief shot of 1960's Michael Caine on a TV in one shot, most connections are nominal and the only logical explanation for any attempt to tie-in to the first film must be to do with financial support from BMW for the inclusion of their ""new"" Mini. In fact I found this about the only bit of the film that never really rang true, it's explained away because of the width of a corridor the gang need to drive down. However, unlike the first film where the original Mini was a quintessential element in the 'swinging London' British theme of the film and where its presence seemed logical with the England football team playing in Italy. In the new film any car of a similar size would have done the trick and using brand new red, white and blue Minis could only make the gang stand out like a sore thumb. Still, the pace is good, the actions flowing and the speedboat and helicopter stunt work are particularly notable. Whatever it's merits or otherwise, this film couldn't have anything like the impact the original Italian Job had when it was first shown, but if you watch the original now it does seem very dated.

The story unfolds at a friendly speed with a few interesting features thrown in, including meaningful dialogue between a man and a woman that is not a lame seduction scene. Sometimes, an all-star cast becomes frustrated by the inability of big stars to work unselfishly as an ensemble, but this film provides a satisfying exception and example of how it can be done right. The 1969 Caine version has little to offer in the way of complications and subplots, which this update rectifies with flair, while maintaining an excellent standard in unique car chase elements. It is an action flick, however, and does play a little loose with scientific verities, such as how long a person can survive at a low body temperature.",The Italian Job

So why not 10 then, well there are enough technical errors to stretch belief or cause significant irritation, which even for a caper movie should be addressed... like when the minis launch out of the storm duct with a tonne of gold in the boot/trunk, they should all rear end down like the earth was a huge magnet, yet they all nose-dive into the water because in reality the engine weights more than an empty boot!
Then the chances of getting the truck to stop exactly where it needs to before blowing ip the road to drop the truck into an empty underground space..... is well simply unbelievable. I do like the ultra-fast flash of Spiderman for no reason whatsoever around this point, just adds to the quickness of why is that even in the movie?

(ok movie),7,4 June 2003,"As a movie, THE ITALIAN JOB is ok at best; good (not great) acting,nice visuals and pacing, a mediocre plot, but nothing bad enoughto walk out on.  But as a car commercial for the new breed of MINICoopers, this film is spectacular!*SPOILERS*Ok, it's a typical heist film with the odd twist (the underwater safe- cracking was nice, if not improbable), and the cast was fairly solid(with the exception of a putrid Wahlberg), but when it all camedown to it, the real ""stars"" of this picture were the three MINICoopers, in all their high-flying, speed-racing, ramp-jumping,bullet-taking, gold-lugging, shiny new glory.  The audience I wassitting amongst actually ""ooed"" and ""aahed"" when Theron's littlered number first hit the screen (strangely enough, neither she norWahlberg garnered the same reaction).
The film starts out promising.  Mos Def, Seth Green, DonaldSutherland, Edward Norton and Jason Statham all begin as aninteresting and humourous band of characters, with the only realuninspired performance being that of the usually good MarkWahlberg.  Why he claims this is his best film I can't imagine; hischaracter is completely one-note, and he plays him so blandly itwas as if Mr. Rogers came back from the dead and was inhabitinghis body.  Charlize is fine as Sutherland's daughter, thoughnothing magical.  Seth Green's character is perfect and therunning Napster jokes (including a cameo by Napster founder,Shawn Fanning) are hilarious; he and some of Mos Def's earlylines add some much needed sparks of humour.  Unfortunately,Edward Norton and Donald Sutherland don't get near enoughscreen time.You can see most of the plot coming from a mile away, and thedialogue is rife with bad one-liners and give-aways, but I doubt thefilmmakers were out to re-invent the wheel here, so taken as atypical action/suspense flick it comes out alright.

Who cares if Clooney wins back Julia Roberts? The guy is a stud anyway and could get any girl. But, you hate to see Donald Sutherland die and you can sympathize with Charlie (Wahlberg) who was like a son to Sutherland and Theron who is Sutherland's daughter.Edward Norton puts in another brilliant performance as the bad guy. It is truly a pleasure seeing this guy on screen; he can play anything!

I cared about these people, and even though some of the stunts seemed a bit much, it still left me feeling like ""it's possible""  verses ""what a stupid video game"" (like the Matrix)This movie isn't brain surgery, it's very straight forward.

Although, according to the DVD commentary, the writers for this film didn't actually see the original before writing for this one, it really looks as if they did and made a conscious effort to improve on it. Because where the original seemed to meander and drag, this one quickly takes you into the story and continues non-stop until the finish. And while the first lacked emotional punch, the re-make added some via the seeking of revenge for death of the team's father figure. And I liked the way how the mini-cooper was introduced by allowing us to see its usefulness early on in the film so that we could understand the team's choice for it in their heist. In the first film, the mini-coopers were simply arbitrarily chosen with little reason as to why. The heist and getaway plan in this film was more intricate, clever and interesting than the one in the first. In short, this is a fast-paced, exciting and smart film.

With revenge in mind, Mark Wahlberg and the gang decide to steal that money back. They manage to hire Charlize Theron to work for them (she plays Bridger's daughter, Stella).So, that's the plot. You can guess what happens; good guys win, bad guys lose. What's new? Well, how some really great chase scenes, and a terrifically satisfying ending?

172,Jack_Yan,Surprise! It's not pants,7,14 August 2003,"Being a fan of the original Italian Job, I feared the worst. What friends and I got tonight, on its first night down here, was a well-paced Hollywood film that's a nice throwback to actioners that aren't disgustingly violent, with lighter moments and a distinctive flavour. For once I agree with Mark Wahlberg when he described this third classic-remake starring him as a 'reimagining'. While it's clearly based on the original 1969 film, director F. Gary Gray (to whom I take off my hat) moves the proceedings along at such a pace that during its viewing, you aren't thinking of Michael Caine's Charlie Croker and Noël Coward's Mr Bridger. In fact, you like, but not sympathize with, the new characters of Handsome Rob, Left Ear and Lyle  a.k.a. Napster.To show how different, there are very brief flashback sequences to the childhoods of Left Ear and Charlie Croker, appropriately accompanied by period pop music  and fortunately these aren't as bad as they sound.Gray allows his performers room to move. Therefore, their own characters emerge, in particular Seth Green's unscripted imitation of Jason Statham's voice and accent in one scene. Gray places the camera inside the cars with the actors to get some great shots of Charlize Theron (in particular), Wahlberg and Statham driving. It's apparent to the audience that they enjoyed making this film, with the exception of Norton, whose real-life lack of interest probably suited his role of double-crosser quite well.But these aren't substantial characters. They are caricatures. You root for them because it's part of going to a movie for entertainment value and enjoying yourself. There is no additional reason: Wahlberg pales in scenes with Donald Sutherland because there is a too-evident comparison against a great actor. And thank God he drives so much because he sure as heck cannot walk like a man.But Wahlberg, while lacking presence, is acceptable at all other times, as are the others. While we know she can act and act well from her earlier movies, Theron has her great beauty on her side, but largely goes through the motions.Green is the only exception, turning in an excellent performance as a frustrated hacker who claims to be the inventor of Napster.The entertainment value continues with far less blood than modern actioners and the ending  which I won't reveal  is less controversial than Troy Kennedy Martin's original.In fact, don't expect any of the layers of meaning of the Kennedy Martin script, the commentary on a declining British national pride and economy and the idealism of ""Britain with her back to the wall"". Don't expect the interplay of the soccer game between England and Italy and its parallel against the Croker gang and the Mafia in the ""job"". There is a single track here, no extra meaning.And don't expect memorable Quincy Jones melodies such as 'On Days Like These' or 'Self-preservation Society'. John Powell's score is standard, early-2000s Hollywood fare that will seem very period in five years' time.Despite some moments, this film is largely predictable. The trailer lets most things out of the bag and the involvement of a separate Mafia  this time Ukrainian  is minimal. Still, it's a mainstream audience-pleaser that can stand strongly on its own merits. It's a 9 on the entertainment scale (a point off for a naff ending)  so let that be your motive when seeing this film.",The Italian Job

The early film is of course not available on Netflix streaming.Cost 60 million grossed 176 million...Had a black director...so won all kinds of prizes...it was not taut and the filming below average so it gets a 5. Usually in this price range Hollywood can crank out tight beautifully crafted camera work....The idea of repeating the tactics of having the 1 ton safe crash through 2 floors into a canal with a 20 ton armored truck was clever and had a nice touch of covering up the hole made with a sheet of steel...why not make it asphalt covered that would have been even more funny. Having them escape on an Amtrak train made me scratch my head as probably the worst idea they could possibly come up with if this was a real heist. I have yet to take an Amtrak train that was not at least 6 hours late.They must have consumed all their money on the stunts which were quasi believable plus car chases all of which are kind of ho hum any more...controlling traffic lights yawn...Amtrak??? pours cold water on any thing.Add better writers. Tight Hollywood film craft for hard to do angles etc...then it would have got a 6 or even a 7 as normal fareI like this kind of genre but there needs to be some suspense this takes skill and subtlety not dollars...this thing has the twists but they are not scary nor suspenseful---it also has sort of corny humor feel good 50s squareness to it (one gang member dreaming of how he would spend his money wanted a stereo that would blow women's clothes off)--added half a star for that oddity though others might subtract half a star.Read some of the 1 star reviews they are entertaining...this thing doesn't exactly bore but I looked at the time left several times....Recommend? if you have time to kill or a female under 16 apparently the largest audience group...(they thought the male stars hot ????--and I am gay they did zero for me--except maybe the 500 pound guy or the Ukrainians--joke) This is your review, you may delete or edit it.",The Italian Job
176,Dkish,`The Italian Job' is a very subtle heavily encased heist film.,6,30 May 2003,"One part `The Score', two parts `Ocean's Eleven', a twist of `The Heist' and shake then serve chilled at a European locale. This is the almost recipe for `The Italian Job'.`The Italian Job' is a film loosely inspired by the cult British film of the same name. In the way that `Ocean's Eleven' was a remake of the Rat Pack classic of the same name, `The Italian Job' borrows a couple elements but never tries to clone the original.In this version of `The Italian Job', Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie Croker, a protégé to the infamous retiring thief master, John Bridger (Donald Sutherland). It's John's last heist and he hopes to bring in a haul worth $35 million dollars in gold. All John wants is to hug his now grown daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron) and retire into the shadows. But all goes to hell when a vindictive and jealous member of the gang, Steve (Edward Norton), decides to double-cross the team. John's last mission ends in blood-shed and the team loses their 35 million dollar prize. Now it's up to Charlie and the rest of his gang to take out Steve in one giant heist.
`The Italian Job' is a very subtle heavily encased heist film. There is a lot more talking and planning in this film then the actual action sequences. Because the film is laid out that way it makes sense to have assembled such a colorful cast.In some ways the casting choices are great but the film also has some hang-ups. In the scenes with Edward Norton, you can definitely see his lack of enthusiasm with the role. There could have been so much more tension and poisoned-filled vengeance if Norton would have put more into the role.The other casting hang-up is the romantic chemistry between Wahlberg and Theron. I really do like each actor a lot but I found it very hard to believe that there was anything more than a brother-sister or colleague kind of relationship. Did I miss something?The great casting choices actually are in the film's supporting cast. The chemistry between Seth Green's techno-whiz, Napster and Jason Statham's Handsome Rob were pure magic. These two really are the hi-lights of the movie. I really want to see more of both in the future. How about a Handsome Rob and Napster flick?I really did enjoy the stunts and action sequences of the film. I especially enjoyed the new version of the Mini. To bad those cars weren't in the `The Fast & the Furious'. `Italian Job' could have been in the same league as `The Fast & the Furious' if it would have relaxed a bit. I can just imagine what this film would have been like if it would have been revved up some. (3 out of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.",The Italian Job
177,elu5iv3,"Good movie, but one of Norton's lesser roles.=",7,25 August 2003,"The Italian Job: 6.5/10Although the concept of ""The Italian Job"" only appealed to me mildly, the inclusion of one of my favourite actors, Edward Norton, made me decide to check it out. I was reluctant even with Norton involved, as he was forced to take this role to break out of a contract. The plot is based around a theft in Venice that goes perfectly, only for one of the team members (Norton) to betray the others, killing the mentor of the lead character (played by Mark Wahlberg). Said mentor just happened to be Donald Sutherland, who was excellent and underused in the movie. The movie followed a basic plot of revenge, and was fun to watch, if not perfect. Charlize Theron was very good as the daughter of Sutherland's character, who hesitantly joins the team for revenge on Norton's character. However, Mark Wahlberg is a very ""blah"" actor, who often fails to distinguish himself and make himself worthy of a leading role. Although he wasn't bad, I felt that many others could have worked the role better. Now as for Norton's role, it was one of his worst ever. It was very run-of-the-mill by Norton, who didn't work too well as the main villain, although had his moments. Many of the things that make Norton such a great actor were missing, and you could tell this wasn't exactly a role he wanted. Overall, a good movie that is worth watching once, maybe twice for the awesome heist at the start, that is worked so well.",The Italian Job

I think we all like Italian Job more.It was a good little action flick.  Even though I am sick of seeing Mark Walberg in movies, I enjoyed this movie.  It starts with a safe heist by a group of hi-tech thieves.  The group is double-crossed by a member of the team played by Edward Norton.  The team re-groups and decides it is time to take action and get back the stolen gold that should have been theirs in the first place.They scope out the house make a plan to rob the person that double-crossed them.  He finds out, so they must change the plan to steal the money during transport.  The plan involves blowing out the road and dropping the armored transport onto the subway.  It is pretty ingenious and original and the movie stays fast paced with car chases.  I love the Mini's in the movie. There is a car chase in the movie motorcycles chase the Mini's throughout the bottom of the subway system, and the Mini's are later chased by helicopter in the air.  I think the next car I get will be a Mini.  I probably cannot afford the Americanized, high priced model.

His character had no morals which explained why he was able to turn on his follow thieves.  The director left no stone unturned.  Every word and action was accounted for and in my opinion, that's a huge contributor to what makes a good flick.

185,the-evil-cult,Unrealistic but Entertaining,7,28 June 2007,"The Italian Job is about a robbery done for money and for revenge on a man who betrayed them in an earlier robbery.First off, this is a very entertaining, very cool movie. It glamorizes thievery but also shows a noble side among thieves. Charlize Theron is by far the most attractive woman ever, and in this movie she is just sizzling hot. From every angle she is a work of art.One of the things about this movie that annoyed was the branding. I don't know whether the brands were deliberately there for marketing purposes or whether they were essential for the plot. At the beginning of the film we notice the divers are wearing Casio G-Shocks. One hypothesis is that the film is marketing Casio watches. The other hypothesis is that G-Shocks are normally what divers use anyway because of the brand's shock resistance. There are plenty of references made to Aston Martins, and the film probably help market many new MINIs. Of course, they're not going to use a Ford Suburban for this robbery because of the SUV's size and slowness, so the MINI was probably necessary. The MINI is an icon for many people. Even though MINI is owned by BMW many believe the MINI is a symbol of Britishness. The car's status as a cultural icon is probably what justifies its price premium, as it is about double the price of a Corolla. Probably not worth it for a small car if you were totally utilitarian, but most people don't buy cars just to get from A to B.While watching The Italian Job, I kept thinking to myself how unrealistic the whole plot was. Everything was planned to perfection and only one small thing had to go wrong for everything to fail. For everything to fall into place so perfectly is like flipping a coin twenty times and getting it to land heads up every single time. The film is definitely over-the-top but that was probably what made it so entertaining in the first place.",The Italian Job
186,mkw-5,The robbery entertainment at it's best,9,9 April 2006,"Very well made, smooth and light action-comedy entertainment. Good actors.

This movie's characters are a little more realistic: They have dreams, pasts, feelings and everything. One problem with movies that have as much (main) characters as this, is that of course the characters cannot be very deep or developed.The money fetish is an interesting issue in these movies. But maybe it's just as good fetish as anything: People must have (or at least they very often want to have) something that gives their life some goals, excitement, hobbies... And like in this case, the money comes connected (after a tragic incident) to everything in these people's lifes, so deeply that they are ready to risk their lifes for it.I would say this movie is very much like the best few of the James Bond movies.

192,evilasahobby,Caper by numbers,3,15 August 2003,"""The Italian Job"" is a caper movie done by the numbers. Riding on the back of every caper cliche, it rises to no particular heights and will be a movie footnote by about the end of the month.The biggest problem is that ""The Italian Job"" possesses no imagination at all. I've seen it all before and done better then. The acting is fine  the cinematography is completely acceptable, but this film breaks absolutely no new ground.Let's tick off the cliches: - ""old-school"" criminal father figure and his protege - another gang member jealous of protege - a double-cross - only bad guys use guns while good-guy criminals don't have to - good criminals always outwit the bad guysAnd that's about the first fifteen minutes. Everything is so predictable. Even the heist and car chase scenes, supposedly the highlight of the movie, seem pretty ordinary. This is especially true since they appeared in the trailers for the film so I already knew what to look for.For me, a caper film works only if it has an element of realism - that maybe, just maybe, it could be pulled off without relying on a deux ex machina or ""just because"" moments. Parts of ""The Italian Job"" just throws that out the window, with computers doing things that computers can't do, the good guys not hitting anyone with their driving (especially going down the stairs) and not one single police car responding to street explosions, recklessly driven minis or even a low flying helicopter. Must be a heck of a city for these things not to rate a response.The acting is passable, with the crew (Seth Green, Jason Stratham and Mos Def) being at least fun to watch. Mark Wahlberg is just too smarmy as the ""nice guy"" hero while Charlize Theron is about the only actor called on to display some kind of range. Donald Sutherland is a class act as always and shows up Wahlberg's deficiencies every moment they are together.Overall this is a pretty uninteresting film. Given the IMDb ratings, it's the girls that really love this film, which I can understand to some extent, but there are such better caper films out there - even the vapidness of the recent ""Ocean's Eleven"" outshines the non-event that is ""The Italian Job"".

193,RandomTask-AP,A $10 Heist - FYI: possible spoilers,5,30 May 2003,"There's nothing like a heist film. The gadgets are cool. The stakes are high. Everybody is a snappy dresser.  And the thieves are eminently likeable characters exhibiting Zen calm or comedic sarcasm toward their tense profession. If you've come to play, The Italian Job, a remake of the 1969 film by the same name staring Michael Caine, will be a good time. However, if you're looking for the surprise movie to upset the summer clogged with superheroes or make a timeless entry in the crime catalogue, you won't quite find your contender here.Starting out in Venice, the characters are introduced as they boost $35 million in gold bars from some rather ugly and shady characters guarding a safe in a smoke-filled apartment. It's just enough exposition to let you know who everyone is and that the thieves function as more of a well-bonded fraternity than a group of criminals. John (Donald Sutherland) is father to Stella (Charlize Theron) and plays master-heistman and father figure to Charlie (Mark Wahlberg) just long enough for Steve (Edward Norton, who is rumored to be part of the cast only under the duress of a lingering studio contract) to betray the group - setting up everyone's motivation for the remainder of the film.Burning through a cliché-riddled script is often the task at hand for summer movie fare, and the cast is largely up to the challenge. Ed Norton goes for the throat in a Snidely Whiplash mustache and goatee making Steve remorseless in his pursuit of luxury. Charlize Theron is the film's most compelling character who has the greatest motivation for revenge, but not convinced that the second heist attempt is the best way to go about putting her personal tragedy behind her. She also takes flat lines that could come from any action film and does her best to make her Stella stand out. Mos Def, and Franky G have fun breathing brains into their back-up muscle. Jason Stratham has the best career move here as Handsome Rob, the getaway driver and smooth-talker. Every time Seth Green comes on screen, you're just waiting to see how he'll steal the scene with a flourish of his jaded GenX programmer's pent up itch for attention.The weak part of the group is Wahlberg. It isn't that he fails to fill the leading man role with a wild twinkle in his eye and provide a protagonist for the audience to jump into the ride with. There just isn't enough for him to distinguish this Charlie from a plethora of other leading heist men. He's the guy who's going to get the girl. You are certain of it. From the moment John mentions his daughter and all his regrets, you are positive that he isn't going to make it out of the first act alive and that Charlie will be carrying his professional and personal torches the rest of the way. The script just doesn't make out the specifics, and Wahlberg lacks the unspoken charisma that made George Clooney's con man in ""Ocean's Eleven"" both likeable and distinct among movie heroes.The script shows its seams most during the second act when the characters are supposed to be driving the story. The suspension of disbelief has kicked in enough to let the audience hang in until the 3rd act heist, which is really what everyone came for. Director F. Gary Gray takes the opportunity to make one of the most memorable moments in his movie a quiet one of suspense that interrupts the heist and challenges Stella in particular.
Then it is off and running and a solidly fashioned and special-effect-free race through the streets, subways and reservoirs of Los Angeles. Without giving things away, it is a romp that makes the city of LA more of a character than it usually is by making traffic a real factor in the theft and ensuing chase. There is something about the danger of genuinely crafted stunts that makes the expected face-off between the thieves and Steve more satisfying than it has a right to beSo if you like the thrill of a con game or a good chase, go for the ride but if you're in it for character, take your friends because they will be the ones who will provide the evening's best conversation.A 5 out of 10 from this movie-goer.",The Italian Job

196,Klaatu-18,Just another (remake) caper movie,6,7 May 2003,"Contains Spoiler!! A couple of weeks ago I got a pass to see a screening of this movie.The title sounded familiar, so I checked the imdb and found that it was a remake of a movie Michael Caine had done in 1969. I went down to my favorite mom-and-pop video store to check it out.What I found was a so-so caper movie about a robbery of a vanload of gold on the streets of Turin (hence The Italian Job). Caine was the leader who was using the plan of one man (killed in the opening minutes of the movie) and the money and material provided by a criminal boss (Noel Coward) who doesn't let being in prison interfere with his activities.The central set-piece was the robbery, followed by a crazy chase scene through the streets, walkways and stairs (!) of Turin. The plan called for using the city's computerized traffic control system to tie up traffic (and the police) while they use the only unjammed corridor to escape with the loot.This is the central part of the new movie as well. The twist is that they steal the gold and then have it stolen from them. It is only in the stealing it back that they return to the original.This time Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie Croker, the Michael Caine part and the computer expert (a hacker, of course) is played by Seth Green (Benny Hill in the original). Seth plays a computer whiz who claims to have created the Napster software, but it was stolen from him while he was dozing (while napping, get it!).I can imagine what you're saying: ""Benny Hill! The original version must've been a real funny one"". Sorry. Benny and Seth both are left with little to do. Seth has a couple of good scenes but that's it.What you're left with is unsatisfying. It's not a split-second gosh-wow caper movie like the remake of ""Ocean's Eleven"" nor is it a comedy of errors like the classic ""The Hot Rock"" (AKA ""The Four Masterminds""). The best part, as in the original, is the big chase scene: three small cars darting in and out of traffic and generally driving where you shouldn't. (The chase scene in the original is IMHO one of the best I've ever seen)This is one to wait for it to get to the video store. Meanwhile, visit your local mom-and-pop video store and rent ""The Hot Rock"". You'll be glad you did.",The Italian Job
197,sathyaaero,A different heist movie,9,17 August 2020,"A good technical heist movie which was completely different from other heist movies. The story was different and build intersting. The cinematography and music was really good. The person of everyone who acted in this film was good and perfect, it doesn't felt like they're acting. It doesn't get bored in any portions and worth watch.",The Italian Job
198,JonSnowsMother,Enjoyable but pointless,7,14 October 2008,"I really enjoyed the Italian Job with Michael Caine i thought it was a exciting,funny and a perfect Brit action/comedy. This one though i had mixed emotions, Maybe if i never saw the original i could give it 9 or maybe even a 10 but after only recently seeing the original i just couldn't like it as much. But i do admit that it was better than expected i will give the producers and writers a pat on the back because mainly when Hollywood remake a classic British film it is awful but this beats the average remake, I liked the cast even though i'm usually not to fond of most of them though like Mark Whalberg even though he seems like a nice guy i just think he makes to many poor choices and he same for Charlize Theron i think she's talented and very pretty i think a she has quite a long list of bad choices but i liked them both in this.Overall-I found it better the than expected i taught the acting and writing were very good and the way they make the truck ""Disappear"" gives two thumps up from me. But it lacks the humour and action of the original.I am relieved they didn't ruin ""You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off"" none of the cast could have pulled it off better than Sir Michael Caine",The Italian Job
199,camachoborracho,Average Heist Movie,6,26 November 2004,"I haven't seen the original film and therefore cannot compare, however, whatever was unique about that one seems to be missing, except for maybe the ending.The acting is flat and uninspired - you've got Wahlberg and Theron as your stars? Yikes. (Apparently Norton made it clear this was a contract and you can tell he hates being here, which maybe helped his performance as a villain). The characters are all clichés from other heist films: explosives guy (also token black guy), computer nerd/comic relief, ""crazy"" foreign dude/driver, hot girl and way too cool hero. There is not really any character development as this is plot driven and action heavy, not that this is necessarily bad.The technicals (sound, lighting, cinematography) are all great but the real winner here is the editing pumped up by a steady soundtrack. Without giving much away the best part is the ending. This film is not really memorable but it is entertaining Hollywood action and I can't say I disliked it, but it's nothing spectacular.As the title implies, this is just another job for everyone involved (which explains the average acting).OVERALL: 6/10. Fun to rent and watch once.",The Italian Job
200,elvylanda,Still a very cool movie!!!,8,30 January 2020,"Yeah, just started rewatching Italian Job after so many years and it still holds very well and is very entertaining. It has aged very well as a movie that was made in 2003. I don't care about plot or storyline I am an action movie fan; I consider this an action movie more than a heist film because it has car chases, guns, explosion. To me a heist film is more a who done it with mystery. Italian Job is clearly an action film and a very good one that is worth a watch on a boring cold day in the winter time. Anyway, someone from Fast and Furious must have watched this film because it's plot and characters are eerily similar to what Fast and Furious became beginning with FF4.",The Italian Job

202,Flyer78,"Phenomenal action, Somewhat generic story.",6,20 July 2009,"There are movies that you absolutely MUST see before you die (Shawshank Redemption, Good Bad and Ugly, etc). There are movies that are very good, but one little factor kept them from being classics (The Bourne Trilogy). And then there are movies that you kick back and watch on Friday night. Italian Job is the latter.This was a very fun movie to watch, and the action in it was very well choreographed, no doubt. This had some of the best chase scenes I think I have ever scene. The acting was good as well. How could it not be? Modern greats like Wahlberg, Theron, Statham, and others were all cast in this movie in ideal roles for their style. But the thing that keeps this movie from being something truly special is the most important element in a good film- the storyline.Let's be honest. How many times have we seen movies that revolve around a group of criminals that go after someone else that in most cases double-crossed them? This storyline simply does not have anything unique in it that sets it apart from any other action/crime film.Reservoir Dogs had the unique characters and unpredictable story. Godfather was sheerly epic. Italian Job was......just a fun little movie.This was one of those movies. We've all seen them. They have so much potential to be something great, but they don't have anything truly original in them, and they end up becoming nothing more than a standard action flick. I'm not saying this is bad, because it's a very fun movie to watch. I'm just saying if you are looking for something special that will leave you in awe, this isn't it.6/10",The Italian Job

Because of that, it doesn't matter how unrealistic this movie might be. You also won't believe how the movie ends or how it gets there. Mark Wahlberg is perfect in the lead role. He is actually rugged and is a smooth actor. The other actors are all good-looking as well, and talented and in-shape. I also love the catchy one-liners in the dialogue!

210,jemmytee,Fun and flashy but them Minis deserved better,6,23 October 2004,"I've yet to see the original film, so I don't know if this is an improvement on or detriment to it...but this was an okay movie unto itself. The capers were quick and a bit ridiculous, but not so much so that they weren't involving. F. Gary Gray kept the action going fast enough to where you could ignore the plot-holes and occasional stupidity of the characters. It sure did LOOK good and had that technical polish we've come to expect of modern American chase movies.But...I don't know how to say this, but the film was like...I dunno, like a helium balloon that's four days old. It still floats, but hasn't got the happiness a fresh balloon has. And I can't really fault the director, this time; he did better than journeyman work and had some really flashy moments. And the writers...well...they didn't try to get away with all that much dumb or irritating stuff, unlike some other thrillers have tried. It's mainly the performances.Oh, Donald Sutherland was letter perfect, as usual, and Seth Green can do no wrong in my eyes. But while Mark Wahlberg handled his lines well enough, he seemed like a kid. Edward Norton, who has done some powerful work in the past, seemed even more like a kid. Mos Def seemed like a kid. Charlize Theron seemed like she was only there to make sure the guys came across as straight. But not one of them had any heft or danger or threat to their actions, despite the punches and doublecrosses and threats and gunplay. Even at the end, when Edward Norton is facing his inevitable end, he seemed more peeved than anything else. The fact is, aside from Sutherland and Green -- who carried more weight when he was mimicking ""Handsome Rob"" than when Jason Statham was mimicking himself -- the most convincing performances were turned in by the Minis. And that is sad.Compare this film to ""The Bourne Identity"" or even ""Speed"" and you can see how lightweight the acting in it is. That's not to say it's not a fun movie...it's just nothing more.

I was worried the Napster joke was going to get old quick, but it stayed fresh, and it was nice to see Shawn Fanning again.  Seth Green's Lyle (The Napster) is the greatest character in the movie, and his VO of Handsome Rob and Becky from the car is the funniest scene in the movie.  He steals every scene he is in.  Also...there's a quick cameo from Spider-Man! Blink and you'll miss it! Right when the guys are blowing up the ground to get the truck, there's a quick shot of him.  Good stuff, enjoyable popcorn that is most definitely worth seeing.  My only complaint is that the most talented actor in the cast (Edward Norton) is given the least interesting character, made especially disappointing since the villain is usually supposed to be more interesting than the hero.

This film is very fun and entertaining.  It is also quite funny, and doesn't take itself too seriously.Edward Norton essentially reprises his previous character from ""The Score"", another partner-in-crime-turned-traitor.  His on-screen presence is perfect for his character.  Charlize Theron turns in what, IMHO, is the most convincing piece of acting I have seen from her, playing the vengeful daughter of a slain man.  There are no weak spots in the casting -- Wahlberg and the rest were quite good.My only complaint about this movie was that the plot was bit too predictable.  Had I been in charge of the script, I would have tried to include another surprise or two during the last half hour, ala ""The Game"" or ""Malice.""Some may see this movie as a cheap cross between ""Ocean's 11"" and ""The Score.""  But I think it makes for a great time, and I plan to see it again.",The Italian Job
216,meako1973,A brit perspective,9,17 September 2003,"People have been waiting to criticize this film since it was first announced.  Everyone ready to pounce at the opportunity to say how it is `no-where near as good as the original,' and that `the original was a classic and shouldn't be remade!'  (although when you look at the original now, it isn't really a classic!  Yes, there is THAT mini scene, and the `bloody doors' quote, but aside from that it was a slow film.  Good, but not classic.)Anyway, here is the chance for all you naysayers to pounce, and then find that you are really disappointed..'cos Italian Job is a pretty good film. Heck, I'd even go so far as to say it is a damned enjoyable film!The film doesn't remake the first film, and a recent interview with the director revealed that the intention was never to remake, but to homage. Indeed it does pay homage.  A bullion heist in Venice is successful, until one of the gang of thieves betrays the rest and leaves them for dead. Months later, they all seek to steal the gold back, and get their revenge.One of the things that makes this film so much fun (aside from the mini scenes, which I won't go into detail about, suffice to say they are 'cool') is the caliber of actors on display, and the likeability of the 'good guys' (if indeed a thief can be a good guy).  Much in the same way Oceans 11 seemed perfect in the casting, so does this.  Mark Wahlberg is the smooth mastermind behind the scams, and with Ed Norton as the bad guy, adding Seth Green, Charlize Theron, Jason Statham, and Donald Sutherland into the mix is pure genius.  The personalities bounce off each other well, creating a group of players that you do care about.  Norton is as good as ever, but seems to be just playing by numbers.  He has been vocal about how he didn't really want to do this film, and now I understand why.  He is an actor who likes to take on different roles..this was just a repeat of his performance in the Score.  Nontheless, still a good actor.Direction is pacey, and the story keeps moving throughout, with the initial heist being a work of genius, to the introduction of the players (with amusing flashbacks), then the set up for the new heist.  Witty dialogue is scattered throughout, giving that extra character to each of the stars.So, feel free to criticize this film, and compare it to the first..but make sure you watch it first before you make an ass of yourself!",The Italian Job
217,Tralequang,A very boring watch,5,20 September 2020,"I cannot stress enough how disappointed I was watching this movie. The pace is too slow for the genre, the jokes are corny, all the action scenes (except from the sewage car chase) are boring, the theft itself is not innovative, and the character developments are just done for the sake of it.
Music would have helped enhance the experience, but the movie is deaf. Considering the vigor Speed achieved in 1994 and the wit shown in Ocean's Eleven in 2001, I really can't comprehend what they were doing with this movie.",The Italian Job
218,bkam,Heist Adventure,5,9 June 2003,"While it was a fairly typical heist movie, this film was more in the adventure category to me than action.  Its lack of cursing, violence, and sex in some ways was refreshing, but on the other hand it did lose some of the grittiness of a movie about lowlifes.  I'm not saying that there needs to be another movie in which everyone betrays each other and ends up dead, but rather that the honor among thieves theme may have been pushed too far in this movie.The energetic and enjoyable score and the cool but entirely unartistic camera work help to give the movie some of its character.  The acting was fine, with nobody particularly memorable and without much opportunity for good acting; despite this, the characters' individual talents were fun throughout the film.  Two static but still entertaining characters are ""Napster"" (who's funny) and Handsome Rob (who's just sweet).  The plot is utterly predictable in every way; they made no attempt to disguise Steve's betrayal at the beginning (even though I'm informed that the previews showed this--never watch TV).  Neither was there any doubt over whether Stella would help them.  As a result many of the early scenes were dry and cliché.The action scenes are typical, but typically entertaining.  I was impressed by the fact that they made those stupid looking minicoopers semi-cool, and the final elaborate plan unfolds rather well.  If you're into heists or cool non-violent action but you don't mind a Deus ex Machina, a trite plot, and an unmemorable cast, this is one for you.  I should mention that for reasons entirely unfathomable to me, my female friends seem to be of the ludicrous consensus that Ed Norton and Mark Wahlberg are hot (never mentioning Jason Statham whose coolness boosts him far above them IMO), so if you're one of those kind of people that might make the film better for you.

221,tonopah6,Nonsense; but somewhat entertaining,2,4 February 2004,"It started off okay: the Italian heist scene; But when one of the thief crew, (Edward Norton), decides to take the gold for himself, the situation resulted into the rest of the crew ending up in freezing water, for several minutes - the death time exposure would kill anybody, but the crew lived through it. There must have been some heavy doses of vitamin intake by those guys in preparation for unusual events, because, not only did they live through that, they sat around on the rocks beside the water, in that freezing cold, pondering their next move, which of course, was revenge. And then, the double-crossing 'Norton' ended up in Los Angeles, of all places. Shamefully the movie reverted to a lower class atmosphere. With the 35 million in gold, Norton then buys a house that looks to be worth 30 million. Doesn't figure? To which then all he does, and is concerned about, is to watch TV. Mark Wahlberg gets Charlize Theron, (the daughter of the only crew member to die), to help with the revenge plan; she's a safe-cracking specialist with an idiot passion for driving outrageously. Some hype dung there. Matter of fact there's hype dung everywhere. You've got your typical computer geek--nothing new there. But you don't have your typical ladies man--this guy looks like a street fighter losing his hair, and he's used to seduce a TV cable woman for the purpose of arranging, (wouldn't you know), the look-alike Charlize into getting inside Norton's house: a house that Charlize scans for a safe that might have the gold. Okay, continuing in short: getting to that safe is complex and watchable--street traffic scenes highlight the obtaining of the truck containing the safe. But . . . Man O Man . . . With those dinky cars that they used to transport the gold: one scene--get this, they went into a subway rail system by driving along the platform and then take a right turn to get onto those tracks (ten feet below)! Man, that's just so damn undoable: in actuality they would have nose-dived . . . Crashed and piled up. And that's this movie; it's full of the undoable! --Made because Hollywood only cares about entertainment, not quality. Edward Norton had been getting some respect from me, but now I've lowered him a notch or two.

225,Simmonz,"Good heist film, with the exception of Wahlberg",8,25 June 2003,"The Italian Job: Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward NortonThose are just a few to grace this cast. I don't know what it is about heist film always having all-star casts but gotta love it. On to the movie, its about a group of theives who steal $35 million in gold only to have a member of their crew (Norton) double-cross them to take the gold for himself and leave the crew for dead. Well don't you know it the crew survives (minus one) and want payback. Thus introduce car chases, neat gizmos, cool cars, and lots of humour, while attempting to be serious.
I didn't have high expectations for this film because by the trailer it looked rather cheesy, but that doesn't mean that I didn't want to see it. I have to say that I like most of Mark Wahlberg's films, but I don't like him as an actor. He was mostly mono-tone throughout the whole film, even when trying to be saddened or mad. He showed virtualy no personality, no charisma. The rest of the cast was a joy to watch, fitting their characters perfectly. I have to highlight Seth Green and Jason Statham. All of Seth Green's films are just so great because he comes off so slick and smooth in his character. Edward Norton is a great villain and really worked by the response of the audiance at my theatre, I heard one person calling him an asshole after killing someone (won't say who).The car chase scene was worth the wait, nothing really special but pulled off well. Its a change of pace from SUV's or Ferraris. The one thing that might happen is througout the film you will either say ""yeah right, like thats possible"" or you will be enjoying the film and not care. I enjoyed this film with a few exceptions, I would of liked to see a lead with more personality but it didn't hinder the film. There is actually a pretty good back plot (won't tell what), and great side characters. I will say one thing, ""skinny Pete"", you will know what I mean when you see it.

226,nadeeshantennage,Serves the audiences with enough excitement.,7,5 April 2018,"The Italian Job is unlike any other heist movie that you may have seen.
To be quite honest I found myself getting invested in its storytelling which is something highly unlikely for a film of this genre.
The first half of the film carries the momentum in the plot quite excitingly enough and a fast pace.
The second half however takes sometime to catch up to the momentum leading up to the events in the climax. But, hang in there beacause this is one of those heist films that try to be logical considering all of its actional consequences which ultimately helps it to deliver an exciting tale boosted with a strain of comedy in it.
Do not miss this one of a kind of a heist movie..
Personally in my opinion this is much better than Ocean's eleven.",The Italian Job

As far as this being a remake, with the exception of the Minis, the main characters name, and gold bars, its barely a remake.  I mean, how many movies involve some sort of gold heist?  How many were full of exaggerated characters? With elaborate escape plans that need to be changed at the last minute?  This one uses the same old cliches as many others do, but, this was well done and very enjoyable. This used the cliches better than most.  We want fun and we wanna get wasted on the movie experience.

While many people seem to have a problem with this movie, I think it's an above-average, entertaining popcorn-flick. The acting is good throughout. And the story twists and turns enough to keep you involved, while keeping up the pace. And special praise has to go to Edward Norton for putting in such a quality performance, considering the well-publicized quarrels he had with the studio. You would never know he did this movie against his will.IMDb rating: 7/10",The Italian Job

Team work is not something which i didn't see before, this isn't the first film which insists on the robbery business, and won't be the last one. The cast tough famous wasn't so good, actually it was medium to overstate. Still what makes it a good action title?this time is in the details, this is the most important plus. Not the acting, not the end, not the far fetched story, but the details.It was lively I admit, which made it pleasant to watch, but it's not all about the rhythm. There are other things which should be take in considerings, like: characters. The character typology was standard: the beautiful, dangerous woman, the impulsive leader, the computer genius, not to mention the handsome skilled driver. It wasn't something new, and surely wasn't fortunate.The simple alignment of a title, to action genre doesn't or shouldn't undervalue important aspects such as originality and authenticity, which are clearly neglected here.Not bad but still lacking originality and authenticity.

Maybe some of the negative reviews are from people stuck in that frame of mind but luckily i've grown beyond it enough to appreciate this film for what it is: 100% pure entertainment. The acting is solid all around which is not the case for a lot of films; the pace is blistering hot and never lags; there are some innovative scenes that will blow your mind just trying to figure out- How'd they do that!!??; the characters are well drawn while avoiding sentimentality; and all the ingredients are whipped into a fine recipe for a tasty movie dish!",The Italian Job

Picturesque, lovely, and we see the water in the canals, houses all seem to have boat houses underneath their homes. How convenient! A team of thieves committing the ultimate heist planned down to the minutest detail. I was totally in awe at how precise the caper was. Everything went like clock work. Everything seemed so perfect. This was a great film! It held my attention and I watched it actually twice. It kind of reminded me of Oceans Eleven because every detail, no matter how small was covered. And each person was hand picked because of their expertise. I just love those kinds of movies. It is so interesting how they plan it all out and get in and get out without anyone being the wiser. It had a fantastic plot.Wonderful cast! Mark Walberg was great as the Master Mind. Donald Sutherland was the old Pro. What a twist on the plot. If you like suspense and car chases you will love this. Action packed story line not just the same old thing. Mystery, and suspense, and some really intense moments make this a great film for your library. I loved the movie.

The characters were believable and charming. Gray mixed exotic locations (venice, Italian Alps, LA) with great humor, Seth Green's character was hilarious as the comic relief. I was entertained the entire time through and enjoyed watching the Mini Cooper Car Chases and the climatic cat and mouse ending.I have never seen the original with Michael Caine and after seeing Gray's rendition, I certainly can't wait to see the first one.",The Italian Job
234,ChrisMIN43211,Good (bad) guys to root for,8,2 June 2003,"In recent years, it has been commonplace for movies to have many twists and turns, and/or the big shocker at the end.  The Italian Job, from director F. Gary Gray, proves that neither are necessary. A gold heist turns sour after Edward Norton, who plays Steve, has his own plans for the gold, and makes sure of that once the team reaches the Italy-Austria border.  A year later, the leader of the team, Charlie (Mark Walhberg) recruits Stella (Charlize Theron) to join the remainder of his team to steal back the gold.The Italian Job, free from fancy visual effects, feature actors who are perfectly suited for their roles. Jason Statham as Handsome Rob, Mos Def as the demolitions guy who ""had a bad experience"" with dogs, and Seth Green, who claims the idea for Napster was stolen from him.Simply put, The Italian Job is fun to watch from beginning to end, the boat chase in Venice, Italy to the Mini-Coopers in L.A., the sneaky but simple-minded bad guy played by Norton. It is far from perfect, but it deserves to be a box-office success.",The Italian Job

Some of the action needs suspension of disbelief, but it didn't take away from the fact that this is a fun, and funny action film.  Ignore the naysayers, and I agree with the pros.  Two thumbs up.

It just got to the point that I was trying really hard to like this one, given the awesome ensemble cast and what I thought we be a solid plot line.Alas, this one was as predictable as could be. The only things that were more disturbing than the plot line were the SHAMELESS commercial tie-ins. I mean really. It's fine to tie-in products; I'm not against the concept. But the Italian Job really lacked the subtlety required, as the ads just took away from any of this movie's respectability.When this film ended I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. And do you know what could get rid of that bad taste? You guessed it! A cool, refreshing Pepsi Blue.

CGI is pretty good, but it can ruin a film like this. I can see CGI where most people don't in a real film like this.I like this film for a heist that is for the gold, and not just to regain the gold. but for the payback. That makes a story like this more appealing. More people really do like a story like that than some simple heist film.

241,LennyRenquist,Italian whatnow?,7,18 August 2003,"Okay. This is a remake. And I usually try to judge remakes on their own merits. I usually end up failing, often because the remake HAS no merits (eg. Get Carter, Planet o' the Apes). This movie, however, DOES have quite a bit going for it, it's just that the original Italian Job happens to be one of my all-time favourite movies. So I found it pretty difficult not to think of it while watching this.In theory, this movie should have been crap. First of all, it's set in America. I'm not going into buy into the argument between the English and American film types...English: You're butchering a classic, a film which defined 60's Britain, blahdy blahdy blah!American: Yeah, but you're just jealous 'cos we're better 'an you....for the simple reason that I don't belong to either nationality, and am therefore unqualified. Not that I have any allegiance either way. Honest.Come on, people! There are plenty of other frivolous reasons to fight wars. You don't need to start one over a Mark Wahlberg movie.My problem with it being set in America is that the movie is called ""The Italian Job"", and not ""The American Job"". Yes, I know the job at the start of the movie is pulled in Venice, in BOATS (""Boats?"" I hear you ask? ""In Venice?""), but that's not really the focus, is it? I suppose, at least, they HAVE chosen to set the main job in a city (LA) where not much effort is needed to create gridlock. But planning to leave themselves a thoroughfare in the chaos kind of defeats the purpose of using Minis, which were used in the original due to their ability to fit through tight spaces in shopping malls, drive through narrow drains and turn on the proverbial ""dime"". Bloody yanks. Sorry. Oh, yes, now I get it! They needed to clear a path because the new Minis are FRICKIN' GIGANTIC, and wouldn't FIT through the narrow spaces in Turin. So they moved it to LA, where everything's BIGGER! Even the DRAINS! IT ALL MAKES SENSE!! Kind of!! Um, maybe!!I seem to remember saying something about merits. Um...oh yeah. The fact that this story isn't a duplicate of the original kind of makes it work like a sequel, if you forget the 30-year gap and the whole England-America thing, and think of Michael Caine and Benny Hill whizzing through Venice in a boat (well, I DID say ""kind of"").The script is also pretty funny, and the team have good chemistry. Marky does fine as the straight-man, and his funky bunch of cronies work well as a team. Jason Statham (who would have made an excellent Charlie in a more faithful remake or sequel) is great as the driver and ladies' man, Handsome Rob. Seth Green is funny as Lyle, the computer hacker geek (an obvious update of Benny Hill's Professor Peach). Mos Def, one of the better rapper-turned-actors around, does a good job as Left Ear, the demolitions guy. Edward Norton is okay, but below his usual standard, as the slimy Steve. The big surprise for me, though, was Charlize Theron. I've seen her in quite a few movies, but never thought much of her. I found her kind of wooden, dull, and not even very attractive. But I thought she was great in this. Funny, cool, and very sexy. Maybe it was because she was the only one who got to drive a ""real"" Mini, her red Cooper S making a meal out of rush hour traffic. That scene, while entertaining, actually detracts from the rest of the movie, because it just heightens the absurdity of them opting for the NEW ""brick"" to pull their job. It's just product placement, I guess.And where was Alan Cumming as Camp Freddie? Talk about a missed opportunity!Anyway, It's a serviceable enough crime caper movie, but with logical holes big enough to drive three armoured cars through. It's no Ocean's Eleven, and it's not a patch on the original Italian Job. But it's good fun.",The Italian Job

It's full of action and enough silliness to keep it entertaining.What does suck though is the title. This movie should have never, ever been called the Italian Job. It's practically sacrilege to the original, to give it this moniker and to give the lead character the name of Charlie Croker.Anyone for 'The life of Brian 2' starring Jim Carrey and set in downtown New Yoik? Thought not...The only other gripe, and it's a personal, picky crime, (that not only this movie is guilty of), is when will movie makers get the sound right on motorbikes? IT'S A TWIN CYLINDER DUCATI FFS! I don't expect the exact replica sound to come ringing through my TV, but for crying out loud, a twin engined bike should sound like a twin, not a bloody R1.

Well basically because it takes the recipe for a classic heist movie and updates to suit a new millennium.You have all the stereotypes in there, the nerd that break into every computer in the world, the explosives expert, the babe, the brains and of course the 'crook that can't be trusted' which in itself is a paradox.You have a big loot, state of the art alarm systems, computers, guards, guard dogs, the police, Russians - and not least 3 tuned Mini Coopers.All in all you have all the ingredients for a classic heist-movie.The good thing about the movie is that it doesn't spend too much time 'assembling the squad' - that is taken care of before we enter the movie, so most of the focus is on the actual heists.The acting is decent, but not overwhelming and the plot does offer some twist and turns, which makes it an enjoyable ride from start to finish.It isn't better than the original - but then again it doesn't try to be either as it changes the premises by changing the plot - and it isn't better than Ocean's 11 either, where I think the acting is better.It is still recommendable, and I have given it a 7 (out of 10 naturally - I follow the standard IMDb scale).",The Italian Job

But as a stand alone movie, the script has humour and the cast gel together well, the Minis used don't really add anything but the action is exciting and entertaining - I really like it and it's worth a watch, just don't go comparing it to the 60's original and you'll come away satisfied.",The Italian Job

Product placement gone wrong, so very wrong.The direction seemed off, too. Edward Norton is the bad guy, and it was so obvious right from the start.

And I left with that fondness still intact.The Italian Job 2003 isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. The main problem has to come down to the plot or lack of it. Its too simple. There's never a moment in the film where something happens you don't expect, it's as if the writers just joined the dots to come up with their story.Starting off in Venice, where a motley crew of characters in Charlie Croker, Left Ear (He's deaf in one ear) Lyle (Who swears he invented Napster) Handsome Rob, who's well handsome and John Bridger, an aging mastermind who's determined to pull of ""one last job"".After an exciting and rather original Venice waterfront chase its into the Alps, except there's trouble in store. If you've seen the trailer you'll know what happens next.Back to L.A. and its up to Charlie (Wahlberg) to recruit Bridger's Daughter Stella who crumbles like a biscuit and succumbs to the revenge plot of Charlie and his crew. See, the plots simplistic. It tries to flesh out the story by introducing Russian gangsters and a huge Asian bloke, but really everything builds to the climatic job and subsequent escape.Sure, it's cool and stylish but its really a disappointment. Apart from a cool moment where a chopper and a Mini tangle, it's textbook stuff, much like the rest of the film really.  Despite all these flaws its still fun. Seth Green and Jason Statham play their parts for laughs and there's plenty of little jokes (The actor learning his lines in a L.A. traffic jam then stealing Statham's accent once he yells at him) and cool moments (At one point it looks like they'll take the Mini's into the house, maybe for the sequel.Apart from the plot though, the biggest problem has to do with the script. It unravels incredibly simply and everything that could happen does happen. It's also hampered by uneasy switch from comedy to drama, one minute we have short, entertaining vignettes introducing the characters lives then the next we see Theron, all crying and vengeful. It's an uncomfortable mix and Theron plays her role way too seriously.If you like heist movies, see this. If you like car chases, see this. If you like Mini's, definately see this (I want one!) but don't expect to come out of the cinema and know anything new or feel like you've watched something extraordinary.

But everyone else comes off as some sort of overblown caricature (even of their ethnicity - Mos Def, and Franky G come to mind as bumbling or over-macho colorful characters, and the white people are always ""IN CHARGE"" here).  My favoritecharacter was Jason Statham as Handsome Rob - he pulls off the character with class and wonderful acting.  Seth Green and Mos Def were more intriguing than the main character, Mark Wahlberg as ""Charlie"".  WAAAAY to much product placement in this film - you can't help but notice it.  The Red, White, and Blue minis driving around as some sort of ??? American statement really reminded me more of the French flag.  And if that is some sort of stupid patriotic statement, then why do the main characters engage in acts of crime so huge that I'd consider it terrorism (shutting down a government computer system).  The best things about this film were the big golfing guy, Skinny Pete, and the Ukrainians.  Edward Norton doesn't deserve this... he did pretty good (you've seen Edward in so many good performances at this point that he always SEEMS good), but was he under some contractual obligation? He seems unhappy making this film even as he's acting.

Edward Norton proved that he can play a character the way it's written and still put his own individual stamp on it. While the characters are interesting, the story and the special effects moments it presents are what drives his film.  While I'm sure there is some computer manipulation going on, this film does not make its FX as blatant The Matrix. For me there are only a couple of problems.  I couldn't figure out why, Handsome Rob didn't make a hit on Stella (His character would have) , why the characters didn't all freeze to death in the mountain lake (except the movie would have been over in twenty minutes) and I never can figure out why Mark Whalberg keeps getting starring roles.",The Italian Job

I really like the section of movie up to part where Steve betrays his comrades (maybe even to the point where Charlie presents his crew to Stella),it was really promising,it was dead serious,and thats how I like my thrillers and action movies,there was no too much silliness about it,which was great. Movie kept my attention,plot was constant,there were no points in movie where I was asking myself why these scenes exist.. First robbery was interesting,quite original. I was kind of sad that it was Norton who played the bad guy,I was hoping he'd stay in the crew as one of good guys because I wanted to see more of him,but ironically,I did see more of him because he was the villain. Liked the dialog between Steve and Charlie when they meet for first time after sell out.And now,for bad stuff. The movie didn't keep its seriousness.. The scene where Mark talks to Stella on how his crew member got their nicks I understood what is the top reach of this movie. Some scenes were accompanied with music that also gave them a cheesy tone,one of them when Stella is trying out the mini,there were more.. Also,one blunder plot-wise.. Robbing your fathers murderer for revenge,seriously ? Thats kind of weak.. Whatever happened to characters like Neil from Heat,who chooses to kill the snitch instead of going to airport with his sweetheart and starting new life in New Zealand.. Did we lose edge compare to 90s ? I think so. Oh yeah,almost forgot,the Napster anecdote gets old after a third time.. Also,the ending is also cheesy.. Botom line is,if you want to make a good action movie,don't try to be too funny and silly about it,if people are looking the movie for laughs,they'll watch comedy instead,be serious,thats what most of new movies are missing.Anyway,movie deserves 7.5,it was interesting,it was a bit better than average but not for 8 thats for sure,entertaining,actors did their thing,none of them failed,even the Mark Wahlberg who I cant stand was quite bearable,its a cool flick,but nothing thats gonna mark a cinema history.",The Italian Job

263,Andu007,A good heist film with a respectable nod to the original.,7,18 April 2020,"Loved the original and a bit tired of all these remakes. Is the film industry lacking creativity, talent and ideas, that they now have to do this?
I watched this not long after it came out and it passed the time and I found it a lot better than I'd thought it would be.
After watching it again recently, it is a good heist film in its own right. It's not a complete remake of the original, though the minis speeding through the streets, gold bars, traffic chaos is a respectable nod to it.
Plenty of action, stunts and twists and a great all star line up, who carry their characters off well.
The film starts in Italy but it's mainly in the US which makes the title a bit non existent.

266,lights-5,A car chase in L.A. How Original.,5,2 June 2003,"This is a pretty good movie.  Well-plotted and directed, good infusion of humor, yet it falls flat.  First, the one sheet gives you no clue what kind of movie it is, with the cast all standing around. Unless you remembered the original 1969 film, you were clueless.  Second, I have rarely seen such an interchangeable cast in any film.  Other than Seth Green, any of the men could have been playing any of the male roles.But my huge objection to this film was the car chase in L.A.  There's not a foot of interesting tarmac or any surface that we have not seen cars racing over in a hundred films or on the nightly news.  This movie is about a car chase.  The original did it on wonderful European locations.  So did the Bourne Identity.  Not a single surprise in L.A. Of course the Minis went over the Sepulveda Dam.  Of course they drove on sidewalks. Of course they drove the flood control channels and the LA River.  But even the thoroughly ordinary Metrorail tunnels couldn't make this chase scene interesting.  Made me want to shoot the neighbors for having that party.  How much better it would have been if the chase had been in the mansion (which is why they chose the Minis in the first place).",The Italian Job

This movie offered no philosophy, no morality, no deep message (and unbelievably, no chemistry whatsoever between Stella and Charlie) but . . . I did have a flat out 104 minutes of fun.  Pretty clever indeed.  A clone of Ocean's Eleven in too many ways to mention.  There were some middle school teen boys in the crowded theater who apparently never saw a caper movie.  At first they annoyed me, but it ended up being almost as much fun watching them enjoy themselves as watching the movie.  I give it 9 out of 10.  (P.S. My eyes might have deceived me, but I'm almost sure I saw Spider Man in the crowd dashing to get out of the way of those Minis.)",The Italian Job
268,FT13TomDinardiJV,Very entertaining,7,5 June 2003,"*SPOILER ALERT!! PLEASE DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT THE MOVIE SPOILED!!*I was originally planning on seeing this movie this past weekend, but my plans ended up making me unable to have time to see it. So me & my friend made plans to see it after school today. Boy, are we glad we did. The movie starts off in Italy, with a planned heist with a group of guys (Charlie Croker [Mark Whalberg], Steve Frezelli [Edward Norton], Lyle, also known as ""Napster"" [Seth Green, you'll get the nickname later], Handsome Rob [Jason Statham], Left Ear [Mos Deaf], & John Bridger [Donald Sutherland]) plan a heist to steal 32 gold bricks. This leads to the whole opening, which is a good 10 to 15 minutes, and involves a boat chase, which opens the movie up right. While driving away in their get away van, Steve Frezelli turns on the group, steals the gold, and kills John Bridger, who is pretty much the (retiring) leader of the group. Fast foward to a year later, where where Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), John's daughter, is one of the top safe-crackers that anyone can ask for. Charlie Croker (who was actually indirectly responsible for her father's death, as he called him out of retirement for the heist) says that they've found Steve (who has gone into hiding), and want to get back at him for what he did. She at first declines, but later agrees, and the teamgets back together, along with getting the help of Wrench (Franky G), a mechanic, to carry out the perfect heist, while creating one of the largest traffic jams in Los Angeles history. This movie is a perfect mix of action with funny bits thrown in throughout. There's an on-running joke about Seth Green's character, Lyle, creating Napster and how Shawn Fanning (who makes a cameo) stole it while he fell asleep, and eventually Lyle will only answer if refered to as ""Napster"". There's even a funny line in the movie by Seth, who goes ""He said in an interview he called it Napster because it described his hair, like it was nappy. He callled it that because *I* was napping when he stole it!"" The begining and ending sequences are pure genius, and everything in between fits perfectly. The only negative thing I can think of with the movie is that Edward Norton's acting was a bit weak. He wasn't a big, tough bad guy. He acted like he was being paid and just doing the bare-minimum (which is a fact, as he was forced to do this movie due to contractual obligation). But, even with that problem being the only real gripe with the film, the movie is still very enjoyable, and I definetly recommend seeing it. And even if you're not interested in the actual movie, go to see Seth Green shine in the comedic role. He's perfect. Rating: **** out of *****",The Italian Job
269,david_topping,Spoiled my day,7,21 November 2005,"I really dislike re-makes, I can't think of many which are any good and any which are better than the originals, so I have to admit I avoided seeing this at the cinema and rented it out with at least a partial expectation of being able to write a cutting review. I thought it would be a doubly cutting review because I could minutely (and dis-favourably) compare it to the ""original"" which I think is an excellent film.Here's the problem: I thoroughly enjoyed the film.Within minutes I realised that the film is not a ""re-make"" but a different take on a basic idea of a clever robbery using cars to make a getaway.I've even got to the stage where I think I understand why it's called the Italian Job. To make the same film with a different name would lead to cries of plagiarism for the use of the basic getaway idea. Using the same name freely acknowledges the origin of the idea but lets the story be told differently.So OK, enough with the theorising; Why is it a good film? Well, like the original it's fast paced, clever and witty, there are good lines for all the characters. The characters have motivation which makes their actions logical and enough emotion that you care what happens to them and want them to succeed. I think I'd have to be honest and say that I felt the relationships between the characters were more enjoyable than the original, but this is simply a reflection of the fact that Michael Caine was such a huge star that he dominated the original. Mark Wahlberg may not be the greatest actor but for the purposes of this film he works well, allowing the rest of the cast to create the idea that it is a team effort, and it's a good team, Charlize Theron is smart and good looking, Mos Def and Seth Green generate some good laughs and Jason Statham is  well he's an actor that can make a success out of ""Transporter"", yes he really does have that much presence.As for the robberies? In my mind they are every bit as clever as that of the original. I found myself on the edge of my seat during both, not only that but you get two robberies not one!So I'm disappointed to have to say that I enjoyed this, it may not be a ""great"" movie but it's good entertainment, it's totally different to the original (which I do feel is a better, but different film), it's out on DVD and well worth the rental and it's made me eat my words.Bah Humbug.",The Italian Job
270,tunnelboy,Slightly entertaining....,4,7 July 2004,"Since this movie got a relatively good rating, I guess that these types of movies are just not for me. Although I love a good heist movie, I found this one way too Hollywood-ized. The dialogue was not at all believable to me. The stunts and effects were very unrealistic too. Some of them reminded me of the movie ""The Quick and the Dead"" where when someone got shot, you could see daylight through the bullet hole in the body.But what really turned me off completely were the Spiderman ""Easter Egg's"" which were clearly visible in a couple of crowd scenes. I wanted to eject the DVD at that point, but my girlfriend wanted to see how it ended. My rating: 4.0",The Italian Job

The original, with Michael Caine was a nice caper film with a fairly simple plot and good characters. This remake is no different, expect a lightweight action-adventure film that is well worth the price of admission. The clever plot addresses all the motivations and angles for the characters, and has just enough plot twists to keep you interested without bogging you down in the minutiae. The heist and chase scenes are first rate and made the crowd buzz with excitement. Of course, the Mini-Cooper is the star! While Mark Wahlberg and Edward Norton give good performances as good guy vs. bad guy, the two leads seemed very one-dimensional. The supporting cast is top notch and very frequently steals the scene with funny, clever one-liners that drew big laughs. Charlize Theron, Seth Green, Mos Def, and Jason Statham all put in believable performances.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it to all of my friends as good, clean fun!",The Italian Job

Caine's 'Job had humor, a decent plot, top-notch actors and 3 terrific cars. The remake just has the cars (and, of course, the lovely Theron).The original movie's ending was memorable - this movie's ending was tacky. The original was a classic crime caper, had a strong sense of national pride (red, white and blue and Union Jacks everywhere, a crime lord who puts Queen and country above all else), beautiful Italian vistas, lovable characters and, of course, the wonderful Michael Caine.

You generally know what to expect, so the success of the film is measured by how much fun it is. The Italian Job certainly delivers on that account.The gang's all there: the old guy on his last job, his heir apparent, the slightly shifty guy, the nerdy computer guy (Seth Green is excellent!), the muscle guy and the oddjob guy. And away we go - it's good fun watching the original heist, and then we come to the fairly predictable twist (which I won't give away here). After that, the rest of the gang obviously try to get the loot back from the traitor, with their plotting - and therefore the film - occasionally more than slightly reminiscent of Ocean's Eleven.OK, the film might be played by the numbers a bit; Mark Wahlberg will forever remain Marky Mark for me, and not a leading man; the car chases are overlong if good (how much did Mini pay them?) - but the script is fast-paced, happily devoid of soppy love-scenes and basically, any film (except maybe Trapped) that is willing to devote a lot of screen time to the ever delectable Charlize Theron gets two thumbs up from me on general grounds.

It is almost self-aware that it is a remake, but doesn't worry because it knows it has a killer cast with some strongly conceived action scenes and decent dialogue to drive along the witty plot.Edward Norton adds a lot to the entertainment with an oddly mixed muted yet over the top performance, while Mark Whalberg and the rest of the men in the gang fill out the movie nicely. In alot of action movies, these ""gangs"" don't work, but each actor in ""Italian Job"" performs their purpose well. Charlize Theron stands out as the daughter of Donald Sutherland, in an excellent casting choice.Director F.

285,StuHolmwood,Proof That Trailers Are The Devil,6,29 May 2003,"Contains Spoiler Speaking from the perspective of being young enough to have not seen to original, this movie serves as an example of the fallen nature of movie previews. The important and fun parts of action films like ""The Italian Job"" are the plots twists; however, when all the twists are known to all the audience before the film starts, then the film must depend on other elements.This is a film whose story can be summed up simply as: the crew gets the gold, Norton kills Sutherland, the crew recruits Sutherland's daughter, and then the crew finally get even. While this would normally serve as ample material for a film of this genre, it is unsatisfying because of the extensive trailer. We know that Norton kills Sutherland. We know that the crew finds Norton. We know that the daughter gets involved. We even know that in a mass traffic jam, an explosive is used to bring an armoured truck to the underground.A caper film does not, thankfully for ""The Italian Job"", necessarily have to depend exclusively on action and plot twist. It can depend on things like original and comic characterization, as in ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"", but there is no Steve Martin or Michael Caine in this film. This film is a triumph of the flat character.Alternatively, a caper film can be a success when it contains many many more twists than its trailer reveals, as with ""Heist"", starring Gene Hackman.
Furthermore, a film of this kind can be a good movie if, through traditional means, it proffers an important theme unto its audience. The theme of ""The Italian Job"" is that good guys win and bad guys lose. Ambition should be made of sterner stuff than this.This is a film with no surprises. All is known from beginning to end. No one character is explored to the point of serious interest. While I was hoping that the trailer was a red herring, and there would be a surprise somewhere, I was bitterly disappointed. It failed to say or do anything important, which was per se the only real surprise, given Ed Norton's record as a villainous philosopher in films such as ""Rounders"", ""American History X"", and ""The 25th Hour"".",The Italian Job

I think Brad Pitt would have been better in the Charlie Croker role that Mark Wahlberg had.

287,Dotacion,"Ouch. Bad, Really Really Really Bad",1,4 February 2004,"Crafted with all of the style and grace of a 70's TV movie, this smelly turd of bowl flotsam might be an interesting movie in about 100 years, as the movie that first featured the new (current) Mini. I urge you to wait.Besides time capsule value, there is nothing else to recommend it.
Perhaps the producers thought Donald Sutherland and Ed Norton would give their movie gravitas; boy were they wrong. I hope they got paid well, cos this is something they are sure to leave off the C.V.Perhaps the producers were tasked with making the car the star, but in heavily edited scenes which defy credulity, it does more to make a joke out of a vehicle that since this was released has quickly lost much of its luster- and I put it to you that this movie is responsible.
Marky Mark breathes really convincingly, but doesn't have more than one sentence of dialogue in any scene, leaving one to wonder if his lines were cut back- cos he's barely in the movie. Conspicuous by his presence, he _appears_ in most of the scenes, but you start to notice he adds nothing, and lets the others around him carry the weight. Since he is male lead, top-billed, it is odd when you, as a viewer, notice he simply does not pull his weight and decides to sleep walk through his ordeal and get that paycheck. One cannot help but wonder 'what is the deal?' Based on his 'work' here, I can't see much of a future for him as an actor in movies.
Nobody plays a weasel like Norton plays a weasel, and he is at his weaselly best here. Marky Mark's anonymity is such that you want Ed to be the victor and smash him to pieces. It would have been a lot more enjoyable- and interesting- had they seen to that. I'd pay $1 to see that.So to sum it up, see something else, don't waste your hard earned $4 to rent this, you'll regret it, and wind up breaking either the teevee or the dvd, or angering your mate.

Well directed, great camera work, good special effects - but the writing is what I believe set it apart and took it to the next level.  The inevitable comparisons to Soderberg's ""Oceans 11"" are unfair to Italian Job in my opinion.  I felt this film was much better written, the acting was better and overall execution a cut above what Oceans 11 accomplished.  When watching the latter, I felt like it was more escapist entertainment, whereas Italian Job did a much better job of drawing me in to the story -and- entertaining me.The criticisms that Wahlberg didn't have enough 'charisma' to pull off the leading male role in this film are unfounded.  If they came from the same people who gushed over Clooney in Oceans 11, then they obviously value Clooney's 'pretty boy charm' over Wahlberg's more substantive acting talent.If you haven't seen this one, you should.

292,Ibsen3,A sickening travesty of a classic film,1,20 January 2008,"I must admit, I was against this movie from the outset but I tried my hardest to be impartial, I really did, but the very idea of remaking a sophisticated, witty, entertaining, quirky British classic full of character has to be dubious from the outset.People in my house were watching this so I swallowed my pride and told myself to be professional about films (I have studied them at Uni after all).As expected for an American film of this sort, the movie began with a chase which wasn't bad. Indeed, many of the action sequences are credible and this alone lifts the mark.Yet the characterisation was abysmal, the set-pieces could very easily have been spliced from any American schlock blockbuster you might have had the misfortune to watch and it lacked all character.Seeming to take a skewed angle on the original film with a failed initial robbery, the US version does the predictable thing and introduces an emotional factor with the death of Donald Sutherland's character. This allows our US cousins plenty of opportunity for sycophantic, dewy-eyed vengeance-seeking against the 'evil-doers' which it milks to predictable excesses. This is never more so evident as in the scenes featuring Charlize Theron (oh pretty! oh so pretty! Look at her pretty, wounded Bambi eyes, everyone!) which were thoroughly nauseating. Her entrance scene, particularly, was like something out of Resident Evil or Tomb Raider which were both a) more entertaining and b) had better beginnings because they couldn't mess up a game like they could with British cinema which was already chock-full of spark, people you genuinely feel something for and moments of inspiration. But I digress, the whole inclusion of a pretty girl for the sake of it just seems like the most ham-fisted manoeuvre I've seen in some time and exposes cynical Hollywood blockbuster-lust for what it is.If you like any of these actors, by the way, and you agree with any of the above comments, DO NOT GO TO SEE THIS FILM! If I had the opportunity of watching 'Fight Club' or 'American History X' after seeing Ed Norton in this, I would have declined. Likewise Jason Statham with 'Lock Stock' (and I suppose 'The Transporter' is okay if you like that sort of thing).Sadly, all the set-pieces are designed in the most transparent possible way to get you thinking, 'Wow! He's smart!', 'Coo! He's cool!', 'Hey! What a tough guy!'. Then there's the 'funny PC guy' who has 'comic relief' splattered across his forehead but whose humour content can be anticipated two minutes in advance. To be honest, if you've seen one or two films like it, you might easily confuse the two as clones from the Jerry Bruckheimer stable. Not that Jerry is irredeemably awful, by the way, but he just uses the clichés to excess as everyone knows (or should).This is where I have to come clean. I didn't manage to make it to the end, so I couldn't even say whether the brilliant ending in the Michael Caine version made it but, I'm sorry, it's just one of those extremely rare films that, if I'd seen it at a cinema, I would have walked out and staged a small protest outside. It's not just that it is another identical by-the-numbers Ocean's 14 or something (Ocean's Eleven was fine but don't bother with the rest!) with all the glitz, glamour, fake sass and pantomime heroics of such a film but I couldn't recognise anything from the original at all.So, if you are expecting 'THE Italian JOB' and not 'OCEAN'S 14' albeit badly written with a less established cast and characters, some disingenuous elements and cardboard cut-out script-writing then DO NOT WATCH! I don't mind people liking a bit of mindless fun but this is a criminal hatchet-job that does not deserve in any way to parade itself under the title of a classic. Seriously, show some pride! I felt thoroughly justified in my outraged and sickened reaction when I first heard that the film would be made. Avoid at all costs!P.S. Some of the action sequences aren't bad at all so add an extra '1' to the mark if you like this sort of thing.",The Italian Job

296,easy_eight,"Awful, improbable waste of time, deserves a 0",1,30 December 2011,"I believe that there is some ballot stuffing at work here. This movie does not deserve a 6.9 rating. I think most people who saw this movie thought it was crap. There should be better policing of the responses because there is manipulation at work probably from movie distribution companies to improve the rating.In the movie, in the early scene the team of crooks are double-crossed by the wimpy villain who attempts to murder the rest of the crew after the original heist for reasons that are not shown.In real life, they would have tracked him down, tortured him, took the gold and that would be it. I had to turn it off (saw it on cable) when the villain starts to manhandle Theriz Theron in the restaurant and the others show up to protect her. They just walked away. They should have waited for him outside the restaurant, beat the crap out of him, and wimp that he is, gotten the gold from him, then made him disappear.The whole plot is absurd from start to finish. The whole good guy robbers thing just does not work. Probably the reason why the movie is so bad is that it lacks any kind of passion.Some other reviewer made the point that if these guys were so cool and so ""good"" why would they disrupt traffic in the middle of the day in a busy city and not stop to think that many innocent people would be killed.Also, Hollywood thinks that anything is possible technologically. One smart guy can hack into the traffic system of a major city and control it for ten minutes. Ridiculous. So much of the slop that comes out of the movie industry just does not make sense.Also, the way the car expert walks up the cable woman who is drop dead grogeous and is a look-alike the Theron is ridiculous. What are the chances of driving up to the cable parking lot and finding the right person. Why even waste time on that part. It seemed so silly and trivial. And what could he have said to her anyway? This scene was totally unnecessary and obviously was just a filler because they had to stretch out the movie.And the acting is atrocious. Theron is like a manikin. Walberg is not convincing as a crook and seems like he is playing the role in his sleep. The rest of the crew is even worse.It is not even worth watching on cable.",The Italian Job

This version shifted its action to L.A., and its theme from action/comedy to action/drama.  Unfortunately, it delivers very little of either.  The acting is listless and the story, lacklustre.I'm a fan of Jason Statham, but he's not enough to save this movie.  Seth Green plays a computer whiz who claims he invented napster (another annoying and pointless schtick). And somehow he's got enough remote hardware power to wirelessly hack into the L.A. traffic system from a baggage claim cart to throw the whole city into logjam.The mini-cooper car chase scenes are hardly reminiscent of the car chase scene from the original movie, which still remains a classic.
The relationships between the characters are poorly developed for a pseudo-drama, which they try to toss in between Donald Sutherland, as Mark Wahlberg's mentor and father figure; and his romantic interest, Charlize Theron.  The worst part had to be the abrupt end to the movie, which culminated with Charlize and Mark living happily ever after without every developing a history in front of the viewing audience.  Another major disappointment is Edward Norton's character as a greedy, ruthless villain, who apparently is not smart enough to avoid transporting his gold putting it at the greatest risk possible for looters like Mark's crew.",The Italian Job

Heist movies are to be about stealing something in a very elaborate and cool way, not about very deep emotional problems. So this film here mixes cool, state-of-the-art technological stealing and a revenge story. And Edward Norton's villain is much too mean, he destroys the ironic heist story. It is the same problem with the James Bond movies: it is pretty tasteless to see Bond tortured. Bond is supposed to be a comic strip hero, not really serious.

Whereas the original is very tongue-in-cheek, this was too serious and the little humour in it was weak. What is it with screenwriters today? They think they can fill a script with weak one-liners and we'll all be so happy? Mark Walberg is a terrible actor. He ruined Planet of the Apes too (another poor remake). There was no chemistry between Theron and Walberg at all and them getting together at the end was clumsy and contrived. Donald Sutherland had the right idea by dying early on.

323,Kleiny,SPOILER ALERT for a piece of DRECK!!!,1,11 September 2005,"This soulless piece of drivel ranks amongst the worst of American excesses. Apart from a very clever opening this film has none of the lightness of touch, ingenuity or charm of the original. In this way the film is a paragon of Hollywood film-making in the 21st century  all beginning, no middle, no end.Compare this to the less than clever opening of the original, which is ostensibly some guy driving around Turin till he hits the bulldozer planted in a tunnel by a waiting mafia. We the audience have no idea who the man is, or the significance of the whole scene. This flies in the face of what we are now told is good screen writing  firstly, the man in the car is NOT the main character, and secondly we haven't actually established what's going on. We only find out who he is about half an hour into the filmand yet it works, and wow, the whole of the film is really great.Which begs the question 'is it salient to compare this to the original?' Salience notwithstanding this is a remake, or rather one of those films that both seeks to define itself from the original and separate itself from the original. The original was a caper film, and consequently had the requisite hallmarks of that genre. Things such as wit, clever writing, clever characters, and so on.This remake is a revenge film - Mark Wahlberg seeks to exact revenge upon Edward Norton because he killed Michael Caine  an act so symbolic it's meaning becomes ironic to the extreme. It says we're killing the original, make way Michael Caine, your day has ended. Unfortunately for the makers of this insipid piece of garbage they spake too soon, because even with the passage of time Collinson's film remains impressive in its wit, style and execution.I once had a discussion with a film guru about 'From Here To Eternity' in which I asked why if great films aren't about dialogue they're about 'showing', that FHTE remains one of the truly great films of all time. His conclusion, which I think is correct, was that nobody these days has the ability to write films like From Here to Eternity. It's obvious that no-one can make films like the original 'The Italian Job' either.I took the trouble of hiring out the original, just to see if I had been romancing the past. I hadn't.

332,candclovefactory,thoughts on the Italian Job,8,26 May 2003,"hey just watched the Italian Job on Friday.  It was  actually pretty good,B+.  Yes there are minicars not vw bugs, and they are so cool.  And yes part of it does take place in Italy. The rest does take place in the US, but to explain how they will get the gold back,Charlie(Mark Walberg) says they will do it like the Italian Job,that way Movie audiences know whats coming to some degree.The Job that they pull is in venice which meant lots of water to work with it was a pretty cool idea.Of coarse I've read a lot of the other postings and all I have to say is I've only seen a few of Mark Walbergs movies, but those have nothing to do with this movie which is a very ensemble piece, so ignore him if you don't like him.  Definitely never saw the original(don't like Michael Caine or Benny Hill),but doubt I would have enjoyed it from what has been described, Think of it as a new film, just some same charecter names. And finally if you haven't seen it don't knock it, once you've seen it than you can make all of the opinions you want. I may even watch the original just to see, with an open mind of coarse.",The Italian Job
333,cmsully,Italian Job requires daylight hours,7,6 June 2003,"The Italian Job requires daylight hours and no experience is required. This is a great matinee and a good afternoon at the movies. The plot is good, but the actual playing out of the plot is very simple and requires no thought process. It's car chases, explosions and all for the simple purpose of defeating ""the bad guy"" played by Edward Norton.  For Norton, it seems he is content to portray the exact same characters as in his previous films such as ""The Score"".  Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron deserve better scripts. Warning: If you've seen the trailer, then you have seen the movie. If you're looking for entertainment at inexpensive prices then you need The Italian Job.",The Italian Job

Lazy filmmaking!!!,1,7 September 2003,"This movie is so bad, I can't imagine anyone enjoying it beyond the opening sequence.The story and direction are so pathetic, and don't get me started on Mark Wahlberg's ""acting"". The kid was perfectly cast a a dumb innocent in ""boogie Nights"" and somehow people got the impression that he was acting.

I thought the whole idea about Napster was so corny. The characters barely say more than two sentences at a time. It might just be me, but I like movies that throw some curves at you; this one doesn't, except at the very beginning, which you then know there is going to be some retaliation and you can figure out how it from there how it is going to happen. This movie reminded me more of Fast and Furious, just more on an international scale. I thought XXX was better. I did not find the characters to be believable in their roles.",The Italian Job
337,leslietwalters,Italian Job 2003 - too much garlic and no base,2,29 July 2006,"I have read the other comments on on this page regarding this film and most, if not all, praise it. Yet, throughout the entirety of these(inane) 'reviews' no one compares it to or even mentions the fact that it is a remake of the vastly superior 1969 Michael Caine vehicle. I have to admit I had low expectations of this new film, and they were not disappointed, it was actually even worse than I anticipated. All performer presence, witty dialogue, and the action of one of the best car chases on celluloid (perhaps the best) has been removed to be substituted with blinding teeth, slicked back hair and constant, unimaginative, intrusive cutting. Even if the director wished to have a car chase to match the earlier set piece (he does not) he could not accomplish it because the demands of the ludicrously short takes in mainstream modern American cinema (to suit short attention spans) mean the stunt drivers cannot drive more than a few metres before 'CUT' must be called. The performers of the first film have, as with so many modern examples, been replaced by young, vacuous, uncharismatic and ineffectual model types. On the strength of the first film I went against my better judgement and gave part of my life to this trash: its enough to make me now hate the first film too.",The Italian Job

In fact I've never yet seen any better movie than this one. It was recommended to me by people who saw it earlier than me in a country where it was released earlier than here, so once I could go to a night preview, I took a look, I didn't even wait for the official premiere date. So this recommendation had not misled me in any way as I enjoyed watching it.The gold worth 35000000 Italian euros ended up in quite a mess, as one of the robbers robbed all his crime partners in the Dolomites quite soon after they had taken the gold away from Venice. A year later those who got nothing due to this second crime in chain found out where the gold was and even if the person who had it all lied that it had all gone, there was gold worth 27000000 euros left, so in the end everything is OK. Why I say this (which is a kind of a spoiler) is that I admire the way Mark Wahlberg a.k.a. Charlie Croker takes back from Steve what belongs to the others, and the way that all is well that ends well. I'm eagerly expecting the 2nd episode to come.",The Italian Job

Oops we did it again!!!!!,1,5 May 2006,"after spoiling the expectations of James Bond fans by imposing their very mediocre cabriolet, and even worse, their horribly looking limousine in ""Tomorrow never dies"" (Even former top BMW executives Pitschenrieder and Reitzle were horrified upon its first official presentation, no joke!, there is an official quote in the ""Spiegel"" about that, and last but not least, their ridiculously expensive roadster in ""The world is not enough"", who nevertheless never demonstrated any of the fell of a classic sports car. Well, for pushing their new Minis, ridiculously expensive and sadly, lacking the charms of the original, they obviously decided that for the millions they paid for being an unrecognized Extra in a James Bond movie, they might as well fund an entire film. It looks as if the script had been written in Munich and so does the movie look like. The actors are OK, unfortunately i have never seen the original, but i dare say that next to an actor of Michael Caine's caliber the entire cast would look rather lost. A completely unnecessary remake, i.e. just another boring commercial disguised as a movie and the fools are willing to pay for it....",The Italian Job

342,cdepetro,Below average,4,1 June 2003,"I haven't yet read all the other comments for this movie, but I find it hard to believe that people could see it as a fantastic movie.  This is one of the silliest films I have seen in quite some time.SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ONThis movie starts off fine, the opening sequence is interesting and action packed.  From there, however, it drifts into a silly Mission Impossible wannabe sort of atmosphere, with way too much fast paced techno music and way too little plot.  After the opening sequence, it is as though the next 30 minutes were completely unnecessary, as all those plans were thrown out the window and a new plan developed?  This seems a bit silly to me.  The final sequence is then very similar to the opening one in that they use nearly the same methods...not very creative.Wahlberg is very average, if not below average.  Theron is surprisingly decent.  Seth Green is very good, as is the rest of the supporting cast. Norton is good but not great in a limited role.  Searching for positives, this is a fun and fast paced thrill ride, if those sort of things make your say.  The story, however, is contrived and silly, and too much of the obvious ends up taking place with Wahlberg and Theron.I give it 4/10",The Italian Job

Paramount for example has been kind enough to shrink down their latest caper movie, ""The Italian Job"" in to a nice 45 second trailer. If one is fortunate enough to catch this on TV (which shouldn't be a problem), they should take the time to write Paramount and thank them for keeping $7-$10 in their wallet. This movie was THAT 45 SECOND TRAILER STRETCHED OUT OVER 90 MINUTES. I am sorry, but they put everything that would have been enjoyable about this movie in the trailer. From Seth Green's one liners to the (anti)climactic car chase, the movie seemed to drag if only because I was used to seeing it resolved in under a minute instead of two hours.

345,vweisman,Fab-u-lous!!!,10,27 May 2012,"This movie is on my ""Bucket List"" of best movies ever. When my kids are old enough to handle it, this movie will be required viewing. Every time it pops up on the movie guide, I can't resist watching it. I should share the fact that I enjoy movies that provide entertainment. Do I notice some goofs and factual errors, absolutely! Do I care? No! Here are the facts about this movie from my perspective.Rock solid character development and story line. Story is simplistic, characters have fairly 2 dimensional development and it all requires some suspension of disbelief. If you don't like this, watch a *&%$#@& documentary.This plot offers classic characters from Greek tragedies and Shakespeare. The thief with a heart, the thief with a heart who is going straight after this last job, the heart breaker thief, the geek thief, the brilliant thief with a chip, the scum thief who betrays everything and everyone. Then, as added spice you have the straight laced daughter who goes rogue to avenge her father. Lastly, this is the story that illustrates the edict of ""Honor among thieves."" All these thieves band together to pursue the thief who has violated this sacrosanct honor.I LOVE the relationships in this movie. That is what makes me watch the film time and time again. All these characters are so attractive and conflicted. I love how they interact with each other. Naturally, they complement each other, but the beauty of this screenplay is how they enrich each other in the one-on-one interactions. There is good natured teasing between Charlie, Rob, Left Ear, and Lyle. Gradually, Stella is allowed into this ""boys club"", but with respect for her skills and contribution not because she is just a pretty face.Honestly, this is the movie that makes me want to embark on a life of crime. If I could find partners like Charlie, Stella, Rob, Left Ear and Lyle, I would be willing to consider high stakes theft! Please, people, this is movie making at its summit. If you love deliberate suspension of disbelief, watch this movie. Just enjoy the artistry of the story/character development and the craftsmanship of the actors and directors.",The Italian Job

I missed bits and pieces of the movie all the way through It is a story about Edward Norton and a crew stealing some gold, and Norton deciding he wants it all to himself. Then the people he betrayed want to get back at him. It is a well put together, intellegent, funny, and action packed film that I need to see again... the whole way through. One of my top movies of the Summer so far.A big help to the entertainment factor is Seth Green. I dont know anyone who doesnt like Seth Green, and he adds to the flavor. He plays a guy who says he created Napster, and his roomate stole it from him. He is a computer genious who is a wonder to watch.It was said that Norton didn't want to do this film.. but If I were him, I would have wanted to sign on.The only problem is that it is very predictable. Any movie go-er should be able to say in their own mind what is happening, before it happens.My biggest complaint with the film, is Eddie Nortons choice of facial hair.

After George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Andy Garcia thrilled with a casino heist in Ocean's Eleven, Donald Sutherland, Charlize Theron, Mark Wahlberg, Jason Statham, Seth Green and Mos Def steal back hundreds of bars of gold from a double-crosser in The Italian Job.Like Ocean's Eleven, The Italian Job involves extremely ambitious plans to steal. The movie starts off with an Italian job of stealing gold bars. Unfortunately one man within the team double-crosses them and makes away with the gold. John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) is killed. The team enlists the help of his daughter, Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), an expert safe cracker, to help them steal back the gold.The movie builds up tempo pretty well, although much of the main plot happens in the later part of the movie. The action sequences were well executed, and how they got the van into the subway was an eye-opener. The getaway seemed to easy, and the two security guards on the motorcycles were very quickly gotten rid off. Unlike Ocean's Eleven, which sprung a surprise getaway method, the rest of The Italian Job's getaway was predictable and was almost on the verge of being boring.I would say I enjoyed Ocean's Eleven more than The Italian Job.

351,fengleefang,Quite entertaining,6,10 March 2004,"Hollywood loves making movies about con artists and thieves. It's a tradition, and it sure has its own place in all the movie categories. This one seems a very typical thief movie, although I have to admit I did enjoy it. The plot is well laid out and executed, though mostly predictable. Two scenes are worth mentioning, one is the ""original"" Italian job at the opening, the way they got the gold out of the safe under water right beneath the ""job"" spot; another one is the mini coupe chasing scene. The performance of all characters (including Charlize Theron who just won Ocsar for her role in ""Monster"") are just flat, which does not bother me at all. Keep in mind that both producers and viewers are looking for FUN here, not gripping performance.

My college was presenting a free preview screening of The Italian Job, and I STILL left feeling ripped off.  The film is utterly absurd.  The dialogue is among the most atrocious that I've ever seen.  ""You can do it"" serves as inspiration.  A single moment together is supposed to make the ""subplot"" of a love story believable.  Even the car chases, which I'm told are what made the original stand out, are completely cookie-cutter and uninteresting.  I haven't fallen asleep in a movie since I was a little kid, but it took several pokes from a friend to stop it from happening this time.  Overall, the plot was ludicrous on all counts, there was absolutely no character development, and even the action scenes were mediocre at best.

I kept getting this feeling that I wasn't seeing anything new, however.  It's a remake, sure, but it wasn't just that.  Like many heist films of late, the thieves are so smart, that they seem to have little trouble pulling off these ever so complex schemes.  I thought the car chase that I saw in the trailer was going to be spectacular, but it was only so-so.  Why can't movies make car chases like 'The Seven-Ups' anymore, or 'Bullitt?'
As for the performances, Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, and Charlize Theron dutifully performed their roles, while the supporting cast stole the movie from them.  Seth Green always brings a little extra flair to the characters he plays.  Check out his scene-stealing role in 'Can't Buy Me Love.'  Mos Def really impresses me every time I see him.  He has a cool presence that will undoubtedly bring him into leading roles in the near future.
I can't really see any huge flaws with this film.  The plot flows.  It kept my attention.  So if you like heist movies, then this one will satisfy. But if you want to be blown away, this ain't the film for you.  My grade - C",The Italian Job

371,ARCact,Enjoyable heist flick--escapist fun,8,30 May 2003,"While I cannot compare the new Italian Job to the Caine original, I found the new version to be an enjoyable heist flick.  It's no Ocean's 11, but it's still entertaining.  Wahlberg is good, although I've liked him better in other films (Three Kings), Theron is wonderful, Norton is as sleazy as he should be and Wahlberg's crew, complete with their funny quirks, are an entertaining group. It won't win any Oscars, but it's a great popcorn movie for the summer.  An interesting and amusing ride with a happy ending, it's a good movie for a hot summer night.",The Italian Job

Humorous in spots without trying to be brilliant and hysterical. Interesting enough characters without trying to do an in-depth character study (without time enough to do it).Beautiful actors who are a pleasure to watch.  Good chase & action without destroying much or wiping out large populations. Amazingly devoid of the gratuitous sex, violence & profanity, giving it a well-deserved and appreciated PG-13 rating. One of my favorite film types, with no major criticisms.",The Italian Job

Movies such as Gone in Sixty Seconds, and The Day of the Jackal, get remade and the results are less than stellar.  So, when I heard that ""the Italian Job"" was getting remade, I expected it to be bad.Well, I had the opportunity to calm down, read some reviews, and finally see the movie, and was proven wrong.  Granted, it's not original, and predictable, but it's sure fun.  From beginning to end, you are taken on one very fun ride.  The scenes with the Minis are great, and the characters actually enjoy themselves.So, even if there are some flaws, who cares as long as it's fun?Overall, 8 out of 10.

The film itself is pretty cool, good acting cool lines delivered by a cool cast, but like most people going to see this movie, I was there to see one thing only, the mini chase. The original film really built up to the getaway at the end of the movie and had one of the best climaxes to any film, but if you're going to be holding your breath for an updated version you will be most dissapointed. The mini chase to honest was rubbish, over way too quickly with no where near as much fun and excitment as the original, and the ending of the film.............well it just ends, with no suspense or anything coming close to the originals cliffhanger, it just turns out all nice and Hollywood.My advice is, if you haven't seen the original, watch it, if you have, watch it again.",The Italian Job

Apparently the screen writers only saw the original once and then I guess it was a bit too sophisticated for them. The characters are cardboard and provide none of the charisma of the original. The only similarity is the use of mini cars (left hand drive) but even this is a tentative link and not really enough to allow this film to have the same title. Now if they had given it a different title then maybe I could have accepted it as a standard Hollywood action movie or the sort of film to watch when hungover.,The Italian Job
385,mcgurkepi,shocking,1,4 January 2004,"Terrible, terrible movie, the only good thing that came out of me going to see this film was that i got to sit next to a sexy young lady. it wasn't even a good bad film, it was so insanely rubbish that i found myself laughing out loud more than a few times.inanely predictable, insipid acting, and less than compelling viewing, quite frankly, i only stayed cos i paid £4 to see this and i figured anyone that stupid deserves some sort of punishment.what this film does is what most dull and souless sequels do, makes money, gives people a few hours of entertainment, hits a few chart positions. great. what it doesnt give you is that feeling you get long after watching a truly great movie, the feeling that you have really experienced something, its not a movie you will remember for years afterwards, it's simply a film to take you from late evening to a little bit later evening without any danger of actually achieving anything. you wont find yourself quoting lines from it, 30 years on..thats for sure.all in all, i'd say if you don't particularly care what you go out to see tonight, go and see this, its got action, somewhat of a storyline, and a bit of good old fashioned geekery from carrot boy himself, no, not Jasp. the perfect film to while away a few hours, doing something which doesnt get you too involved and leaves you feeling the same as when you went in, only with the ability to appreciate going home more than you used to.yeah, go home and get drunk. thats better, go on, you know you want to. it's ok, you can just tell people where you've been for the last two hours..its ok, they'll forgive you in time. it's been 3 months, i'm allowed to sleep in the dog kennel now..",The Italian Job

387,helen20,Great Mark Wahlberg Flick!,7,21 March 2012,"The Italian Job is a fast action, crime/revenge film, which is not a remake of the original as some believe. There has been much discussion about this, but all one has to do is see the cast from the original to know that that film was more of a comedy.""Job"" puts the attention on the heists themselves, the planning, and the cat and mouse anticipatory skills one needs when committing such acts. The acting is satisfactory from a group of top flight actors: Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Donald Sutherland, etc. , but no more than that. The material is beneath Norton, and he's really not on screen enough to warrant an actor of his caliber. Theron seems an odd fit in the film, but has one of the best scenes with Norton in a restaurant. There are several terrific action scenes involving boat and car chases and great location filming. An interesting trivia note: there's a glimpse of the recently renovated Roosevelt Hotel, the site of the very first academy awards ceremony. It was brand new at that time. The script doesn't allow for a lot of character development, and this is the type of film where the characters exist to serve the plot. The film is still enjoyable and better than average for its type. 7/10 stars.",The Italian Job
388,kyle-medina,Fantastic!,8,30 March 2012,"The Italian Job was very entertaining to me, and I think that's what counts! Some people on here criticize every movie they see! Ed Norton played an excellent villain who said in the movie, right or wrong, I don't care, it's about what I want. His character had no morals which explained why he was able to turn on his follow thieves. The director left no stone unturned. Every word and action was accounted for and in my opinion, that's a huge contributor to what makes a good flick. While nothing new was introduced, the movie had some of the best car chases I've seen in a while. The plot was good and the actors were excellent. I thought The Italian job was well cast and the story was well acted and well told.The action was endless and I had such satisfaction because the ending was soooo... sweet. It's okay to just sit back and be entertained by a movie. You don't have to pick it apart for casting, intellect and it's special effects.

389,daviduk2,Brilliant Film!!,10,1 January 2005,"I must admit, when i first went to see this i hadn't seen any trailers and thought it was going to be a bad under-funded film. I had not seen the Original Italian Job before i had seen this, although i have now as i was that impressed with this new version of the film. Firstly, many people say that the film is going to be rubbish as in is set in America where the title of the film suggests that the film takes place in Italy. The film explains this as the story goes on, and it does it well too! Right, now onto the film itself. The story line in my opinion is one of the best out of all films in 2003. The character choices are very good, with Mark Wahlberg playing Charlie Crokers part excellently, and i especially liked Seth Greens part as a computer 'genius', being into computers myself, i particularly liked his role in the movie. THey have kept some of the original things in the new movie from the 1969 version, including starting the movie with a heist in Venice and the inclusion of the new Mini Cooper S's, as the original minis were used in the 1969 version. Overall this is my favourite movie in recent years, and i wouldn't normally give a vote of 10 for any movie, but this film certainly deserves it.",The Italian Job
390,welshie,This isn't the Italian Job you're looking for,3,18 June 2003,"Yes, it's got Mini Coopers. Yes, it's got a character called Charlie Croker, Yes, it's got someone called Mr Bridger, Yes, it's got gold stolen from an armoured car. Yes, it's got bits of the film shot in Italy.Sadly, that's where the similarities with The Italian Job (1969) end, and this becomes an entirely different film not deserving of the title ""The Italian Job"". They should have, and could have, given this film it's own title, because it's an entirely different plot. For the rest of my comments, I shall refer to this film as IJ2003, and the original as The Italian Job.There's a cameo role from a single Rover Mini Cooper, but the real action is BMW Mini Coopers; IJ2003 has far more violence and unnecessary killings, maybe this is a sign of the times. In 1969 very few criminals used 'shooters'.In my opinion, if you have seen The Italian Job, and feel like watching IJ2003, because you liked the original film, don't bother. If you haven't seen The Italian Job, go and see the original first, admire it, then go and watch IJ2003, a totally different film without any preconceptions as to what it should be like. You might like some of the sequences. You'll probably come out of it realising that Paramount only made this film because they messed up on the American marketing on the original.",The Italian Job
391,brownpr0,One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time :(,1,25 May 2003,"I was really looking forward to this movie.  I like slick heist movies (Ocean's 11, Good Thief, etc) and i think this is a great cast.  But be warned -- there's a reason that Ed Norton didn't want to do this movie and it is very obvious about 2 minutes in.First off, the dialog is terrible.  very few ""funny"" interactions are actually interesting (Seth Green imitating Jason Statham is a notable exception).  The director (who has done nothing noteworthy since Friday) clearly didn't care if there was any chemistry on screen or if the words coming out of the actor's mouths actually fit their characters.  He just wanted all the words in there.  At one point, a Ukrainian does a whole routine about how the CIA rigged the 2000 election -- why even keep that in there?most of the characters have cute nicknames, which just makes the whole script seem even more forced.  in the first 20 minutes, you are hit over the head repeatedly about the relationship between Marky Mark and Donald Sutherland so that you know he'll be dead before the second act. obviously there is a romantic relationship that suddenly blossom's between Sutherland's daughter (Theron) and Marky Mark.  Like you couldn't see that coming before you even walked into the theater.Speaking of which, Theron clearly filled in for Angelina Jolie, playing exactly the same role that Jolie played in Gone in 60 seconds.  there are several points in the movie where she is vulnerable (maybe trying to show more range than Jolie?), and in each of those scenes, when Wahlberg comforts her or says ""you can do it"", i thought i was going to puke.worst offender of all is Norton who sleepwalks thru one of the least complex characters he has ever played.there are all sorts of continuity problems with the movie and several characters are introduced and then grossly underused (there's a 400 lb somoan looking dude who may have been an interesting character if we saw him for more than 2 minutes).every plot twist is predictable 30 minutes ahead of time, every ""funny part"" is given away in the trailers (except some of seth green's screen time), and everyone is dragged down by the poor script and direction.

392,walalashiboom,An incredible heist,8,23 April 2006,"The Italian Job was as greatly thought out as Charlie's detailed plans in the movie. I may not be a Roger Ebert, but I am hoping that my review is respectable in saying that it well-fit the description of a must-see movie. The Italian Job goes along the lines of action and comedy, yet a touch of romance for those type of viewers as well. I was actually amazed that such a male dominated movie did not contain any sex-oriented scenes. Without that being the point, the audience is introduced to a number of interesting and entertaining characters who have nothing in common other than a good heart, great motivation, and immense knowledge in each of his or her trade. As the movie succeeds in putting its viewers mentally in the heist with Charlie and the gang, each chase and heart-racing moment is an adrenaline rush. The Italian Job is a movie for those that admire masterminds filled with imagination and have a love for adventure. Thus allowing those who want to create diversions and act on such genius plans to be taken on that intense ride through the movie and feel accomplished. It is just that type of a movie.",The Italian Job

But the music combined with the element of a clean heist with no guns pulled by Charlie Croker's crew, with one exception for Steve, is a rare element that is nearly impossible to find anywhere else. If you want to see some decent action, stealing gold, a few laughs, and excellent acting on the behalf of the entire cast, then the Italian Job is a movie that will a movie that you'll be happy to watch when you feel like it again and again and again.

I saw The Italian Job for the first time some years ago and visiting a rental shop I couldn't quite remember why I had a bad feeling about it. Now I do.After voting for the ratings for this film I saw the statistics. Apparently this film appeals most to under 18 girls. No wonder. They didn't pay enough to Charlize to flash and I guess some girls magazine has rated Mark Wahlbergs abs ""AWESOME"".Other than that this film is completely predictable, the actors are mainly forever B-stars and even the good ones are being misused horribly, the film is filled with obvious product placement and imagine this: it even manages to repeat itself without doing a sequel! The first 15 minutes are the best part of the film and it's all downhill from there and once they figured this out they decided to use the finest hour again in the end repeating-to-detail their gold heist. All in all, lots of noise about nothing.I think Charlize Theron is good and Ed Norton could be more as he's been before.

It's definitely a summer movie worth checking out.  The plot is your basic heist flick.  Guy has gold.  Team wants to get gold.  I won't give anything away, but you can probably guess what the motive is from the trailers.  The plot is simple but that's okay because the movie goes along at a fast pace with some humor sprinkled in here and there.  One scene to note is when handsome Rob picks up the cable girl to which Seth Green does some really good comedy.  I'd liken the movie to Ocean's 11.  I think it ranks just below, but it definitely stands on its own as a decent heist flick.  Overall it's one to check out.

I think that this period of time is enough (2003 - 2009) to bring something nice. And I am thinking what kind of car will they drive, maybe Smart For Four, because it seems a little like Mini.

The new film can't leave Europe quick enough and replaces the minis with German BMWs, thus negating the two founding points of the film. This is an average heist flick at best and calling two characters the same as ones from the original doesn't make it a remake, nor does using a car called a mini make it a mini. In short this should be flushed into room 101 along with the remakes of get carter, taxi, the assassin and ring. - - - save your time and just watch the original.

It was a fun movie worth seeing again and I will. I would have liked to see Donald Sutherland last a bit longer in the story but we all go the way of the dinosaur one day.  He died well.

The 2003 remake is a POOR cousin to the 1969 original. Watch the original and see the difference between class and copy. The original has ooddles (thats right 'ooddles') more to offer than this 2003 hollywoodisation. The original holds up excellently in terms of production values, cinematography and dramatic integrity plus a superb sprinkling of humour.... in the words of my country rent the original and ""do yourself a favour"" !!!!!! Michael Caine is the original lead and he trumps the mumbling hunk of meat that Mark Wahlberg is presenting in the this re-make.",The Italian Job

I really hope Norton did not do this. He is a fine actor and all but he scared people away from a decent movie.I found it entertaining.

However, the info they didn't provide us was that in the film's making, they failed miserably in providing the audience with any original plot, concept, or character. I understand that this is a remake... but if one is going to attempt a remake, shouldn't it be based on a tale worth telling???  This tale has been retold in hundreds of theft/caper flicks already. Nothing new to see here. No one you end up really caring about or finding compelling, quirky, interesting in the least.  The chase scenes weren't even cool enough to justify marketing them in the trailers. So they souped up a coupla Minis... great. I personally am more entertained by the Mazda commercials...

A true ensemble piece, everyone shines in this movie. Mark Wahlberg reprises his ""stoic leader"" role from The Big Hit, and does fabulous things for your average white dress shirt.  Seth Green looks like he had a great time making this movie, and has some of the best lines. Jason Statham makes me more of a fan every time I see him, and it was nice to see him play a more humorous character than those he's done in the past. And I'd never seen Mos Def before, but he was hysterical.  Charlize Theron didn't have a whole lot to work with - her character seemed to be the least fleshed out - but I still enjoyed her performance.  She's one of the few ""It"" actresses out there these days that I can stomach.The action sequences were great, and the Mini Cooper chase made me want to take a trip to the local BMW dealer (which I'm sure was half the point). Those little things certainly took a beating in this film.All in all, good summer fun.  When you've had your fill of Charlie's Angels' camp, and don't want to put the brain power into something dramatic and serious, go see The Italian Job.  It's fun!",The Italian Job

418,glow_gel33,"Very plausible action sequences, excellent flow, I loved it!",10,8 January 2004,"Most of the movie was very realistic.  The only part I thought was a little far fetched was at the beginning when the thieves were loading the gold into their submersible craft.  For one, I'd think the weight of the gold would be too heavy for the craft to support.   But also they never showed how they actually escaped underwater.  The movie cut from the scene when they were loading the gold bars, to all of a sudden they are celebrating on top of the snowy mountain.  I'd think it would be hard to drive and steer the craft underwater, afterall, in murky water, even with goggles, it's hard to see 2 feet ahead, so they could have easily crashed into say, a cement pillar of a bridge.Oh, one other thing, near the end of the movie, it was foolish for the backstabbing thief in the helicopter not to think of just lifting the cover off of the hole that Wahlberg order his car remodeler to cover up with the side of a truck, and then lowering down on say, ropes, and then they would be instantly at the location of their armored car full of gold!",The Italian Job

""The Italian Job"" has a group of thieves seeking to take revenge on a former partner-in-crime who double-crossed them. In a way, the whole movie is a giant car chase, but it's clever enough so that it never gets ridiculous or idiotic.Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Mos Def, Jason Statham, Seth Green, and Donald Sutherland all do a great job. I know that these stunts are all really dangerous, but I still wish to assert that it would be neat to experience this movie, especially the whole scene in the metro.

Charlize Theron and Mark Wahlberg have a great chemistry. Seth Green's character adds the comedy edge to the film, it's a great addition. Edward Norton makes a good villain, however I have seen him in better films than this one or maybe just better roles. It may be a remade film but I do believe its a well-made remake. I haven't seen the original which was made infamous by Michael Caine but I think that Mark Wahlberg has done a great job to try and fill the enormous shoes left by Caine. All-in-all a great film.",The Italian Job
423,talldarkridiculous,Don't suspend your disbelief at how bad this is.,2,22 August 2004,"Wahlberg was sleep walking through this film. When he's confronted with higher caliber actors like Norton and Theron, he looks like he can't wait to hear 'cut' so he can check his account and make sure his salary has been direct deposited. This movie is ridiculous. The crew should have been dead of hypothermia after their ridiculous meeting w/ bottles of Dom in the Austrian Alps. Every seen is less believable than the last. Watch the original and don't waste your time with yet another remake by an industry that is so out of ideas, it has to remake classics and can't even come up with a more original idea of heisting the gold the second time than using the same method as the Venice heist.I give this 2 out of 10 for the efforts of Theron and Norton having to deal with bad material.",The Italian Job

425,manideep-yelisetti,Despite a few fall-backs it's a great film,8,28 May 2015,"Over the last few months, I have seen a lot of reviews for The Italian Job, many of them negative. The gist of almost all of these pessimistic criticisms is that, for all its modernistic bravado and high-budget technology, the film doesn't have much substance where it counts. Look, people, it's just a fun movie. This is the type of picture where you're supposed to sit back, relax, and just enjoy the steady-moving pace of the film. Like Ocean's Eleven (2001), you can concentrate on the characters and the plot at the same time without having to do much thinking (lucky for some of us). Granted, ""Ocean"" is a better movie, but who cares? The plot may have some holes (there's a huge one about 3/4 of the way through), the action may not be as gratifyingly gratuitous as the trailers made it out to be, and some of the dialog may seem pointless and cheesy, but again, who really cares? Cool characters, Mini Coopers, big explosions, Charlize Theron. What more do you want? I think it's time to drop the fake Roger Ebert meets Gene Shalit act and enjoy yourself for once! Oh, and another thing, whatever you do, don't compare it to the original because, to reiterate what F. Gary Gray has told the press a million times, THIS IS NOT A REMAKE!! My advice- if you're interested in nit-picking your way through a good-humored, fun flick, don't even bother seeing The Italian Job. But, if you don't have a severe inferiority complex and/or want to see Ed Norton get jacked by a bunch of Ukranians, go ahead. The Bottom Line, my fellow moviegoers, is: Lighten Up and Have Fun, Dammit.",The Italian Job
426,kens_rose_2013,The Italian Job Review,8,24 September 2013,"""The Italian Job"" is nothing like a real ""job"". This on the edge of your seat movie, makes you wanting the job of Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg). The Italian Job is a great action packed movie which keeps you guessing about what is going to happen next and gives you everything you want in a movie, from comedy and romance, to high intensity action that is joined by superb acting. Charlie Croker, his mentor, John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), and six man team assemble to steal millions of dollars of gold in Italy. Charlie and John plan and execute this mission to a tee. However, after the mission is over their planning can not help them with what happens. The aftermath of losing the money affects all of the men on the mission team in a different ways, and they all go their separate ways. However fate brings them back together for a once in a life time opportunity to get back what is rightly theirs. A new member is added on to the team as a safecracker, Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron). She is not only bringing her expertise but also revenge. The team assembles and new bonds are connected between people especially Charlie and Stella. A past leaves these two with mixed emotions and tension towards each other, but their chemistry is undeniable. They were connected because of Stella's father, who was Charlie's mentor and more of a father figure to him then Stella. This creates the chemistry and tension between the two and leaves them caring for one another more than either one of them could expect.After careful planning by the entire team. It is time to take down Steve (Edward Norton). The mission has its ups and downs and in the process the action keeps you on your toes along with some laughs such as Left Ear's (Mos Def) hearing problem from a childhood mishap.From driving cars through Los Angles's busy streets to making deals with mobsters. Director, F. Gary Gray, uses Los Angles along with Italy to provide a setting that makes space tight and the action ten time more suspenseful because of these places restrictions in ways to escape. This adds suspense to the film because of the populous places they are in.Mark Wahlberg along with Charlize Theron and Edward Norton are captivating in this movie. The casting was phenomenal because of how each character worked with each other in the movie. Norton portrays the enemy so well by making the audience despise him. His careless and less than remorseful attitude toward Wahlberg and Theron, when realizing he has fallen for the man's daughter that he killed, makes you want to get up and punch him as Theron does in a restaurant scene. Theron's no B.S attitude makes the viewers give her respect, especially when she fights through working with the people that ultimately costed her her father. Walhberg on the other hand steals the hearts of the audience by caring for Theron's character and wanting to steal back the money from Norton to, in a way, avenge Theron's fathers death.The action packed movie will leave you cheering for the team of cons and feeling connected to the all-star cast. This movie has everything you would want to see in an action movie, car chases, guns, fist fights, and even some under and above water chases. Even if that is not enough for an audience the clever acting, comedy, and romance that are intertwined will leave any viewers happy, and asking yourself why no other action movie has ever kept you on the edge of your seat like this.",The Italian Job
427,froen3,questions for the director.,9,6 February 2005,"These questions is for the director of the Italian job F Gary Gray.1.what was the reason for pricking the character of Stella with the name tag of Becky?

429,ccc950,non-stop action film,9,23 February 2005,"I enjoyed the movie very much. Everything in The Italian Job is simple. An explosive guy, a safe-cracker, a computer genius, a wheel-man and a man with a spectacular plan of stealing 35 million without using a gun. This film is entertaining although it has no central idea. It is a non-stop movie with lots of actions. All the stunt work is gorgeous. From the speedboat chase in Venice at the beginning to the chase on the busy roads in Los Angeles involving three mini coopers and even a helicopter. The best boast chase I have ever seen. I like the mini coopers. The expert thieves used mini coopers for the getaway cars. The chase between the mini coopers and the motor-bikes is amazing. They chased underground. I can say there was not a moment I was bored. Mark Wahlberg (Charlie Croker), Charlize Theron (Stella Bridger), Donald Sutherland (John Bridger), Jason Statham (Handsome Rob), Seth Green (Lyle), Mos Def (Left Ear) and Edwin Norton (Steve) really did a good job. I like the actors in this film. I have seen a lot of heist movie but The Italian Job& is one of my favourites. A great Hollywood action movie without a drop of blood.

430,dpierotti2001,Simply Atrocious,3,17 May 2005,"One of the worst directing jobs I've seen in years. Heist movies, even the weak ones, generally convey a sense of fun. Almost as if the performers were enjoying themselves as much as the audience. Here, the actors perform like they're in a hostage video and their first born child is in danger. With a good cast, cool cars and exotic locations you'd think it'd be hard to screw up but every element of this is bad. Anytime people speak it's like watching a high school play. There's no pacing, no humor, no tension, and zero chemistry. This film should be Exhibit A in illustrating exactly what a director does. F. Gary Gray is a completely talentless hack and if you don't believe me go watch 'Be Cool'. It makes one pine for the studio system, when, at least, you were guaranteed a level of professional competence.",The Italian Job

After leaving the rest for dead, Steve leaves to go spend his fortune. One year later, Charlie has still not gotten over the death of John, so he re-assembles the team, with the help of John's daughter, Stella, to go take back the gold from Steve and get revenge. It's an awesome movie, and the final scenes bring to life some of the greatest driving stunts in Hollywood history.

Having recently watched the outstanding original once more, I am reminded of exactly how little charm this movie possesses. Where the original had a captivating personality, this has just another white-washed Hollywood sheen to it. The new minis are quite nice, but have none of the cheeky character of the old ones and with Micheal Cain replaced by the competent, if frankly uninspiring Wahlberg, this movie disappointed me in almost every way possible. Don't even get me started on the happy go-lucky ending either. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not simply worshipping the original because it was there first. I worship the original because it's a classic, and quite rightfully so. Admittedly, this film had a hell of a lot to live up to, but with such a cast and even the original scriptwriter, Troy Kennedy-Martin, the fact that it didn't made me hate it even more.

""The Italian Job"" carries with it the moral values so many of us take for granted. Although much in the film is morally ambiguous, one may find that even when all your life you've lived on the other side of the law, you can still settle down and have a heart-to-heart. When I first saw this movie I was sure it would be another violent crime movie that I would never want to see again. I have since seen it 3 times and have a copy of my own. The thrilling sequences and brilliant camera-work have you glued to the screen. The exceptional cast of characters has you wondering ""who could be so lucky to work with them?"".

439,Stolarz,The Italian Job ~ Stolen Idea? or Steals Box office?,10,28 November 2005,"Warning: This review might contain spoilers. The 2003 version of ""The Italian Job"" is a great example of what a modern day action film contains. It has villains, heroes, gun battles, car chases, great camera work, and of course a beautiful woman. This film stands out on any list of action films and is an excellent movie.This movie really has little in common with its 1969 predecessor, other than the fact that gold is stolen with the help of Mini Coopers. However, this more modern version still manages to upend its earlier version. The advancements in technology make the camera angles more impressive and much more interesting, while the idea of high tech tools make the characters the envy of modern males.Seth Green steals every scene. As the geeky computer hacker Lyle, Green manages to create a true geek image and brings a new level to the parody of the geek. As he helps the thieves hack the computer systems necessary for the job, he constantly flashes back to his college days where he claims to be the real maker of Napster.The casting is perfect. Mark Wahlberg plays the leading role of hero Charlie Croker. Edward Norton, who does a great job making his character disliked, takes on the villain role. Charlize Theron plays the role of beautiful woman, Stella Bridger. Charlize does an excellent job with this role and this is the best she has looked in one of her films.In Conclusion, F. Gary Gray's version of ""The Italian Job"" is superior compared to its predecessor. This movie updates all of the elements from 1969, which are now obsolete. The film is well done and the new twist on a well-known plot is appreciated and creates a new classic.",The Italian Job
