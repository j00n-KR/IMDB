0,MartinHafer,Well worth seeing.,8,15 June 2011,"In 1924, Cook County (Chicago) had two trials of women who killed their lovers. Both Beaulah Annan and Belva Gaertner inexplicably were found innocent--and the media loved it. As a result, in 1927, a silent fictionalized movie called ""Chicago"" debuted. Then, in 1942, Ginger Rogers starred in a remake called ""Roxie Hart"". In the mid-1970s, a musical version of ""Roxie Hart"" debuted on Broadway. And, in 2002, the filmed version of the 70s musical was released. Now that is a long and interesting pedigree! As for the film, it's an interesting melange. The songs are great and the film is very impressive...yet it's so incredibly anachronistic that it made my brain hurt. Now some of this I could understand--it was more like a filmed version of the play than most musicals. But why they chose to have ridiculously modern outfits and backup dancers confused me. Why did Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renée Zellweger and Richard Gere dress and look like they were from the 1920s--yet the rest of the dancers look right off the stage of Broadway circa 2002?! The fishnet stockings, 2002 hairstyles and the like really confused the crap out of me--especially since I am a history teacher.Still, I must point out the singing and songs were great and the story was a huge improvement over the Ginger Rogers film (which was wretched). It was well made and I was particularly impressed by Zeta-Jones (who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for it), Gere and John C. Reilly. They really worked their butts off and impressed me. So, because so much was right about this film I certainly recommend it. It's just too bad they didn't get the details right or even try when it came to all the minor characters and costumes. Oh well, you can't win 'em all.",Chicago
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Witty and naughty, but what a fantastic movie!",9,31 August 2009,"Yes, you may be sceptical of the casting if you saw it, but Chicago is a great movie, honestly it is. There is a sharp and witty script, wonderful performances from Catherine Zeta Jones, Renee Zellwegger and Richard Gere and brilliant song and dance routines. The film is stunningly-photographed, and it is not only that the song and dance numbers were great, but also how cleverly they were incorporated into the story, which was a fantastic idea. The costumes are also fabulous, and I thought Catherine Zeta Jones was hot as Velma. Richard Gere is his usual charming self, and Renee Zellwegger lights up the screen even if her character is rather dim-witted. The film is a little long, but I think this is a witty and naughty movie, that is absolutely fantastic in every meaning of the word, and I don't get the negative criticisms. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",Chicago
2,Leofwine_draca,Criminally bad,2,3 April 2013,"I've been watching a few Hollywood musicals as of late, and enjoying them to one degree or another (MAMMA MIA, SWEENEY TODD and PHANTOM OF THE OPERA being three of the most recent). I decided to catch up on the Oscar-winning CHICAGO to see how it held up against them, and...I discovered that this is a nonsensical, overblown mess of a film. It's filled with actors and actresses I find it very easy to dislike - Catherine Zeta Jones, Richard Gere - and a leading performance from without a doubt the most irritating personality in modern-day cinema, Renee Zellweger, delivering yet another spin on her supposedly 'cutesy' role in BRIDGET JONES' DIARY; is there nothing else she knows how to do?CHICAGO boasts a couple of decent song 'n' dance numbers and the rest is just a dreary mess. The costume designers went out of their way to make this as sleazy a film as possible, with all the singers and dancers dressed like hookers throughout and acres of bare flesh on show; at least somebody like Verhoeven made his sexual odyssey, SHOWGIRLS, without pretension while this strives to be art.It isn't; it's abominable: boring, stupid and utterly without merit, by far the worst musical I've ever had the misfortune of sitting through.",Chicago
3,SnoopyStyle,lots of big jazzy song and dance,7,18 January 2015,"Roxie Hart (Renée Zellweger) has an affair with Fred Casely hoping he has the connection for her to break into show business. Instead he lied to her about his connection and she shoots him dead. Her simple husband Amos (John C. Reilly) figures out her affair and tells the truth. She is held as District Attorney Harrison (Colm Feore) seeks the death penalty. The prison is run by Matron Mama Morton (Queen Latifah). Big star Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is also imprisoned charged with the murders of her husband and her sister. She's defended by supreme lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) but he wants $5k from Roxie to defend her. Amos can only come up with $2k but he pledges to pay the rest.Everybody makes a great effort in this Broadway extravaganza. The music and dance is big, jazzy and full-of-life. Even Richard Gere gets a passing grade in his number. The movie embraces the musical stage. The story gets overwhelmed by the musical numbers that come every ten minutes. Nevertheless, it is simply so much jazz-hands fun.",Chicago
4,Hitchcoc,Anything Goes!,9,30 March 2006,"This is a musical with a hard edge and harder characters. Its songs aren't the romantic love songs, but rather songs of anger and revenge. The plot, such as it is, makes us believe that there is no justice in the world. For this movie, this is true. Just give 'em the old razzle dazzle. It's all about fame and the public and the heroes are made in the press. Fame is about fifteen minutes at the most and then we go on to someone else. All the characters strut their outrageous stuff for us. The production numbers are terrific. Everything is done with a sneer and a wink. And it doesn't matter how many die; they are just fodder for the public. Renee Zelwegger as Roxie Hart is so vapid and yet so driven, she will step on anyone. Catherine Zeta Jones is stunning as the rival. And then there are all those women in prison who describe the offing of their various lovers. Some even die from time to time because they are not in the public eye. I was surprised to see Richard Gere. He does pretty well in his role as attorney tot he stars. He comes off quite well. He has the ability to do anything for a buck, but his loyalties are pretty ethereal. I don't know if this was a best picture but it certainly has a lot of energy and a rather sad message. Too true.",Chicago
5,mark.waltz,"Chicago, Chicago, that Murderin' Town.....",8,22 December 2014,"Singlely responsible for bringing back the big budget movie musical, ""Chicago"" deservedly won a Best Picture Oscar simply for that. Between ""Little Shop of Horrors"" in 1986 and ""Chicago"" 16 years later, only two movie musicals made it to the big screen-a quickly forgotten re-do of ""The Threepenny Opera"" called ""Mack the Knife"" and the underrated ""Evita"" which got more attention for the fact that Madonna didn't get an Oscar nomination than the fact that it was actually a really good film version of a smash hit show. Had ""Evita"" gotten better reviews, it may have signaled other Broadway musicals being made into movies, and ""Chicago"" might have come out earlier. Movie musical fans had to settle for T.V. versions of movie musicals that had already been done, and even those were a mixed bag.In the case of ""Chicago"", it is pretty much done as Roxie Hart's dream life, a fantasy she lives through as various characters come into her dreams performing musical numbers as her drama is played out. She kills her lover while living the life of ""All That Jazz"" which even she gets a verse to. Renee Zellweger gives a magnificent performance as the seemingly innocent looking Roxie (something missing from her stage counterparts), while Catherine Zeta-Jones is rough and tough as Velma Kelly, an experienced songstress who ends up in prison with Roxie as they both commit murders at approximately the same time.There's a lot of ""Jailhouse Rock"" in ""The Cellblock Tango"", and if you've seen ""That's Entertainment III"", you'll recall a similar number, ""The Lockstep"" from an early MGM musical that looks almost exactly the same. Setting Roxie's life in prison up, ""CT"" is one of the great chorus line numbers of all times as various murderesses tell their stories while a troubled Roxie settles into her life in prison. The smiling Matron Mama Morton (a wonderful Queen Latifah) could charm the garters off of these girls as she gets what she wants as long as you're good to mama.Then, there's Billy Flynn which has Richard Gere returning to his musical roots. He's excellent in this part, and certainly was deserving of a Best Actor Oscar Nomination. He's a sophisticated scoundrel who could charm the rattle off of a snake, and in getting the toughest of cases, he also gets the most publicity. Reporter Mary Sunshine is here too, a bit more cynical, as seen through the eyes of the marvelous Christine Baranski, another stage musical veteran who has been a regular presence in the movie versions of these hit Broadway shows ever since ""Chicago"" returned them to the map. John C. Reilly is milquetoast perfection as Amos Hart, tearing up ""Mr. Cellophane"" as if he was Ed Wynn back in his burlesque days. This really is a pastiche of various trends of the 1930's and 40's movie musicals, filled with the jazz of the day and magnificently staged from beginning to end.While there's a new song written for the movie, it is the songs from the original that still stand out, although the Mama Morton/Velma duet of ""Class"" is sadly missing. Fortunately, the DVD includes that outtake. A love letter to the show's original past is included with the presence of Chita Rivera in a cameo, giving her something to tie in with her soon to be produced Broadway musical 101 lesson ""The Dancer's Life"", and a reminded of how many wonderful Broadway performers were overlooked when it came time to do the film. The finale where Roxie and Velma get together (""Nowadays"") becomes delightfully pretentious and over the top, with an element of gaudy glory that is a testament to today's cynical world and an indication of why the show might have not had an extremely long run (only two years compared to the current versions 17 and counting) back during the time of ""A Chorus Line"" and ""Annie"".",Chicago
6,claudio_carvalho,What a Wonderful Movie !,10,25 January 2004,"Roxie Hart (Renée Zellweger) has a very simple life, married with the simple and cuckold mechanic Amos Hart (John C. Reilley), but is a dreamer. She dreams of being successful,  loved by the masses and rich, the same way Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones, in an outstanding performance) seems to be. Roxie is deceived by his lover, who had promised to present her to an owner of an important night-club only for taking sexual advantages from her and kills him. In the prison, she shares the jail with Velma, who killed her husband and her sister, and they become enemies.  She meets Matron 'Mama' Morton (Queen Latifah), an important and influent jail-keeper, and Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), an expensive lawyer who never lost a case and who decided to take care of Roxie's case. Billy tries to change their passionate crimes to a different perspective to the public opinion. Yesterday I watched this movie for the first time. What a wonderful movie! The performance of the cast, highlighting Catherine Zeta-Jones in the first plan and Renée Zellweger next is fantastic. The screenplay, where reality is saw under the vision of Roxie as a musical all the time is marvelous.  The direction is amazingly perfect for a rookie director of films. Congratulations to all cast: the Oscars wined by this film were very deserved. Renée Zellweger has proved in the past that she is an outstanding actress. Richard Gere also has many magnificent movies in his career. But Catherine Zeta-Jones surprised me a lot: I could never expect those skills on her. John C. Reilley is also a great underrated actor, but he has to be careful with his roles: this is the second time, in a short period, that he plays a cuckold (see `The Good Girl'). Honestly, I did not expect such an excellent movie. The scene of the interview of Roxie and Billy is a masterpiece. Only this scene would be enough for me. But this movie offers almost two hours of pleasure.  I only regret that the DVD released in Brazil is in fullscreen, instead of widescreen. The extras are also great. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): `Chicago'",Chicago
7,gavin6942,Highly Entertaining,8,16 September 2015,"Murderesses Velma Kelly (Catherine Z. Jones) and Roxie Hart (Renee Z.) find themselves on death row together and fight for the fame that will keep them from the gallows in 1920s Chicago.I am not particularly big on musicals, but I really enjoyed the way this mixed its songs with its narrative. You can definitely see that Bob Fosse had a hand in it, because it has the influence of ""All That Jazz"" all over it. Various incarnations have been floating around since the 1920s, but this may be the definitive one.How famous are the original killers the musical is based on? Not very. You can find them on Wikipedia and a book is written on them, but do not even bother mentioning their names... no one will know who you are talking about.",Chicago
8,lee_eisenberg,Can't stop the music (or the infotainment).,10,19 December 2005,"Years before it became fashionable for killers to use the media to get off scot free, Roxie Hart did just that. And ""Chicago"" does quite a job portraying it. Hart (Renee Zellweger) is a celebrity wannabe in the Windy City during the 1920s. After murdering her lover, she gets thrown in jail. Hearing of fellow inmate Velma Kelly's (Catherine Zeta-Jones) plan to hire hotshot lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), Roxie sees her big chance.Maybe it wasn't 100% necessary for ""Chicago"" to be a musical, but it certainly had a good plot. Much like what Michael Moore identified in ""Bowling for Columbine"", this movie shows that America seems to be stuck in the ""if it bleeds, it leads"" mentality. As for the songs themselves, ""Cell Block Tango"" was really neat; we come to understand that there are definitely two sides to every story.All in all, this movie is sure to make you respect musicals (I can say that; I usually hate musicals). The three stars all do great jobs, as do John C. Reilly as Roxie's emotionally vacant husband Amos, and Queen Latifah as brassy Matron ""Mama"" Morton. As Billy Flynn notes: ""Nothing attracts people's attention like fresh blood. God save Illinois."" I probably wouldn't have given this Best Picture (I probably would have gone with ""Gangs of New York""), but Catherine Zeta-Jones certainly deserved her Oscar.",Chicago
9,jboothmillard,Chicago,8,11 July 2005,"From Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Rob Marshall (Nine, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Into the Woods), this had been in the pipeline for a film adaptation for years,but the waiting was worth it, based on the successful Broadway musical. Basically housewife Roxie Hart (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Renée Zellweger) dreams of being a vaudeville star, she is arrested and imprisoned for killing her boyfriend Fred Casely (Dominic West), shooting him, because had promised, but lied, to her about giving her a big break at the Onyx Club. Also imprisoned with her at Cook County jail is her idol, chanteuse and tease Velma Kelly (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Catherine Zeta-Jones), who killed her husband and sister after finding them in bed together, but there to help the women prisoners, for a price, is prison matron, ""Mama"" Morton (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Queen Latifah). Advised by Mama, Roxie puts all her trust for being exonerated on Velma's brilliant lawyer Billy Flyn (Golden Globe winning Richard Gere), who has never lost a case, he pulls Roxie's strings and wants to make the press believe that she was defending herself with the gun against Casely, and slowly Roxie does become a national treasure with the exposure. There is a point though when Velma is gaining the spotlight again and making it less likely for the press to pay attention and help her win her case, and her naive simple-minded husband Amos (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated John C. Reilly) did not convince the police when he takes the blame, so Roxie convinces the press that she is pregnant, to Velma's dismay. Roxie is all over the front pages of newspapers and uses her fame to her advantage, Velma is somewhat left in the dirt, and finally the court case goes ahead, and Billy does everything he can to defend Roxie as his client and make the jury and all of this invented story that the death was not intentional, and he wins. Following the case though Billy is quick to move on to his next case, Velma also gets herself out of prison, she finds Roxie making an unsuccessful attempt to audition to become a vaudeville actress, they do still resent each other, but they realise they could become stars again helping each other, and Roxie and Velma earn love from an audience, with a standing ovation, with a spectacular stage performance together. Also starring Christine Baranski as Mary Sunshine, Taye Diggs as Bandleader, Lucy Liu as Kitty Baxter, Colm Feore as DA Martin Harrison, singer Mýa as Mona and Chita Rivera as Nickie. Zellweger I think should have won her Oscar for this film, rather than for Cold Mountain, she does a brilliant performance, both singing and acting, Zeta-Jones deserved her Oscar as the feisty showgirl, also great at singing, and Gere proves himself a worthy actor and singer as well as the deceitful lawyer. The story mixing both a girl wanting to be a musical star with a murder trial is clever, seeing the characters play out key scenes as fantasy stage show performances, the costumes and sets are lavish and splendid looking, and all the songs, including ""All That Jazz"", ""When You're Good to Mama"", ""We Both Reached for the Gun"", ""Roxie"" and ""Razzle Dazzle"" are catchy and spirited, a marvellous musical comedy drama. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Song for ""I Move On"" and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, it won the BAFTA for Best Sound, and it was nominated the Asquith Award for Film Music for Danny Elfman, John Kander and Fred Ebb, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Richard Gere was number 76, and Julia Roberts number 29 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 43 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, Catherine Zeta-Jones was number 10 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 39 on The 100 Worst Britons, ""All That Jazz"" was number 98 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, the film was number 12 on 100 Years of Musicals, and it was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Very good!",Chicago
10,ccthemovieman-1,"Great Visuals, Horrible Message",3,8 December 2005,"THE GOOD - Spectacular visuals are the highlight of this film. It looks tremendous on DVD, one of the best I've ever seen. The music is decent, the dancing is pretty good and the characters are pretty interesting.THE BAD - The film gives a terrible message, story-wise, making crime pay and the perpetrators as sympathetic good people we are supposed to root for and like? Renee Zellweger is way too profane and downright strange-looking (yet she's told throughout the film how pretty she is - yeah, right. Pretty as Lily Munster.) The story is a sleazy one and so are most of the characters. OVERALL - Worth a look, especially if you like colors and great visuals, or you want to check out a musical, but I found myself repulsed by the storyline and I gave the film a second look (but canned it after 30 minutes the second time, too disgusted with the content to go on.) Best movie of the year? Come on! No wonder people scoff at the Academy Awards these days. They are a bad joke, like this movie.",Chicago
11,rmax304823,"Musical, Cynical and Clever.",7,19 May 2011,"This is a long way from the warm-hearted MGM musicals of the 1940s and 50s. They were already finished, subject to pattern exhaustion, by the end of the 1950s. And after a hiatus of ten or so years, musicals were revived as a set of edgier comments on contemporary life -- with ""West Side Story"" and ""Cabaret."" By the time of Bob Fosse's ""All That Jazz,"" they were as energetic as ever but mighty dark in tone.This was taken from the Broadway play and directed by award-winning choreographer Rob Marshall, who learned a lot from Bob Fosse's work. Even the tricky use of hats appears in the last number, though the hats aren't derbies.Marshall shows a lot of skill in handling his performers. Hollywood is compelled to thrust name stars into musical roles even if they have next to no musical training. Of the three principals here, Catherine Zeta-Jones had some dancing and singing roles early in her career but had since become an ordinary actress of some talent. Neither Renee Zellweger nor Richard Gere have had dance training -- and dancing is difficult. (Anybody can sing. You can sing. I can sing. We all can sing.) Rob Marshall masks the paucity of their experience using several techniques. When possible he surrounds them with twirling bodies of more accomplished dancers. He keeps most of the takes short, so that if a step is flubbed it doesn't much matter. And he keeps the steps themselves easy and sometimes brazenly tricky, like Michael Jackson's ""moonwalk."" There may be nothing much to the dances -- no grand jetes or any demanding stuff like that -- but they're flashy and impressive. Fosse was able to choreograph some neat minimalist steps with non professionals like Janet Leigh in ""My Sister Eileen."" Only one of the featured players has had formal dance training, having danced with the Kirov Ballet and worked as a soloist with the American Ballet Theater before becoming a teacher in Canada. She's hardly on screen. I won't even bother to identify her because you can pick her out at once.Not to knock the three or four stars. At the very least, the two ladies are sinuous and sexy and, like Gere, they give it everything they have. I still can't help wishing they'd had one or two polished performers like Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse.For the most part the numbers are staged as if they were being performed on a platform with one or two single bright lights illuminating the performers, similar to the hospital hallucination in ""All That Jazz."" The music is bumpy and rhythmic and evokes Chicago jazz of the 1920s. None of the numbers is likely to enter The Great American Songbook but the lyrics by Fred Ebb, however, are cutting and sometimes very amusing. And some of the dialog sparkles with irony. ""So I got a shotgun and fired two warning shots -- into his head."" The plot doesn't matter too much. Gere is a high-end criminal lawyer who saves Zellweger from the noose by means that are cheerfully illegal and unethical. Zeta-Jones cooperates in getting Zellweger off and they form a successful two-act. Everybody is happy. Everybody who counts, anyway. Nothing is more satisfying that watching Gere belt out his first number, ""All I Care About Is Love."" It's like the gathering of the mobsters and their goons in ""Some Like It Hot"" -- and the organization is called ""Friends of Italian Opera."" The hypocrisy stuns.",Chicago
12,Tweekums,Amoral and sexy and a lot of fun,8,8 May 2015,"In 1920s Chicago Roxie Hart wants to be famous as a performer but it is an entirely different type of fame she achieves when she kills her lover after he reneges on a promise to put her on the stage. She finds herself in jail and the prosecutor wants her hanged so he can make a name for himself. Inside she meets other murderesses including performer Velma Kelly. She tries to become friendly with her but is ignored that is until she hires Velma's lawyer, Billy Flynn, and he concentrates on her case and arranges interviews that make her famous; to such an extent that Velma starts getting ignored. It is a time and place where fame is all that matters; Roxie and Velma want it; Flynn picks clients who draw attention to him and employs any method he can to get his clients off no matter how underhand.While I don't watch many musicals I do like to watch something different occasionally so gave this a go. It was certainly different and not just because it was a musical; the main characters have few redeeming features; Roxie and Velma are both killers who feel no remorse and Flynn is only interested in the next high profile case hardly typical material for a musical. The leads put in fine performances; Renée Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones are great as Roxie and Velma; delightfully capturing their self-centredness and their obvious sexiness. Richard Gere is also a lot of fun as the amoral Flynn. Also notable is Queen Latifah as Matron Mama Morton; who will help the prisoners if they pay her. Being a musical the quality of the various song and dance routines is at least as important as the plot this are fairly catchy, surprisingly sexy and delivered in an impressive way. I wouldn't usually comment on costumes but again they are important; mostly they wear prison clothes but when they sing and dance they appear in very sexy and fairly minimal clothing. Overall I found this surprisingly enjoyable and worth watching even if you don't consider yourself a fan of musicals.",Chicago
13,moonspinner55,A musical made in the editing room...,7,3 July 2005,"Razzle-dazzle package, a musical adaptation of the Broadway show earlier filmed as the straight comedy ""Roxie Hart"" in 1942, has would-be jazz baby in 1920's Chicago arrested for a crime of passion; once inside the clink, she comes face-to-face with idol Velma Kelly, a cabaret star also arrested on similar charges. Fast and flashy revue, though one with a supreme case of Bob Fosse-itis. Director Rob Marshall deserves credit for handling the performers and the complex storyboarding with expertise, yet the film's major asset is the breakneck pacing, which is the result of some very canny, clever editing. Unfortunately, the narrative runs out of steam before the final show-stopping number, skimping on Velma's acquittal and the touching subplot involving Roxie's 'invisible' husband (nicely played by John C. Reilly). Richard Gere is dastardly and charming as Roxie's lawyer, but he's not much of a song-and-dance man (he works hard and is a good sport); Renee Zellweger is perky and sassy as Roxie, but we're never quite sure who she is, as the character changes her shadings with shotgun-speed according to the plot developments; Catherine Zeta-Jones is wonderfully cool as Velma, and won the Supporting Actress Oscar. This Best Picture winner has some funny, if unsubtle, things to say about celebrity, and Marshall's work is aided tremendously by terrific art direction and cinematography, amusing choreography and top-notch supporting performances. *** from ****",Chicago
14,blanche-2,This isn't your mother's movie musical!,10,28 July 2005,"It's amazing, after seeing Chicago, to contemplate how the movie musical has changed over the years. Thinking back to the musicals in my own era - ""West Side Story,"" ""My Fair Lady,"" ""Sound of Music,"" and ""Music Man,"" one is struck by how entire numbers were performed straight through. Then came MTV, and that all changed. Our attention spans today will not tolerate sitting through someone singing an entire number.That being said, Chicago is an exciting movie with wonderful performances by Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zwelleger, Richard Gere, John C. Reilly, and Queen Latifah. And let's not forget the dancers - they're phenomenal. I think my favorite numbers were Zeta-Jones' ""I Can't Do It Alone""; the prison ""He Had It Coming,"" and that great finale. Zwelleger is a true chameleon, so tiny and very much the '30s blonde. I saw this movie at the Ziegfeld in New York, the perfect place to see it.",Chicago
15,michaelRokeefe,Colorful battle of Broadway divas.,5,22 March 2005,"No doubt director Bob Marshall does Bob Fosse proud; but I guess I was expecting more.

Velma's notoriety soon begins to fade when an aspiring stage performer, Roxie Hart(Renee Zellweger), who also shoots her lover and winds up in jail. Under the self-serving guidance of prison supervisor Mama Morton(Queen Latifah)and silver-tongued lawyer Billy Flynn(Richard Gere), the two divas conjure freedom, with each trying to steal the favor of the spotlight from the other.Zeta-Jones is no less a goddess. Zellweger has the way to charm your attention. Queen Latifah if nothing else provides cleavage. And the ever charming Gere fights off being pedestrian.

16,sunwarrior13,Chicago Is A Must-See Musical,10,13 October 2012,"Chicago is a musical film adapted from the satirical stage musical of the same name, exploring the themes of celebrity, scandal, and corruption in Jazz Age Chicago.It stars stars Renée Zellweger, Richard Gere, and Catherine Zeta-Jones also featuring Queen Latifah, John C. Reilly, Christine Baranski, Lucy Liu, Taye Diggs, Colm Feore, and Mýa Harrison. It centers on Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly, two murderesses who find themselves in jail together awaiting trial in 1920s Chicago. Velma, a vaudevillian, and Roxie, a housewife, fight for the fame that will keep them from the gallows.It is directed and choreographed by Rob Marshall, and adapted by screenwriter Bill Condon.Roxie Hart is a small-time chorus dancer married to a well-meaning dunderhead named Amos. Roxie is having an affair on the side with Fred Casley, a smooth talker who insists he can make her a star. However, Fred strings Roxie along a bit too far for his own good, and when she realizes that his promises are empty, she becomes enraged and murders Fred in cold blood. Roxie soon finds herself behind bars alongside Velma Kelly, a sexy vaudeville star who used to perform with her sister until Velma discovered that her sister had been sleeping with her husband. Velma shot them both dead, and, after scheming prison matron ""Mama"" Morton hooks Velma up with hotshot lawyer Billy Flynn, Velma becomes the new Queen of the scandal sheets. Roxie is just shrewd enough to realize that her poor fortune could also bring her fame, so she convinces Amos to also hire Flynn. Soon Flynn is splashing Roxie's story or, more accurately, a highly melodramatic revision of Roxie's story all over the gutter press, and Roxy and Velma are soon battling neck-to-neck over who can win greater fame through the headlines.A rousing and energetic adaptation of the Broadway musical, Chicago succeeds on the level pure spectacle, but provides a surprising level of depth and humor as well.This film adaptation, written by Bill Condon, is somewhat kinder and gentler than the stage versions that preceded it.Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones put on quite a show in Rob Marshall's dazzling cinematic rethinking of the 1975 Kander and Ebb musical directed by Bob Fosse.Singing live in the rehearsal hall while going through the strenuous motions of Marshall's choreography, Zeta- Jones is every inch the consummate performer and undeniable star and Zellwegger defines delicious.It is a must-see musical.",Chicago

18,hitchcockthelegend,Fosse's legendary stage musical gets a good old fashioned movie musical make over.,7,7 November 2009,"It might be stating the bleeding obvious, but every movie musical lives and dies by two basic things, the quality of the songs and the execution of the routines from the actors. Happily, tho, first time director Rob Marshall's Chicago isn't found wanting in either department, with a song practically every five minutes, this be a musical in the truest sense of the word. And although the non-musical scenes are a touch rushed in eagerness to get to the next number-they do serve as points of realism to move the narrative forward. ""All That Jazz,"" ""Cell Block Tango,"" ""All I Care About Is Love"" and ""Mr Cellophane"" are just some of the more memorable moments as Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, John C. Reilly, Christine Baranski and Queen Latifah {who's enormous bosom threatens to swamp the set at one point} all bring differing levels of quality to the already magnificent source. Sure stuff has had to be trimmed down and Fosse's choreography replaced by Marshall's more tentative, and at times too close, approach work. But the heart and essence is spot on because the wry observations on the justice system, celebrity {fickle} status, female empowerment, spin and of course, sin-gladly hit home without being thrust down our throats.

Mr. Marshall, working with the editor, has translated the stage work into a vibrant film. There's not a dull moment in this picture. From the very beginning it starts moving with the great score of songs that are so well known by now.Almost all the actors in the movie aren't known for their singing or dancing on the stage, or on films. Yet, under the direction of Mr. Marshall, they respond to the material incredibly well. Take Rene Zellweger, the Roxie Hart of the story. In her musical numbers she comes across as an accomplished singer who, unknown to us, can also act and charm the living daylight out of anyone. Miss Zellweger is a natural for this role. She never lets us down. This is acting at its best. Ms. Zellweger has such a sweet aura around her that we can only surrender to her magnetism.How about Catherine Zeta-Jones? She's magnificent as Velma Kelly. She has curves that are unbelievable. Her singing and dancing skills were not what brought her into the world of films, yet, she manages to create this complex character. Ms. Zeta-Jones is a gorgeous woman who keeps getting better and better all the time.The greatest revelation is Richard Gere. He is an actor who should play the bad guy rather than the romantic lead most directors cast him in. When playing an evil person, he excels. His Billy Flynn is a triumph and credit, no doubt, has to go to Mr. Marshall, who knew his leading actor had it in him to give a fabulous performance and he can sing and dance on top of that.John C. Riley, wow! He's an actor who never repeats himself. He has such a moldable face that no matter what film, or stage work he does, he makes the role his own. You never see this great actor give a fake performance as proven in all his recent work. His ""Cellophane Man"" is a show stopper. Had he done it on Broadway, he probably had to do it as an encore because he is the epitome of what the character is going through at the time.The other great surprise is Queen Latifa. She has such a great voice!. It's a shame no one has created a film to showcase her talent. She has charm to spare; her screen presence is incredible.Great work Mr. Marshall!",Chicago
20,preppy-3,Almost a 10,9,20 December 2002,"In 1920s Chicago, Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) shoots and kills her lover (Dominic West).  She lands in prison but, with the help of shady lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), she begins to enjoy her notoriety and thrive on the publicity.  Another inmate, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) begins to get very jealous of all this...Adaptation of the hit Broadway musical is actually better than the stage version.  The story is more coherent and the cast gives their all to the material.  Also, the songs flow right into the story--in some musicals the story stops short to make room for the songs--here they just blend together perfectly.  Also some of the song and dance numbers just had my audience applauding them--they're that well done!The acting is universally good--Zeta-Jones (totally covering her Scottish accent) is just great as Kelly;  Zellweger is good as Roxie (but she pouted a little too much for my taste) and Gere is obviously having a great old time as Flynn (and he sings and dances pretty well!).  And Queen Latifah, Taye Diggs and Dominic West are great in supporting roles.I almost gave this a 10...but the ending left me a bit cold.  That aside, this is a rarity--a good solid Hollywood adaptation of a stage musical. Worth catching.",Chicago
21,writers_reign,Class of 1975,7,25 February 2009,"Some 27 years after its Broadway opening the movie adaptation of Chicago finally made it to the screen albeit with a couple of 'alterations' - at least one number, 'Class' was jettisoned after shooting and this time around Mary Sunshine is actually played by a female rather than a guy in drag, which scored heavily as a shock 'revelation' in the stage version. In either format Chicago is a collection of great showtunes in search of a Book. Sure, the satire and social comment is biting and a deadly accurate portrayal of life that is as relevant today as it was in the twenties where celebrity is everything and real talent counts for naught. The cast are competent but about the best you can say for them is that they don't embarrass themselves with ideas above their station. The easily pleased will revel whilst the truly discerning will sigh for what might have been.",Chicago

Good story, vibrant musical sequences with bouncy music. The whole movie just moves along at a brisk pace, propelled by the musical interludes, the interesting, clever story and the witty dialogue.Great performances all round. Entire cast shines, with Catherine Zeta- Jones, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere to the fore. Zeta-Jones won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar and Zellweger was nominated for Best Actress. Even John C Reilly and Queen Latifah put in solid performances, enough to get them Supporting Actor/Actress Oscar nominations.Good fun.",Chicago
23,Boba_Fett1138,Tthroughout enjoyable.,7,1 June 2010,"Despite the fact that I had quite some problems with the movie, it still was throughout enjoyable to watch. Fast going and good looking. Loud and flashy but in a really good way. A great way to bring a musical to the big screen for the modern audiences.But yet it also at the same time is a movie that is heavily flawed. I really had lots of problems with this movie. The first thing is its story. It's such an incredibly thin and simplistic story that gets stretched out incredibly, to make it fit an almost 2 hours long movie. I just didn't liked that at all. Another thing are its characters. The characters are constantly changing throughout the movie. At one point you are supposed to sympathize for them but at the other they are doing such incredibly wrong things that you just can't sympathize for them at all. And the one moment the Renée Zellweger characters was an incredibly naive, shy, sweet girl and at the other she was totally manipulative and angry with everyone around her, even the ones that never intended to hurt her and sincerely cared for her. Seriously, what was up with that?But well, the movie is just so fast going that you tend to forget and see through its flaws, simply because you have no time to ever really stand still and think about them. It's obviously a movie made for entertainment, like basically all musicals are.I liked the movie for being a modern renditions of the quite old fashioned and uncool musical genre. This is one of the movies that brought some new life to the genre again and helped to introduce a new style to appeal to modern audiences. It's mostly notable in its pace. The movie is basically non-stop musical and singing, which often gets annoying after a while but in this case it does work out and makes the movie entertaining.The movie has a great look, especially for its musical moments. It's a creative movie, that does a lot with its limited space for its story to work in. The songs are also good and performed nicely by the cast, that has quite some big name in it. I really liked Renée Zellweger, despite the fact that I couldn't always like her character and I thought that her looks were also not really right for the part. Renée Zellweger just isn't a very attractive person to me and is actually one that does look better with some more meat on her bones. No matter how hard they tried to make her look sexy in this movie, it just didn't do it for me. Still she really deserved more an Oscar than Catherine Zeta-Jones did for her role in this movie.Totally ridicules that this is a movie that won 6 Oscars, including one for best picture but it nevertheless remains a good and enjoyable enough movie to watch.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Chicago
24,view_and_review,What a Show,7,19 February 2021,"I am not a fan of musicals, but I was all in on this one. This was funny, creative, and different. My image of musicals is a person spontaneously breaking out into song and just simply standing there singing with the spotlight on him/her. ""Chicago"" was not that. There would be no standing still and no illogically breaking out into song.A woman named Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) wanted to get into the entertainment industry so bad she slept with her furniture salesman, Fred Casely (Dominic West), because he said he could introduce her to someone at the club. When he burst her bubble and told her the truth---he was only saying what he needed to say to get into her pants---she shot him dead. It was a glorious moment of ""You're not getting away with this!"" (even though she was cheating on her husband). Her aloof, oblivious, sucker of a husband, Amos (John C. Riley) was going to take the wrap for killing Fred when he didn't know that the dead man under the sheet was Fred, their furniture salesman. Once Amos put two and two together, or more accurately, once he was spoon fed the facts, he let Roxie go down for her crime.Turns out that wasn't a bad move by Amos because women's prison in Chicago ain't so bad. Roxie only became the headliner she wanted to be anyway with the help of the matron, Mama Morton (Queen Latifah), and a savvy lawyer named Billy Flynn (Richard Gere).I'm surprised that Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Richard Gere made me laugh. I've never laughed at one of them before (not when I was supposed to anyway), but this movie was so well done it had me totally tuned in and guffawing all the way.",Chicago
25,evanston_dad,Better Than Anyone Expected It to Be,7,4 August 2010,"Film newbie Rob Marshall adapted the 1975 Broadway musical that's been a blockbuster hit in revival since 1996 and did a better job than anyone thought he could. For a while after its release, and especially after it snagged the Best Picture Academy Award, America had ""Chicago"" fever.Looking back on it all these years later, long after the hype has died down, it's clear that ""Chicago"" is a lot of fun and certainly has energy to spare, but it was vastly overrated at the time. After its success, it became ""safe"" again to make Hollywood musicals, but the irony is that director Marshall works overtime to make ""Chicago"" as un-musical as possible. The ""it's-all-in-Roxie's-head"" approach to every musical number is monotonous, and the musical numbers are never allowed to cut loose, because the editor has to remind us at every fourth or fifth cut that we're watching a fantasy taking place in someone's fevered imagination. And one would never know how good the choreography might be, because we're never really given a chance to see it. Every number tries so aggressively to be a show-stopper that the movie never has a chance to relax.The performances from Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere in the lead roles are pretty good, and John C. Reilly and Queen Latifah fare well in smaller roles. Everyone gets a chance to belt out a big number and it's fun to see people not associated with musical talent pull it off so well. But Marshall in his subsequent projects has proved that he's essentially a one-hit wonder, and years from now I wouldn't be surprised if people watch ""Chicago"" and wonder what all the hoopla was about.Grade: B+",Chicago
26,ferguson-6,Jailhouse Rock on Steroids,8,5 January 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Super-hyped movie that supposedly, on the heels of ""Moulin Rouge"", will bring the musical back to Hollywood. Yes it is a very entertaining movie with some catchy numbers and wonderful characters, but to put this on a list of best in 2002 (a strong year for film) is difficult to understand.  First time director Rob Marshall has a nice feel for pacing, but with one viewing I saw boom mikes on 3 different occasions - a real no-no these days.  Very little dancing in the movie until the final number with the Velma/Roxie combo.  By far the best musical number is Queen Latifah's ""Mama"".  She jumps off the screen and has the voice to carry the song.  The best choreography and most creative number was the marionette piece ""We both went for the gun"" with Gere and Zellweger. However, I was very disappointed in both of their voices.  I think Mandy Patinkin would have been a wonderful choice for the Billy Flynn (Gere) role. Catherine Zeta-Jones' voice was more than sufficient and she aptly captured the spirit of Velma.  Wonderful supporting turns by Christine Baranski, Lucy Liu and John C. Riley (in a very different role from ""Gangs of New York"" or any of his PT Anderson roles).  Again, very enjoyable and I do hope to see even more creative musicals, but forget the top 10 stuff.",Chicago
27,anaconda-40658,Tap Dance It.,7,10 March 2016,"Chicago (2002): Dir: Rob Marshall / Cast: Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, John C. Reilly: Musical about reputation of profession or the city where those professions are committed. It is a miraculous film filled with glitter and glamour and the cold damp gloom of a jail cell. Opening with the arrest of murder suspect Roxie Hart whose dreams are shattered. Richard Gere is the lawyer with the perfect record who renders Hart a media darling and victim of circumstance. This leaves former media darling Velma Kelly in the cold. Flawed with unnecessary footage and the phony uniting between Hart and Velma Kelly in the conclusion. Rob Marshall directs as a tribute to Bob Fosse who found major success with Cabaret. Renee Zellweger delivers a remarkable comic performance and is especially brilliant during a ventriloquist sequence. Catherine Zeta-Jones does a superb job particularly during a rousing opening number called ""All That Jazz."" Gere demonstrates pride during a tremendous tap dancing sequence where deception takes a major lead. Queen Latifah is Big Momma Morton the warden who accepts bribes and also sings a humorous number called ""Mama Knows Best."" John C. Reilly makes a memorable musical impression as Roxie's devoted husband. Destruction of integrity perfectly realized in its song and dance. Score: 7 / 10",Chicago
28,HotToastyRag,A beautiful work of art,10,6 January 2018,"It's difficult for me to describe all the ways in which I love Chicago, because often times when attempting the explanation, my description winds up just as long as the feature's length. The short version of my recommendation would be for you to buy a copy for yourself as soon as possible. I had a VHS version that I watched so many times the colors started to fade, and now I'm happily watching my DVD copy ad nauseum.I've seen the musical Chicago live onstage, and it's terrible. No one who actually likes music would enjoy sitting through the show. The script is crass, the characters aren't developed, and the songs are annoying. But, magically enough, when Bill Condon wrote the script for the film adaptation, everything changed. He and director Rob Marshall-in my humble opinion, one of the greatest directors of the modern era-completely changed the point of the story and made it not only accessible, but fascinating to film audiences. While onstage, it's about an aspiring showgirl who goes to jail for murdering her lover, in the film, it's about a fragile, disappointed woman who uses the allure of the stage as a mental escape when she's frightened. See how much more interesting that story is? I've watched every behind-the-scenes featurette included on my DVD, and have since learned that Condon and Marshall purposely redesigned the story that way. Every time there's a musical number, it's because Renée Zellweger's character needs a mental distraction from her surroundings. When she's being questioned by the police, she imagines the song ""Funny Honey"", her first night in prison is comforted by the ""Cell Block Tango"", etc. Every song is in Renée's imagination. Not only is that method of storytelling incredibly clever and shows a unique side to the main character, but it's a great way to get audiences hooked into a film musical, a genre that pretty much died out in the 1970s, with the exception of 2001's Moulin Rouge. Chicago is infinitely superior to Baz Lurhmann's spectacular because it doesn't bombard the senses. It's a thoughtful, sensitive piece, perfectly balancing the fine line between musical comedy and a dramatic murder story. In the golden age of musicals, songs and dances were often filmed in whole takes so audiences could see the continuity and realism of the actors' talents. Because of the way the story was designed, the numbers in Chicago couldn't be captured in long takes. The scenes constantly cut back and forth between fantasy and reality, simultaneously entertaining the audience with a song and advancing the story. Martin Walsh, the editor of Chicago, had his hands full with the multitude of camera angles and the challenge to set and maintain two separate paces within each song. The end result is a beautiful work of art. Now, onto the performances. Renée Zellweger didn't take home the gold that year, even though her turn as Roxie Hart was the best performance of her career. She won her make-up Oscar the following year for her supporting role in Cold Mountain, a role that, given her Southern roots, she could have done in her sleep. Renée captures every subtle emotion of her character, making her situation sympathetic to the audience, even though she's shown cheating on her kind-hearted husband, murdering her boyfriend, and tricking her husband into taking the blame. How is someone like that sympathetic? Because the audience feel so incredibly sorry for her, this fragile woman with dreams of grandeur and severe mental issues. Renée is absolutely perfect.
Richard Gere takes the male lead, Billy Flynn, a part highly coveted in the musical theater world. Just like his costar, he takes a character that's utterly unlikable on paper and transforms him into someone the audience completely falls in love with-and not just because he's Richard Gere. His comic timing and charm play off Renée's insecurities wonderfully, and he seems to glide through the part effortlessly, as if he's done it a hundred times before and will probably do it again tomorrow. He doesn't seem bored or tired, though, just very well prepared-as Billy Flynn is supposed to be! Billy is the best lawyer in Chicago, so he actually has gone through his ""song and dance"" a hundred times before. It's a fine line to walk, and Richard walks it.In the supporting cast are Catherine Zeta-Jones, John C. Reilly, and Queen Latifah. Each have their own show-stopping numbers that will stay with you long after the credits roll. Each character, even the smaller parts, are given many character facets to juggle-mirroring the reality-fantasy combination of the songs-and it's a true testament to Rob Marshall's directing that every actor and actress nail their parts. Queen Latifah is hardened and only slightly compassionate, but you can't help but trust her even when you know you shouldn't. John C. Reilly is every smart girl's idea of an ideal husband, and his ""Mr. Cellophane"" will probably make you cry. Every time I watch it, I wish I could reach into the television and give him a gigantic hug.Catherine Zeta-Jones dazzles from start to finish, and while everyone has their own favorite and most beautiful performance, her turn as Velma Kelly might be mine. She's the archetypical 1920's vamp and uses every ounce of star power to attract and propel Renée's character through the story. As realistic and raw as Renée's performance is, Catherine's is equally staged and calculated. She makes bad look so good, it's no wonder Renée aspires to be just like her!Chicago swept the 2003 Academy Awards, winning Best Editing, Costumes, Sound, Supporting Actress, Art Direction, and Picture, with Kirk and Michael Douglas famously reading the winner aloud onstage together. Additional nominations were earned for Cinematography, Directing, Adapted Screenplay, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress, Actress, and Original Song for ""I Move On"", played during the end credits. Obviously, if I had my way, Rob Marshall, John C. Reilly, and Bill Condon would have taken home statuettes as well. Julianne Moore also gave the best performance of her career that year in Far From Heaven, so I would have tied the leading ladies and given them both Oscars; Edward Lachman's cinematography in Far From Heaven was also beautiful, so I probably would have tied that category as well.Whatever reason you decide to watch Chicago, whether it's for the eye-catching costumes, hidden talents of stars you didn't know were musical, clever storytelling, or beautifully framed and edited scenes, I'm sure you'll be entertained. I come from a long line of theater performers, and while my mom didn't like this movie, she admitted she was able to appreciate the work that went into it and how expertly Renée was able to sell her songs. I've written three musicals myself-and I'm the first to admit that Kander and Ebb's songs are the weakest elements of the show-and I still absolutely love this movie.",Chicago
29,phd_travel,Not as good as seeing it on stage,3,12 August 2010,Seeing this on stage is much better. This movie version uses confusing camera angles and closeups so you don't see the overall picture. You lose a lot of the dance numbers. Felt a bit dizzy after a while.Casting is OK but not ideal. Catherine Zeta Jones is talented and deserves her award though a little plump here. Renee is not dumb blonde enough. Richard Gere is weak both voice and acting wise. Latifah is a little too bemused looking.Sadly this just doesn't transfer from stage to screen well. But if you are a fan of the musical watch it - just be prepared to feel a little vomity after a while.,Chicago
30,Wuchakk,Gazillions of babes frolicking around in showgirl costumes,7,21 August 2018,"In mid-20's Chicago Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Renée Zellweger) find themselves on death row for murdering their lovers and fan the fame that will keep them from the gallows with the assistance of a slick lawyer (Richard Gere). John C. Reilly plays Roxie's likable but dimwitted husband while Latifah is on hand as the avaricious prison matron.People criticize this amusing satirical musical for being sleazy, but it would be hard to lampoon and ridicule the corrupt targets of the media and the legal (in)justice system without showing, um, sleaze. That's the point of the original 1926 play ""Chicago"" and all its successive incarnations, including this acclaimed 2002 movie: illustrating and sarcastically denouncing sleaze via a droll musical. ""Chicago"" without sleaze would be akin to ""Apocalypse Now"" without war.Believe it or not, the movie is based on real women, Beulah Annan (represented by Roxie) and Belva Gaertner (Velma), who were imprisoned for killing lovers in spring, 1924, in two unrelated incidents. The actual accounts were salacious with loads of sex & violence; and both were ultimately acquitted. Maurine Dallas Watkins wrote the original play, which was intended as a stinging satire of the lack of morals in Chicago during the roaring 20s. Watkins was, interestingly, a reporter for the Chicago Tribune who covered the popular trials and is represented by Mary Sunshine (Christine Baranski) in the film. Several of the peripheral characters are also based on real-life individuals who played a part in the unfolding drama, e.g. journalists, attorneys, officials and convicts.I'm not big on musicals beyond ones like ""Moulin Rouge"" (1952) and ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939), but ""Chicago"" works for me simply due to the scores of beautiful women prancing around in scanty showgirl apparel of the 20s. It's the same reason I love figure skating. After the passage of the 19th Amendment, American women were basking in their newfound freedoms and ""Chicago"" depicts this euphoric emancipation.I also appreciate ""Chicago"" because Gere is great and there are some creative pieces, like the puppet one and the tap-dancing part. All the musical skits are in Roxie's imagination, except for the opening ""All that Jazz"" performed by Velma at the club and the climatic one, which features both Velma & Roxie.The film runs 1 hour, 53 minutes.GRADE: B",Chicago
31,The_Void,"A dazzling, if lacking, musical experience",5,13 December 2004,"You will notice, whenever Chicago is mentioned, that the title 'best picture' is never far away. It's almost as if people are trying to convince themselves that this really DID deserve said accolade. However, while this film certainly does not deserve to be called the best picture of 2002, and is the weakest film to win the award since Schindler's List in 1993, it is still not essentially a 'bad' film. Not a great one, but at least it isn't terrible. The most curious thing about this film, however, even more curious than it getting best picture is Catherine Zeta-Jones getting 'best supporting actress'. Don't get me wrong, Zeta-Jones is very good looking and she has a great body, and although I realize that the Academy awards are silly and with such rash decisions on which films deserve the awards; aren't really worth much, I didn't think even they would resort to giving an actress the award because she's sexy. Eh, maybe she bribed them...Chicago could be viewed as a commentary on the fickleness of fame, but this commentary comes across as muddled at best. The problem is that, because this film is a musical, the focus is very much on the music sequences and although these sequences are grand and largely quite fun to watch, the message is lost within them. That's not to say that the musical sequences are superfluous to the film's plot, however, as the majority of them serve in building up the main characters. The best of these character-building sequences is Richard Gere's rendition of a song titled ""Razzle Dazzle 'em"". This is ironic, for two reasons; the first, fairly obviously, is that this song sums up the whole film. It's a dazzling experience, but there is nothing within that is particularly brilliant, and certainly nothing to suggest that it should be considered a 'great' film. The second is that this sums up Gere's career; he's a rubbish actor, but his dazzling good looks have, and will continue to, get him good roles. A Freudian slip? Maybe.The majority of the songs in the movie are nice and have a good tune to them, but once you've heard four or five; they tend to get a bit samey. Chicago surprises on a number of occasions, the most notable of which sees Richard Gere using Renee Zelwegger as a puppet (it makes sense when you see it), but overall...this is pretty routine stuff. Although it is still worth seeing, don't expect anything brilliant.",Chicago
32,zetes,"Dazzle me, baby!",8,6 January 2003,"A hugely entertaining musical about a woman, Roxie Hart (Renée Zellweger), who kills her lover when he reveals that he was lying about a guy who could make her famous. She's up for murder and might be hanged, but she and her wishy-washy, pushover husband (John C. Reilly) hire a fast-talking lawyer (Richard Gere) to defend her. The high-profile defense makes Roxie famous, and she plans to start an act after her inevitable release from prison. The film is all flash, and I wouldn't have it any other way. The point, that fame can come and go without warning, isn't anything new, but the film has a lot of energy to drive its theme home. The great musical numbers can be attributed to the original play's original director, Bob Fosse. As a Fosse fan, I could immediately identify his style. The numbers all arise out of the characters' fantasies, which works very well. The music itself is somewhat less impressive. Sure, every song is at least good, but there are so many songs that they tend to run into each other.Zellweger has been around for several years now, since Jerry MacGuire, and she's always been good. This is the first time she's been fantastic, and I'm guessing that she will be nominated for Best Actress. I've seen a few people praise Richard Gere's performance, but his, I think, is the least special in the film. He just didn't seem right to me, and I'm not sure I could explain why. I like Reilly in this film as well. He's had a thousand great roles in the last decade, and everyone tends to ignore him. His character in the film is constantly forgotten, so much so that his one musical number is ""Mr. Celophane,"" in which he laments his invisibility. I hope the Academy doesn't look right through him this year. I've left out Catherine Zeta-Jones, who looks like she's really important on the posters. She's less so in the actual film. She plays another murderess, having killed her husband and sister when she found them together. She was the night club star whom Roxie was watching when she was seduced by the man whom she eventually killed. I wish that her character had been given more screen time. Even more deserving of extra screen time is Queen Latifah, who has one of the most impressive musical numbers early in the film. She also kind of drops away as the film progresses, unfortunately. 8/10.",Chicago

The characters of Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart are quite unique--they are played beautifully by Oscar nominee Renee Zellwegger and Oscar winner, Catherine Zeta Jones Douglas. I have to say that Richard Gere was robbed again of an Oscar nomination for his performance as Billy Flynn. Bob Fosse would be proud of this film. It incorporates his dance style which is darkness, black, hats, and just similar to Cabaret, one of the greatest musical films of all time. New York City Columnist, Cindy Adams has named this film one of her all time favorites. The movie was long overdue in the first place. Yes, it's dark and morbid. I can't forget Oscar nominee Queen Latifah as the prison matron. She did a good job. I like the fact that the film was not that much different than the musical. I can't imagine the musical to be any better than the film. For men out there, treat your ladies or significant others right or this could happen to you.",Chicago
34,SimonJack,"When the competition isn't very good, what can one expect?",2,4 January 2017,"I wonder if people in 2002 and since have been starved for good musicals. Or could it be just lots of glitter and scintillating sexual innuendo tossed here and there? I first saw ""Chicago"" on the big screen when it came out years ago. I very much enjoy musicals, and have collected many of the best from decades past on DVD. In watching this movie again recently, I have to reaffirm my first sense of the film. It's wrapped in a very glamorous and glittery package. But the screenplay is crude, much of the dialog is crass, and the talent – well, these are not highly talented singers and dancers. Yes, they have a couple of interesting numbers and dance routines. One can see some natural agility in Catherine Zeta-Jones. But otherwise, this movie just is not that good. How Miramax poured the money into the glitz for this film, and how it promoted it to the hilt! It won six academy awards with several more nominations in a year of almost no competition. This movie is a combination revue and musical play. Where the original play, and the 1942 film, were comedies made as satires, I can see why the author, Maurine Watkins, was reluctant to sell the movie rights for a musical. After her death, her estate did sell the rights to Bob Fosse, Gwen Verdon and Richard Fryer. They wrote a musical score with numbers as individual vaudeville pieces. The 1975 musical play retains the satire of the Chicago corruption of the time – it is evident in the script and the performances. But the 2002 musical movie has numerous changes in the story and from the stage musical. And, it moves the musical performances to the fore, with all the glitter and sexploitation. This should have been a highly talented performance of musical and dance numbers with a story of biting satire. Instead, it's a so-so musical with so-so talented singers and dancers in an elaborate glitzy setting. Any remaining satire comes almost as a whimsical afterthought of that little old corruption in Chicago that really wasn't so bad. Take out the crassness in the dialog, cut down the glitz, put in some better voices and dancers, and work the numbers for the satire and this could be a memorable production.",Chicago

The songs are great, the dance numbers are entertaining and every member of this cast is ideal - up to the task and at-home with the big Hollywood spectacle.

After viewing ""Chicago"" with Queen Latifah,(Matron Mama),""Brown Sugar"",'02 I could not believe the great talent Matron Mama had, she was outstanding and practically stole the entire show. However, Catherine-Zeta-Jones,(Velma Kelly),""Intolerably Cruelty"",03 burned up the stage with her dancing and singing along with Renee Zellweger(Roxie Hart),""Nurse Betty"",2000. These two Jail Birds performed great acting skills and gave their lawyer, Richard Gere,(Billy Flynn),""Runaway Bride"",'99 a run for his money in more ways than none.  Enjoyed seeing Christine Baranski(Mary Sunshine)""Cybill"",TV series, acting as a newspaper reporter who kept you laughing through out the entire picture.

37,JamesHitchcock,Entertaining Black Comedy with Much to Enjoy,8,10 January 2006,"The cinematic musical has never really died, although there have been times over the last three decades when it has not seemed to be in the best of health. The golden age of the genre was in the fifties and sixties; in the latter decade four of the ten ""Best Picture"" Oscars went to musicals (""West Side Story"", ""My Fair Lady"" ""The Sound of Music"" and ""Oliver!""). Like a number of other seemingly-established genres (such as the Western) the musical suffered a decline in the seventies and eighties; those two great films ""Fiddler on the Roof"" and ""Cabaret"" from the early seventies seemed to be the end of the line. (If I were to be asked for my favourite musical of the eighties, it would probably be something as obscure as ""Absolute Beginners""). That, however, was not the end of the story. Many of the genres which had gone out of fashion made at least a partial comeback in the nineties. Alan Parker's ""Evita"" in 1996 was in my view the first great musical for over twenty years. Although it has not been followed by as many imitators as devotees of the genre might have hoped for, there have nevertheless been some good examples, notably ""Chicago"", the first musical to take ""Best Picture"" since 1969.Most of the classic musicals of the past were either light-hearted comedies like ""An American in Paris"" or serious dramas like ""West Side Story"". ""Chicago"", however, does not fit into either category, being a black comedy that deals with serious topics such as murder, the death penalty and the judicial system in an ironical way. The plot, set in the jazz-age Chicago of the Twenties, concerns Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart, two young women accused of crimes of passion. Velma is a showgirl who murdered her sister and her husband after finding them in a compromising position. Roxie, a housewife with showbiz ambitions of her own, murdered her lover after discovering he had lied to her about his theatrical connections. Both hire to defend them Billy Flynn, the city's leading lawyer, who tries to win public sympathy by turning them into media celebrities.This film has been compared to another twenty-first century musical, Baz Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge!"", but in my view ""Chicago"" is far superior to that tasteless, meretricious movie. The main defect of ""Moulin Rouge!"" is not so much that it is irredeemably vulgar; honest vulgarity has its place, sometimes an honourable one, in the entertainment industry. ""Moulin Rouge!"", however, is the dishonest sort of vulgarity, the self-satisfied variety that takes itself seriously, never realising how trashy it is. There are elements of vulgarity in ""Chicago"", but it never falls into the same trap of taking itself too seriously. The tone is generally light and cynical; when it has serious points to make it does so in a satirical way. There is some sharp satire at the expense of lawyers and the media who attempt to exploit the notoriety of celebrity criminals for their own purposes; for some reason the initials ""OJ"" kept coming to mind.Another reason why I found ""Chicago"" superior was the quality of the music. Unlike the earlier film it was originally written as a stage musical, with purpose-written songs. ""Moulin Rouge!"", by contrast, simply borrows various pop songs from the previous three decades, none of which were written as part of a musical and many of which seem out of place in that particular context, especially when performed by the likes of Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, neither of whom have particularly strong voices.The music of ""Chicago"", however, written in the jazz style of the twenties, is lively with witty lyrics, the two most memorable numbers being ""All That Jazz"" and ""Give 'Em the Old Razzle-Dazzle"". The two female leads in are both clearly talented as singers and dancers. Catherine Zeta Jones is aggressively seductive as Velma, something that might surprise her fellow Britons who remember her as sweet little Mariette in ""The Darling Buds of May"" or as a rather soulful Eustacia in ""The Return of the Native"". In Hollywood, however, apart from adventures of the ""Zorro"" type, her forte seems to be cynical or satirical comedies like this one, ""America's Sweethearts"" or ""Intolerable Cruelty"". Renee Zellwegger, clearly hoping to exorcise the ghost of the frumpy Bridget Jones, plays Roxie with an intriguing mixture of sexuality and vulnerability. Richard Gere is not the world's greatest singer, but his relaxed, nonchalant style of acting makes him ideal for the role of the cynically mercenary Billy. There are also some good cameos, particularly from Queen Latifah as the corrupt prison warder Mama Morton.The ""Best Supporting Actress"" Oscar for Catherine Zeta Jones was well deserved, but I was rather surprised by the ""Best Picture"" award. ""Chicago"" is a good film, but I am not sure that it is a better one than ""The Two Towers"" (which possibly suffered from being the middle episode of a trilogy) or ""The Pianist"". Nevertheless, there is much to enjoy in this entertaining black comedy. 8/10",Chicago
38,StevePulaski,An experience only an eclectic could love,9,25 April 2012,"Rob Marshall's Chicago bares a resemblance to John Waters's Female Trouble when dissecting themes and the central focus. Waters's picture showed how America strangely glorifies criminals and those behind bars, and the strange, undefinable way some of us admire them. Do we admire their boldness, or do we admire the fact that they are mysterious and that thousands of questions loom? Waters used grotesque tactics in Female Trouble to prove his point, while Marshall uses classiness and urgency to convey his story. Both are fine examples of art and trash art. I don't think I need to say which is which.Chicago is the stunning big screen adaptation of a play of the same name created by Fred Ebb and Bob Fosse. Big screen musicals are always a scare to the public because instead of searching for lesser-known singers that could possibly make their entry into Hollywood and the music industry, the studio immediately hunts down the names and puts them in revealing outfits and gives them a mic. This isn't a glossy, heavy-handed MTV production, but a ravishing, scintillating adventure that evokes every kind of sensation with courage and every dance number with broad, amusing sex appeal.The story is set in 1920's Chicago. We are greeted with Velma Kelly, played by an attractive and leggy Catherine Zeta-Jones, who works at a downtown nightclub. Young and foolish Roxie Hart (Zellweger) admires the star for her stylish chic and her silent but noticeable courage, and hopes Fred Casely (West), the man she is cheating on her husband with, will get her the same kind of gig. Casely promises her glitz, glamor, and fame, but when she discovers he is a lying scumbag, guns him down and is thrown on Death Row.Velma is arrested after the show for killing her husband and sister when she finds the two were hiding their fond relationship behind her back. Abandoned by her husband Amos (Reilly), a naive and innocent soul much like herself, Roxie is desperate, and hopes to find ways to gain fame and publicity while behind bars. Both her and Velma are taken under the wing of the vicious and corrupt Mama (Latifah) who takes bribes to supply her inmates with the goodies.Meanwhile, a trial for both women is coming. Roxie gets the highly recommended lawyer Billy Flynn (Gere), whom she steals from Velma. Billy promises Roxie a successful trial as long as she is quiet, cooperative, and obedient. And she is, but how far does that get her? There are quite a few elegantly shot and extravagantly written musical numbers to be found in Chicago. My personal favorite was the ""Cell Block Tango,"" performed by women in prison, all lead by the murderess Velma. Another wonderfully ambiguous musical number was ""We Both Reached for the Gun,"" performed by Richard Gere's Billy. The scene depicts Gere sitting on a chair, being the ventriloquist for the Roxie ""dummy."" While it is played for laughs, it provides subtle commentary on how some lawyers speak entirely for their client and become their voice, almost robbing them of the will to speak and their collective individuality. This was the first time in a long time that a musical number entranced me, and one of the selected times ambiguity was successfully played.The sets in Chicago are colorful, vivacious, and captivating. The seamy nature of the city and the prison is also conveyed nicely when it is shown. Art direction is the number one thing in a musical. There is nothing worse than a bleak, dreary setup in a film that should be filled with imagery. Chicago is shamelessly stylistic, and that's not a bad thing. The twist is that many of the musical numbers, more or less, occur in Roxie's head. The challenge is making that present and clear to the audience, and the film accepts the task and pulls it off wonderfully.Not to mention, the ensemble cast is absolutely divine, all of them complimented with beautifully written material, comprised not of musical clichés and recycled odds and ends, but of freshness, angst, enigma, and everlasting style. Its rhythm never feels rushed, its pacing seems natural (although sometimes it appears the picture is winded and is desperately trying to set up the next musical number while progressing the story), and Zeta-Jones gives a performance more than deserving of the Oscar. Chicago may not be the greatest musical, but it portrays cynicism in a fashionable way, occupies some devilishly entertaining musical numbers, has monologues that seem to have exploded out of the Broadway light, and commendable performances around the clock. It is an experience only an eclectic could love.Starring: Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, John C. Reilly, Christine Baranski, Taye Diggs, and Lucy Liu.

I am excited about seeing the musical next time it comes into town. And it's based in the best city in the world!!! What more could you want?! Sorry, just a little city pride there. Recently, the newer musical movies aren't as enchanting as they used to be in the 50's and 60's. I miss movies like: West Side Story, Oliver, and Singing in the Rain.

All the characters are dis-likable and comes off way too self-centered, one dimensional and superficial. But this is a musical that basically shows the greedy side of human nature. The main protagonist Roxanne ""Roxie"" Hart played by Renée Zellweger is one of the most annoying and disgusting characters I seen in a while. Velma Kelly played by Catherine Zeta-Jones who becomes rivals with Roxie at least seem to know she is a conceited woman. When it comes down to it this is a musical with memorable musical numbers and revolves around dis-likable characters. That go off to imagination land after few dialogues where they sing and dance while pulling other stunts. Of and the actors and actresses can't sing.6/10",Chicago
41,OllieSuave-007,Great musical and crime film.,7,6 November 2013,"This is a fun musical and crime film, full of twists and turns and toe-tapping music. Murderesses Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Renée Zellweger) find themselves on death row together, but fight for their stardom that will keep them away from the executioner.The film's cinematography by Dion Beebe captures the 1920s era in Chicago beautifully - very rich and vibrant, and the acting captures very well the the mood of that era, a sort of film/noir or gangster feel to it. The plot was pretty solid, but did drag at times at swayed away from the main point of the story. The quick humor and acid wits made this movie more entertaining. But, the best aspect of the movie, I think, is the scores of songs and music, which are a real treat for those fans of musicals to enjoy. All the musical numbers were brilliant and catchy (I especially like the ""All that Jazz"" sequence). Overall, a pretty nice movie, but I think it is best for musical fans to enjoy rather than movie fans in general. Grade B",Chicago
42,sddavis63,"Fun, Funny And Sexy Musical",9,5 January 2009,"""Chicago"" was in many ways the revival of the Hollywood musical. I don't really remember a successful, big budget musical that I liked coming out of modern Hollywood until this, but since we've been treated to several (think ""Hairspray,"" ""Mamma Mia!"" and ""Sweeney Todd"" as examples, among others.) And it's no wonder this was so successful, and that it reinvigorated a largely lost genre: it's a great movie, just plain fun to sit down with and watch. On a personal note, I have to confess that while I was always impressed with Renee Zellweger as an actress, after her performance in ""Chicago"" I also became quite smitten with her! Zellweger was quite lovely (and showed her acting, singing and dancing talents) in her portrayal of Roxie Hart, a wannabe jazz club singer in 1920's Chicago who kills her lover and then has to make herself an object of sympathy to escape the gallows. Her female co-star (and equal in terms of talent) was the more mature but equally lovely Catherine Zeta-Jones as Velma Kelly, another singer/killer, who Roxie meets up with in jail. Richard Gere put on a stunning performance as their attorney Billy Flynn. Rounding out the cast, there were very solid supporting performances from Queen Latifah, John C. Reilly and Catharine Baranski. In the acting department, there's not a weakness to be found here. Zellweger and Jones play off each other brilliantly, as does Gere with both. Latifah's performance as prison Matron Mamma Morton was also very good, and, I thought, somewhat sexually suggestive in her interplay with the female prisoners under her charge - think of lines like ""you do me a favour and I'll do you a favour."" I know she was specifically asking for financial favours, but given the inherent (but always innocent) sexuality of the movie, one wonders if there wasn't a bit of a double entendre to the line.Latifah's character was one of the few problem areas in the movie for me, mind you. This isn't to be looked at as a serious movie (it's clearly meant to be fun) but still it was hard for me to accept that an African American woman would become the head of a women's prison in the 1920's. The story at times had a bit of an awkward flow because of the repeated musical numbers, and some of those musical numbers were perhaps a wee bit too long (which meant that the movie itself was perhaps a wee bit too long.) All things considered, though, those are really minor criticisms of an overall great movie. 9/10",Chicago
43,thesar-2,I look forward to 2052 when this is considered a Masterpiece,10,27 June 2010,"You know the worse part of Chicago? When you finish, and I mean through the end of the credits, you will want to watch it again.This movie is AMAZING. And I am not into musicals. Back in 2003, my boyfriend made me see this movie a few weeks after its release at Arrowhead AMC. I resisted – again, I don't favor musicals, but the minuteyes, I mean MINUTEit stared I was hooked. For life.Dare I say this is my favorite musical? Well, it's not that easy. I absolutely loved The Sound of Music. But beyond that wonderful Julie Andrews Nazi film, this one had so much energy, originality, spunk, great songs, characters with soul-depth, score, suspense, fun and wonderful acting; I will NEVER forget this movie. It's got a permanent place on my measly 4-gig (12 with an almost useless 8-gig add-on card) MP3 player.Chicago starts off with a BANG – literally. Velma Kelly (Jones) enters the 1920's Chicago stage – with a little bloody journey, that is – alone when she is to be perform with her sister. She performs: ""All that Jazz"" (PERFECTLY, I must add) with on-looker, and main character, Roxie Hart (Zellweger) who's envious and star-struck. She's rushed away by her extramarital-affair boyfriend who promises her the world. When he can't deliver, he's carried away horizontally and she's hauled off to prison.There, she meets life and the characters who will influence the remainder of her life: namely Mama (Latifah) and Kelly – who got arrested for ""murdering"" her sister. She will also become the star she wanted to be, acting like the innocent little blonde with the help of the expensive attorney, Billy (Gere) who uses ""Razzle Dazzle"" to lead the jurors.There's a lot more to thisobviously with the fantastic soundtrack that, in itself, tells the fall and rise of the central character of Roxie Hart. But, I ask that you discover this gem on your own. I do each time I watch it.That's what makes this piece of history worthy of its Best Picture win (sorry, Lord of the Rings Part Two): they didn't stop at the excellent acting (ALL actors did their absolute best, despite only one winning a best actor Oscar (Jones),) or the wonderful and powerful songs that come one after another leaving you wanting even more. No, the screenplay and characters were filled with so many layers, you'd think this fantastic piece of work should win a Pulitzer.One of the most magical parts of this work of art: they went beyond the obvious. I appreciate that in any film, but I would've loved this movie anyways due to the energy and fantastic music. Why stop there? In this duel viewing, I picked up on ""I can do it on my own"" from Velma and the transition of Roxie's reality into fantasy. (In all honesty, I might have realized this earlier, so, to add to the magic, I guess I re-imagined the movie as if it was the first time watching it.) These two ""minor"" scenes/pieces made me appreciate/escalate the movie to the nth degree – and they were in the first 10 minutes.There's so much more I want to say about this movie and since I'm doing this for free, I'll continue. Gere deserved an honor for Pretty Woman, but this was a role of the lifetime for him, much like Julia Roberts's number one role was for that ""pretty"" prostitute. Latifah was absolutely fabulous. Sure she played herself, but no one, NO ONE, could've done it better. Zones was an absolute excellent 1920's flapper. Say what you will about Zones, herself, but, again, NO ONE could have been Velma Kelly. While Reilly was great in his role, and only one of two (Hunyak, played by Ekaterina Chtchelkanova – see below for translation, if you want. Watch the movie if want to know what she said) that was truly innocent, he played his normal sad-sack role. That's not saying he was bad – he was still wonderful.Now, beyond the person that actually won the Oscar – Jones, who thoroughly deserved the award, was Zellweger as Roxie Hart. She (Renee) is not my favorite actress, though I really liked her in Jerry Maguire, but in Chicago as Roxie Hart, she was perfect. Watch the absolute levels of depth she shows as a ""human being"": naïve, contriving, selfish and perkiness, all in one. Her character is truly the center of this movie; no matter what happens around her, no matter the character they introduce or shine, it's all about her. Zellweger, despite not winning the deserved Oscar, preformed the role of a lifetime.How great is it that everyone performed their own songs? Each one is excellent – sung in the movie, that is. (SKIP: ""Class"" from the extras from both DVD and Soundtrack. There was a reason it was cut.) My personal favoriteis a TIE. Originally, I loved ""We Both Reached for the Gun,"" including the WONDERFUL puppet scene from the movie. Later, I loved ""All That Jazz,"" the opening segment more. But, now, I can't decide between the two. My boyfriend, I mentioned, loved ""Cell Block Tango"" which I only liked a bit at the time, but now like a lot. As I listen to the whole soundtrack as I write this – the whole CD/Soundtrack is as great as the movie is. Buy the movie. Then buy the soundtrack. You won't regret either purchase.Isn't is grand? Isn't it great? 50 years later, or 2052, I think this movie will be considered what it should've on opening day: a classic. A masterpiece.",Chicago
44,ElMaruecan82,"More than a movie, a true miracle ...",10,28 November 2010,"This is one of the best films from the last decade, and considering how low were my expectations, this is sing...

Cicero, Lipshiz ... The movie is Chicago with a ""O"" like ""Oh-lala"" and a ""A"" like ""Screw Lady Gagaaaa!"" ... This is the kind of movies that makes me love movies ... a special and very subtle kind of Hollywood films where Hollywood isn't synonym of predictability, big money or 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang', in fact the whole concept of 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' is joyfully parodied and turned into an extravagant and spectacular musical comedy that it's very hard to believe that one director, during the Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings or Spider-Man era decided to make such a film ... My respects ! As a directorial achievement, Chicago is a fantastic tribute to one of the best defining Hollywood genres, musicals, it has the wit of ""Singin' in the Rain"" ... the grandeur and decadence of ""Cabaret"" ... the flamboyance of ""All That Jazz"" ... the triumphant chaos of ""The Cotton Club"" ... the sexiness of ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" ... and yet, in an incredibly admirable assurance, it manages to look so original, even superior to some of the most acclaimed musicals ... why? I don't know? I just know that it worked for me ... I didn't expect much from Richard Gere but he convinced me as Billy Flynn the 'lawyer and a gentleman'... as the ladies's gentleman ... Renee Zelwegger was so sweet as the cute and manipulative Roxie Hart she definitely touched mine and made me wish I could touch her hips ... and kiss her lips ... or the opposite ... as the antagonistic brunette, Zeta was the Alpha and Omega of the film, she was more than perfect, she was ""superhypnoticasexyelectrifryingmysticalmagicaletc.etc"" and Queen Latifah was simply ... '""Oh... Mama!"". And honorable mention for John C., Reilly perfect as the imperfect Andy, or Amos, whatever ... An original musical comedy with irresistible dialogs, this naughty touch of sexiness with a nuanced once of innocence (try to say that rapidly) that seems to lack today and a jazziness tailor-made for the 2000's even though, I don't think our cynical cinematic era deserved such a refreshing film ... I don't even care about arguing whether it deserved to win Best Picture or not, this is so sterile ... ""Singin' in the Rain"" should have won in 52, many musicals that won in the 60's dated terribly, this one is perfect for its genre, I'm not even saying there were not better or more serious movies nominated, but this one is a true miracle ... it looks so old, but so modern, it doesn't take itself seriously so much you take it seriously as an important cinematographic achievement and an unpretentious film with spectacular numbers (especially the one with 'dummies', which was a delight to watch) ... or maybe after so many dramas, I just needed to watch a good comedy that'd put a smile in my face, and this one worked so much I feel like it's the best I have seen in a while, but one thing for sure, it'll take me more than one viewing to decide which of the Maid, the Princess or the Queen was the sexiest ...",Chicago

49,ironhorse_iv,Nowadays any mediocre film can win best picture,6,19 October 2012,"Chicago is a deep dish of overrated. It's probably one of the worst Oscar Best Picture winners out there. It's just didn't deserve that praise, with other great films in 2002. Titles like the Pianist, Lord of the Rings, the Hours, & Gangs of New York. Loosely based on a real life trial in the 1920's, the story of 'Chicago' is trite. The two main characters Velma Kelly play by Catherine Zeta Jones and Roxie Hart play by Renee Zellweger are unlikeable. The reasons why because they loved being famous for their crime of murdering people. The murders are not even justified. Velma Kelly is a chanteuse and tease whom killed her husband and sister after finding them in bed together. Roxie Hart kill her boyfriend because she was angry that she wasn't going to be famous. Both of these characters head to prison, and a trial set up. Lawyer Billy Flynn play by Richard Gene come up to defend Roxie Hart on the stand, while making a cat fight between her and Velma. This movie is just wrong to call it a period piece—It's become hopelessly anachronistic, apparently sliding anywhere from 1920 to 1945 in the middle of a scene. Cell Block Tango goes into a weird bondage dress dance number. Half the movie seems like an odd musical soft core T&A porno with Roxie and Velma being scantily clad with naughty girls in jail who need punishment. The dialogue is totally unnatural, the costumes hopelessly inauthentic. It presents a completely unbelievable view of prison life and period piece. Don't get me started, on the music. Chicago is hardly a movie at all, more felt like a filmed musical. There wasn't much added to the film version that couldn't have been done on stage, so technically, it's one of the best adaptations of a musical to a movie I've ever seen. I saw the original on broad way, and it looks like that, but films are supposed to felt bigger than the stage play. It just looks cheap having every musical number shot in a sparsely-decorated warehouse. Sadly it felt like a really bad stage play with well-known actors with little singing talent doing Broadway. Catherine Zeta Jones was OK in her semi-acting role. Catherine was energetic, captivating, convincing, and sings beautifully in the music acts like 'All that Jazz'. She had some Broadway's flair with Annie, that's shows in this role. I doubt that Renee Zellweger can hold a note or tune. Her singing sounds like yelling, in some songs like 'Name on Everyone's Lips'. 'Love and Devotion', you can barely understand, what's she saying with all that soft talk. I was afraid for Renee as for her bones through most of the dance numbers she looked so brittle that she would break. The musical numbers while all very skillful, got a bit stale after a while. I really liked Queen Latifah in this, but she shouldn't be nomination. Richard Gere was surprisingly good. Almost in his element, I'd say. The singing and dancing was all uniformly good. The puppet number stood out, to me, as the best performance and the most clever staging from both Renee and Gere in 'We both reach for the gun' number. ""Mr. Cellophane"" by John C. Reilly was a nice little surprise buried in the movie, but too quickly forgotten and overshadowed by more of the same brash numbers. He was the only likable character in the movie. The movie had way too many performances overall, not enough story. I never really cared about any of the characters enough to invest much in the film. The whole musical-as-fantasy-life thing was done, and done better, in Dancer in the Dark. A movie based on the stage musical doesn't make it a great movie. While Chicago has been on stage since time immemorial and has been watched by zillions of people, Chicago the movie wasn't that great. I'm not sorry I saw it. It was mostly filler for a couple hours, with a few high points and a few points of can we move on now?

Interestingly, ""Cabaret,"" directed by Fosse himself, had the same issue - great musical numbers but flat dramatic parts.

The musical numbers are all done brilliantly (particularly the Cell Block Tango, All That Jazz, and Mr Cellophane).  Other bits are wildly entertaining, especially the sequence with the press during the trial ... is this film the first in the musical 'new wave'?  Can it kick-start a genre again where Evita failed?  Or am I right to be worried about the team behind Chicago planning a new version of Guys and Dolls with Vin Diesel, despite their triumph this time?",Chicago
54,johnnyboyz,Significantly lacking in the film-making column but remains high on energy and incredibly catchy songs.,6,7 March 2008,"Chicago is a great idea on paper; a sort of theatrical experience of a stage musical delivered right there for the average movie-goer who couldn't tell apart their Phantom's of the Opera to their Joseph's and their Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoats and yes, I'm one of them. But whilst the idea of delivering 'a film that is actually a real life stage show set within a world of a film but maintaining that break that makes us feel we're actually there and watching it' is a good one, it doesn't quite come off as well as it should and it's for a number of reasons.I have no idea how faithful to the original text Chicago is since I know nothing of the stage show but I doubt the level of sexism, media obsessed characters and false ideas of glory that are present in this film feature so dominantly feature in the original show. There is no doubt that Chicago is a pretty film but how many people will realise that what with all the sexism going on; the cinematography and use of light is brilliant; constantly alluring to us through different colour; colour of costumes, stage lights and backdrops; the use of light to emphasise certain spaces within the stage within the film and set design in general, specially the way the blur between real life and stage narrative is dealt with; a character can be in jail one minute but we sort of know she occupies another space entirely  this is also apparent in the courtroom and the press conference scenes.But whilst the parallel life/scenes concept is cute, one can only take it seriously for so long. The life in question revolves around Roxie Hart (Zellweger) who gets herself into trouble because she has murdered someone but has committed lust in the process by having an affair in the first place; this means our hero is someone who is in trouble through her own unfaithfulness and ignorance that her guy she was having on the side would be able to make her a star  bad traits for a protagonist to have: unfaithful and stupid. In fact, by the end of her journey, Roxie has pretty much remained the same: ""What about my scoop?"" she moans in a frustrated and somewhat dumb manner. But there is more to the narrative; the film is about prison life but told in a musical form; a prison where all the women wear fishnet stockings and revealing clothes, a prison in 1920s America whose chief warden is a black woman and a jail in which the inmates are treated like celebrities.Yes, celebrities. The idea at the very core of this film, if you're willing to delve deep enough, is who can get their face in amongst the tabloids; who can win over the press and who can be most famous before they are sentenced to death. It's the idea that something so serious as murder and jail and death sentences can be treated in such a careless and colloquial manner that is the problem here; it is nothing new to America since people will remember Ted Bundy defending himself in court and making a media circus out of everything but he was a psychotic serial killer who fought to the very end; with himself, the law, the media and everyone; Roxie on the other hand is a dumb, loose, un-engaging floozy whom none of us would give ten seconds of our time to in real life. But then again, I doubt many people would complain since they get to see extensive shots of legs, stockings, crotches and even the chests of the girls that inhabit the jail I mentioned; there is one such shot in which there are several of them lined up in a row of windows backlit with light of the magenta tone, looking uncannily like how prostitutes in the Amsterdam red-light district are advertised.But that's the film's main problem; it is sure it is sexist yet remains well shot and beautifully choreographed but it is not sure whether it is a film or a recorded stage show, indeed the jumps may be Roxie's loose psychosis flipping between real life and her imagination of her dream: to be a premiere singer but there is no evidence to suggest she is psychologically unstable and there are numbers that do not involve her. Onto those; the songs are good fun and somewhat catchy but they contain other meanings: Amos Hart (Reilly), Roxie's husband, sings about everyone looking right through him as he imitates Charlie Chaplin who of course, for the best part of his career, was inaudible due to the silent era. The symbolism of lawyer Billy Flynn (Gere) controlling the media at the press conference is put across via puppets on strings representing the journalists but this is an obvious analysis.Chicago may be a classical Hollywood musical for the contemporary era; a feat of visualisation and colour over decent character progression and interesting, realistic narrative but it works to a certain degree. Roxie may finish the film how she began it and I wonder if, by the time she's performing the big number at the end, if she even remembers the murder; the jail sentence; the manipulation of the media and the courtroom episodes because if she doesn't then she has failed and the film has been a waste of time. But despite failing as a logical and realistic picture, Chicago succeeds as a musical gone nuts; an explosion of energy and song  similarly to Moulin Rouge!, which was really a basic love triangle narrative, Chicago does nothing to big expectations except let them down.",Chicago
55,SAMTHEBESTEST,"Too much fun with great musicals and awesome choreography even after the absurd idea of crushing ethics, law & justice under the foot.",6,14 May 2021,"Chicago (2002) :
Brief Review -Too much fun with great musicals and awesome choreography even after the absurd idea of crushing ethics, law & justice under the foot. Chicago sort of reminded me of Mackiewicz's Masterpiece 'All About Eve' (1950). You know that philosophy of life that glamour and fame doesn't stop for anybody, it just keeps jumping around, yes Chicago is well focused with the same Idea. However, the vision here is completely different as it carries the narrative on two strong shoulders black comedy and musicals. To be frank, Chicago has an absurd story. Yes, it's highly degrading to law & justice and morality of human beings. Thankfully, the great musical numbers, awesome choreography and black humour works like saving bubbles for this drowning bottle. There are many things to hate in the film but like i said it's too much even after that. Two death-row murderesses develop a fierce rivalry while competing for publicity, celebrity, and a sleazy lawyer's attention. It lacks lovable characters and positive storyline and that hampers a lot when you talk about the impact. You know those Iconic musicals 'A Star Is Born', 'The Wizard Of Oz', 'Singin In The Rain', 'West Side Story', 'Sound Of Music', 'Mary Poppins' and 'Oliver' etc. All these are termed Iconics not just because they had great musicals but because they also had great stories to tell. Stories, that can reform your life in some way. Unfortunately, Chicago is nowhere near to that and even worse part is, it doesn't even try for it. Roxie's character is so hateful. A married woman having an sexual affair shots a guy just because he lied to her, seriously? She was actually more guilty than him to have fooled her husband and then even blaming him for being disloyal, lol. You kidding? Somebody would shot her 10 times for that. The same goes to her husband's character. I just didn't understand what kind of guy he was. How can you be so dumb to defend her even after knowing she was two-timing you and was never interested in you? Richard Gere's Lawyer was so much fun and so much entertainment and the same for Catherine Zeta-Jones & Queen Latifah's characters. Rob Marshall has filled Chicago with nice humour and creative dance numbers. I would have been more happy if he had not made a big joke of Law & Justice at the end. Anyways, a good attempt, and it's a crispy watch. But wait a sec man, Oscars chose this as Best Picture over Classics like 'The Pianist', 'Catch Me If You Can' and Lord Of The Rings : Two Towers'..?

56,insomniac_rod,Spectacular re-birth of musicals.,8,17 November 2008,"I'm not a big fan of Broadway musicals brought to the big screen but ""Chicago"" truly amazed me because it signified the rebirth of movie musicals.I had the pleasure to watch the Broadway play one year before the movie's release and I was totally amazed by it; and I repeat, I'm not a fan of musicals.The plot is the less important thing in these kind of movies but ""Chicago"" has a witty, funny, and sexy plot that will get your attention.But let's be honest, we watch this movie for it's musical numbers and choreography. You won't be disappointed because every single musical number is spectacular and very well done.Catherine Zeta Jones delivers a super sexy performance that will get you hooked in. Reneé Zellweger also delivers a fine performance and demonstrates her versatility. The rest of the cast is also very well.If you liked the Broadway play, you might enjoy the movie but personally I think the play is way superior.",Chicago
57,Movie_Muse_Reviews,There's still hope for the movie musical,8,31 January 2009,"So many movie musicals fail to clear the biggest hurdle of adapting a show to the big screen: they are directed by stage-minded individuals who struggle to re-imagine the work in a three-dimensional world. But not Rob Marshall. The biggest strength of ""Chicago"" is its seamless, stylish and poignant transitions that connect both the stage world of the 1920s Chicago jazz club scene along with the city's cold, corrupt and two-faced reality.Though the plot of ""Chicago"" is interesting, it's a musical first and foremost. It's all about the glitz and putting on a show, despite the plot focusing on two women that are wannabe stars stuck on death row for cold-blooded murder. It's true excellence shines through in how the musical numbers (both lyrically and visually) expand on the story or reveal greater truth to it and its characters.The marquee actors are interesting choices for a musical. Catherine Zeta-Jones pulls off her character, the shameless and brutally straightforward Velma Kelly, better than the others. Zeta-Jones really owns her part. Renee Zellweger (the protagonist, Roxie) and Richard Gere (her hot-shot attorney, Billy Flynn) both find great success with certain aspects of their characters, but don't really command the roles. Zellweger is great with the naive side of Roxie as well as her cunning, sassier side, but the serious, more dramatic elements lack a bit for her. Gere is great as the attorney whose only care is his cut, but not as much the debonair performer. Worthy of mention are also Queen Latifah taking a dramatic turn as prison warden Mama and John C. Reilly who will steal a lot of your heart with his soft, innocent performance. Though so minor, his number ""Mr. Cellophane"" will stick with you. Still, it's the lighting, the costumes, the choreography and this great interweave of numbers with scenes that dazzle in ""Chicago."" The musical numbers grow so subtly out from the scenes and the fade gently back into the story to create this effect on you and steal your breath. The musical numbers also do not depart or distance themselves entirely from the important parts of the script. Every number has something to say about a character or event. The best examples of that are the scenes revealing how much of a swindler Billy Flynn is. Since Roxie becomes his puppet, the number uses a marionette theme to show how Roxie and the press are being controlled by how he spins things. The marionette costumes and choreography turn an ordinary song, ""We Both Reached for the Gun"" into one of the best scenes. It's so good that it would have just as much success on stage as it does in the movie.Without even having to explain this concept to you, screenwriter Bill Condon and Marshall are able to clearly demonstrate that the musical numbers are either imagined by the characters or are sort of third-person artistic re-tellings of the action going on in the story. They build on this understanding by creating these incredible transitions that make the music really echo what the film says about over-dramatization of life and how the events in the film, the press conferences, the trial--it's all a big show. Rarely does a movie musical come along and not only work just in terms of moving onto the screen, but also evolve and grow in this new medium.",Chicago
58,dfranzen70,Dazzling delight,9,23 September 2003,"By this time, you've undoubtedly heard of this Broadway play-cum-Hollywood musical; otherwise, that rock you've been under must be nice and cozy. Chicago won six Oscars (including Best Picture) at this year's ceremony, and it was nominated for seven more. It's rare that a movie could be so widely praised and still not be be very good, and happily for the home viewer, that doesn't happen here, either.Chicago is the story of Roxie Hart (Rene Zellweger), a married woman on trial for killing her boyfriend. Her husband Amos (John C. Reilly) stands by her, but Roxie aspires to be more than a housewife - she wants to be a big Star like her idol, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who's also currently in stir for murder. Roxie is defended by the magnificently egotistical megalomaniac Billy Flynn, who had been Velma's lawyer, too.It's not always easy to transform a musical to the big screen. Movie audiences tend to tune out big production numbers, because our attention spans just aren't what they used to be. Also, it's harder to capture the pomp and circumstance of a big musical production in a movie than it is on a stage. On stage, your audience is rapt, captive to the sounds and smells of the entertainment afore them. On the screen, it's all visual. In addition, the grand old era of big musicals is long gone - MGM Studios had an entire division devoted to it back in the forties and fifties. But times have changed, and the audience with them.Director Rob Marshall, whose first big film this was, brought a career in choreography to the project, and he succeeded tremendously. The dramatic apexes of the movie are told in song and dance, and never for a moment does the viewer imagine he is anywhere but in the jail, the courtroom, Roxie's apartment, or wherever the scene is set. That's a testament to the wonderful camerawork, the lively and photogenic choreography, and the bravura performances turned in by the cast. Each scene is more mesmerizing than the last, and the set pieces alone are really jaw-dropping.
But aside from all that supplemental stuff, there's the cast itself. Each cast member performed his or her own singing and dancing. Zeta-Jones is a trained singer and dancer; the rest of the cast needed lessons, but it doesn't show. In particular, I was duly impressed with Zellweger's vocal range and showmanship; even Richard Gere - long on my list of Poor Actors - shone. And none in this triumphant trimuverate turned in the plum performance of the show - that would be Queen Latifah, who was herself nominated for an Oscar as Mama Morton. Of course, Latifah is an accomplished singer and has been for some time, but her work her was absolutely powerful.Recommending musicals can be treacherous work. Guys will turn up their noses or grunt (or both) and dismiss any musical as a chick flick. Don't do it, guys, don't do it. You get to see three sexy women (four, if you count the exotic Lucy Liu, one of my personal all-time favorites) oozing scandal, intrigue, and sensuality; it's not as if they're sitting around discussing the latest woman-in-peril movie on Lifetime. There's violence AND sex. Okay, the sex is way, way, way offscreen. But it's still naughty, trust me.",Chicago
59,ianlouisiana,You gotta have heart.,4,22 August 2006,"""Chicago"" certainly gives you a lot of bang for your buck,no question. If there was a prize for the loudest,least subtle,flashiest most in-your face musical of 2002 it would win it.But,and it's a very big but,it's also vulgar,crass and rather unpleasant.I felt as I watched it that the performers were browbeating me into enjoying it.Particularly the ludicrously over - praised Miss Zeta - Jones who seemed to pause before every one of her numbers as if to say ""Watch me,I'm going to do something ever so hard now"". It's like viewing all the most self-indulgent bits of ""All That Jazz"" joined together in an endless loop,Bob Fosse's hymn of praise to himself. Miss Zellwegger tries hard but she just isn't up to it,you can sometimes glimpse the desperation in her eyes.She clearly lacks the chutzpah of her co - star who would play the part of Mother Theresa if it were offered. Mr Richard Gere,staggering under the weight of his hair oil,is even more smug than usual,freely dispensing knowing grins at the camera as he cavorts with all the grace and skill of a Las Vegas chorus boy called to fill in at the last minute. All this is bad enough,I had a headache after 30 minutes,but the whole Hollywood machine,the TV pundits,the movie critics have poured so much praise on ""Chicago"" that I seriously began to doubt my own faculties. Is Mrs Douglas a hugely talented star?Am I missing something? There is no charm in ""Chicago"",no warmth or humanity and precious little wit either.It's a musical that ticks a lot of boxes - it has big names, big tunes,a budget Gordon Brown might find handy,but it doesn't have a heart.If Broadway is the hardened artery of New York this show was right at home there. There's a song in the infinitely superior ""Damn Yankees"" that sums up ""Chicago""'s shortcomings in one pithy line,""You gotta have heart"",and it doesn't.",Chicago
60,PWNYCNY,"If It Wants to, Holly wood Can Still Make a Great Musical.",10,31 July 2005,"This movie proves that if it wants to, Hollywood can still makes a great musical. In ""Chicago"" the producers of the movies utilize a cast who are essentially dramatic actors and convert them into singers and dancers ... and it works. In addition, the story is fast-paced, funny and literate and the characters are likable and enjoyable to watch. Normally Richard Gere is associated with serious dramatic roles, so I was amazed by his transformation into a song-and-dance actor who sings and dances his way through the movie, and does it as deftly as Fred Astaire. For this movie would not have succeeded if not for Mr. Gere's remarkable performance. But the movie does succeed, and one can now be assured that the Hollywood movie musical genre is not a thing of the past, but has now re-emerged after years of being dormant. Maybe this movie marks the start of a new era of Hollywood musicals. Time will tell.",Chicago
61,meeza,This is Chicago,8,31 December 2002,"`Chicago! Chicago!' My kind of movie musical. `Moulin Rouge' brought us back the illuminating power of the movie musical, now `Chicago' has reached it to its near-perfect synchronized tone.  This crime-caper musical in the Windy city will blow you away. Here are the `bears' I mean bare facts about the movie: Renee Zellweger stars as Roxie Hart, an aspiring jazz singer who is accused of a murder that resulted in her victim being `black hawk' downed. Renee's performance had me at `hello chicago'. I raise my `cub' I mean cup to Catherine Zeta-Jones' electrifying work as Velma the musical star also accused of ravaging her male prey. Richard Gere's titanic `sears tower' performance as the debonair defense lawyer is one of the most challenging ones done by an actor this year. Yes folks! Mr. Gere also sings! He also dances with `pretty women' Renee and Catherine. John C. Reilly's role as the clueless husband should convince many viewers who have no clue who Reilly is how good an actor he is.  Director Rob Marshall's `marshall plan' of adapting this broadway musical into film was well thought out. However, what I thought was the most remarkable aspect of the film was its cross-cut editing; and that is no `bull'. Chicago's editing should make the cut and receive an Oscar nomination. `Chicago' will not leave you in the cold. And `That's Chicago!' **** Good",Chicago
62,st-shot,Nothing to sing about in this musical.,5,19 November 2009,"The long awaited stage to film version Chicago provides compelling evidence that the movie musical is on life support. It is a pale imitation of Cabaret thirty years previous and is inferior in every facet. The music is less than memorable, the choreography passionless and the leads attractive but talent challenged as director Rob Marshall plays it safe, zapping the film of its sass and energy.Roxie Hart and Vilma Kelly are on trial for offing their lovers. Assessing the tabloid possibilities their lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) sets in motion a plan to exploit the situation and save his clients.Roaring Twenties Chicago should at least be able to contend with 30's Berlin (Cabaret) as backdrop for both of these musicals closely associated with Bob Fosse but Marshall is not Fosse and Chicago limps instead of strutting with confidence. The cast is more variety show guest list than film ensemble and it shows. In a role tailor made for professionally trained dancer Christopher Walken we have the more bankable, left footed Richard Gere. Judiicious editing salvages what he has to offer but at great sacrifice to the character's contribution of the film forcing more of the responsibility on the shoulder of the two female leads. Sexy and alluring as Katherine Zeta Jones is she does not have an ounce of Liza Minelli's all around talent and another pretty face won't do.In spite of its glossy production values Chicago with no catchy tunes (Quick, name one?), unspectacular choreography and out of depth cast never jells as a whole.

63,CubsandCulture,The Crown Jewel of Miramax,10,28 August 2018,"For a good 10-15 years Miramax and Pixar were the only two studios that released a quality film basically every time they released something. Sure there was a clunky now and then but Miramax was golden 99%. Their crown jewel is this stylish, biting and rousing musical that proves that everyone loves the big lie and bunkum if it is entertaining enough. The stage show was great but the decision to place the songs in Roxie's head really elevates the material. The fantasy of They Both Reach for the Gun is more truthful than the reality of the press conference. This central tension makes the satire all that more biting.Music, lights, dance, top notch production values make the visuals brash, sleek and colorful. But Marshall knows when to simplify and allow a single image to carry the point. Roxie (song) is one of the most narcissistic things imaginable and by staging it with mostly Roxie (character) as the only thing on screen makes the point but also gives your eyes a needed break. It is all very well done. Of course the acting is wonderful. I especially like Gere as Flynn because his voice has a raspy quality to it that make it feel like Flynn has done this song and dance routine just one to many times. There is a reason I've seen this film 30+ times.Lastly, Trumpianism and its tendency toward obvious lies bunkum provides this film with a maddening and depressive energy. People will buy anything if you razzle dazzle them enough. This movie is very true by being bunkum. That is yet another irony.",Chicago
64,Chris_Docker,"Slick, superficial",7,2 February 2003,"Why don't they make big scale song-and-dance movies like they used to, with stars like Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Judy Garland - and all those fantastic choreography effects with lots of mirrors and scores of swirly dancers making wonderful patterns beneath overhead cameras?One of the reasons is that there aren't any big scale song and dance stars. That, for better or worse, was obviously not going to stop Director/Choreographer Rob Marshall who, with lots of fast editing manages to produce an old-fashioned classic with modern-day razzamatazz. There are even one or two professional dancers in the film, mostly wonderfully underused and, as the film is nearly *all* song and dance, the high-calibre actors in the shape of Gere, Zellwegger and Zeta-Jones don't get much chance to display their talents to the full. Catherine Zeta-Jones is something of a saving grace though as she not only injects some realistic character portrayal into this piece of high-powered celluloid but can actually dance and sing. Theatrical mise en scene devices have transferred superbly to film, leaving the audience with more time to relax and enjoy the spectacle without having to worry about figuring out the story (which on stage can seem overly complicated). The action in this 1920s drama is mirrored and intercut with song and dance routines that dramatise those very same events. This is done so well it is almost like having the dialogue in one ear and the song version in the other. We follow the larger than life story of showbiz wanna-be (Zellwegger/Roxie) who kills her no-good bit-on-the-side and then, with the help of adoring husband, persuades fast-talking lawyer Gere to get her off the hook. Providing her with a convincing note of jealousy is an established nightclub singer, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta Jones), who has been incarcerated for bumping off her hubby. Whilst the plot lacks substance (as many stage musicals do) it makes up for it with a script that gets plenty of laughs and some dazzlingly colourful scenes.In the closing credits, the audience is reassured that 'Richard Gere's singing and dancing is performed by Richard Gere, Renée Zellweger by Renée Zellweger . . . ' etc - nice to know  and we obviously needed the reassurance - but what do the equally prominent stand-ins do then?Rob Marshall has put together some really beautiful scenes for this film, and already had the hype of a long-running and successful stage show, a great score and a sparkling adapted screenplay. Unlike the closest rivals for dance movies of recent years, such as Strictly Ballroom, he decided to place his bets on known movie stars rather than appropriate dancing talent: do enough takes and patch together the best shots with frequent editing cuts and lo and behold - even Richard Gere can tap dance like Fred Astaire! Well. . . not quite. Not by quite a long shot actually. But will audiences care? Probably not.There is not going to be another Top Hat or Easter Parade or Singing in the Rain while movies like Chicago do so well, but in piecing together the excellent elements that can be easily manufactured in today's Miramax-Weinstein bankability we at least have the pleasure of watching a decent fake.",Chicago
65,MaxBorg89,"A slick and sparkling piece of entertainment, although it occasionally loses its energy when the music stops",8,1 March 2007,"First things first: no matter what the Academy voters seem to think, Chicago is not the best film of 2002 (The Pianist is a finer picture). It is however, an interesting and quite good musical, and can be considered, alongside the fabulous Moulin Rouge!, the movie that gave life back to the genre.Like many other similar films, Chicago deals with show business, more specifically its darker aspects (something this movie's writer, Bill Condon, covered again, yet in a slightly different fashion, with Dreamgirls). At the story's center is Roxie Hart (Renée Zellweger), a struggling performer who dreams to become as famous as her idol, the sinister Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Sadly, our naive heroine blows it all by shooting her lover, having been told she'll never be a star. Her case becomes the hottest news in Chicago, as amoral lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), constantly looking for publicity, accepts to defend her. It's up to him to clear her name in court and save her marriage to the foolish Amos Hart (John C. Reilly). Things won't get easy, though, since Velma, also imprisoned, doesn't want anyone to steal the limelight from her.Given his past as a choreographer, director Rob Marshall couldn't have chosen a better subject for his debut: the musical numbers are sublime and filled with vitality. Furthermore, Marshall and Condon deserve praise for how those scenes are incorporated into the main plot: all the singing and dancing takes place in Roxie's mind, rather than popping up at random and interrupting the storyline. This narrative decision is fascinating, but it also gives the film its most significant weakness: whenever the focus is on the ""real world"", the characters tend to lose the spark they had in the singing scenes. Both Zellweger and Zeta-Jones (whose Oscar-win was an exaggeration) excel in the splendidly staged fantasy sequences, but struggle to give their roles any additional substance once they have to just talk to other people. Luckily, Gere manages to retain his energy throughout the whole film, whether he has to dance or creatively dismiss the prosecution's statements as nonsense. The film may nominally belong to the ladies, but it's Gere's smug, effortlessly irresistible performance (reminiscent of his work in Pretty Woman, but without the sentimental bit) that makes Chicago special.Overrated? Certainly, but also a charming, entertaining musical, and a must-see for Richard Gere fans.",Chicago

I enjoyed it, and am glad I saw it. Having said all this, though, I cannot imagine how it took the best picture Oscar, and I am unlikely to ever watch it again. I thought it was ""pretty good"" not ""real good"", not ""excellent"", and definitely not ""great"". Catherine Zeta-Jones was in fine voice, and danced very well, as befits her background. She was very pretty, as well, although the short haircut doesn't do her looks justice. Renee Zellweger also sang and danced very well, and also was quite fetching, although a bit too thin. I consider myself a fan of both of these women, so that's not a reason for not liking the film more. Richard Gere was adequate, and did not embarrass himself. Queen Latifah, although I'm not a fan, was pretty good in her number, and in the ""acting"" parts of the movie. I also thought the framing device, where most of the musical numbers were in Roxie's imagination, in her weird view of the world around her, was a really good idea. But the movie just failed to engage me sufficiently to live up to its reputation. I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I have liked a few quite a bit, such as ""Moulin Rouge"", ""Funny Girl"", and ""My Fair Lady.""

She shares the prison with other women killers, including Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a cabaret singer/dancer who Roxie admires. The two girls don't get on and both are relying on lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) to get them acquitted. If he fails, they will be hanged. The story is peppered with song and dance numbers.It's an OK film with mediocre (instantly forgettable) songs and average (uninteresting) dance routines. The actors do well, especially Zeta-Jones as a baddie and Gere as a publicity-seeking lawyer. I found the best part of the film to be the beginning sequence and first song sung by Zeta-Jones - ""And all that jazz"". The film just levelled out after that with nothing particularly standing out.

68,noralee,Effective Use of Non Singers and Dancers in a Cynical Musical,7,19 December 2005,"""Chicago"" uses razzle-dazzle to give us a terrific song and dance with people who can't really sing and dance (maybe the Broadway show stars like Bibi Neuwirth or even Jerry Ohrbach will get to sing the new closing song at the Oscars). But they sure know how to turn it on for the camera.Film is a different medium than theater and director/choreographer Rob Marshall does an effective tribute to the Bob Fosse both of dance and movies (he does finally stick in a dedication to Fosse and Gwen Verdon at the very end of the credits to recognize the film's provenance).Though I did fleetingly during the dance numbers long for Fosse's more syncopative moves, especially with hats and chairs, (and wondered how at least Ann Reinking would have done this choreography) the quick editing between fantasy and reality and celebrity faux reality carries the story forward, much like the carefully linked continuity in ""The Hours,"" with John C. Reilly eerily doing pretty much the same role in both movies.This mostly throws out the Astaire/Kelly principle of showing full body shots of dancers to instead show bits of body parts. There is an advantage to having real actors do the very contemporary dialog, especially when we get to see Richard Gere and Catherine Zeta-Jones oozing. So while Gere's tap dance was no competition for, say, Savion Glover, whose feet are their own language, it did whoppingly illustrate the point of the lawyer's sleazy monologue.Renee Zellwegger is intermittently effective, and I wish she'd kept the weight on from ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" which made her look like a normal person instead of painfully thin. (I want to assure Catherine Z-J who was very self-conscious during the filming of having recently had a baby that she looks healthy.)Queen Latifah does show them all up, because she can both act and really sing (evidently we have to wait for the DVD to see another number of hers that was cut). Nice to see Dominic West of ""The Wire"" on the big screen, even fleetingly as yet another ne'er do well.The principals are surrounded by gypsies who can really dance and the camera focuses on their choreography for sheer enjoyment, not to carry the story forward.Were lines that seem so post-O. J. trial in the original show? Or in the previous movies made from the same story? I did feel like doing a tap dance to cynicism while coming out of the theater.(originally written 2/23/2003)",Chicago
69,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Absolutely smashing film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical,9,21 November 2005,"CHICAGO, in my opinion, is an absolutely smashing film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical. If you ask me, Billy (Richard Gere) was a really good attorney, dancer, and singer. Despite the fact that she had no voice or dance training, Roxie (Renée Zellweger) did a very good job... especially Velma (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Mama (Queen Latifah). Amos (John C. Reilly) was good, too. I would have to choose Catherine Zeta-Jones if asked who I thought gave the best performance, though. Also, the bandleader (Taye Diggs) was a very mysterious and stylish man, even though you couldn't see him most of the time. In addition, the choreography and music were absolutely smashing. My favorite number of the movie, if I had to choose, would be either ""When You're Good To Mama"" or ""And All That Jazz."" Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this absolutely smashing film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical to any Renée Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, or Richard Gere fan who hasn't seen it. You're in for a smashing good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",Chicago
70,davispittman,And all....that.....jazzzzzz,10,7 February 2017,"This 6 time academy award winning musical including best picture truly is a spectacle. The dazzling costumes, the bright lights, the spectacular musical numbers! No one will ever be able to say that this movie adaptation of the hit Broadway play doesn't deliver on all of those things. Catherine Zeta Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, and John C. Reilly all give it their all with their performances here, especially Renee, she really blew me away here. The singing and musical numbers are fabulous and dazzling in every way, and the choreography is magnificent, it'll make you question how in the hell the actors learned to do all that. The plot is interesting enough to keep the audiences attention, especially fans of the Broadway play. Everything here is done so well, like a perfectly choreographed dance routine. Everyone really gives it their all, both on and off the screen, that is painfully obvious from watching. Films like this is why I adore cinema, when they get it so right like they do here, it just reminds you why the arts are such a treasure. I encourage everyone to watch this dazzling musical, it is hands down my favorite musical of all time!",Chicago
71,Agent10,A fresh and different film to help get through the bleak wasteland of January releases,8,28 January 2003,"Never having been one for musicals, Chicago was a rather accessible trip into the unconscious for me. The imagery, the music, the jazz and the whole lot of the film seemed to infiltrate my senses and mind. There were especially two sequences I liked in the film. (The last one is one of them, but I won't mention it). The whole singing ensemble with the reporters on strings and being controlled by Richard Gere seemed quite indicative of what the current hoarding media feeding frenzy is like these days. While this is one of the better films of the year, it will most likely get too much credit. (The Two Towers is easily the better movie). Nonetheless, this film is enjoyable and worth spending your hard earned money on.",Chicago
72,adamjohns-42575,"""He ran in to my knife!""",9,16 October 2020,"I think I could quite honestly say that this film was a catalyst to my desire to be in musicals. I would love to be Velma or Roxie if I could, but unfortunately I was born to play Mr Cellophane. The amount of times I've been called Andy or Aden or anything but my name are uncountable.As I can't play the parts I want, it is at least great to see Renée and Catherine doing such a good job in the roles. Hasn't Mariette come a long way since The Darling Buds of May and what a transformation. I was truly impressed by her abilities that I feel had been relatively unseen until this film. I do worry about Renée though with her changes of weight that she constantly has, to play the parts she gets, they should just let Bridget Jones have a successful diet in the next one.
I think John C Reilly does a good job too, but I don't like Richard Gere in this role. He's fine when he's just acting, but I personally find his dancing and singing a bit cringey and he looks uncomfortable at times. I'm also not a huge fan of Queen Latifah, but she's not in it enough to worry about. Lucy Liu however is superb in the few minutes she is seen on screen, but I do have a bit of a crush on her.I like the artistic, almost painted, filter they have used and the soundtrack, already brilliant, is accentuated with a superb collection of backing tracks and underscoring. The one bit about this film that makes me slightly nauseous is the Hunyak's big moment.Songs like ""He Had It Comin'"", ""Roxie"" and Nowadays must surely have inspired so many dancers and stage performers. Watching it again tonight really makes me want to sign up for a dance class, because I would just love to have the ability and energy to give it All That Jazz!",Chicago
73,rbverhoef,It is back...,8,24 February 2003,"After Moulin Rouge! did a very fine job last year we get Chicago this year. I liked Moulin Rouge! better but I think Chicago is just as good. Again we have a very simple story brought in a beautiful package.With nice songs, beautiful settings and costumes, a great fast editing and a nice cinematography together with a well performed choreography (which reminds us a lot of the style of Bob Fosse) all under a pretty good direction by Rob Marshall this movie plays like a fun amusement park-attraction. After you have done it, you want to go again.Renée Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly all do their own singing. Zellweger is Roxie Hart, the woman who has all the musical parts played in her head. She killed her lover and was send to prison. Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) killed her sister who was having an affair with her husband a month earlier and was also send there. They both are represented by Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), the best lawyer in Chicago. Because he plays the media so well the killer women are heroes. Slowly Roxie starts to be a bigger hero than her big example Velma.Zellweger, Zeta-Jones and Gere are great in their roles. They sing, they dance, they act, it looks great. I liked the puppeteer-scene, where Roxie still played by Zellweger is a doll. She talks and moves like she is controlled by Gere. It is a great scene. Queen Latifah (as the warden of the prison) and John C. Reilly (as Roxie's husband) are very good as well. For a good and fast film, with some nice singing and dancing and very strong performances by all the leads this is your film.",Chicago

75,vertigo_14,"Thank you sir, may I have another?",10,21 April 2004,"After much delay, Chicago finally made it to the big screen. I thought with this, and the previous year's released of 'Moulin Rouge,' musicals were on their way to a cinematic revival. But I haven't seen much else to validate that theory.Chicago was really quite a fantastic production. Some of the problems with trying to get it to the big screen before had to do with how they were going to turn a play into a movie. With Chicago, they were able to strike a balance between both, alternating between the feeling of watching a movie and that of feeling like you're actually watching a major Broadway Production. Full of wild jazz numbers, a great score, and lots of dancing, it's a great picture.Based on a true story is the tale of murdering beauties who try to sweet talk their way out of guilty verdicts. Most of them being superstar entertainers, they hire Billy Flynn (Gere), a smooth talking lawyer to tweak the case and play the jury to get his girls off. At the center of the story is Roxie Heart (Rene Zellweger), aspiring for great stardom but achieving nothing but mediocrity. She's new to Murderer's Row, wherein resides her adversary, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a washed up superstar who has to fight with Roxie and stir up some controversy to get herself in the papers again. They all want to be famous, and with the public, always inviting a good show with plenty of juicy gossip, the girls will do anything they can to get famous and buy themselves some sympathy, their ticket out of jail and back on stage.Everyone did a fantastic job in this rich, catchy picture that was put together so well. It is definitely worth seeing if you haven't already.",Chicago

77,triple8,Beyond amazing-and all that jazz....,10,14 September 2003,"I had already written a review of this awhile ago(long since buried under many other reviews) but wanted to comment again because I was reading all the bad reviews and just couldn't believe it. Chicago is a masterpiece. Even if one doesn't like musicals or this is a type of film that doesn't appeal to them I don't see how anyone could argue on the direction and acting of this film. The fact is, there are not that many musicals that are worthy of winning an Oscar and this one was and did. It was amazingly put together from start to finish. I can see someone who doesn't like musicals maybe not liking the movie but if one just watches the movie objectively I can't see how the Dynamic dancing, singing, acting wouldn't overwhelm even the biggest skeptic. The movie managed to create a similar atmosphere to watching a Broadway show-it's really unbelievable because this movie so easily could have been awful.Absolutely every musical number was good-most being great. There are no flaws to this movie and it was done as a movie in such a wonderfully creative way. Chicago deserves to be up in the IMDb top 250 easily.Chicago the play, comes alive on screen as a movie, and one feels so Alive watching it. It's mood is infectious, and the dance numbers are so good, you don't want them to end. I think Chicago was deserving of every award it got and is easily a 10 of 10. Richard Gere was robbed-should have been nominated in the best actor category. EVERYONE was just amazing. I've seen this movie 4 times now and each time love it more. I can't even imagine seeing it now on Broadway, Roxie in my mind will forever be associated with Renee Zelwegger. 10 of 10 for the movie and all the actors/actresses!",Chicago
78,Spleen,Stunning; the first really good musical in a decade,8,7 June 2003,"""Chicago"" is the first film in eleven or ten years thoroughly determined to be a full-blooded musical (the previous one was ""Beauty and the Beast"", or just possibly ""Aladdin""), and, if there have been others, is almost certainly the best. Forget ""Moulin Rouge"". That film was terrified by the very idea of being a musical. It couldn't introduce a song without being seen to quote it rather than sing it, and would cut the song short, relieved to have it over and done with, at the soonest possible moment. But ""Chicago"" REALLY launches into its production numbers. Its songs are full-throated and lusty. (As far as the music goes, and the wit and sparkle of the lyrics, Kander and Ebb wrote far better songs for ""Chicago"" than for ""Cabaret"".) They've been staged with dazzling style.Yes, a pity about the editing. But whereas the rapid-fire editing of ""Moulin Rouge"" as good as put a bullet through that film's heart, the rapid-fire - and it's not really ""rapid-fire"", it's just that there's too much of it - editing of ""Chicago"" does only minimal harm. Don't get me wrong: it's unquestionably a bad thing. The sudden shifts, bang on the downbeat, from the subtler colour schemes of the everyday Chicago to the block reds and misty blues of the stage Chicago, don't have nearly the impact they'd have if they weren't occurring every other minute; and Marshall's stark and striking shots are never held long enough to get the most out of them. A good thing the next image is never a disgrace on the previous one. A good thing that every other aspect of the production is so rock-solid to begin with.It's absurd that Martin Walsh won an Oscar for such overdone to-ing an fro-ing. Some critics (Roger Ebert is one) suggest that the award was justfied on the grounds that Walsh's editing skillfully hides the defects of inferior performers, but I don't buy this. I'm convinced, for instance, that Catherine Zeta-Jones is NOT an inferior performer, that she doesn't NEED patchwork-quilt editing in order to look good; if she does, then Walsh has indeed performed a miracle, but not one he should be congratulated for in polite society. As for Richard Gere, I again don't see the need for him to appear to be better than he is. There's nothing wrong with his voice and he doesn't have to dance much HIMSELF. He's the kind who gets other people to dance for him. In the song ""Razzle Dazzle 'Em"" he actually sings as much: ""As long as you keep 'em way off balance, How can they spot you got no talents?"" Billy Flynn OUGHT to be a mediocre song-and-dance artist, who relies on glitter, lights and inspired staging - but certainly NOT on deceptive editing. In that song we need to see what's going on. We also need the suggestion that Flynn fools people who on some level willingly allow themselves to be fooled. In fact, we do see all this anyway, which is why the overly frenetic editing fails to do any real damage.The story of ""Chicago"" is at once deeply moral and deliciously amoral. The two go together. Amorality depends for its zest on our sense of the pull of true morality: our sense that our heroes and heroines really do do the wrong thing now and then, and that no false excuses are being made on their behalf.",Chicago
79,Sherazade,Nice!,8,21 April 2006,"Catherine Zeta Jones, Renee Zellwegger, Queen Latifah, Richard Gere, Taye Diggs and others star in this musical Broadway favourite about two women who murder their cheating men. Zeta Jones is the singing Dah-ling, already a star and Zellwegger is the starry eyed Roxy Hart who wants to be her. There's not much to do with the script, in fact it bored me. The real seller in Chicago is the fancy footwork and song/dance. All the stars do their own singing, dancing and acting, very rare for any cinema these days. The film was nominated for many awards and even won Zeta Jones an Oscar, not to mention the uncountable street credit everyone associated with this movie got for such an audacious piece.",Chicago
80,rosscinema,"Terrific film, Zellweger stands out!",8,3 March 2003,"Rob Marshall does a terrific job of bringing this story to the big screen and the overall look of the film is impressive with the set designs to make it look like old Chicago but the real impressive thing about this fun and lively film are the performances, especially Renee Zellweger. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere and Zellweger all do they're own dancing and singing and its impossible not to appreciate real talent on screen when you see it. I'm a firm believer that we live in a day and age of incredible mediocrity and while there are a number of mega talented performers in films its a real rarity to actually see them demonstrate this in a film. While both Zeta-Jones and Gere had some sort of early training in song and dance, Zellweger had none! And she's arguably the most impressive performer in the film! She's just terrific and you have to wonder if they're is anything she cannot do as an actress. She's amazing to watch. The supporting cast is equally fine with John C. Reilly and Queen Latifah. And while I'm not a fan of hers I do think its a good role for Queen Latifah and she is very good in the film but she really didn't deserve an Oscar nod. This film is so fun and enjoyable to watch that you don't have to be a fan of musicals to enjoy this one. I'll be shocked if it doesn't win Best Picture.",Chicago

I like how during certain sequenses the actual sets will be replaced by stages. It gives the movie even more of a unique style. This movie isn't perfect, but is is extremely entertaining and I would highly recommend it.",Chicago
82,nycritic,A Dazzling Film About Lurid Murders and the Hypocrisy of Justice,10,5 November 2005,"Unless you've been exiled to the Patagonia for the past twenty years, then maybe you might not know the premise of Rob Marshall's perfect rendition of Bob Fosse's CHICAGO which depicts the lurid events surrounding a pair of murderesses, their shady lawyer, and the media circus which ensues.Kept on hold for years and going through a revolving door of directors and actors slated to play the leads and supporting players, and benefiting from the smash success of Baz Luhrmann's MOULIN ROUGE!, CHICAGO manages to virtually re-invent and resuscitate the musical to its fullest. Featuring dazzling visuals and musical numbers which segue seamlessly from scene to scene as it delves into Roxie Hart's vivid inner dialogue (with some exceptions, such as Velma Kelly's rendition of ""I Can't Do it Alone"" or Mama Morton's ""When You're Good to Mama""), Rob Marshall breaks down the walls which in other way would have made the story less mobile.CHICAGO tells the story of Roxie Hart, a vague young thing married to a colorless man, Amos Hart (John C. Reilly), but carrying on with a low-life Fred Caseley (Dominic West) who's made more promises than he can keep. She shoots him dead, and is thrown in jail where she meets Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a vaudeville star who's also in for the murder of her sister and lover, whom she found in bed together. The rousing musical number, ""Cell Block Tango"" is the show-stopper here, where Velma and five other inmates tell their story of how they arrived in jail. It is visually stunning, with each of the women using blood-red scarves which they use to describe their murders, and the dancers are in top form, sexy, ferocious, and dangerous -- pure Fosse material.Into the story comes Matron 'Mama' Morton (Queen Latifah) who hooks Velma up with Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), the hot lawyer who takes on her case. Roxie, seeing she is down on her luck, has Amos hire Flynn, and he turns her story into the thing of tabloid fodder: soon everyone is following Roxie's move down to her hairstyle, and this of course causes Velma to go into a fit of jealousy since the spotlight has been taken away from her.When seeing CHICAGO, it's not hard to compare it with the real-life circus shows that the trials of Michael Jackson and O.J. Simpson have become. The climactic court scene in which Billy Flynn literally tap-dances his audience into exonerating Roxie despite the obvious evidence as showgirls pirouette over the bumbling witnesses is one that blurs the lines of reality with fiction, and the rapid editing sparkles in sheer brilliance. People don't want to hear the true story even though they may say so; to see Roxie as the innocent waif and Velma as the glamorous star is all they want as expressed by the movie's conclusion. Killers become media darlings and use up their fifteen minutes of fame -- that is, until then next lurid murder.Fantastic performances are all over this film. Catherine Zeta-Jones brings forth the energy of a very young Joan Crawford who made a number of dance-oriented films early in her career. Richard Gere, ignored at Oscar time, stands out in his smarmy part and proves his capacity for dance and song, especially in his ""We Both Reached For the Gun"" number with Christine Baranski playing Mary Sunshine. Renee Zellweger reveals a vulnerable persona as Roxie Hart and comes across a little Marilyn Monroe, a little Ginger Rogers, and totally breathless, as in her two beautiful numbers ""Funny Honey"" and ""Roxie"". We don't expect her to sing well -- she's a wannabe star. Queen Latifah smolders as 'Mama,' so much that I wanted more of her. She reminded me of Sophie Tucker (whom the film mentions), all brass, tough, and sexy, and a less self-conscious Mae West. Her ""When You're Good to Mama' is a more subtle take from Mary McCarty's growling number which made every line a symbol of double entendre. John C. Reilly plays the sap affectionately, and what a number he has! ""Mr. Cellophane"" is the saddest song ever, which he performs as the clown he has become. All in all, Rob Marshall has created a powerful, lurid film, made darker due to much of its subject matter but treated as if it were SINGING IN THE RAIN, full of instant classic sequences, and ending in a full applause.",Chicago
83,Rob_Taylor,My kind of film.....Chicago ain't!,3,8 November 2003,"Which sums up this movie. Lots of wind and not a lot of sunshine.Musicals must have energy to survive. They must draw you into the story, make you want to sing along. Chicago does none of these things. It's not awful, but it just doesn't grab you and shake you. Instead, you begin to wonder when it will all be over and whether you can sneak out for a break without anyone noticing.In short, its dull. The cast give good performances, but the story just isn't that good. The musical numbers are OK, but not spectacular. Everything is just average.Musicals, more so than any other genre of film, should have a high re-watchability. Frankly, I don't think Chicago will see me re-watching it for a very long time, if at all.Not good.",Chicago

Now Roxie tries to get the best lawyer in town, Billy Flynn, to plead her not guilty of what she has done.This is probably the best musical so far, that I've seen. It's better than Rent, which I thought was amazing. The film is upbeat and very fast paced with great songs!The performance by Renée Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere, John C.

85,LeonardKniffel,"Music, Murder, and Debauchery",7,3 May 2020,"Employing every cliché ever uttered about Chicago and its 1930s gangster scene, Chicago nevertheless manages to be an entertaining musical---if you like your musicals mixed with murder and debauchery. Catherine Zeta-Jones really delivers the title song, but the musical highlight for me has always been Queen Latifah singing ""When You're Good to Mama"" with lesbian inference. She's got the best voice in the film. ""He Had It Coming"" and ""All I Care About"" are also showstoppers, and Richard Gere and Rene Zellweger pull off a couple of their best performances.",Chicago

You have probably read about how brilliant the cutting is and how it makes Zeta-Jones, Zellweger and Gere look professional. They sure do.This plot is among the simpliest one has seen and that's part of the concept. It's just an excuse for the acts. It's although entertaining all the time, but with a little too many glimpses towards the Academy Award jury. Well, the glimpses seem to have been enough.",Chicago
87,valadas,Great musical,7,3 April 2003,"This is really two movies in one: the musical and the story. The first is excellent, the best I've seen over the last years. The second not so much though not exactly bad; it's however a somewhat ordinary story of tragedy and harshness, hypocrisy and deceitfulness. We can say that that it's the story that provides the musical with the plot and not the latter that limits itself to illustrate the former. But returning to the musical which is really the most important feature of the movie, the numbers are remarkable, some of them even breathtaking like the puppet (marionetta) one for instance. The music, inspired in the old Chicago style jazz of the twenties and thirties is really beautiful and the choreography, predominantly feminine, is of an explosive sensuality without sinking into cheap or vulgar eroticism. The 2 above referred movies combine themselves very well in a counterpoint of successive images very well achieved with mutual enhancement. The acting is good without being exceptional and matches the quality standard of the movie. In my opinion, however, Catherine Zeta-Jones is better than Renee Zellweger in terms of personality, presence and expression in the musical numbers. This is a movie not to be missed, by all means.",Chicago

This has everything you could expect from a Harvey Weinstein movie, bosoms, bums, boobs and brainless glorification of sleazy murderesses. All done in a grotty, sensationalistic burlesque style - complete with a black lesbian prison boss! Some shots looked like the editor threw the footage in the air then randomly cut it together. Now add a bunch of songs with the majority that can't be hummed, whistled, or remembered and voila! you've got an Oscar-worthy mega-hit, what else.Yes, a few of the stars do some interesting slick star turns but only between, or after, much stomach-churning, frenetic ugliness has turned your head into a pit of aching mulch. If you haven't felt like throwing up by the halfway point, then you deserve this movie! Or, if you liked Fosse's sleazy ""All that Jazz"" you could also get sucked in by this mess.

89,DeeNine-2,Entertainment with an edge,8,26 February 2005,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)This is a musical in the tradition of musicals that are entertaining and easy to digest, and yet some hours later leave one with some apprehension. Is it really the intent of the story to celebrate getting away with murder? Or is this movie a statement about how murder by women in emotionally trying circumstances can be justified? Or perhaps is this an indictment of the criminal justice system? Or is this just a spicy entertainment? I'll opt for the latter; however I can tell you that women will find this more agreeable than their spouses. There is a kind of historically revisionist feeling to the sentiments expressed. I seriously doubt that this production, in which murder from jealousy is seemingly justified, would have been produced as a musical comedy before the modern era.But never mind. What makes Bob Fosse's Chicago a hit (and the Academy's Best Picture of 2002) are the beautifully staged and choreographed song and dance numbers, the spiffy direction and neat editing, a lot of leggy flesh along with some fine performances by Queen Latifah, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger.In particular I liked Queen Latifah's performance. When she comes on singing ""When You're Good to Momma"" she just about brings the house down. I also liked her portrayal of the savvy and corrupt Boss Lady on Murderess Row. Zeta-Jones got the Oscar for best Supporting Actress, and she was good, but I think Latifah, who was also nominated, was just as impressive if not more so.Zellweger, looking almost anorectic compared to the last time I saw her in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001)--released only the year before--gives a solid performance in a very demanding role, although to be honest, it appeared that she was doing a lot of lipsyncing. Still one is amazed at how good she and Zeta-Jones were at the old song and dance, not having been previous known for being twinkled-toed.You might want to see this to compare how it stands up to a long line of filmland musicals, such as Oklahoma, South Pacific, Jesus Christ Superstar, The Phantom of the Opera, etc. Chicago certainly is well within the confines of that venerable traditional, although it is my feeling, that despite the Academy's favor, this is just a notch below the best.",Chicago
90,wisewebwoman,I waited a few days after seeing this movie,7,3 March 2003,"Before writing about it. And I still feel the same.  It went too flat too quickly.  There were many elements to dislike in the movie, the editing for one, I kept thinking there were body doubles doing the somersaults for Catherine and for Renee, too much quick intercutting. And Richard Gere, I thought the man was going to die of embarrassment when he had to tap or sing. I was right there with him feeling a squirm coming on. Now I have read all the raves and I am surprised. I feel like I am the only one in the world to feel this disappointment. The hype was so great everywhere, but I still feel like someone put something over on me, I was tricked. Now all that said, the highlights for me were John C. Reilly and ""Cellophane Man"", an absolute knockout and Queen Latifah when she sang and danced (again heavily edited), not when she tried to act like the matron, because again, I sensed her embarrassment. A standout scene also are the six women singing and dancing in the jail cells. 7 out of 10. I might have missed something.",Chicago
91,KUAlum26,The Return of the Musical,9,19 January 2006,"Director Rob Marshall's film treatment of the revived Broadway hit ""Chicago"" may not have seemed like anything ALL that revolutionary to audiences familiar with the musicals of the '30s,40s,50s and 60s,but to audiences born and familiarized with movies from 1970 onward,this film is something of an epiphany.To be sure,2001's ""Moulin Rouge"" beat this movie to the punch in reviving the public's interest in musicals set to film,but while Moulin was somewhat of an original musical dramedy experiment,rife with pop music standards that are re-adapted to fit the sound and look of early twentieth century Europe,Chicago is actually a stage musical that is lifted to fill the screen,song for song,line for line. The story of star-struck,bored housewife Roxie HArt(Renee Zellweger,very fine) who kills her lover because she discovers that he not only isn't going to make her a star but is in fact just using her. When she ends up in prison,she meets an assortment of wronged ladies and a corrupt,masterful warden(Queen Latifah,also quite good here) and discovers her story isn't so unusual. Then she runs into her idol,Velma Kelly(CAtherine Zeta-JOnes,agile and adroit),and discovers that she,actually CAN become that celebrity she's always wanted,namely by stealing the services of the popular,slick and handsome defense attorney Billy Flynn(Richard Gere,better than I expected). Flynn's trial tactics turn her crime into something that is--surprise!--a showcase and a spectacle.Brilliant musical numbers,a spare set that makes for a very ""staged""feel and strong support from(among others)John C.Reilly as Roxie's sad-sack husband and CHristine Baranski as a 20s type gossip reporter,enhance something that can be as fun to watch on screen as it is on stage(And I've done both). For the most part,I feel like the Oscars this film received were well-worth it,but it will probably more worth the rent or watch on BrAVO! if you can appreciate stage musicals being given the ""Hollywood"" treatment,so to speak.",Chicago
92,RNMorton,Huh?,7,12 December 2003,"Beyond overblown, surreal musical about flappers in prison in old Chicago. And by musical I mean the real thing, like somebody gets asked a question and they stand up and start singing their answer.  Renee Z always gives 100% and Catherine Z is coldly stunning, but this just is not my cup of tea.  Was Warren Beatty connected with this movie?",Chicago
93,bobsgrock,Flashy and entertaining.,8,1 April 2008,"With a high-energy feel and enough stars to light up Broadway, Chicago triumphs as one of the best transitions from the stage to the screen. Indeed, with the way the musical is set up, it would seem rather difficult to put it to celluloid, but director Rob Marshall does a good job of using the musical numbers as imagination numbers for the wanna-be star heroine, Roxie Hart. Of course, the key to all of this is the acting, and it is terrific. Renee Zellwegger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Richard Gere are perfect as their respective roles. Of all though, Zellwegger is the best. Her ability to be seductive and sexy in one number, than sweet and innocent in another amazes me of her capabilities as an actress. Gere also surprised me at how smooth and in control he was as the fast-talking, slick criminal lawyer Billy Flynn. Zeta-Jones is also very entertaining, but I felt she needed more screen time to prove herself. The minor characters are very good as well, with Queen Latifah, John C. Reilly, and others giving great performances. The narration may steer off every now and then, but it works well enough that this is definitely one of the best films of 2002 and certainly one of the better movie musicals ever made.",Chicago
94,lambiepie-2,"I saw the original on Broadway, the revival and now this. Time has its advantages.",7,27 December 2002,"Since I've seen the original stage version of Chicago on Broadway back in 1975, this movie version had much to live up to for me, and just didn't cut it. Chicago has a great ""book"" (story)--crimes of passion and the subsequent usage of them to bring on 'fame'. This movie version is wonderful to look and the actors act well. For me, its a let down of sorts to see this version get so much acclaim when it's only an echo of what it was. I don't know if anyone really looked at the actors dancing in the numbers, because although they are FILMED nicely, they never actually show the FEET of the dancers - very quick cut aways and more on the poses of the actors during the numbers. Zeta-Jones, Zellwigger and Gere acted well, but the three of them could not perform this show on stage. Which is why it's a movie and a good movie with good actors. Not as sinfully horrid as the film version of ""A Chorus Line"", but not as spectacular as the reviewers are making you believe.
It's decent entertainment, but I do miss the genius of Fosse. Those who don't know of Fosse's work with Chicago and have never seen it will never miss it; so it will never become a consideration of liking or hating this film. But don't let entertainment reviewers and Award designations fool you, the 'Fosse experience' is just not there in this film. It's just a nice, colorful and well acted film version of a great Broadway musical.",Chicago

The movie lives up to every stereotype imaginable, jumping from one over produced, over-the-top sing/dance scene to another in a breathless, yet highly boring, two hour musical marathon.Why is it that movies in this genre often feel the need to be so garish and brash?

Alas poor urich..  oops wrong show.The first half hour is a horrible bore.  Trying to draw us in with big boobs and pretty things.  Sure I'm a guy but the movie was trying to hard.  Renee certainly doesn't help matters by her inability to sound convincing. Catherine Zeta Jones I had assumed had a big role from the look of things during the Oscars.  She was far better than Renee and was very convincing in her role.  But Richard Gere was king here.  He seemed natural to the character he plays.  I was simply left stunned.  The movie would have never made it without him.  I see Richard in new light from now on.  Hope to see more Gere movies like Chicago.  Great going gere.  I am disappointed with the ending.

98,brchthethird,Quite a spectacular musical...and all that jazz,10,29 March 2015,"Even though I don't watch too many musicals, I've ended up liking the handful I've seen. That trend continues with CHICAGO, which is possibly the best modern musical I've seen (to differentiate it from classic Hollywood musicals of the 1950's-1960's). Since it's been out for over 10 years, most people probably know the basic plot. Set in 1920's Chicago, it's about a woman who murders her lover, gets sent to prison and uses the publicity to become a tabloid sensation and star. Everything about the film is just spectacular, from the sets and costumes, the musical numbers, to the singing and performances. Who knew that Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere could sing and dance so well? The film also has some great (if a little on-the-nose) commentary about corruption in the justice system and opportunists who are just out for their 15 minutes of fame. Richard Gere was perfect as the slimy lawyer who always gets his clients off...as long as he gets paid. Catherine Zeta-Jones was also good as a jazz sensation whose better days are behind her, and Renee Zellweger provided nice counterpoint as an ingénue looking to break into the biz. Even the way the film is constructed was pretty innovative. All of the musical numbers take place in the minds of the characters (except for the opening and closing numbers) so that the basic plot can maintain a sense of realism. There was also a kinetic energy in the way the musical numbers were filmed and edited that made them really pop off the screen. Overall, with some classic Kander/Ebb tunes, great performances and pointed commentary on fame and the justice system, CHICAGO is a film I can see myself returning to again and again.",Chicago
99,mentalcritic,The people who voted 10 obviously haven't seen the stage show...,1,30 March 2003,"Chicago, like any film that is adapted from a stage musical, faced many challenges. Like Grease, to name one well-known example, it had to integrate musical numbers with story and dialogue in a way that makes sense to a film audience without getting too slow. Both of these stage musicals had the luxury of an intermission, however, something that more films could do with in order to fit more story.One thing that Grease had in its film version that Chicago lacks is, to put it simply, a soul. Another essential ingredient Grease has that is missing here is a sense of fun - something that should never, in a million years, be omitted from any production of Chicago. However, Zellweger, Zeta-Jones, and Gere look so uncomfortable in their roles it is more like watching them trying to pass a gold anvil than a fun, humourous display of minor sexual appeal that I remember very well from the stage show.Another strike against the film is that the three top-billed stars are totally and utterly wrong for their parts. Richard Gere is a terrible Billy Flynn, especially considering that he is at least two decades too old for the part. Catherine Zeta-Jones is a competent vocalist, but her dancing ability is questionable at best. Renée Zellweger can't act her way out of a paper bag. After seeing an actor who probably makes less than a 1000th of what Zellweger makes in the part, I am utterly disgusted with both Hollywood and the Academy. The Oscars have truly sunk to being nothing more than an advertising gimmick.The only person who walks out of this mess with a shred of credibility is Lucy Liu, who gets to give her martial arts abilities a very minor workout in her arrest scene, playing the immortal Kitty Baxter. This is the only time the film adds something that the stage play could have done with (but then, it's very difficult to convince any male actor to do these kind of scenes on the stage). Unfortunately, her role is cut down so far that it's hard to connect her with the rest of the story, a major faux pas considering that this character and her story is an essential ingredient in the story's ending. Oh, and don't get me started on Queen Latifah as Matron Morton. This is a miscasting exceeded only by Winona Ryder in Alien Resurrection.So all in all, I am giving Chicago a 1 out of ten because it will be responsible for a whole plethora of people thinking that this is a fair representation of the musical without ever having seen the real thing, to quote Russell Morrison. And, like missing out on the recent Lord Of The Rings films or never seeing a symphony orchestra perform the Star Wars scores in the flesh, that is a minor film-related tragedy that nobody with the required levels of intelligence or literacy to appreciate a real translation of a musical to film should abide.",Chicago
100,gftbiloxi,As Big As Any Gangland Hit,9,18 April 2005,"Renowned for his complex choreography and innovative staging, director-choreographer Bob Fosse was well known for his ability to impose tremendous style on even the slightest of material--and that is precisely what he did when John Kander and Fred Ebb presented him with their follow up to Broadway smash CABARET. After considerable script work, the story of two 1920s jailhouse divas emerged on the stage as CHICAGO, a remarkably dark and visually witty commentary on lust, corruption, and fame at any price. And although Fosse, who has been dead a decade or more, had nothing to do with the screen version with CHICAGO, this big screen show is so completely in his style that it is difficult to believe director Rob Marshall wasn't doing a bit of spiritual channeling when he put it together.This one of those rare screen versions that doesn't pull the teeth of the original material: on screen, CHICAGO is every bit as dark and bitter as it was on stage, and if you're expecting a boy-meets-girl, bursts-into-song musical you're in for a rude awakening. Singer-dancer Velma Kelly (Catherine Zita-Jones) has become the queen of Chicago's tabloids by offing her faithless husband and perfidious sister; sitting on death row, she's busy enjoying the press and planning to parlay the attention into a big time vaudeville act--but she's suddenly rolled for the throne by show-biz wannabe Roxie Hart (Rene Zellweger), who captures press attention when she bumps off her lover and is then caught trying to coax her husband into taking the wrap. And with fame, fortune, and beating the wrap high priorities, the two slither, snarl, and play games of one-upmanship right into the courtroom under the sponsorship of their equally corrupt lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere.) It's an arena in which truth counts for nothing and the innocent hang; only hardness, a total lack of integrity, and an implausible lie will get you by.The cast is simply amazing. Both Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere come from stage backgrounds, but neither have shown their song-and-dance skills on the big screen until now--and they give every indication of having the time of their lives, tossing off everything from meticulous time steps to classic Fosse-esquire squirming choreography, and singing the complicated songs extremely well indeed. And they are very nearly upstaged by Queen Latifa as the wanton prison matron and John C. Reilly as Roxie's dim husband. And then there is Rene Zellweger as Roxie Hart. Frankly, the late great Gwen Verdon, who originated the role on Broadway, is a tough act to follow--but Zellweger sidesteps the trap of merely repeating Verdon's memorable interpretation and creates her own take on the half-naive, half-rapacious jazz baby from hell. And when all is said and done, she makes Roxie Hart her own.Although some songs from the stage version have been dropped, the best survive, and the company tears strips off them, all the way from the opening ""All That Jazz"" to the finishing ""Nowadays."" And everywhere the Fosse touch is very much in evidence: surrealistic concepts of space and time, slinky and half-naked dancers, wicked wit, and a sexy sneer are the order of the day. The cinematography is also quite fine, using elements of rapid-fire editing seen in MOULIN ROUGE but without the same ""beat you to death"" quality that film had. The result is dark, glittering, and remarkably sly in its mix of too-accurate social commentary and classic music elements. And this is one of the few recent musicals that I think will stand the test of time. Strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Chicago
101,Stampsfightclub,Well acted but inconsistent musical,7,12 September 2008,"Renee Zellweger (Cold Mountain) stars as Roxie Hart, a woman who has always dreamed of being in the spotlight and when she murders a man; she is sent to Death Row and seeks the help of lawyer Billy Flynn to get her out of trouble and into the spotlight.Winner of 6 Oscars including Best Picture, Chicago is one of the noughties most recognized musicals, filled with plenty of entertainment, catchy songs and strong performances, if not the best written plot.Zellweger gives a good performance as attention seeking Hart, filled with exquisite dancing and acting. Her character is exceptionally annoying all the way through, so unbelievably stubborn and self-centred, and can be frustrating to watch.It is the support cast who the plaudits most go to. Zeta Jones (The Mask of Zorro) won an Oscar for her supporting role as Velma Kelly, another performer on Death Row seeking the spotlight, and is the best character of the film, filled with class and sophistication she is a joy to watch. John C Riley (The Aviator) delivers on acting and singing levels too with an Oscar nominated performance.The plot is very inconsistent, with plenty of lapses and too many songs filling unnecessary points during the film. The dialogue is quirky and enough to make up for these lapses, as is the catchy tunes including the brilliant All That Jazz.The film is mostly set in Death Row, but ironically we do not see much of the dealings or hardship happening, not a true reflection of prison life. Watch out for a few comparisons to other films, including Latifah' s character resembling a female Red from Shawshank Redemption, her performance helps emulate something of a hard prison life, but otherwise prison life is portrayed as being simple and easy.Costume design and settings are well established, as is the brilliant lighting which goes a long way in plenty of the songs, including Roxie's vision of her own show, and all the women explaining why they're in prison.The plot is leading up to a big trial and when it gets there it is major disappointment. As it begins, Richard Gere's impressive tap dancing sequence plays in the background, but it completely ruins the moment of the trial and will give viewers a headache, an awful disappointing climax to an enjoyable well acted musical drama.",Chicago
102,gbheron,A Smash Musical,10,1 August 2003,"Totally deserving its best picture Oscar, Chicago demonstrates that the musical is not dead. Not by a long shot. You could argue the Moulin Rouge proved that point just last year, but I consider that one a near miss; the editing gave me a headache. Chicago is spot on; the acting, singing, dancing, direction, timing, lighting; you name it, it couldn't be improved upon. This is what a musical film should aspire to. I guess most do, but few hit the mark as squarely as Chicago.",Chicago
103,KnightsofNi11,High quality musical,7,30 June 2011,"There's a certain razzle dazzle effect that musicals can have on you. They have the ability to transport you to a whole new world, but not in the way that sci-fi or fantasy does. They transport you to the unique and fantastical world of song and dance. A world that exists only in our imaginations and on the stage. Chicago captures this quality excellently, creating an incredibly imaginative musical that transports us to the most glamorous portrayal of 1920's Chicago ever seen before. Chicago's got life, pizzaz, finesse, and all that jazz.What's funny honey is that I'm not a huge musical fan but I legitimately enjoyed Chicago. It's not a film I can fall in love with because I'm not one to fall in love with a musical, but I can definitely respect it for it's class and excellent construction. The film is about Roxie Hart who dreams of a life on the stage. She thinks she's going to get that through the man she is having an affair with, but when she finds out he's lying she murders him and gets thrown in prison. To represent her in court she employs the suave Billy Flinn who has never lost a case with a female client. And so in order to win Roxie's case he turns her into a star, giving her copious amounts of publicity and creating a fake background for her and an alibi that boasts: we both reached for the gun.Normally, all I care about is a good story. The storyline in Chicago isn't bad at all, in fact it is a lot of fun, but what really matters in Chicago is the music, and the movie knows this. It is all the glam of glitz of show business conveyed through some truly great songs. All the music in this film is catchy. There are a few numbers I didn't care for but then other numbers that are done so well and so creatively. There is some excellent camera work that adds plenty of glamour to the film and makes it all the more engaging. Probably the most creative thing about the entire film is the way some of the songs are pulled off. A lot of the film takes place in a prison with a very monotone color scheme. The scenery is very flat, making it a very bad match for vivacious musical numbers. To combat this each song that takes place in the prison is juxtaposed with the song taking place on a stage. This adds a whole new life to each song and makes for some excellent visual wonders. This is arguably the most well put together aspect of the entire film, which is pretty important for a musical.I think I respect this film more than I love it, but I won't say that I didn't thoroughly enjoy it. The only part of Chicago I truly didn't care for was the very end. The final musical number is a little distracting and doesn't live up to the expectations the rest of the film's finesse built. For me, the ending seemed way to abrupt and very rushed, not really wrapping up the story or characters all too well. I was a little disappointed by this because it was the only poor part of an otherwise great film. But I move on from this and am glad that, when thinking back to Chicago, all that really comes to mind are how much I enjoyed the songs and how impressed I was by the way the film was put together and how technically and creatively grand the musical numbers were.Nowadays, too many musicals think they can just present a bunch of flashy clothing, lights, and some catchy tunes and they are perfect. But what a good musical has is a combination of all these things that work together in seamless unison. Chicago is just that, minus a disappointing ending. It is flashy, it is grand, it is exciting, and the songs are very catchy. I enjoyed this film very much and while I don't see myself re-watching it I can at least respect it for being a well made film that doesn't forget what a true musical is all about.",Chicago
104,Bob-45,Malevolent Masterpiece,9,30 August 2003,"A few years back, while cleaning out my storage for a major move from Arizona to Georgia, I came across, within 15 minutes, a white scorpion the size of my fist and a black widow spider the size of a silver dollar. At the urgings of my helper, I reluctantly killed both,after first marveling at their beauty. I believe this experience helped me to prepare for ""Chicago"", a beautiful/ugly, mean-spirited masterpiece. Never before had I witnessed a major film in which the principle characters were either loathsome or pathetic. I can marvel at the beautiful dance numbers, the colors, costumes and performances of ""Chicago,"" but I don't particularly enjoy the bitter aftertaste. Nonetheless, this movie is a keeper.Brilliant performances abound, from Richard Gere to Catherine Zita-Jones to Queen Latifah (although John C. Reilly is one of my favorite actors, his one-note portrayal of Amos Hart is overpraised). However, Rene Zellweger, as Roxy Hart, is beyond brilliant. She's phenomenal. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new star in Hollywood.  When a homely, skinny, shapeless Rene Zellweger can perform beside them shapely, beautiful and talented Catherine Zita-Jones, and my eyes are completely drawn to Zellweger, I know I'm watching a major star.Certainly Zellweger's character, the murderous, slutty, adulterous Roxie Hart, is one of the great creations of the theater. Nevertheless, Zellweger has demonstrated she not only fully understands the character, she is capable of affecting every necessary nuance. Unlike most lead characters, Roxie Hart doesn't develop; she slowly disrobes, revealing layer-by-layer until we realize Roxie is an utterly ruthless, incredibly dangerous psychopath. ""I fear for Chicago,"" Gere's character says at one point. I strongly agree.While the songs are no great shakes, the dancing is uniformly terrific, as are all the technical elements.My only quibble with ""Chicago,"" is the ""Mr. Cellophane"" number. It slows the film to a crawl and is totally unnecessary. I much prefer the deleted ""Class,"" which, I believe, would have left me feeling much better about enjoying this movie.One other observation: Queen Latifah, sans makeup, is one of the most naturally beautiful women I've ever seen. One can only imagine how she would look 75 pounds lighter.Someday, I hope someday CRITERION releases a version with ""Class"" included (and, hopefully, ""Mr. Cellophane"" deleted). Till then, I give ""Chicago"" a ""9"".",Chicago

Chicago, the 1920s: a chorine (Renee Zellweger) shoots her lover and finds herself in the middle of a media storm.Chicago is a fitful filming of the Kander and Ebb musical in which, as the libretto tells us, old-school razzle-dazzle can help us to overlook creative faults. Casting in the central roles is timid and commercially minded, and there's a lack of modulation: starting with a showstopper like All That Jazz barely leaves the filmmakers with anywhere to go.

106,stamper,A long time ago in a city that wasn't very chic,8,16 March 2003,"Chicago may not have ruled the box-office in 2002, but counting the number of Academy Award nominations, one could say that this the best film of the year. Now I must say that I was not very thrilled by this film. Surely, it was not bad, but if this film is supposed to be the best one of the year, the industry has to make up in 2003. I must admit, I have not seen a lot of the films nominated for best picture (actually only this one and The Two Towers), but since this one is the big favorite for the most prices I must say I am a bit disappointed (as I was last year by the way). Last year The Fellowship of the Ring got loads of nominations, but failed to collect a big amount of statues and to be honest, I can see the same thing happening for Chicago. Despite being a well made film, this film lacked emotion and feeling. I simply was not moved by the whole thing. It was entertaining, I tell you that, but it could have been better. First of all I didn't like the way in which the musical scenes were integrated' into the story, for sometimes they had nothing to do with the story at all, but were used as trips into private worlds. Also I thought, that the music was not emotional and not moving enough and I felt that the story as a whole could have been more exciting. There are also good things about the film, but I find it hard to tell you about it. The singing is good (with one exception that is even better) and the choreography and filming are good as well. As I've just mentioned, there is that one person in the singing department that exceeds all others and I can tell you that person does not only exceed in that department. Mrs. Zeta-Jones is just perfect as Velma (bitchy suits her incredibly well) and I dare say (without having seen the other films), that in my book has a good chance of winning Oscar. If she does not I hope she loses it because someone else was better and not just because Kidman lost last year or because it is Streep's ninth nomination since winning her last Oscar, for Catherine is the person of the Chicago acting ensemble that (I feel) most rightly deserved the nomination.
The bottom line is this: Chicago does not fail to entertain, but it could have been more moving. It could have been like that musical that came out last year. You know which one I mean? I mean the musical that got NOTHING (and in any case less than Chicago will get). The musical that got lousy Art Decoration and Costume Design Oscar's in 2002. If you care to find out which film I'm talking about, look it up and see for yourself. If you don't care, don't blame me!

107,rzajac,Misogyny,8,30 December 2006,"I saw Chicago about 6 months after my separation from a 20-year marriage, and about a year before the divorce. What's interesting is that my view of this movie is more sinister now than when I first saw it.The fairly standard parse, I think, is that in a man's world, the comeupance for male romantic privilege (""love 'em/leave 'em"" as standard operating procedure) necessarily remains in the hands of individual women. Additionally, the spin in this movie--as in so many movies that heroize ""rugged individualist"" bad guys, like Bonnie and Clyde--is that this denouement will necessarily be...romantic in nature. When Roxy kills the dud dude who flaunts his plans to dump her unceremoniously, we are to see this as heroic, albeit aided by the scrim of ""period"" puppet theater fantasy; with music and everything!But as I look back on this, there's a darkness that reaches out through the entertainment value, like magma snaking up through the crust to fry a village. This is the taint of misogyny, pure and simple. It's a characterization of a spiritual level, down below the veneer of male supremacy and female deference, where women are the proverbial meatgrinders, black widows, mantids. The movie takes us, like a pied piper, from the rashness of acts carried out in the heat of passion, through the struggle for survival, and out into the sunshine where the truth gleams in the plain light of day: Women are amoral entities looking out for number one, indistinguishable from monsters. Women are inscrutable goddesses of destruction, and their vaginas will bite it off as soon as look at it.Now what I've just said may strike some as going a bit too far; and maybe it is. But get ready for this: I'm not personally convinced that amorality is a sex-linked characteristic, neither am I convinced that this movie doesn't succeed in pointing out the venality of all persons, regardless of gender. I wouldn't for a minute dismiss the fantastic production values, at every level; the tunesmithing, acting, dancing, singing, film work, everything. In fact, what I'm saying is laudable about the movie. By dancing on the fault line of this suppressed (and eminently suppressible) interpretation of gender reality, Chicago is nothing less than radical.",Chicago

More ignorance by the Academy of Fools!I tried questioning myself as to why people pay money to see this, then it struck me...the glamor.

109,FilmOtaku,Good reinvention of the Hollywood musical,8,10 May 2003,"Chicago tells the story of Roxie Hart, murderess and actress wannabee in 1920's Chicago.  While in prison and in jail, Hart (Zellweger) encounters fellow murderess Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones), Matron Mama Morton (Latifah) and attorney Billy Flynn (Gere) among others.  This was the second time I'd seen this film, and I do have to admit that I was more dazzled the first time I watched it, simply because of the surprises it held.  The biggest surprise being the hidden song and dance talents of the main players.  Admittedly, I am not a fan of any of the main cast other than John C. Reilly, who played Hart's husband Amos.  Therefore when I actually saw them in this new light, I was very pleasantly surprised, particularly with Zeta-Jones.  I knew she could play the vamp, but it turns out that she has a very good singing voice and impressive dancing ability. I'm don't particularly enjoy musicals, but I absolutely enjoy a few exceptions, most notably Fosse's Cabaret.  The producers of Chicago were very true to Fosse's vision, particularly in the unusual choreography. After every musical number I felt the urge to applaud, which normally only happens during bizarre dark films with a salty old cynic like me. 
Chicago started as a stage musical (and still continues to be very popular) therefore was very tricky to translate to the screen.  One has to remember this while watching the film, because it is not substantive in plot.  The story is, however, told cleverly through a number of musical numbers that interchange with reality.  First time director Rob Marshall is definitely schooled in stage production, a talent that is apparent in the direction of Chicago.  Despite the fact that he cut his directing teeth on this film, he utilized some very interesting camera techniques which gives the film an overall slick and sleek feel, particularly in the courtroom musical number. I wasn't thrilled with the song, but the production of that scene was amazing. Probably the best compliment to his direction was when the friend I saw this film with, a person who enjoys the cinema but doesn't partake that much leaned over to me in the middle of the film and said, ""I am REALLY impressed with the cinematography!""  Chicago was a very good movie:  Both entertaining and clever.  I'm looking forward to its release on DVD because I'm sure there will be a lot of interesting behind the scenes extras which will only further affirm how much work went into this film, both by cast and crew.--Shelly",Chicago

Considering that neither Zellweger nor O'Reilly has ever done any singing that I know of and that neither Zeta-Jones nor Gere was known to the public for singing and dancing, Rob Marshall has turned in an outstanding job of directing.

111,Pedro_H,Banal old-time variety show linked by a comic book script.,6,16 November 2004,"Two women are thrown behind bars to await trial for the slaying people that have betrayed them, but in the 1920's Chicago world of sensation, slick lawyers and tabloid newspapers is this their downfall or their making?This is such a stupid plot that any sort of analytical discussion of it should be reduced for fear of making my cheeks redden. Before seeing this I thought the musical Tommy had a silly and unbelievable script! There are bits here that make the Warren Beatty/Madonna/Al Pacino film Dick Tracy (with which this film shares art Stalins) look like Hamlet!For the record, a lot of what takes place is set in a strange surreal prison where conditions are harsh outside of the hair and make-up department. The Chief Warder is a top heavy black lesbian - played by Queen Latifah - presumably because that is what the cliché demands?(The stretch leather/plastic/PVC hot-pant outfits the dancing prisoners wear are about as 1920's as the Apollo space programme!)From what I've told you already the only things that can save this is great song and dance. Sadly it falls in to the middle ground. All That Jazz is the nearest we have to a classic and they know it too - spinning it out and repeating it at the end.The dancing is, however, passable - especially when the CO-leads Zellweger and Jones do a double hoof. Richard Gere seems to have learnt from his Cotton Club (a total flop musical and yet more fun viewing than this Best Picture Oscar winner!) experience and got himself wide awake before someone shouted ""action"" - although his song and dance is pure village hall.Let me tell a little secret about Catherine Zeta Jones - she used to be on a TV programme called Junior Showtime here in the UK. This involved little children pretending to be adults and was cast in the form of an old time music hall review. The Muppet Show borrowed the format. While the show-biz brats loved it I know of no one of my age that could stand it. I have dark suspicions as to why it stayed on air so long!I am not one to spoil anyone's fun, because I am sure that there are people that love this kind of thing, but Cabaret and even the Sound of Music had a life outside of the song and dance. This is as limp as a boiled noodle as soon as the music stops. The whole thing plays like an evening flicking channels between a dreadful 2 AM B picture and a big budget variety show from the 1970's.From what I read this is purely intentional.",Chicago

This success is down to good musical scores, good acting by well-known actresses and actors, and overall good production and attention to detail. I think that audiences had a wider appreciation for the genre and a good movie with a good story upon seeing this film.

114,jdkraus,Possibly the worst Best Picture winner ever!,1,20 September 2008,"Okay, people called ""Chicago"" the best of 2002, winning six academy awards (including Picutre). To know what the hype was all about, I rented it. After seeing a half hour of it, I could not sit through the movie because it was so awful. There are many reasons why I find it so terrible. For starters, I did not like the opening. It beings with choppy editing, jumping from Renee Zellweger's character having aggressive sex with a man to Catherine Zeta Jones dancing seductively in smashing tights.When this ends, Zellweger has an argument which leads to the man she had sex with abusing her. She pulls out a gun and kills him in a fit of rage. She gets arrested and ends up in a woman's prisoner led by Queen Latifah. Much of the movie makes up of the actresses' lip singing (which can be seen very clearly) and wearing exotic costumes that make them look like whores. So I think to myself, is this supposed to be about a woman imprisoned and trying to prove her innocence, or a bunch of bad singing and sexual immorality? Or, a movie that's about the glorification of women killing man and saying it's okay? After a few songs, I had enough, I walked out of the room. I didn't even get to the part when Richard Gere arrives. I do not understand how this won six academy awards. The set- decoration and costume design was nothing in the leagues of ""Gangs of New York"" or ""The Two Towers"". The editing was poorly done; chopping up the dance sequences instead of making them move fluently (half the time I couldn't tell what was going on). As with the performances, I was not impressed. All Queen Latifah and Catherine Zeta-Jones did was sing, dance and wear unpleasant costumes (I found Jones's tights and Latifah's peacock dress hilarious) and Zellweger, well, she's a great actress, but all she did in this was whine, wiggle her butt, and look adorable. I've seen all the other Picture nominees of '02, and each of them are much, much better candidates than this hunk of garbage. If the academy gives it a lot of Oscars, okay, but it doesn't mean they give it to the right individuals. 1/10",Chicago
115,AhmedSpielberg99,All That Jazz!,8,23 April 2020,"It's really sad the unique storytelling Rob Marshall perfected here has never been duplicated in any Musical film, as far as I know, since this day, even Marshall himself approached it a second time in Nine and it's safe to say that he failed miserably. I'm talking about le montage parallèle that keeps the songs separated from the on-going actions in the actual story, and play simultaneously in order to express what the characters feel at a certain point in the story. Such a technique is rarely used in musicals, let alone used in a way that really shows that the director is in total command of his craft. That really could have been something revolutionary for the musical film genre if it was accompanied with a very simple thing.I feel that the main reason the risks Marshall has taken in Chicago paid off brilliantly is that the film is simply has a decent plot; one that we seldom see in a musical film that tells its story primarily relying on dance numbers, which are here, by the way, elaborately choreographed. I'm a fan of musical films already, but I reckon even those who are not very fond of watching two hours of people dancing and singing would be easily engaged in a film that rather has an actual, intricate story. Even if the dance numbers don't seem to add to much to the story (for, yes, I think there are some redundant ones and others overlong here), it would be easy to tolerate with them as long as there is a story, a clever one, you're engrossed in from the get-go. Did I mention that Chicago has what quite possibly be the best opening dance number I've seen in any musical since I've seen La La Land's Another Day of Sun?That what made Chicago an excellent film, but what really made it extremely fun to watch is the sleek camerawork and polished lighting, the skilful and slick direction that treated the film as a breezy crime flick and the magnificent performances by all the cast, including, of course, Catherine Zeta-Jones's Oscar-winning performance. Chicago really took me by surprise since I didn't even like any of the three Rob Marshall films I've seen so far. This one I did love it!(8.5/10)",Chicago
116,tomimt,Why they didn't even want a picture of me?,8,7 January 2006,"I've been surprised with myself lately: I've noticed that that musicals can actually be deeper and more meaningful than I've thought.First musical I noticed I like was Moulin Rogue and now there is Chicago, the murder musical about two women who just want to stay in the headlights long enough to make a mint.Maybe this my new fondness of musical is usage of actors, who I've never thought of being used as musical actors, like Richard Gere (Billy Flynn, a self serving lawyer) or Renée Zellweger (Roxie Hart, a ""poor"" lil'l girl who kills her lover). Also John C. Reilly makes great performance as Amos, well meaning, but little bit too soft hearted husband of Roxie. As said, Chicago is a story of Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who both are waiting for their murder trial. Flynn states, that to be acquitted they need publicity and Roxie notices that is easy to obtain. But here today, gone tomorrow. That kind of publicity is hard to keep up and she is forced to come up bigger and bigger lies to keep the flame burning.As Chicago is a musical you can guess that the music plays important (duh) part ín the film. Luckily the songs and melodies carry through and Chicago is enjoyable experience, in both, visual and musical, ways.I didn't like Chicago as much I liked Moulin Rogue, but it still is a solid musical (as far I can say).",Chicago
117,Christian_Dimartino,"Unique, colorful and sexy... a lot of fun.",10,4 June 2012,"I have never been a total fan of musicals. Sure, some are great, like Sweeney Todd, The Sound of Music, and Singin' in the Rain. But some, like The Music Man and Annie, just don't cut it for me. But I knew that Rob Marshall's Chicago would provide just the right amount of razzle dazzle to win me over.The film is mainly centered around two women. One(Renee Zellweger) wants fame, and when she murders her other man, that is basically what she gets. The other has fame, and after she murders someone, the two compete over the media's affections. Richard Gere plays their lawyer, John C. Reilly is wonderful as Zellweger's naive husband, and Queen Latifa is good also as the warden.A lot of the songs are really enjoyable, and the way Marshall displays them is fairly unique. I like musicals like this and Moulin Rouge, that are flashy and bright and sexy. The film is very entertaining and I actually kind of wanted it to go on.Zellweger is terrific, even though I hate her character, and so is Zeta-Jones, who went home with an Oscar. Gere is good too, but I must point out that his singing voice is odd. I loved the film, but I have a couple problems with it, just minor problems.I don't think that the ending is really justified enough. Actually, not really at all. The John C. Reilly portion is unfair. Also, there are too many songs, but that was just a minor flaw. I also don't think it deserved Best Picture. Best Picture should have gone to Roman Polanski's The Pianist, in which, after reading about the notorious auteur, is similar to his experience. But Chicago is wonderful.Overall, Chicago goes out blazing.A",Chicago
118,Isaac5855,"A Dazzling, Eye Popping Extravaganza",9,13 December 2005,"The 2002 screen version of the Kander/Ebb/Fosse Broadway musical CHICAGO was a long time coming but well worth the wait. This amazing musical became the first musical to win the Oscar for Best Picture since 1968 and along with MOULIN ROUGE, helped to pave the way for the return of musicals to the big screen (PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, RENT, THE PRODUCERS, and DREAMGIRLS is on its way). When the film rights were first purchased for this musical over 20 years ago, Goldie Hawn and Liza Minnelli had been announced to be the stars, which gives you a good idea as to how long this project stayed on the shelf. Thank God, Harvey Fierstein, Miramax, and the amazing Rob Marshall finally found a way to bring the project to fruition. This dark and slightly jaundiced musical traces the tale of two ladies Roxie Hart (Renee Zellwegger) and Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who have committed murder and use their notoriety as murderesses to become stars. Richard Gere plays the slightly unscrupulous lawyer who is trying to keep both girls from being convicted of murder in order to collect his fat fee. In the stage musical, the scenes are introduced as vaudeville acts and director Marshall cleverly legitimized this set-up for the film by making the entire film a dream of Roxie's by opening the film with a closeup of Zellwegger's lovely blue eye which segues directly onto the stage of the Onyx, the nightclub where Zeta-Jones (in an electrifying performance that won her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar)is seen washing the blood off her hands before going onstage to perform the show's signature song, ""All that Jazz"" while Roxie is seen murdering her scummy lover (Dominic West) and trying to get her husband (John C. Reilly) to cover for her. This film is a feast for the eyes and ears and Marshall has definitely channeled Bob Fosse in his staging of the musical numbers. ""Cell Block Tango"", ""They Both Reached for the Gun"", ""Roxie"", ""Razzle Dazzle"", and ""All I Care About"" are just amazing. The performances are uniformly first-rate, with special mention to Queen Latifah as Mama and John C. Reilly as Roxie's husband, Amos, who stops the show with ""Mr. Cellophane."" Five numbers from the original score have been cut but there was only one (""Class"") that I really missed. Otherwise, this musical is a must-see. I think even people who don't like musicals might even enjoy this one. A joy from start to finish.",Chicago

I was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining, engaging, and even exciting the story line in this movie is. The songs, dancing, and sets are tremendously stylized, but in a way that is intriguing--- one is drawn deeper and deeper into the world of the movie and its story. And the cast is amazing--- I think everyone will be surprised (and thrilled) seeing the 4 leads, known for non-musical performances, strut their music-hall stuff with the best of them. That is, Renee Zelwegger, Catherine Z-J, John C. Reilly, and Richard Gere are awesome as musical performers here--- AND they brought every bit of their usual charisma and dramatic impact with them. Queen Latifa was also great and delightful with her virtuoso performance--- but then we are used to seeing music from her. All around--- Very Well Done Indeed!!!Contrast ""Chicago"" and its meaningful spectacle with the fluffy ""Moulin Rouge."" That other movie was splashy, and stylized, but it was also so vapid and senseless as a feature. It wasn't ABOUT anything. It was like watching someone play the kazoo with their nose--- it may amuse for a few minutes, but then PUH-LEEEZE, drop it and move on to something else! ""Moulin Rouge"" was some artsy-fartsy person's minor and narrow vision of some tiny speck of fleeting interest that somehow (and wrongfully) got expanded and stretched into a two-hour exercise in indulgence, and lack of connection with Heart, Mind, or Life. ""Chicago,"" however, has all of the flare of ""Moulin"" and more--- plus ""Chicago"" is truly about something. It is everything at once: music, art, entertainment, drama, comedy, fantasy, and inspiration.In appreciation I must mention the vibe of the late Bob Fosse. I think he'd LOVE this version and this movie. I also deepened my love for his 1979 (or so) autobiographical movie, ""All That Jazz"" after watching ""Chicago"" today. Go Bob!",Chicago

No, I do not generally like musicals, but this creation is so fabulous because the performances are top-notch, the story is riveting and the underlying critique of law and justice is so incisive. There is quite a dose of truth here, mixed in with all of the entertainment.Some may find that Chicago is more like a filmed theatrical production than a carefully plotted out masterpiece of cinema, but the lighting and sound are quite good, so it does count as a well-produced film and certainly deserved the many accolades bestowed upon it. Chicago has aged well, probably because it depicts the early 20th century and always will....I find this production highly entertaining--a feast for the eyes but also some food for thought.

122,lawprof,About That PG-13 Rating,10,15 February 2003,"MINOR SPOILERS (I think there are no surprises below but I want to be safe)Comments about ""Chicago"" on IMDb are reaching the four hundred mark and I have little to add about the film itself other than to say it's a glorious adaptation of a show with outstanding performances, excellent songs and the kind of dancing that would make Bob Fosse very proud. Catherine Zeta-Jones surprised me with the range of emotions she expresses and Renee Zellweger is amazing in a rawly seductive role. Richard Gere is the kind of lawyer too familiar in the Cook County of the Roaring Twenties.  10/10.I am curious if others found the PG-13 rating questionable.  I took my thirteen-and-a-half year old son and he regularly sees, with me, R-rated films to say nothing of TV shows such as ""Law & order"" to which he is addicted (he's the son of a law professor and an attorney and everyone expects he'll wind up in our profession).At today's early afternoon showing there were quite a few kids my son's age and under - under in this instance meaning down to about nine based on my quick scan of a packed theater.This film has1)  more or less hot sex scenes,2)  a number of graphic shootings,3)  the very realistic execution by hanging of a woman not thrilled with her fate,4)  dances with scantily clad chorus girls, gyrating with the insouciance of bawdy house hosts,5)  dialogue dealing with everything from adultery to suborning perjury.Mature and with a sardonic, some might say morbid, sense of humor, my kid wasn't distressed by any of this (in the morning we lounged in my bedroom watching a TV screening of that old Korean War machine gun 'em by the thousands flick, ""The Steel Helmet.""  The lad's comments during that film might make some sensitive souls shudder. :) ).But many parents might be unhappy (I think) with items 1-5 above and the PG-13 rating doesn't alert them to the content in any meaningful way.Is there a problem with the ratings system?  Are ratings based on economic considerations, however muted?  Are this generation's kids simply more mature overall and better able to deal with the subjects in ""Chicago"" than their predecessors?  Am I simply off the radar screen of sensitivity by even raising the question?",Chicago

They then compete for Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), a high-priced attorney who has never lost a case.

They did all of their own singing and dancing, which looked real. No real special effects here. The music didn't seem to interrupt anything and fit right in. I wasn't shocked that they took a nice scene and made razzmatazz out of it. It flowed along nicely; when it went too long without a musical scene I was left waiting for one. That's pretty good directing (by Rob Marshall).Alas, like all musicals, Chicago drags a bit in the second act, not having the steady pace of the fun of the first one. It seemed to go too leisurely and the tap-dancing scene, from Gere, seemed unnecessary. I really liked how Marshall interspliced two or even three scenes seamlessly with quick cuts. It added to the experience of a dancing set of the twenties. The songs were bouncy, but I was surprised that my feet weren't tapping along like I wanted them to be. All of them are great, but I only really remember `All That Jazz' (because it was played over the credits). This is a movie whose soundtrack I must buy.Zellweger surprised me (with her astonishingly bubbly voice sometimes), but the standout was Zeta-Jones. She, being a veteran of Broadway, really wanted to do this project and seemed to have so much fun doing this, probably what she likes to do best. I felt glad that she was the best part of the movie musical revival. Gere (who I hated in The Mothman Prophecies) did a nice role, though he was a lot better singing and dancing than he was acting.

The costuming and themeing was perfect and brought out the idea and the culture of the twenties. No expense was uselessly wasted. Plus, as an added bonus, the fast paced cinematography was enjoyable to watch, but may have too many `Blair Witch Project side effects'.Queen Latifah played `Momma', a warden-type at the prison. She was probably the second best performer in the show. Other people that popped up include Christine Baranski as a radio announcer, Taye Diggs as a band leader, and Lucy Liu (in a somewhat wasted role) as a new prisoner. That leads me to my next point-although movies like this don't use much time in developing a great plot, the secondary characters leave something to be admired. During the slinky song about six inmates and how they killed their husbands/boyfriends, only two came back later.

125,WriterDave,Mulholland Drive--The Musical!,9,9 January 2003,"Note: I am not saying this was the year's best film, but it was pure and honest to its genre in a way that perhaps no other film has been, and well, I could see it sweeping the Oscars, which would be funny, and a slap in the face to Baz the Spazz Luhrman, who I hate. Also, I think it is strongly related thematically (and sometimes visually as Zelwegger looks like Naomi Watts in certain lights and costumes, and she also looks like Marilyn Monroe in a certain musical number) to David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"". I'm really surprised no other critic has made that leap in comparison.In the end, what is arguably this year's best film (at least in terms of artistic integrity), is about the same damn thing that last year's best film was about--""Mulholland Drive""--how dreams of fame and fortune can psychologically torture seemingly innocent ingenues and turn them into homicidal maniacs. I normally hate musicals, and I especially loathed the trite and visually obnoxious ""Moulin Rouge"". But ""Chicago"" succeeds beautifully in that the almost all of the musical numbers are the products of a delusional mind, and it is a musical that is about SOMETHING. Yes, it's bright and flashy and fun as hell, but it has something deep to say about our obsession with fame and how murder, time and time again, has become a legitimate way to achieve that fame and live in the limelight. Everybody involved in this film seemed to be having such a hell of a good time making it, that I got bowled over by the sheer enthusiasm of it all. And I think that was the point. Booze, jazz, sex, and murder can make for the best kind of entertainment if you can sell it, and boy, did these people sell it. I've always loved Catherine Zeta-Jones, and she will blow you away. Renee Zelwegger delicately balances he character's delusional ingenuity and maniacal madness. And Richard Gere, though we all laughed out loud when he busted into song, was, well, pretty damn good because he wasn't that bad and seemed to have so much fun. Yes, they all sold it, as did Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly.

127,ChungMo,The age of the American Film Musical is long gone,4,16 April 2005,"I avoided this when it came out when I saw a few dance numbers on television reviews. I especially avoided it after a couple of friends who really liked ""Moulin Rouge"" recommended it. Now three years later a couple of other friends insisted that I at least watch the DVD which they lent me.I would lose a lot of friends if I took their taste in musicals as a test of their friendship.First of all, Mr. Marshall's direction is wrong, wrong, wrong. He uses lazy music video style to construct the dance/song numbers. This style consists of shooting a massive amount of footage, any footage, and hope your editor can do something with it. Unlike the dancing, there was clearly no choreography to the camera work. Watch any GOOD musical (pre-1960) and you'll see what camera choreography is. Hell, watch a few modern Bollywood musical numbers and you'll see good camera choreography. A real film musical works with the performed material and compliments it. Watching Fosse's own filming of Sweet Charity shows that he understood this.I dismiss the notion that the editing was to cover the actor's lack of dancing talent. I think they would have shot and edited this film this way even if they had Fred Astaire and Ginger Rodgers in it. Nobody in the film industry knows how to respect the talents of stage entertainers anymore. The assumption is that nobody can really do anything (which is true of many music performers today) so it's up to the filmmakers to bedazzle the viewer with flashy technique and noise. Some of the background dancers in the film could really move. A smart choreographer could set a scene up so that the stars wouldn't be upstaged. And a smart director would let that smart choreographer's work be seen.All this said, I found a potentially good film under all the glitz. The performers did a very good job but the real surprise was Mr. Gere breaking out of his hound puppy act that's been his shtick for all these years. He was the one person who really understood how to perform his role. The movie really ends with his last scene. Unfortunately he's not enough for me to recommend the film to anyone.",Chicago
128,departed07,One of the coolest musicals made,10,28 November 2003,"Chicago is about two women that are accused of seperate murders. one is Velma Kelly(Catherine Zeta Jones), a dancer at the Chicago night club who shot her sister and her husband. The other is Roxie Hart(Renee Zellweger), a shy girl who wants to get into show businesses like Kelly until she goes home with the man who says she is going to get her into the business by having sex. Roxie kills the man and is accused of murder. Richard Gere plays Billy, the attorney that will help Roxie, unless another wild story comes up. Roxie has the fame in her hands. People are emulating her, reporters are dying to find out secrets about her life. The film is dazzling with great songs and heart. Even though this film won best picture at the academy awards and dissapointed many people because this film won, I like Chicago anyway. Its the type of film you can see over and over again with a smile on your face.This film also stars Queen Latifah, John C. Reiley, Lucy Liu, Christine Baranski, Colm Feroe and Mya.10/10
This film is worth the watch.",Chicago
129,beresfordjd,CZJ the star arrives!,8,26 February 2013,"Not the greatest musical ever made but the greatest performance I ever saw in a musical and I love musicals. Catherine Zeta Jones delivers in every respect as Velma Kelly, overshadowing everyone else in this film. I just found whatever scene she was in she dominated - it was very difficult to take my eyes off her. She really achieved her star potential in Chicago and rightly walked away with the Oscar. Rene Zellwegger was good but far too skinny to be sexy as far as I was concerned and I dislike Richard Gere in anything, he just has nothing for me. The musical numbers are all well done and choreographed brilliantly but CZJ steals every scene in which she appears - a fair amount of the film flags when she is not on screen. I hardly even noticed Rene was in their final dance number - CZJ just gave that number everything!! This sounds as though I was always a huge fan of Catherine but to be honest I could take or leave her even given her obvious beauty. I enjoyed seeing her in Entrapment and the Zorro movies but Chicago really showed what she can do.",Chicago
130,Spanner-2,Excellent production,9,1 January 2003,"This is an adaption of a broadway musical and the filmmakers have done an excellent job with this version. The production design and camerawork is outstanding and the performances are mostly very good. Renee Zellweger, cast against her usual type, turns in an oustanding performance as does Catherine Zeta-Jones (cast more to type) and they both turn in effective song numbers as well. Richard Gere, whom I rather dislike normaly, is less anoying than usual in this role, as a smarmy lawyer, though he was the least effective of the leads. The supporting players are uniformaly excellent as well. A rousing crowd-pleasing musical extravagancy, this is one to be sure to catch this season. GRADE: A-",Chicago

The cast is perfect, with Renée Zellweger perfect as Roxie Hart and Catherine Zeta-Jones excellent as Velma Kelly.

133,bbewnylorac,Dazzling,9,6 November 2016,"I saw Chicago both on Broadway in 2001 and earlier in Melbourne, Australia, so I know and love this musical well. This movie is blessed with inheriting the outstanding, impeccably arranged songs by Kander and Ebb, the luscious, sexy choreography by Bob Fosse, and above all, the searing satire of the original writer, Maurine Dallas Watkins. The latter was a court reporter so disgusted with the simpering, self-serving antics of female murderers In trials in the 1920s that she wrote a play about them. She even includes a sycophantic reporter character, Mary Sunshine, in a savage mockery of weak journalists. Rob Marshall's direction of the film is suitably snappy and witty. The acting is great. I think this is Richard Gere's best film - he conveys the faux concern, sleaze and underlying ruthlessness of lawyer Billy Flynn beautifully, and he nails two of the musical's best numbers - All I Care About and Razzle Dazzle, in charismatic style. Renee Zellweger is witty and appealing as the outwardly sweet but morally bankrupt killer Roxy Hart. It's hard to believe Zellweger was inexperienced in musicals. Catherine Zeta Jones is great as the more wily but increasingly desperate Velma Kelly, accused of killing her husband and her sister. Special mention to Lucy Liu in a smart cameo as the glamorous new killer who takes the media spotlight away from Velma and Roxy. All in all, this movie is a superb complement to the stage version.",Chicago
134,bsinc,My lord,6,29 March 2003,"There isn't a single category in which ""Chicago"" was nominated that was deserved. Best editing, please, have you seen ""Irreversible"", best sound: ""LOTR:TTT"", art direction; don't get me started, costume design, well this one isn't that far off, but best picture, best picture.I haven't seen any of the other nominees, but if this is the best 2002 had to offer(and it didn't) then it's an extremely sad year indeed.*****************************SPOILERS AHEAD***************************** The plot in ""Chicago"" is so absurd I couldn't believe my eyes. Zellweger is sentenced to jail(life sentence to be precise) because she killed her lover who lied to her to get her in bed; realizes she has to get out and in conclusion hires an infamous lawyer(Gere) to get her freedom back. After this the story basically revolves around the publicity she receives because the movie tries to convince us there is only one way to win your freedom in Chicago; to win the crowds first. So we see the enthusiastic Gere taking every cheap shot he can simply to save the ""poor"" and ""beautiful"" Roxie so she can live her dream of dancing on stage. ************************************************************************
OK, let's forget this is the most immoral movie of the year, lets concentrate on this musical as such. So what's left, well the music and songs of course; well none are very memorable, and I couldn't stop thinking that this movie was made for the sole purpose of inserting the songs in it. And I couldn't care less for any character in this years ""best movie"".In my mind the Oscars lost their credibility a very long time ago, but this is more than an insult. ""Chicago"" doesn't posses one Oscar worthy quality, be it the average(in Zellweger's case sometimes very poor) acting or the outrageous story.Catherine Zeta Jones (who really put some effort into her acting)and Gere (who seemed like he was having a blast) were the only ones who made this movie less painful. The rest is a mix of forgettable songs and Zellweger's pathetic facial expressions. I can't believe I found her attractive in ""Jerry Maguire"", because I can't think of an actress with more sadness in her face. Even when she's laughing she looks like somebody just stuck a pin in her ass.I thought ""Moulin Rouge"" was terrible; well it was and this movie wasn't anywhere near as bad, but still, 13 Oscar nominations???Well, they at lest wrote their own songs.A boring, extremely stupid and immoral movie that gave me no joy, only remorse and sorrow.  6/10",Chicago

Now I gotta tell ya, I couldn't sit thru ""Moulin Rouge""...guess it just wasn't my type of musical, but I found nothing to interest me there. Now, ""Chicago"" is a whole 'nother story.  From the begining we get that Fosse treatment...the sensuality without the full frontal nudity, or graphic sex.  The titilation.  What you don't see is more interesting than what you would probably see. Anyone that had a hard time following this movie should stick to ""Top Gun"" and ""Speed"".  The music and dance numbers fit nicely into the story, they were great, and the whole damn picture moved along at a nice clip.  The Velma chick should surely get the Oscar. On a scale of one to ten punches, I give it a ten...four jabs, a left hook, four rights to the noggin, and an uppercut for the knockout!",Chicago
136,TaylorYee94,"Great movie with diverse attractions. However, is it Oscar-worthy?",8,15 January 2021,"'Chicago' is strangely well put together, a mix of stage and reality. I felt as if I was watching a musical in the theater because of dark lighting & spotlight, jazzy music, the quality of choreography, the feeling of intimacy and closeness (distance-wise) between actors and audience, and vividness of Roxie's imagination. Especially, two last reasons could be possible because the director switches reality scenes and musical scenes so smoothly, naturally, effectively, and appropriately. Courtroom scene is a great example. 'Razzle Dazzle' musical rather shows hypocrisy of the courtroom and all the people in there pretended to be reasonable. The exchange of musical and courtroom is swift but yet so realistic (kudos to editing team). Richard Gere's lines do not stop and actors' eyes stay on the same spot during the switch, so all the efforts complete strong connecting between reality and musical scene.I also want to compliment choreography of this movie. It consists of various moves including jazz dance, latin dance (tango), ballet, and tap dance. It is heck of a show. I also love how the movie keeps the ambiance of voluptuous, dark, sexy beauty through colors and lightings. The metaphors are great especially when Roxie was a marionette, symbolizing the whole legal process is like a puppet show, winning people's heart with lies and fabrication.However, each musical segment feels elongated, making the whole story slowed. I'm just not sure 'Chicago' has captivated the audience enough to deserve Oscar.",Chicago

I was prepared to NOT like this movie for that reason alone. (And because I was a big Bob Fosse fan, I wasn't prepared to like a movie that was mere ""imitation-Fosse"" but...I liked it!!! I liked it!!!The music and the performances are top notch... at least as far as the female cast goes... Richard Gere, well, he does a good job but the ladies (Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellwegger and Queen Latifah) are sooooooooooooo good that he sort of pales by comparison. The movie doesn't have a dull moment... one incredible song-and-dance number after another... woo hoo! The only flaw in the movie is that I don't think the later climactic songs are as good as some of the earlier show-stoppers... the trial needed a big finish and it just didn't quite have it. Still, that's a minor point. Weeks later and I'm still humming the songs!(Also, as much as I love this movie... it's still only the SECOND BEST musical released in 2002...

Jazz and liquor and many more cliché's are brought back to life here, but the sassy story and even more sequined musical numbers are the main attraction. The music does tend to bleed together and self serving star dialog takes away any caring of each of their fates, but this is a comedy based on two murderesses, an opportunistic lawyer and a courtroom that's a (musically choreographed) circus. This is certainly a sexy and energetic escapade into the roaring twenties that titillates and entertains.",Chicago
140,cat_ranchero,Highly enjoyable with some great performances and some classic songs!...,8,7 May 2012,"I think the reason I like the look of this film is because it doesn't pretend to be anything other than a musical. All the set-pieces are performed on sets that are cut away from the dramatic story-line. There is much to admire, some great songs and some really great performances. I thought Richard Gere did a decent enough job of the musical numbers but I felt he was better in the dramatic parts. I can't say I particularly liked any of the main characters all that much; they were all far too self-obsessed, but still entertaining. There was just one thing missing (for me) and that was a different ending I have in mind how I would have liked it to end but I guess I'll just have to keep that one with me (for now).

141,Mike_Devine,A musical that has lost its luster over the years,6,11 November 2018,"Broadway musicals find their way onto the silver screen every once in a while, and 'Chicago' is one of the most commercially successful examples of this. The 2002 Academy Award-winning film boasts an A-list cast and resonated with audiences at the time, as it came out in an era when musicals were back in style (see 'Moulin Rouge').At its core, 'Chicago' is an anti-feminist feminist story, as it focuses on murderous struggling jazz performers (and wannabe performers) who look to game the system in 1920s Chicago. Renee Zellweger and Academy Award winner Catherine Zeta-Jones run the show - both actresses considered Hollywood heavyweights at the time this was filmed - while Richard Gere delivers in his portrayal of a deceptive defense attorney (minus his horrible vocals). We also see strong supporting roles from Queen Latifah, Christine Baranski, Taye Diggs and John C. Reilly, although it's hard for any of them to really make a dent given Zellweger, Zeta-Jones and Gere hog the limelight.Where 'Chicago' does well is on the production side, as it's done very well. It has the feel of a big budget spectacle that is intended to be watched in a theatre, as there a number of musical numbers that almost seem like they're taken directly from Broadway. However, the songs are more or less cheesy and some of the numbers are almost unwatchable. Sure, it's a musical so that's to be expected, but still...Watching 'Chicago' in this day and age, it definitely feels dated compared to musicals of the current era (see 'La La Land' or 'The Greatest Showman'). And while clearly overrated, its success can't be denied.",Chicago

A string of subtle plot twists kept me spellbound.Adapted from the 1970s Bob Fosse Masterpiece, the musical numbers are elaborate as well as visually and acoustically stunning. The very best in years, well deserving of all the Academy Awards (especially Katherine Zeda-Jones, her choreography and stage presence are electrifying).

144,nickmesafilms,Chicago (2002) - ...And All that Jazz!,10,9 January 2012,"Director Rob Marshall and writer Bill Condon team up for the adaptation of the hit satire Broadway production, ""Chicago"". The movie focuses on two leading ladies, Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly, portrayed by Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones, who find themselves awaiting their trials for murder in the 20s era of Chicago. Velma Kelly is a vaudevillian, and Roxie Hart is a housewife with dreams of joining the stage. With the help of a charismatic lawyer, portrayed by Richard Gere, both these ladies will fight for the fame that they always dreamed of having. Watching this movie is like a breath of fresh air. This movie is an entertaining, charming, and wicked musical. The memorable songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb are quite enjoying, and the choreographed musical numbers make the movie stand out for what it wants to be. Rob Marshall is the perfect director to organize such a classic musical like this. He has helped to make incredible costumes, breathtaking art direction, memorable songs, incredible film editing, and great acting come to life on the big screen. The casting ensemble in this movie is truly something to die for. Renee Zellweger is just super awesome, Catherine Zeta-Jones deserved her Oscar win, and Richard Gere was just plain excellent. John C. Reilly is perfect as Roxie's ignored husband, and Queen Latifah is super as the matron of the Cook County Jail. I'm a big fan of musicals, and they always know how to lift my spirits. I start to sing along to the songs, and I never forget them. I can watch this movie over and over again, and I'll never stop enjoying everything that this movie has to offer.

145,glgioia,Great Fun,9,27 October 2008,"A near perfect adaptation of the Broadway smash featuring an all-star cast who somehow all do their own singing and dancing.One of the very Broadway crossovers in recent memory to actually do its job and entertain, and boy, does it ever! Chicago sucks you in at minute one and you don't really come up for air until a half hour has passed. Now thats a good movie. Musicals, theater etc are hardly my cup of tea, and Hollywood's opium dream renditions are even less in my scope of enjoyment. Why Chicago works where most of them have flopped utterly, I am not sure but would have to bet its down to direction. Chicago's song and dance segments are cut MTV style, but, Marshall seems to have almost perfected this technique to somehow capture the in-theater dramatic 'zowie' feeling that almost never makes it from stage to screen. While many argue Chicago owe its success at the Oscars to the drubbing Moulin Rouge took (quite deservedly) the year before, I happen to disagree and believe that for once the Academy actually got it right. The cast is fantastic. Sure you can nitpick about Gere being too nasally and too Gere, and maybe Zellwegger's drunken bridesmaid dancing could have used a couple more takes, but the final product even with those bizarre ingredients is one of the most enjoyable experiences to come out of Hollywood, maybe ever?",Chicago
146,Hunky Stud,"good story, not so good singing and dancing.",7,3 June 2005,"I am not impressed with this movie at all. I knew that it has won many Oscars; however, it didn't get me the excitement as I expected. The songs were not impressive; the dances were not stimulating, either. Of course, I saw the movie from a tiny TV. Maybe that is the major reason why I didn't get excited.This movie reminded me of ""Moulin Rouge."" The best part of this movie is how they seamlessly blended two scenes together with the singing and the dialogue. The storyline is very intriguing, yet overly simplified and exaggerated. It didn't have any songs that I like to sing after.I think that it is great that they used Lucy Liu. As a Chinese American, it is not easy that she can get parts in quite a few big budget movies. One of her distinguish feature is her eyes. I am not sure if it is positive or negative. Maybe she is a role model for many other Asians who have eyes such as hers. However, she might also give the rest of audiences the impression that all Asians have eyes like hers. That would perpetuate the negative images that people have about Asian Americans.",Chicago
147,jackasstrange,Not sure if is worth a re-watch,7,26 November 2013,"Chicago is the adaptation to cinema of the satirical stage play with the same name. As you can easily perceive in this film, the media which glorifies the sexy and murderers ladies and turn them in celebrities is satirized in the film, and what is also mocked here is the sad fact of how low any human being can be in order to satisfy their wishes. Interesting 'subtle' themes.The editing probably has a word for 90% of this film. Some of it's best moments only works due to the intercalation of both the real and the stage world, and generally the stage world reflects what their correspondents in the real world are doing. For example, in the courtroom sequence, where Gere's character is in a delicate situation in the court and needs to 'dance' in order to save his egocentric client from the hanging. So both sequences_ Gere trying to save his client in the real world, and Gere doing the tap-dance,allegory of his effort on the court, in the stage world_ are intercalated through fast and smart editing. Great moment, one of the best in the film.Really everything in this film is great: the acting, the costumes, and especially the art design, which deservedly won the Oscar...But one thing really bothered me in this film, and is probably a pretty obvious complain: it has too much and long numbers on this film. It's way too frenetic even for a musical film. This style of musical obviously don't fits well the standards of entertainment of Hollywood, but it somehow worked in 2002, due to the hype. But looking at it now, in 2013, is just hard to imagine a film like this doing success. I would recommend it,though. Fun to watch, but it lacks a consistent story line,a fact which can turn the musical numbers way too repetitive.7.0/10",Chicago

That too..",6,13 January 2003,"I couldn't help thinking how much this piece was missing something that made me feel for the characters involved.  Sure its well acted, and kind of a charming script, but its hopelessly hokey and very campy.  Most of the numbers are actually second rate and got on my nerves after awhile.The movie also seems to devoid itself of the era in which it takes place. While Queen Latifah stands out, the mannerisms of everyone else don't seem to inhabit the way people acted in that era.  I was also wondering if I was ever going to see a black male in this piece who would at least have conked hair.Also I didn't care for the new talents of Zeta, Gere, and Renee.  While it was fine it wasn't that impressive for me probaly cause the songs weren't all that inspiring, and I found the film speed of some of their dance numbers (particularly at the end) overdone and purposely jerky.Far from being a classic or a masterpiece.Rating 6 out of 10",Chicago
149,bix171,A Joke,3,18 March 2003,"'Chicago' barely qualifies as a movie--it's a filmed presentation of a Broadway musical. Somewhere there's a script (Bill Condon wrote it) and some characters (John C. Reilly plays one) but in the end it's a series of loosely strung together numbers intending to insult the audience, sneeringly identifying it as a scandal-loving, celebrity-mad, indiscriminate horde. Choreographer Rob Marshall turns his directorial debut into a slavish homage to Bob Fosse but where Fosse had the good sense to surround non-dancer Roy Scheider in 'All That Jazz' with Ann Reinking and Ben Vereen, Marshall surrounds non-dancer Renee Zellweger with the equally lead footed Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere and suddenly editor Martin Walsh is everyone's best friend. It's all a trick; none of it's credible: you spend the entire film guessing where the dancing doubles are inserted (though the credits trumpet the fact that when you see the leads dancethey're really dancing--which is the same as saying whatever beef is used in an hot dog really is all beef). There's probably only about twenty minutes of actual dialog and the material is so thin (two murderesses turn their crimes into a media circus in Chicago's immoral twenties) that the film must depend on its musical staging to keep you interested; but even there you're presented with an unoriginal patchwork of fantasy sequences (you've seen this kind of stuff on PBS' 'Great Performances' hundreds of times) intended to move character development along but in reality only stalls what little plot there is. The film is way overpopulated with songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and they're relentlessly similar--loud, brassy and bearing very little of the sardonic wit and pointedness of their 'Cabaret'. Let's not even get started on the leads' singing voices. With Taye Diggs (a direct imitation of Joel Grey in 'Cabaret' and Ben Vereen in 'All That Jazz') and Queen Latifah, both of whom seem out of place in this white-bread world.

But this is Chicago, and the mellow tone of ""West Side Story"" or ""Moulin Rouge"" is left apart to the spotlight-smokey atmosphere of the 1930's cabarets. And you can bet that you won't be left out of the storm. Sporting magnificent coreographies right from the start, ""Chicago"" is a thrill ride right from the guts, giving a warm breath of heart to everyone who missed the music and looks of the Prohibition era. Reneé Zelwegger has all the light, but she dims right next to the power of Catherine Zeta-Jones, who stands out and looks like she wants to grab the audience and whisper the lyrics in your ear. Richard Gere is surprising to say the least, emerging as a singer AND dancer. I could say that in a movie with its name, the city of Chicago doesn't show up too often, I could say that I expected more cabaret-action, and more period detail, but you won't care when you see it: the magnificent and jaw-dropping set pieces are all so perfectly timed and coreographed that you won't think about details.

154,Silverzero,"Glitzy, radiant musical sparkles in glamour and frivolity.",10,15 August 2003,"The stage musical- this is a genre that was common in the `MGM Golden Era' or the 40's and 50's. But as time went by, attitudes changed and people became more cynical and focused. And in the high-tech sceptical world of today, such a sunshine, happy smile utopia seems inappropriate. `Chicago' is unlikely to revive this dusty old genre, but it certainly is a welcome attempt. Based on the original Bob Fosse stage play, this plays out like a normal musical. While it is often considered as a `visually impressive' picture, the narrative that follows is a strong one.Winning 6 Oscars at this year's Academy Awards, I'm surprised to say that this deserved all of its awards. The most attractive feature is the stylish production design and lavish cinematography that give the film a lot of glamour. But it has often been misinterpreted. While the characters are vapid and superficial, the underlying narrative is a much deeper one. The presence of grit has often been overlooked. `Chicago' is an adaptation of a popular musical, but also a bold satire on the shallowness of showbiz and the flaws of the law system.The weakest point is probably the script. With song and dances taking place every 2-3 minutes, the script must just make up a few lines of dialogue that will signal a plot advance. I'm not a big fan of musicals, but this is thoroughly engaging throughout, right from the big bang of an opening. Perhaps that is because the narrative is bolstered by the visual beauty, but either way, it will have your attention. The feature is directed by newcomer Rob Marshall. He presents a unique blend of the styles of Bob Fosse (the traditional stage play) and Baz Luhrmann (bizarre costumes and numbers) but the amateurish characteristics show. While he does a fairly good job, the camerawork is flawed on occasions.I have to admit I'm not a big fan of anyone in the cast. But most of them do a glossy, solid job. I think Melanie Griffith would have pulled off the part well, but Renee Zellwegger's ditzy interpretation of Roxie Hart is right on the mark. Yet compared to the heavy dramatics of Nicole and Julianne, the performance comes across as a little shallow. Richard Gere is simply perfect for the part of suave lawyer Billy Flynn. Easily the best performance on show goes to Catherine Zeta-Jones ice goddess, Velma Kelly. She simply makes for the perfect b*tch and was totally deserving of the Oscar. John C. Reilly and Queen Latifah are okay (though the latter is too young a choice) but easily upstaged by Zeta-Jones. The Oscar nom's they received certainly are questionable. The support ranges from the underused (Dominic West, Lucy Liu) to the totally miscast (Taye Diggs anyone?).Perhaps it's the fact that I'm unfamiliar with the musical itself, but I was very impressed with `Chicago'. As a film, it was (slightly) better than `Gangs of New York', `Adaptation.' etc. but has often been misunderstood. If you like musicals, you'll love this. Even if you don't, there's a good chance that you'll take a shine to Chicago. Or if you just want some good glitzy fun, this is the film for you. My IMDb rating: 8.1/10.",Chicago
155,shanfloyd,Sheer entertainment.,7,12 April 2003,"The genre ""musical"" has been quite rare in standard Hollywood movies in recent years. Perhaps because there are things called ""music videos"" conquering the TV channels and the appeal of serious musical films is not so much to the teenage community. Whatever may be the true reason, ""Chicago"" is treated differently by the audience simply because it brings a fresh air in Hollywood. Though definitely not touching, this spectacular account of 1920's city media, its mass hype, its entertainment is absolutely fascinating just to watch, and question oneself no more.The story is very simple, but the presentation is brilliant. The introduction of every character, the twist in every incident and the duel in every mind are brilliantly depicted through dance and jazzy music. Director Rob Marshall did a wonderful job in this case. Superb set and costume designing assisted him good. But all credits should go only to his creative mind. Introducing the tap dance sequence during the trial is, in a word, a winner. There should not be any doubt about his Academy Award nomination. Cinematography also deserves full praise. The last dance sequence of Velma and Roxie is the burning example of the mastery of this art.
Coming to the acting, I must say there is less scope of acting in musicals than in any other drama type of movies. But all the major five, Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah and John Rilley did wonderful jobs. But I'll specially mention Richard Gere first. He performance absolutely overwhelmed me with sheer ability and character gravity. You cannot imagine anyone else in that role after you see the movie. Queen Latifah, in my opinion, should have been the choice of the Academy judges rather than Zeta-Jones. John Rilley was fascinating to watch as Roxie's naive and simple husband. The movie is of a new kind of taste. Once enjoyed, one is bound to forget it in short time. But during the two hours you spent at the theatre, you've watched the absolute entertainment.",Chicago
156,macpherr,Oscar night: and .. The Oscar goes go Renée Zellweger!,10,17 January 2003,"Billy Flynn, Richard Gere (Pretty Woman) is your typical lawyer looking for money and publicity. I was not surprised by his performance because he was the under study for John Travolta in `Grease.' He sings beautifully and dances well. He stated that this movie was pure fun. I believe it was. I wish I was in it! It looks like it was a real blast! Velma Kelly,  Catherine Zeta Jones (Traffic)  is one of those characters that you love to hate. Her performance is excellent. All I could think of was that Michael Douglas has good taste. She has done theater and musicals in Great Britain. I knew she was a singer and a danger.Renée Zellweger , (Bridget Jones' Diary, One True Thing) is absolutely deserving of an Oscar for her performance as  Roxanne 'Roxie' Hart. Actually she should have gotten one for `Bridget Jones.'  It is great to hear that she will be doing the sequel. Another movie to be memorized. I have watched the first movie so many times that I memorized the script! I LOVE Renée. I love the roles she picks, her down to earth attitude. She is a beautiful lady. I have watched most of her movies and she is believable in all of them. She is a serious actress and she is not just there acting cute. Nothing would please me more to hear on Golden Globe and Oscar night: and .. The Oscar goes go Renée Zellweger! I will be jumping up and down. There has to be a tie if someone else is to win. It belongs to her. There is no way around it. She MUST win! Queen Latifah, ( The Bone Collector) Matron Mamm' Morton, was the surprise. I am not familiar with her work at all. Nice job. Mary Sunshine, Christine Baranski (Cybill) did what I expected her to do. I loved her part on Cybill and think that there should have been a spin off series with her  as Maryann Thorpe. As far as I can tell I watched the series because of Maryann. I have heard her sing and knew that she was good. John C. Reilly Amos Hart ( The Perfect Storm) was so cute with his little dance. I hope that musicals do come back because they are so much fun. Interestingly after all those years of trying to do Chicago they came up with the PERFECT cast. I love the way the music comes in as the chanters are thinking. It flows really well. It is now like one of those Elvis Presley musicals where he starts singing out of the blue in a boat with his hair completely dry. To me this movie is a winner and deserves as many awards as possible. I give it a 10!",Chicago
157,christian94,Musical vs. Movie,8,6 February 2003,"I have seen the musical on Broadway early in January of this year (with the new cast) and have just seen the movie yesterday night (a month later). I would like to make a few comparisons and comments.Firstly, I found that I overall liked the musical slightly better. Besides the fact that I had front row seat and really felt part of the action, I thought the musical had better signing, better dancing and was also quite funnier than the movie.Secondly, acting-wise the film seemed to have uneven performances where acted scenes and signing scenes often were of different caliber. In the musical, the acting seemed to flow more into and out of the music, keeping the character whole without too much effort.Thirdly, if you compare song by song, most were better done on stage. Only the spectacular ""Roxie"" really blew me away in the movie with stellar lighting, a nice concept and René's best signing number. ""All that Jazz"" was markedly better in the movie with the sly editing with Roxie's love affair, and perfectly preceded by Velma's rush arrival and star-studded entrance on stage. The other numbers which worked in the film were the also both very well-edited ""funny honey"" (Roxie on the Piano was a nice touch) and the before last song, ""nowadays"", that ended short in a failed Roxie audition, before continuing with Velma. The actor which did ""Mister Cellophane"" on stage was simply incredible and much more believable (note that his character was more developed in the longer running musical than in the movie). Billy Zhane who does Billy Flynn on Broadway had much more class and charisma for ""All I care about"" than the struggling Richard Gere. Roxie looked much more like a puppet being ventriloquized on stage (excellent performance indeed) than pretty-faced René Zellweger in ""We both reached for the gun"". Velma danced, acted and connived much better on stage than Catherine Zeta-Jones in ""I can't do it alone"" (you actually believed she was doing a duo alone). The ""Cell Block Tango"" did not suffer from Mya's bad acting or the unconvincing Hungarian. ""Razzle Dazzle"" was much better for Gere than ""All I care about"", but Zhane was still the master razzle-dazzler. I did enjoy the movie however. The music was well incorporated, the editing and directing choices were fantastic and fresh, Taye Diggs added a lot with his introductions, the cinematography was plush and the story flowed pretty well. The acting was good in general. Zellweger was great and Gere did well in his non-signing scenes. Zeta-Jones showed well Velma's conceit and bitchiness, but her beauty did not unfortunately make up for her lack of stage-caliber dancing. Queen Latifah was a good Mama, but could not hit the notes like the incredible voices of the stage production. Flynn was more cunning in the movie and Gere made this work, and the tap dance trial sequence was very well executed (so that Roxie was not). The movie showed a more innocent, naive, influentiable Roxie which worked well for René, but I still prefer the stage version of Roxie who is more complex, more intelligent, slightly crazy and much funnier.If you liked the movie go see the musical. If you liked the musical, still go see the movie.",Chicago
158,ssssgelojun,extreme madness,8,4 April 2020,"The extreme madness, the hormones are surging in the gutter. ""All SINS have been forgiven in advance, and all have been viciously permitted."" The movie captures that phrase with great accuracy. In an age of entertainment to the death, it's too important to hold the line.",Chicago
159,luke-a-mcgowan,"The phrase ""owned the screen"" is used too lightly...unless for Catherine Zeta-Jones in this film",9,2 February 2016,"Chicago might be one of the most dazzling films I've ever seen. Rob Marshall's love for choreography is shown in every facet of his film's editing and cinematography. Brilliant directorial decisions, such as the use of red handkerchiefs (and a white one for the innocent Turkish woman) to represent blood makes the dances visually stunning and narratively seamless. The blending of the musical with the story is utterly wonderful, the ""musical inside Roxie's head"" idea that Marshall pitched works like a treat.The film would never succeed without its incredible cast. Renee Zellwegger plays Roxie with a sweet naivety reminiscent of Dorothy Comingmore in Citizen Kane, and over time the sweetness remains whilst the naivety is replaced by cold cunning and haughty pride. She's able to sing and dance and charm the audience, and her portrayal of Roxie is one of cinema's most alluring vixens. The phrase ""own the screen"" is used too lightly, but when talking about Catherine Zeta-Jones' performance it almost isn't enough. A seductive, villainous prima donna, every frame of the movie bearing Velma Kelly is better than one that does not. Zeta-Jones plays Kelly in an extremely cool and detached manner, but in the latter stages of the film it becomes even better. When she launches into ""But I Can't Do It Alone"", her assurances that ""its swell with tow people"" she lurches into an almost deranged plea for attention that is funny and almost maddening to watch. Her delivery of the screenplay's lines is perfect, and every movement has purpose and zazz. Outside the two main ladies, the casting is no less brilliant. Richard Gere was a perfect choice for the sleazy lawyer Billy Flynn. His finest moments come in his cross-examination tap sequence of Velma late in the piece, where his manic energy keys the whole film to its magnificent climax. John C. Reilly steals the entire film as Roxie's dumb, innocent, heartbreakingly faithful husband Amos, and should have walked home with the Oscar instead of Chris Cooper. Queen Latifah was an inspired casting choice for Matron Mama Morton, a character whose femininity and grace was just as essential as her physical dominance. Lucy Liu and Christine Baranski are memorable in small roles, whilst Dominic West is the only weak link in the cast as an evil caricature. Rob Marshall's set pieces - helped by the production team and cinematographers - are a delight to behold, especially Roxie's strutting around a mirror black stage before her titular song. The placement of backup dancers around the courtroom - especially around the judge - is brilliant, and the only flaw i can raise with his choreography was to have Amos sitting while he shouts about Roxie's infidelity at the beginning of the film. He should have been on his feet, so that his body language matched properly with his tone.The film's editors are to be commended for their job of weaving the musical and non-musical segments together at the same time that they time the cuts with the musical cues. Whilst there is an awkward one-month time skip at the beginning of the film, it's only a minor flaw in the grand scheme of things. The original song ""I Move On"" fits so well with the rest of the music that you'd never point to it as the one that was written for the film. The film's screenplay is delightful, weaving exposition amongst the music and saving the talking moments for other events. The lines perfectly match the characters, whether it be Roxie's vanity, Velma's delusion, Amos' sweet stupidity or Billy's self-confidence. The law side of the film is almost hilariously neglected, with the defence counsel objecting to a single leading question when there's actually been about twenty already. But because the film is about vanity, I don't even care.",Chicago
160,tributarystu,Razzle Dazzle,6,13 September 2003,"I will not make out of this review an open protest to the Academy Awards. I'll just say: man, you sucked as usually. Chicago is a good movie, which excels in the domain of cinematography and directing, but which is certainly not Oscar material story-wise. It's a story about immorality, but unfortunately the conclusion you draw after the movie is that immorality is allowed if it's for the sake of being SOMEONE. Of course, this is not right. I'll just quickly point out what I liked in the movie. I liked Richard Gere, who is quite impressive in his stupid kind of way, I like Reilly, but I am disappointed that his current part is very similar to the one in The Hours(which is, by the way, crap). Eventually Cat was good too and I guess I should be pleased she got the Oscar and not someone else. I think this could hardly have been a non-oscar revolving review considering that this movie was considered by the Academy the best film of 2002. I can not agree with this because The Pianist is much better. Gangs is quite an even match for Chicago, but only in an eventual ""fight"" for second place. Plainly speaking, both are mediocre with Chicago flaring occasionally and giving it a necessary ""boom"". Sure, Chicago is a fun film but it is not Oscar material. The story is ""sinful"" and even very hard to believe. Dancing and singing come together fine, but sometime there is no real reason for ""dancing and singing"". Compared to Moulin Rouge it's a great improvement, because something actually happens here, but it's still far away from being great. It's worth an 8, especially for the impressive ""technical"" departments, like make up, directing, cinematography, but not much more. This is Chicago.",Chicago
161,ikanboy,Razzamatazz!!!,8,18 January 2003,"A great musical in the Bob Fosse tradition, even though Fosse didn't choreograph the movie his dark, cynical tone permeates the film, which also owes homage to ""Cabaret"".I'd heard that the three stars all did their own singing and dancing (the latter rather obviously) and they all did a great job. Zeta Jones is a singer/hoofer from way back, and Gere is very talented musically on three instruments. Zellweger had the furthest to go and sounded a lot like Bernadette Peters. My only problem with her is that she has a tendency to scrunch up her face and goes from cute to real ugly real fast.The story is a cynical, but not far fetched, look at the American legal system when it's under the eye of the media, as shown in the final trial scene and most tellingly in the oh so wicked ""Puppet/Marrionettes"" number. It's ironic that the Illinois governor has just gutted death row!
I found the musical numbers were masterfully placed so as to accentuate, not slow, the plot. I actually wanted more numbers!",Chicago
162,Jerique,Awful musical film...,2,11 September 2010,"As far as musicals goes, Chicago has to be the worst ever created. I would give this film a one out of ten, but I enjoyed the song ""He Had It Coming"" and I felt it deserved a one-point boost. This film was a big winner of Oscars and it's what increased my suspicion of the Academy Awards being nothing but a popularity contest. As of 2010, I no longer trust nor base my opinion of movies on the Oscars. Chicago is undeserving of the Oscars it won.The plot lacks real substance and it gets mixed up with horrendous editing and interweaving song/dance numbers while trying to develop drama. It doesn't bode well because it kinda makes you go, ""what's happening now?"" Although, I was able to follow the movie, I found it ridiculous to have a scene in jail escalate into a song. I found it inane to have a random unsatisfying song to come from an unknown character.The plot is so tepid as well. I found it very bland and boring. I'm not saying this is the worst movie of all time but it's definitely up there in the top ten worst movies for me. I definitely think this is worst musical ever created. You can't sing along with the songs if you watch it for the second time (although, I won't) because they aren't catchy (save for He Had It Coming).I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. If you're a person who loves musicals, steer clear of this one because it's not good at all.",Chicago

I was impressed with Catherine and her performance as Velma and Richard was a pretty convincing Billy, but the film failed to rank in my top favorite musicals. Renee's acting was all right at times, but not the best she could do and her singing was lackluster. I purchased the original 1975 Broadway album a few months and listened to the songs and that was by far better than the movie's actors. I will still give credit to the actors of the film for their attempt to make the film a successful adaptation. However, in my humble opinion, the film was not an Oscar-worthy movie.",Chicago
164,Bob Pr.,"Satirical, irreverent, very adult, & innovative ---> GREAT!!",10,4 November 2011,"Stars: Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, John C. Reilly, others. Velma (Zeta-Jones), a dancing, singing star in an act with her sister, is on murderer's row after shooting her sister and Velma's lover when she caught them doing a number not part of their act. Roxie (Zellweger) is a wannabe star who cheats on her husband (Reilly) when an acquaintance (in order to bed her) promises to get her into show business. When Roxie finds out he's deceived her, she shoots him and also goes to the Murderer's Row for women where Mama (Latifah) is in charge. Billy (Gere) is the manipulating lawyer who represents Velma and Roxie in their trials.This is a very adult, satirical & cynical, irreverent & innovative musical set in 1920s era Chicago that makes fun of attorneys & the legal/court process, all aspects of the news media, fidelity & monogamy--and probably several other things, like traditional virtues.Zellweger plays a talented but not very bright young woman (Roxie) who VERY much wants to be a dancing, singing star in the '20s Chicago night clubs. Periodically, as the narrative unfolds, Roxie transposes many scenes she's seeing into a singing, dancing musical version in her mind's eye--and this film brings us along to view Roxie's visions.GREAT cast, many great numbers, possibly my favorite is Gere as a puppeteer with Zellweger on his lap--or maybe Queen Latifah singing ""When You Take Care of Mama""--or maybe others?My vote: 10+ of 10 stars.",Chicago

We do not care about the characters at all because they are not real characters with emotion, just murderesses for Hollywood appeal. The numbers are fast-moving and get so repetitive that the end number is literally non-existent. There's nothing genuine about this storytelling and nothing that breathes either old Hollywood or even the crude new Hollywood. What's left is a bunch of fake singing and a boring story with no characters we can connect to or care about even in the slightest.

166,gregeichelberger,Take an excursion to 'Chicago' for the holidays,7,27 June 2012,"Review originally published on Dec. 20, 2002:Late in the newest Miramax musical release, ""Chicago,"" Richard Gere sings (yes, really) ""Razzle-dazzle 'em."" That's what this film does to its audience. It's like cotton candy and sno-cones. They're not particularly good for the body, but boy do they taste great while you're munching on them.In cinema's musical lexicon, it draws more for the recent ""Moulin Rouge"" than a more superior effort, like say, ""Cabaret."" which won Bob Fosse a Best Director Academy Award (against ""The Godfather's"" Francis Ford Coppola, to boot).""Rouge"" is a jumbled, often disjointed assemblage with the irritating and lazy distraction of using modern songs in the movie's late 19th century timeline (I despised that). Pure glitz and style — clearly over substance.""Cabaret,"" on the other hand, was based upon ""Berlin Stories"" and filmed with the consummate care only Fosse could give and is certainly one of motion picture's best modern musicals.And while ""Chicago"" (based on the 1975 Broadway production) is not great, it is fun. Plus, if you can overlook the scant, clichéd storyline, you will most likely thoroughly enjoy the show. Although do not be surprised if this one garners several Academy Award nominations (including, dare I say, a best Picture nod?).Roxie Hart (a platinum Renee Zellweger casting a much more glamorous shadow from her previous dumpy roles in ""Jerry Macguire"" and ""Bridgette Jones's Diary,"" among others) is the wide-eyed lounge singer wannabe determined to be a first-class success in the Second City. She's a ditzy slut (who also seems a bit retarded) and has no problem taking advantage of using and taking advantage of everyone in her life to realize her dream.This especially includes her cuckolded, sad-sack of a husband, Amos (John C. Reilly, ""Magnolia,"" ""Gangs Of New York""). To climb to the top, though, she will have to overcome current sensation, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who is stunning with her flapper 'do and seems nothing short of poured into her fashionable dance outfits.However, in a case of pure plot convenience, both women are jailed for murder (Roxie for shooting her cad of a lover; Velma for killing her unfaithful boyfriend and her own sister), and are placed in the famed ""Murderesses Row.""Enter fast-talking mouthpiece Billy Flynn (Gere), a sleazy but sharp shyster who has never lost a case, He even gets Amos, who tries to protect his wife at first, to pay for her defense. Both Roxie and Velma not only crave Flynn's legal expertise, but the priceless publicity that comes with it.They also try to ingratiate themselves with the prison matron, Mama Morely (a terrific performance by ""rapper"" and comic ""Queen"" Latifa).That's pretty much it for plot, folks. It's nothing that we haven't already seen in any of the old ""Broadway Melody"" pictures dating back to the late 1920s. That is not why someone would want to see this picture, though. It's the wonderful sets, splendid cinematography, amazing choreography and great songs which will fill the venues showing this movie. Each song, except for the Zeta-Jones' opening ""All That Jazz"" number is introduced as a fantasy, and as if part of a nightclub cabaret show. And, instead of cringing when these tunes stop the action and stall the plot, the viewer (even those not familiar with the tunes) actually looks forward to each one.Even those sung by Gere (""All I Care About Is Love"" and ""Razzle-Dazzle"") and Reilly (""Mr. Cellophane"").More impressive, however, are the efforts of Zeta-Jones, Zellweger and Latifa, who kick out the jams like real troupers.",Chicago

The music and dancing bring to mind Cabaret, the acting is very good and the story is involving. This is an adaptation of a play that premiered in 1975, which in turn was based on a 1942 film, ""Roxie Hart"" which itself was based on a 1927 silent film, ""Chicago"", which was based on a play and a book by Maurine Watkins. The principal players in this film do a dandy job of acting, which is to be expected. That they also sing well is a real surprise. The DVD transfer of this film is excellent and the sound fantastic.

168,ldavis-2,points at the stupidity of its own hype,1,12 September 2003,"In Chicago the bad guys win, and the good guys get kicked to the curb -- a warped affirmation of everything that Hollywood holds near and dear!Zellweger tries to make Roxie a victim. This is a fatal mistake: Roxie is completely amoral, as cold as the snow that blankets the city. You can admire her gumption, but, if you try to make the audience feel sorry for her, you lose them. I think Zellweger has a fear of not being liked, hence, her making such a disastrous choice.OTOH, Zeta-Jones and Latifah don't fall into that trap. Velma and Mama don't care if you like them. Zeta-Jones brings the ruthlessness and self-assuredness Velma calls for, while Latifah infuses Mama with a wink of mischief and a heap of homo-eroticism. But was Zeta-Jones's performance Oscar-worthy? I don't think so.Why wasn't Kitty's name/background changed to reflect Lui's ethnicity? Her appearance and WASP-name, coupled with Marshall recycling Velma's story, and Lui's attempt to out-bitch the leading ladies, is jarring. And you forget her 30 seconds after she exits.As for Hollywood's favorite Buddhist, Richard Gere does what he does best -- being stiff and smarmy.With a title that cries out for wide-open spaces, why does Marshall stick the audience into a corner when the story uses the history of the great city as a metaphor for life in it? In his unimaginative staging - ripping off nearly every movie musical in the process - there's little raunch, no heat, and a confused rhythm that no amount of machine-gun editing can hide.BTW, no woman in Cook County has ever been sentenced to death, much less, ""swung.""",Chicago

Oh, and Queen Latifah has a terrific show stopping number that shows us that plus size women can be as sexy as any size 2 model!The storyline, however, is lacking in morals. We are rooting for a woman to get away with murder...Oh, excuse me....two women.

170,Michael Fargo,A boring disappointment,6,31 December 2002,"When I saw the trailer for ""Chicago"" some months ago, I was full of anticipation. Hollywood can mangle a Broadway musical (""The Fantasticks"") or send us soaring (""Cabaret""). I'll admit that the choice of Zellweger and Zeta-Jones heading the lead of a cast of a notoriously rigorous dance vehicle gave me pause...and I should have stuck with that pause.
From the beginning, the camera shies away from letting either Zellweger or Zeta-Jones finish one single step (much less two). I remember a dance instructor commenting on Vanessa Redgrave's performance in ""Isadora,"" ""...she doesn't have a dancer's hands."" Well, neither Zellweger or Zeta-Jones have any part of their anatomy that fulfills the criteria for being a dancer. Ms. Zeta-Jones (who must be one of Hollywood's most photogenic beauties) even resorts to ""walking like an Egyptian."" Yes, she does that well, but so does most of the general population.
Zellweger is asked to carry the weight of this entire production and she can't even keep time to the music. The editors try. They shatter the musical sequences and reassemble them to some semblence of a rhythm, but it only calls attention to what the cast lacks. Vocally, Zellweger has some appeal, but it isn't enough to compensate for what she's required to do here.
Visually, this is a rehash of Fosse's ""Cabaret."" And an airless uninspired rehash at that. There's no emotional payoff, no involvement with anything going on on screen. Even with the failed adaptation of ""Sweet Charity"" to film, there were thrilling moments interspersed. Those were delivered because there was talent--musical comedy talent--by the cast. But here there's none.",Chicago
171,manendra-lodhi,Amazing film.,10,8 July 2012,"A film that reminded me of the film featuring the Beatles – ""A hard day's night"". Compared to both I liked this one more. It mixes the flow of the story with musical numbers which are really nice. The story at some times will look at sometimes to be too much made and that something like that should not happen in world. But leaving this fact you will find that you will be entertained fully. Usually I don't like songs with the film but these films are kind of an exception. The film follows the story of a girl who wanted to be celebrity but unfortunately it is not easy to do that. But the girl has inborn talent in her. She views a lot of things though musical performances and so the film is taking you to a ride which involves the imaginations of the girl. The editing is the second thing that has to be praised and is fully responsible for making the film so enjoyable. The acting is top notch and and all the characters are tightly knitted together. And in the last I would also mention about the amazing screenplay without which nothing could have been possible.",Chicago
172,galensaysyes,Busy,3,19 September 2003,"I don't get why everybody loved this. Mostly it seemed to me a fake. Or, put another way, it was a producer's movie, crammed with Stuff, most of it okay but not great, spinning around a center that was even more okay, and even more not-great. Mainly it was just busy, and appeared designed for busy people--people who are too busy for music. To me the appeal of musicals is simple: I like to listen to people sing and watch them dance, and to experience being in a place where people communicate through song and dance. I couldn't easily to do that here. For one thing, ehe dancing was shot and edited so it couldn't be seen clearly; I can't remember another song-and-dance movie that seemed to take so little visual pleasure in dancing. And then, the musical numbers were constantly being interrupted by cutaways to dramatic scenes. The latter weren't very good in themselves; they looked as if they were still in rehearsal. And what they were telling duplicated what the dancing was telling, so that, besides getting in each other's way, each eliminated the need for the other. What with all the back and forth, the characters and the story never had a chance to register, and I had to take my bearings from what I remembered of the old movie.A lot of things that would probably work on stage didn't work in this film because its style, or mix of styles, was poorly defined. Sometimes I felt as if I were watching a taped a stage play, other times I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to be watching. The leads seemed able to sing and dance, more or less, but none with enough skill to carry a musical, or sell a number, or establish a character. A few things were good: the song by Queen Latifah; the song by the abandoned husband; and even the finale by the two stars, when they finally get up something worth seeing and the camera allows us to see it.

That's the true story in 1927; played so well be Catherine Zeta-Jones as Verma, and Renee Zellinger as Roxie Hart.  Richard Gere plays the defense lawyer, and I was soo surprised that he does project a great baritone voice.  Roxie's husband is played by John C. Reilly, and he has a commendable voice; he sang ""Mr. Cellophane"", but they cut out most of his song;  what a shame because that's one of my favorite songs. The pace of this musical is very fast and enjoyable.  It doesn't seem to last long enough... I feel there must have been too many cuts.  Why don't they put them back in?

Catherine Zeta Jones and Queen Latifah sparkled in their musical numbers.  There were so many good parts to this movie that I can't remember them all.  People have compared this to Moulin Rouge...but I hated that movie, and this one is more like a traditional musical (with its own original music!)but updated for a 21st century audience.  Highly recommended.",Chicago
175,blrnani,Very pertinent to today's USA,6,16 October 2019,"There are excellent acting performances in this lively little musical, which sees CZJ and RZ at the height of their powers.
What put me off was the level of cynicism of the whole endeavour. As Richard Gere puts it, the world is a 3-ring circus and you just have to razzle dazzle 'em. Consequently, truth as a concept becomes irrelevant and everything's about the spin.
Given that assessment, it's hardly surprising that the USA (mainly but not exclusively, as so many other countries take the USA's lead) is in the state it is right now, with people fighting to restore some core values to society while fearing that one cannot make any headway without resorting to the same old tricks of the cynical game.
I also saw ""Gone Girl"" recently and putting the two films together helps explain why nobody believes anything anymore - especially if it's recorded, as that's when people put on their best 'show'.",Chicago

Best performance - Renee Zellweger. As Roxie, Zellweger carries the show on her skinny shoulders and should have won Best Actress. Catherine Zeta-Jones looks a bit fleshy in her Oscar winning performance, although she does fine. John C. Reilly is pathetic as called for, and Richard Gere finally found a role that suits his ""smarmy"" personality.I think this is the Best Musical in years with interesting plot and well-directed pace. The big songs are spectacular and the quiet ones (the few) are touching and cynical in a tough Chicago world.",Chicago
177,ilovedolby,One can't help but tap their feet to the jazzy music and laugh at its silly form of humor.,8,8 February 2003,"Much hype has been generated about Chicago for several different reasons. For one, the film has great performances in song and dance. Second, the film helps to revive the old era of the musical in cinema. Third, because of the Golden Globe awards that it took home for Best Actor, Richard Gere, Best Actress, Rene Zellweger, and Best Motion Picture in the genre of a musical or comedy. Whether you are the kind of person to listen to hype or not, this film is grand in scale and certainly gives it's audience a really pleasing show. One can't help but tap their feet to the jazzy music and laugh at its silly form of humor. Chicago joins the ranks of only a few musicals that have been released in recent years, Moulin Rouge being the biggest. But unlike Moulin Rouge, with it's excellent cinematography, use of popular music, and great direction from Baz Luhrmann, Chicago follows the more traditional form of a musical in film. And yet, that is not entirely accurate because the film feels like it's being performed on a stage, even though the exhibition is in a theater. 	The story follows that of a young woman, Roxie Hart, played by Rene Zellweger, who dreams of being a singer/dancer on the Vaudeville stages of Chicago during the 1920s. However, while having an affair, she ends up murdering her boyfriend during a quarrel and is quickly sent to prison. When she enters the joint,' she encounters several other women who have been sent away for murder, including that of her idol, Velma Kelly, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones. Also while in prison, Roxie meets the prison warden, `Mama' Morton, played by Queen Latifah. Mama is basically the woman in prison who sees to the security of the inmates, and the wants of the inmates...for a price, of course. Having sympathy for Roxie, `Mama' sets Roxie up with a slick attorney who has never lost a case, Billy Flynn, played by Richard Gere. It's now up to Mr. Flynn to get Roxie off of death row for murder, and just maybe, Roxie can achieve her dream of being a stage star. 	The performances in Chicago are wonderful. Filled with music and fun, the actors seem to really enjoy taking a break from the traditional forms of acting to try something different. John C. Reilly, who has been in such films as The Perfect Storm and Gangs of New York, portrays Roxie's dim-witted and pitiful husband, Amos Hart. Reilly has appeared in several shows on Broadway and the guy does a great job in this film, as well. Richard Gere is hilarious as the Roxie's attorney, Billy Flynn, who loves nothing more than to put on a great show trial. Rene Zellweger, finally getting recognition in the form of a Best Actress Award for her portrayal as Roxie, does a fantastic job singing and dancing. She was nominated for her performance in 2001s romantic comedy hit, Bridget Joneses Diary. Catherine Zeta-Jones also does a superb job as Velma Kelly, portraying the sexy dancer/singer sent to prison. Her dancing moves are excellent and the moves add a real sexual tension to the film. 	Chicago was directed by Rob Marshall, who's only other directing credit is to the 1999 television version of Annie, which starred Kathy Bates and Victor Garber. Marshall served as Chicago's choreographer, as well as the choreographer for other television films such as Annie, Cinderella and Mrs. Santa Claus. Chicago will undoubtedly bring him fame in the world of cinema, and hopefully he will bring us more great musicals in the future. In the end, Chicago proves to be an amusing film for it's musical numbers, humor, and great acting. ***",Chicago

Welcome to ""Chicago,"" where the editor cut during action to give the illusion of dance.In scene after scene, the three dead-legged principals— Zellweger, Zeta-J., and Gere --bust a move, strike a pose, and leave the musicians, the D.P. and the editor to do their abracadabra thing.When Astaire and Kelly made movies—not to mention Cyd Charisse, Vera-Ellen, Bill Robinson, Ann Miller, Shirley Temple, Leslie Caron, Hines, Travolta, etc., etc., even Groucho and Cagney!—they seemed to dance with the camera. Long graceful shots revealed their skills, and let the dancing flow with the music.""Chicago,"" like ""Moulin Rouge"" before it, rarely lets even three or two full seconds of dance occur at a stretch-- as musicals go, it doesn't get lamer than that. Most unfortunately, the staccato editing is even used during sequences with the chorus of highly skilled dancers, including Susan Misner and Denise Faye. The entertainment value of ""Chicago,"" minimal as it is, rests on exposed female flesh-- or in Zellweger's case, skeleton.By the way, they can't sing either. The rest of the cast, including Queen Latifah and Taye Diggs, do seem skilled with both feet and voice, but they're tossed into the editor's Final Cut Pro blender, too, so we can't know for sure.",Chicago

Catherine Zeta-Jones deserved her oscar so much, she was fantastic. Richard Gere is highly underrated he was excellent in singing and acting. Renee Zellwegger was excellent as Roxie Hart, her acting was great, though her singing could be a little better on a couple of occasions, but remember she isnt suppose to be the best singer.

182,patryk-czekaj,A musical for the ages,8,12 May 2012,"I've never been a big fun of musicals, so I approached Chicago with a bit of skepticism. Actually, I only got a chance to watch it, because my father is a huge admirer of this movie. And as a specifically curious son, I wanted to know what made this movie so entertaining to him.And yes, now I may certainly say that I see what can be so compelling about it. I'm even not surprised that it got as many as six Academy Awards. All of them were well deserved.For starters, I must say that the main plot is very decently structured. The story presents a somehow dark and gangster-like tale of corruption, harsh love and a constant struggle to stay on top. There are some fine laughable moments too, but it's definitely not one of those cute musical comedies that tell a beautiful story through whopping big sing-and-dance acts. I love the fact that all of the singing parts aren't just some out-of-context video clips, but they intertwine with the whole plot beautifully. My favorite one is definitely the Cell Block Tango, which introduces all the girls in jail, as they present all of the 'naughty' things they did to deserve this punishment.The art direction and costumes are amazing. Those two factors combined together give a tremendous impression of Chicago in the 1920's.Rob Marshall did a great job directing the gorgeous dancing sequences. They are really fun to watch, due to the very creative choreography. I must also say that most of the songs created for this film are catchy and really pleasant to listen while, for example, driving a car. Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones can sing, no doubt about it. And the performances that they give certainly demand consideration. Chicago also teaches a very valuable lesson: everybody can have his own five minutes of fame, but there are consequences attached to that. Some people achieve glory through great accomplishments, and are able to stay on top for a long time. Other, less talented, fellows would do almost everything to have their own moment of high-life. Killing a person is on the list too.All in all, if you are ready for some action accompanied by a lot of creative singing parts, be sure to watch Chicago and you won't regret it. It's a great show and it doesn't stop until the very last minute.",Chicago
183,TuckMN,Reinvention of the American Movie Musical,10,7 January 2003,"Completely prepared to not like this film (Moulin Rouge' being the big over-rated stinker of last year) I was astounded by the artistry and sheer spectacle of what has to be one of the best films of the year.While Catherine Zeta-Jones has been the primary focus of the adverts, the show really belongs to Renée Zellweger.  She proves she can dance, sing and act.Ms Zellweger has a certain `Marilyn' aspect to her performance  not only in her vocal skills but in her look as well. While Queen Latifah is granted only one big musical number on her own she astounds with a characterization of Mae West that will drop your jaw.  She is more than her rap' persona will ever consent to  she rocks!There is incredible interplay of colour in this film  hot pink contrasting with cool blue to send a message of what is right and what is wrong  theoretically. The music by Fred Ebb and John Kander is timeless  true classics  though contemporary composer Danny Elfman (`Rugrats' amongst many other titles) provides his own sense of artistry.Everyone (providing none of the singing voices were dubbed) can sing his or her heart out  While Ms Zellweger is not the greatest vocalist ever she certainly knows how to sell a song and make you believe that she is the woman wronged.' The Greek chorus' of the women behind bars' is absolutely astounding  providing not just a couple of great musical numbers but also supplying a story line that helps to move everything along They can also dance like no one else I have ever seen.Richard Gere is utilized as much as his talent allows  not a lot  but enough to make the story work.My primary concern before I saw this film was `Please, don't wreck the story.'  Not only was the story not wrecked' this is one of the best films I have seen this year.",Chicago

My favorites include Camelot and Fiddler on the Roof - along with my all-time favorite movie - Little Shop of Horrors.I was thrilled a couple years ago that Moulan Rouge did so well. I hoped it might usher in a new era of the musical. With Chicago, it seemed to have done just that. This movie is exceptional in a number of ways. But, the single BEST thing about it was the choreography. I was riveted to the frenzied action on many occasions.Richard Gere stole the show as far as I am concerned, but, I thought all of the singers were fine. Jones was especially impressive with here energy! There was hardly a story at all - merely, a basic outline to fit the songs into, but who cares? How much story line is there in Cats???

186,Benjamin_Cox,Sounds good but it's a bit bizarre for my tastes - 60%,6,17 April 2006,"As a budding screenwriter myself, I'd would dearly love to write a good, old-fashioned, Prohibition gangster movie. No, seriously - a time when bullets flew across Broadway, dames were as deadly as the guys and Mr Capone ruled the beautiful city of Chicago. There is no doubt that this sort of atmosphere is exactly what ""Chicago"" tries to resurrect and to a certain degree, it does. But this is a surrealist musical journey that will either grab your attention like an exploding Tommy Gun or have you wishing you could sleep with the fishes.Renée Zellweger plays Roxie Hart, a girl dreaming of hitting the big time like her showgirl idol Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones). But before long, she is jailed for the murder of her lover and sent to Chicago's infamous Murderess Row under the watchful gaze of Mama Norton (Queen Latifah). To her surprise, Velma is also an inmate and Roxie quickly realises that her key to freedom lies with hot-shot legal representative Billy Flynn (an amazing turn by Richard Gere) and continuing press coverage. But Velma isn't about to let Roxie have it all her own way and soon, the pair of them battle it out in order to escape and become the toast of the town.There is no easy way of saying this. ""Chicago"" is pure movie Marmite - you'll either love it or absolutely loathe it. I will admit, it certainly looks and sounds a treat. Costumes, stage design (and I mean ""stage"" and not set - this may as well have been a big budget version of the stage musical), singing and dancing are all faultless and I can't criticise the cast at all. Not a bum note to be heard and Gere's tap-dancing sequence is surreal brilliance. But what ""Chicago"" has in razzmatazz, it lacks in cohesion. The whole thing flows like a bizarre dream and unless you're a fan of all things Fosse, it possibly won't be to your taste. I will admit, I'm not a lover of musicals at all so I'm almost certainly the wrong audience type but even my Better Half (who rates ""Annie"" as one of her favourites) wasn't too impressed with ""Chicago"".But don't dismiss this too easily. It did pick up the Best Picture Oscar in 2003 so it's clearly doing something right. But the simple truth is that I just didn't enjoy it. For all the spit and polish, all the rehearsals and fine-tuning, I can honestly say that ""Chicago"" didn't quite reach the right notes for me. Once you've been dazzled by the opening number ""All That Jazz"", you've really seen the film because very little changes. It's like listening to a Pet Shop Boys album where the last track sounds identical to the first. I confess, they will be some of you who will watch this and love it to bits. And if you do, we're selling our DVD copy if anybody's interested!",Chicago
187,dhaufrect,Classic Musical Style with Pazazz,10,5 January 2003,This movie is done in a refreshing style that is reminiscent of the musicals placed into motion pictures 20 or 30 years ago.  The audiences must appreciate this fact and relish the rebirth of Hollywood at its zenith.  It is a must see film with Richard Gere in a surprisingly agile dance scene. His singing talents are acceptable as the shister lawyer.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is a treat to see and hear.  John Reilly is as natural as they come.  Queen Fatifah is a delight.  Don't miss this electrifying musical.,Chicago
188,saarvardi,"If it were up to me, the title of this film would have been Hollywood rather than Chicago",10,19 July 2007,"My favorite Academy Award winning Best Picture of the decade thus far, Chicago is a cinematic extravaganza that comes along only once in a long, long time. Richard Gere, Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Queen Latifah, Christine Baranski, John C. Reilly and others explode on screen with music, talent and heaps of fun, in a sarcastic and very ironic look at show business, fame, crime and the thin line that runs between them.When you come to think about it, the plot is OK, but what really makes this musical light up with fire and passion are the singing bits carried out by the talented cast. Come to think of it, I've only seen the film 4-5 times, but I've heard the soundtrack 20 or 30 times more than that, and it keeps getting better, and more entertaining, each and every time.Richard Gere is absolutely stunning as Mr. Billy Flynn, the slick attorney who represents the homicidal rising star, Roxie Hart (Zellweger), in a murder case that creates a media frenzy circa the sparkling 1930's. When Gere smooth sings his way through 'We Both Reached for the Gun"", you'll wonder why this manly man of an actor didn't turn to Jazz and music from the get go. Zellweger, who's always been a chameleon in her respective roles, fits perfectly into the role of Roxie, the smoking hot murderess who'll doing anything for fame and publicity (even err, especially, murder). If you need to be convinced, listen to her perform ""Roxie"", and you too will fall for her. However, the girl who really steals the thunder from her fellow cast members is Catherine Zeta-Jones in her Academy Award winning role of Velma Kelly, the rough murderess who's been through the star-murder-fame road before Roxie has, and now has some advice to give to her fame struck cell-mate (hear also track number 8 in the soundtrack ""I Can't do it Alone""). Also in this musical are the always enjoyable (and only ""real"" singer in the cast) Queen Latifah as the slick prison warden Matron Mama Morton, and hilarious character actor John C. Reilly as Roxie's sap of a husband (hear ""Mister Cellophane"").There's been a blessed resurrection of musicals in Hollywood throughout recent years, and while Moulin Rouge might have been the first light that reignited in the interest in the genre, Chicago is the true beacon that shined the way for all the others to follow. And while films like Rent, The Phantom of the Opera and Hairspray might be worthy entries in the genre, Chicago stands high, high above them as a refreshing celebration of music, fame, irony and stardom. If it were up to me, the title of this film would have been Hollywood rather than Chicago.",Chicago
189,merrywood,The Triumph of the Pettifogger,10,11 March 2003,"Is one of the titles that this now aged, 1926 Jazzfest of a show, CHICAGO, can be called if taken only for its simple story.  I went to see this version of it on the Centennial of the birth of Jazz great Bix Beiderbecke. This great Jazz cornetist is still celebrated today some 72 years after he drank himself to death in 1931 at the age of 28 after rising to the top ranks of all the Jazz musicians of his time and arguably of all that followed him.  	This stage musical has always been all about Jazz and the way it was played in Bix's time, the 20's, the way Jazz purists love it.  CHICAGO, the 2002 film, is exquisite in making this point.  It celebrates the music with aplomb rarely seen in film.  It's cast and crew is extraordinary.  As the film plays out it illustrates the meaning of Jazz and recalls a time when it was given the fullness of artistic expression and why.  This fine production will be a keeper for many reasons but its extraordinary score will give it its true legs.",Chicago
190,Pavel-8,All that Jazz.,8,11 March 2003,"**Warning!  Mild Spoilers Ahead!**Let's get this out of the way first.  ""Chicago"" is inevitably compared to last year's ""Moulin Rouge.""  They are both superb films in their own ways.""Moulin Rouge"" is more of a story, and ""Chicago"" is more of a show.
And what a show it is.  Glitz.  Glamour.  Murder.  Mini-skirts.  And (ahem) all that jazz.  Sheer entertainment.  Knowing a little about the play, I wondered how it would translate to the big screen.  But the transitions to dream-like parallel musical numbers work very well.  Those numbers meld kinetic choreography and music with expert staging.The Hollywood cliche is that most of good acting is good casting. ""Chicago"" has both.  Catherine Zeta-Jones, with her musical background, is perfect vamping as Velda.  Renee Zellweger, of whom I'm not a big fan, does well morphing from ingenue to a kinniving, desperate-for-attention.  Richard Gere is playing a role he can do in his sleep, but this time it's a musical part. That stretches Gere, but he's up to the challenge as the fast-talking, slick-footed Billy.  My personal favorite was the ubiquitous John C. Reilly as the lovable loser husband.Overall I don't think it had enough substance to reach truly great status, but the flash and music were a completely enjoyable spectacle, enough to place it as my third best movie of 2002.",Chicago

She cheats on her husband and uses men to get ahead in her career and then kills a man because he lied to her and gets her husband to take the blame, creates a lie about a baby in court when she is not only not pregnant, but does not want to ever have a baby with her husband.

193,robb_772,The best big screen musical in nearly twenty years.,8,17 May 2006,"Let's face it, for the last thirty years or so, musicals have been dead artistically and commercially. That's not to say there have not been some great ones released during this time frame. I personally think that CABARET (1972), PENNIES FROM HEAVEN (1981), and YENTL (1983) are absolutely brilliant, and should have absolutely redefined the genre. However, these three films are not musicals in the ""traditional"" sense.No, despite whatever financial success they might have had, most modern-day musicals have been either ultra-cheesy (1978's GREASE - I don't care if it is one of the biggest grossers of all time), overly-saccharine (1981's ANNIE), too self-important (1996's EVITA), or mind-numbingly garish (2001's MOULIN ROUGE). I'm not saying that these films didn't have their moments, but they were all decidedly mixed bags. That's why it's so surprising that CHICAGO not only succeeds in avoiding all of these pratfalls, but succeeds in every way imaginable.Winning six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, the film is breezy and entertaining rather than static or stagy and never descends into the off-the-wall giddiness that undermines many musical efforts. Director Rob Marshall wisely does not try to dress up the production numbers, he just shoots them for what they are and brilliantly isolates them from the surrounding drama. The staging and choreography are stunning, and the cast is surprisingly terrific.Renee Zellweger may not be the most accomplished singer or dancer in the world, but she's the perfect Roxie Hart. Interweaving cuteness with maliciousness deservedly won Zellweger a Golden Globe and a SAG award, in addition to her second consecutive Oscar nomination. Richard Gere is at his sly best as Billy Flynn, and his introductory striptease is a highlight in a film bursting with highlights. He won a Golden Globe, but was unjustly overlooked at Oscar time.John C. Reilly is heartbreaking (most notably in his big solo ""Mr. Cellophane""), while Queen Latifah turns the relatively thankless role of the prison matron into no-nonsense, comedic tour de force. Both Reilly and Latifah received respective Supporting Oscar nods. Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu also make memorable and significant appearances in smaller roles, and all of the ""Cell Block Tango"" dancers are nothing short of amazing. However, the true star of the film is Catherine Zeta-Jones, whose high-octane, Oscar-winning performance is the most exciting thing I've seen at the movies in ages.",Chicago

195,DanB-4,"Excellent, but .....",9,19 February 2003,"Hardly worth 13 Oscar nominations. This is a very good film, better than most, but it should have taken a back seat at the Oscars to Twin Towers, Adaptation, Minority Report and several others. Chicago teeters on greatness, but never quite achieves it.The plot line is loosely based on the real Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly, both in prison in 1920's Chicago awaiting trial for murder. Both are represented by the slick huckster of a lawyer Billy Flynn. This were real people, but the movie Chicago is a complete fantasy.Roxie murders her lover early in the film after finding out that she is being lied to about her chanced for fame. In prison, she finds that her coy sweetness is media-friendly and she becomes a star. Renee Zellweger and CZJ are wonderful in the leading roles. Richard Gere is woefully miscast as Billy Flynn. To quote the ever quotable Roger Ebert ""Gere's own tap dancing is on the level of performers in the Chicago Bar Association's annual revue."" The supporting players make this film. (I would like to see the movie redone, sans Gere and putting in Christoper Walken). Queen Latifah is perfect as the prison matron Mama. I was delighted to see and Oscar nomination for John C. Reilly, exactly right in the thankless role as Roxie's gullible husband Amos.Chicago demonstrates 3 moments of brilliance, namely the opening, the Cellblock Tango and the marionette scene. Reilly's Mr. Cellophane provides the movies only sentimental moment and is letter perfect. Other than that, it is pure dark comedy, sex and silliness. The directorial choice to make the musical numbers exist in Roxie's fantasy works well.
Chicago represents the new style of musical lead by Moulin Rouge! last year. In the 50's musicals were plot gamely interupted by song and dance. Now, we have song and dance tossed lightly with some plot - sort of like watching a feature length MTV video. Rob Marshall makes all the right calls here, and Chicago is great entertainment. Best picture? No way. ***1/2 out of ****",Chicago

I wished I was able to see the movie when it was first released in NY and LA in December and not wait until the second week in January. That's how much I enjoyed the movie.I don't believe it's the best movie musical of all time (in my very humble opinion, that thankless title goes to ""The Band Wagon"" by Vincente Minnelli). I'm in agreement with some people that the edits may have been too much in the style of MTV (though that style was what the late Bob Fosse might have had in mind when he directed ""Cabaret"" and the underrated ""All That Jazz""). Despite those flaws, from the opening sequence to the end credits, I was taken in (and taken aback) by the film's energetic musical interludes and even the non-musical scenes were entertaining. All of the actors, from the leads to the supporting and background actors, were up to the task and they looked like they had a great time performing.I believe ""Chicago"" is worthy of the hype its receiving.",Chicago
197,davek28,Not my kind of town,2,23 January 2003,"I'm sorry but I hated this film. I'm a big fan of Bob Fosse, especially All That Jazz and Sweet Charity, and generally speaking I enjoy musicals. However, I couldn't bear this particular musical. I had no sympathy at all with any of the characters. They all deserved to be in the slammer - especially for the musical numbers. CZJ is as bland as ever (although she perked up a bit in Traffic), and Renee Z looks like she's just eaten a whole lemon, as usual. I rarely walk out of a film before the end (unless I'm desperate to use the restroom), but this was one of the few films that I found myself unable to tolerate. Essentially, it consists of a constant stream of phantasy numbers interspersed by the occasional snippet of dialogue. I began to dread the onset of each musical set piece and looked forward to the next prose interlude. Maybe this is in the running for more awards after its success at the Golden Globes, but these awards have to be showbiz backslapping rather than for any real achievement. Badly miscast - endless glitzy music with skeletal, overexposed (for the period) dancers - antipathetic characters with no redeeming qualities.
I don't often feel strongly enough to condemn a film - especially one which I should, in theory, have enjoyed. The above opinion is based on the first hour, because I couldn't take any more.  Two out of ten. And don't tell me what happens in the end because I couldn't care less!",Chicago
198,Ishallwearpurple,WOW!!! We want to see it again---,10,26 January 2003,"Just returned from seeing Chicago on a frigid day in the Heartland.  But the heat from this musical warmed up the three gals(one senior, two 40's) who had a blast watching this.  Since it is a conservative community, there was no applause, but we 3 wanted to after almost every number.  Especially Richar Gere's ""Razzle Dazzle"" number with his lawyer dancing and singing and dazzlin' the jury.  Great stuff!The whole cast is a 10/10.  Zeta-Jones can sing and dance up a storm.  Renee is just a doll, and the last number with the two of them is just sheer magic.If you are a fan of the technicolor musicals of the 40-50's, see this one. The color is delicious.All in all - a 10/10.Jane",Chicago
199,jimakros,enjoyable but no Fosse,5,29 March 2003,"The best thing about this movie is that it succeeds in staging the dark and sexual world of Bob Fosse.These qualities present in most of his work are a matter of taste and don't appeal to everyone.But for Fosse fans they are necessary.What it doesn't do and thats why it is mediocre, it does not contain the high voltage dancing Fosses's name is synonymous with.Zeta Jones tries hard but is not an accomplished dancer and Zellweger hardly dances at all.In the entire movie there isn't one number that dancing fans will remember.Considering this is a Fosse baby the dancing had to be much better.If you want to remind yourself what Fosse was all about,you're much better off with the DVD version of the Broadway tribute to him.That said,Chicago is not boring,the cast is attractive and it moves pretty fast with colorful images.It just lacks what the academy voted it has, the qualities to make it a classic.",Chicago
200,marxsarx,All the praise for this movie leaves me scratching my head!,5,11 February 2003,"I had high hopes for ""Chicago"", the musical as there are many critics praising this movie. Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed after seeing the film. This is one of those films that the critics got wrong and all of the praise leaves me scratching my head.Not only was it obvious that the director was a newcomer, it was also obvious that he made some very disappointing choices in editing.  Why in the world are most of the dance sequences filmed in extemely dark settings so we can't see?  Why does the director not notice that the scenes of the principle characters dancing are nothing short of lame.  It seems like the director thought he could fool us into thinking they were good dancers without showing any real dancing.  And the plot is so full of holes and contrivances that I was laughing with incredulity that anyone would consider this a good film, let alone great. Most of the audience sat in bored silence so thick you could cut it with a knife the day I saw the film. Some of the songs and dance numbers were so so, but most were nothing to brag about. The most enjoyable singing in the movie comes from Catherine Zeta Jones as Velma.  The word I would use to describe this film is lame. There was actually one decent performance in the film.  That was the performance of Catherine Zeta-Jones.  I must admit that she soared above the other actors in her portrayal of Velma and  I found myself wishing that Velma was spending more time on screen.  She was the only principle star in this mess of a film that understood how to get her character to come across the audience.  Renee Zelwigger's performance of Roxie was visually interesting but otherwise empty, flat and emotionally barren.  There is no way that she deserves an oscar for this cheesy performance.  The hoopla about Richard Gere dancing is a joke.  Anytime there was a closeup of Richard Gere dancing, it was either his face or it was either his feet?  HMMMM?  There weren't any decent shots of him dancing which begs the question were the closepups of him tapdancing really someone else?  This movie is definitely a rental.  Don't waste your money at the theater. If you want to see a great musical, watch Moulin Rouge with Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor.  Now there's a movie!  Give Chicago the boot!  I'd only give ""Chicago"" a 5 or 6 on a scale of 10.",Chicago
201,ween-3,CHANNELING BOB FOSSE,10,20 January 2003,"The late Bob Fosse was responsible for ""All That Jazz"" and ""Cabaret""---probably the 2 most interesting musicals ever brought to the screen. The king is dead--long live the king. And welcome, Rob Marshall. ""Chicago"" is a brilliant realization of Fosse's stage play and a bold ""hello"" from a relatively new director/choreographer whose Eagle has definitely just landed. Don't want to bore you with a long list of superlatives--suffice it to say that this film (which just won the Golden Globes for movie, and for Richard Gere and Renee Zellweger)is the real deal from start to finish. And the casting team should win this year's Nobel Prize for mad scientists. Nothing I've ever seen from Gere, Zellweger, Zeta-Jones, John C. Reilly or Queen Latifah prepared me in any way, shape or form for their performances in this movie. This isn't just a ""stretch..this is a thousand miles of Spandex. The last people in the world you'd envision in these roles playing them to sheer perfection. After having seen the 1997 Broadway revival, I thought the casting agents were suffering from psychotic disassociative disorder when I found out who was scheduled to play the leads in the movie version. Well..I'm here to tell you, folks..I stand ridiculously corrected.I've got a sinking feeling that because of the success of ""Chicago"" and the visually stunning ""Moulin Rouge"" from Baz Luhrmann last year, the floodgates are about to open on a spate of bad remakes of musicals from the 30's and 40's with everybody from Carrot Top to Steven Segal clamoring to sing and dance on screen. So run, don't walk, to see ""Chicago"". This is the gold standard. There's gonna be a lot of brass heading your way soon.",Chicago

I held off as long as possible but when this was on one of the movie channels yesterday, I had to watch. I'll admit that I was taken in by the music, the gowns, and, at times, even the acting. A curious jont into the musical which was very, very well done. I really enjoyed watching the way that the musical numbers where tied in with the story and a few even made me tap my foot. In the end, I wish I'd seen this earlier. It has some very memorable moments and if all the actors did their own singing (not sure if they did or not) then Zeta-Jones should really think of leaving movies for a stage career. Thoroughly enjoyable.7/10",Chicago

But after hearing nothing but critical acclaim from everyone, including 13 Oscar nominations, I was enticed to check it out. I was surprised just how much I liked it. The thing that impressed me the most were the two leads, Renée Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones. I have enjoyed many of their earlier movies, but I had no idea how talented they were until this movie. They can really sing and dance! The supporting cast, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, and John C. Reilly, were also surprisingly good. It had a good story that mixed well with the musical numbers. Chicago is definitely worth checking out, even if you're not a big musical fan. It's a very fun and entertaining movie. ***1/2 (out of 4)",Chicago
204,simonrosenbaum,All That's Jazz?,5,10 September 2004,"Surely one of the worst films to win a Best Picture Oscar, Chicago is all gloss and dazzle but with no emotional depth or substance. I was expecting Cabaret and it was more like Bugsy Malone (that at least had humour, charm and some catchy songs.) I can't fault the performances especially as they all sang and danced themselves, but like Moulin Rouge and Evita it glides effortlessly with technical brilliance from one scene to another without stopping for air and getting the chance to to know the characters and grow to feel something for them. In the last half hour it improves slightly with some clever sequences and I admit Catherine Zeta-Jones was good and deserved her Oscar but it was like one of those cartoon take offs of an original film and I'd like to see the original film!

But I have to say this was really a very good movie. Not at all what I expected.  It was almost like watching a person living their life like it was MTV videos.  Everything that Roxie thought about was put to music and dance.  And it was hot too.  Even Richard Gere, who I never liked before, seemed to have fun with the dance numbers and played all his time with all those great looking women with tung in cheek.

""Moulin Rouge"" reinvented the musical; ""Chicago"" put it back to bed, sadly.",Chicago
208,kevvportela,"Empowerment and show, what else to ask for?",10,19 May 2021,"The iconic adaptation of the musical that comes from the play premiered in 1926 by journalist Maurine Dallas Watkins. In this version brought to the big screen it is directed by Rob Marshall, starring a young Rene Zellweger, and supported by big names like Catherine Zeta Jones, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, and John C. Reilly. It makes me one of the best musicals brought to the screen, it transmits that lively energy, dynamism and show like no other.The direction is unimpressive but has a charm when combined with a pompous and fleeting script. The way that puts the role of women in a vulnerable position but at the same time empowered by taking advantage of the place that puts them. This is well projected in the musical numbers, and none of them is filler, everything contributes to the narrative of the story, the arc of the characters, and they are all explosive.The fidelity that the choreographies and printing maintain to Bob Fosse makes one fall in love and even more makes this play naughty and sensual.The performances are incredible. Rene gives one of her best performances in this leading role, her number ""Roxie"" leaves her mark. I want to talk about the colossal and ardent Catherine Zeta Jones, she is a supporting actress but she is my favorite, her performance never lets go of her even in her musical numbers, ""Cell Block Tango"" intimidates the viewer in a surprising way with that presence accompanied by a roaring voice and strong choreography, a passionate and empowered character without a doubt, for me it is the best Oscar for Best Supporting Actress of the decade and my top 5 of all time. Richard Gere is his best performance ever, I have never seen him so devoted to a character that apart from his comfort as an actor, without believing that he was not nominated for the Oscars. Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly have little screen time but that does not make them stand out less with their presentation numbers that also remain with a stamp.Film nominated for 13 Oscars, winning 6. Among them the most important of the night ""Best Picture"" being one of the few musicals with such a feat. They also honored Zeta Jones' fierce performance in supporting actress, sound, costume, art direction, and editing.",Chicago
209,Morbius_Fitzgerald,"Murder, skin tights and all that Jazz.",2,20 April 2014,"Before anyone gets up me, I'll confess, I'm not really a Broadway fan. I haven't even seen any other rendition of this musical. However I do feel as though an adaptation should be good REGARDLESS of whether you've seen the original or not. And even though I respect a few elements of this movie, I did not like this film.So the plot goes along the lines of Roxie Hart (Rene Zellwegger) wants to be a big star but when a guy she's having an affair with (Dominic West) tells her all their relationship was was ""a bit of fun"" and he never really had connections to make her a big star, she shoots him for being ""a liar"". Yet, did you know that back then if you killed someone that would be the way to make a star out of you? Thats the impression I got from this movie. Zellwegger then tries to get Richard Gere as a lawyer because he's the best in the business and people who work with him are ""guaranteed"" to be successes. However Catherine Zeta Jones also has him as a lawyer and she tries to work with her or even sabotage her to get her way.Now, first off, the compliments. I respect that this musical to be adapted to the screen would've been hard and I do respect that in some cases it did work, however there are a few things that brought the movie down.The problem I have with this movie is the characters. Okay so Zellwegger is so obsessed with her big dream of being a ""star"" and the lengths she goes to to get there are insane. She makes up an oppressive back-story with this lawyer to give herself sympathy in the press, whenever anyone else tries to take the spotlight away even for a second, she lies about having a baby and doesn't even tell her husband. There is even a scene where she does say she wants out but then witnesses an innocent Hungarian woman hang by the neck for her ""crime"". Does that get her to question the morality of what she's doing? Of course not. In fact, she goes right back to Richard Gere and goes along with his charade. This character is the one that we, as an audience, are supposed to like!The way this movie plays out is also dumb as hell. I mentioned before that the ""nice character"" lied about having a baby. Now let me tell you how the Husband goes through this story arc and how bat sh#t crazy it is. He finds out and then gets depressed that she didn't even acknowledge him while the press tried to get every photo they possibly could of her. Then he goes to Richard Gere who tells him its not his, he doesn't even talk to his wife before filing for divorce (dumb move on its own, this movie also TRIES to sell him off as a loving all- supportive husband). In the trial Gere says the baby is his and everything is okay. When Roxie is out of the spotlight again for 2 minutes she tells him in rage that there never really was a baby and he leaves the movie on that scene without saying a word.When it comes to songs in themselves, I'm sorry but these were as forgettable as a Hans Zimmer score without a ""bwaum"" in it. Most of the time they're forgettable yet harmless enough in the story that goes on. However I love one song in this soundtrack purely because it makes the writer look like he had ADD. Richard Gere's opening song is him singing about how he doesn't care about money, all that expensive stuff and all he really wants is love...interesting spin on a lawyer but literally one scene later, he's negotiating with Roxie's Husband as to what fee to pay and how he wont take any less than $5000. Then literally less than 20 seconds later Gere's character says he'll do it anyway. Huh? So you go from ""I don't care about money"" to ""I'm not taking a penny less than $5000"" to ""okay, I'll do the case anyway"" Come on, you gotta have some logic!I'm not here to blindly hate against the movie, there are some well choreographed scenes and well shot scenes but I'm sorry, the story and characters were horribly written. Okay, the kind of musicals I do kinda like are Sweeney Todd, The Wizard Of Oz and Hair. Those were clever. Those, despite having characters that did worse, knew where they stood in terms of how to balance everything out. Sweeney Todd tries to kill the Judge because he sent him to Australia and killed his wife only to try and rape his daughter years later. If Roxie had those kinds of motivations, I'd understand but she just wants to be famous so all these horrid things she does is completely without merit.Overall I wont judge against anyone who related to this...somehow and I wont completely, blindly hate on it but this is just not for me.",Chicago

And, I don't care because I thought this was a very good movie. There are a lot of catchy songs in this movie that'll stick in your head for some time and the added bonus is that all the actors do their own singing and dancing, so it isn't cheesy or phony looking. Besides being very entertaining, Chicago also makes a good statement on our society, and how we treat criminals like celebrities, even though that point is exaggerated. A lot of the wisdom from Chicago comes from Richard Gere's Character. He has lines like ""they'd love you better if you were hanged, it would sell more papers,"" ""this trial, this whole world, it's all show business,"" and at one point near the end he accidentally refers to the jury as ""the audience.""Chicago is funny, witty, satirical, and just damn entertaining.

Nothing will go as you would expect, characters resemble not all too boring stereotypes because everything is somehow crooked. Nobody should be offended, it gets not too real and it's all just a parody of us and our vices. Even if 'Chicago' is about the 1920's it does not attempt to create anything too silly like some nostalgia about the decade, on the contrary, the least the most unnecessary gangster&whore clichés are avoided and in the spotlight is only one silly, I mean really silly girl, who wants to become a performer. And how she ends up in that does not become too evident before the very end.There are really no heroes and villains. It's just about a world that does not feel like nobody's home and the guilty pleasure in this film is that it makes the hell look a pretty comfortable place.

I gave this movie a 9 out of 10 because of it's brilliance but it lost 1 because it seems more suited to broadway than the big screen.Catherine Zeta Jones was fantastic as Velma Kelly and she has a great voice to go with it. Renee Zellweger as Roxie Hart played her role to perfection, you love her and hate her at the same time. Richard Gere was a pleasant surprise as Billy Flynn, a lawyer with quite a voice. I guess because I'm a romantic, I found that ""Moulin Rouge"" had that certain something about it but I suppose because these two musicals have different stories you can't really compare them.Overall it's a definite must see!",Chicago

The question is how did such a mediocre musical win the Best Picture Oscar ? I have no idea, probably because it's good safe entertainment. The movie is mediocre all-around. Standard story, mediocre music, lyrics, choreography and performances, probably the weakest performance I have seen Renee Zellwger give yet. Catherine Zeta-Jones, like usual is just kind of there. She should look into using that pretty face for modeling because she's far from being a great actress and has a tendency of killing any scene she's in.

This is unusual for me cause I think musicals are bad, except I did see Chicago the play and thought it was excellent. But I seriously had doubts about the movie. I thought some of the cast like Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta Jones, Renee Zellwegger but I thought the rest of the cast would be at least good.I think this movie has Oscars written all over it. I think it will win Best Picture cause it won a golden globe for best picture (musical/comedy). The only thing that holds this movie back is that its a musical and they are sort of rare recently. Best Director is possible too but Scorsese might get it cause he has been screwed so many times before and of course when he gets he will get for the definite wrong movie. Adapted Screenplay is another award this movie will be nominated for.Now for the acting. Richard Gere was actually excellent, no wonder he won the globe. Catherine Zeta Jones really surprised me, she should be moved into the supporting category and shes got it won. No as much surprised Zeta Jones surprised, Renee surprised me even more, she was excellent but shes got alot of competition like Kidman has been getting great reviews in the Hours. But I have faith in Renee. Now I did prefer Zeta Jones but I dont have to have faith in her cause shes a lock for the win. Richard Gere faces tough competition from Jack Nicholson's performance which was excellent. Daniel Day Lewis overrated performance in Gangs of New York might be tough competition but since Day Lewis lost the golden globe he might be out but you never know. The academy may not give the award to Nicholson cause hes won 3 already but I dont know he was great in his performance. The rest of the Cast is great.This movie will also get some awards in the technical categories like possibly Art Direction and Costume Design. But Gangs of New York and the Two Towers also had great Art Direction and Costume Design. Now Im still not a fan of Musicals except for this one. I think this is a damn fine picture and the best movie of 2002. Gets a spot in my top 10 list but not number one cause Godfather I and II will always be number one. 10 out of 10. This will get at least 3 or 4 oscars.",Chicago
215,Jim-500,The difference between stage and screen,3,27 March 2003,"Chicago is a film I wanted to like. Last year I spent a month performing in the orchestra for an Equity production of the musical. I thought the show was funny and very enjoyable, though the music is derivative and sometimes tedious.I thought the film fell far short of the show. In going from stage to screen, it loses the human touch, and becomes a testament to the director and cinematographer's crafts: all slick, glitz and style. For all of the hype about the singing and the dancing, the camera moves so quickly that it's hard to tell if anybody is really doing either. The talent here is the camera, not the actors.In inevitably comparing the two, the stage show is far superior. The movie leaves out almost all of the funny lines, and merely touches upon the subplots and the human element. Much has been made about the film's Amos Hart character, but what you see in the movie is a smidge of what the stage show delivers.The film is good for what it is. But you'll have a much more enriching experience when you see the stage show.",Chicago

Two observations however:  In my opinion, this is a much better movie than Moulin Rouge for the simple reason that it relies on the old fashioned elements of lighting, sets, clever film editing, and especially real people, rather than the extensive emphasis on digital technology that was Moulin Rouge. I understand many people are fans of the later, but I simply am not.Also turning a stage show like Chicago into a good movie would have to be an exceedingly difficult task. I can't imagine how it could have been done better than this. Yes, Fosse's choreography and directing would be more eccentric and intangibly special, but he's dead!

Every note, every cut, every bit of lighting, casting, music, is absolutely perfect, and astonishing. A year ago the only negative thing I said was that Bob Fosse would have done it even better. Now I am not even so sure of that.Some of my favorite numbers, like Cell Block Tango, I have played at least 20 times. THe entrance of Velma at the beginning still send a chill up my spine!YEs, the original show had qualities the movie doesn't, for example a harder and dirtier edge to it.

Not that the acting was so great, or the script so compelling, but the production, the cinematography and the ensemble effort deliver a fantastic effort that just blows you away.A word on the acting, however. I had heard that Catherine Zeta Jones carries the show in terms of talent, and her dancing is of a higher level, but that is to diminish the effort of Renee Zellwiger who delivers more than expected in a difficult roll. The singing was no embarrassment to anyone and the dancers were superb.At no time did one feel the urge to check the time and it wasn't until the end credits rolled that I realized that there had been no front credits.

219,AlbertCinefilu,A good musical filled with some deadly good performances,9,11 February 2021,"I'm not going to ruin your watching experience but listen to me, you have to see the Cell Block Tango scene. You can ignore the rest if you want - though I don't advise you - but if you are a fan of musicals, dancing or just excellent performances, you have to watch the Cell Block Tango. It was midnight, my mother was really exhausted but I made her stay awake 15 more minutes so I can play the scene twice on the computer in her room. I find Catherine Zeta-Jones' performance here to be the apogee of acting, her facial expressions, her sex-appeal, her ferocity... everything that she does transforms her into Velma Kelly, the ultimate 21st century femme fatale.I'm also ashamed of myself that I've witnessed Renée Zellweger's performance only in Cold Mountain before and didn't recognize her talent at that time. In ''Chicago'' Zellweger manages to make Roxie Hart constantly fluctuate between being likeable, charming and worth rooting for on one side and truly repellent, immoral and a bit cruel on the other. Richard Gere is all-right, though I was never able to like him too much, I don't know why.Other musical numbers I adored were Roxie Hart's dream of becoming a celebrity Razzle Dazzle 'em, and John C. Reilly's Cellophane, which was uncomfortably good for it payed heed to the painful truth of being as hollow and transparent as a cellophane for those around you. Oh, I also adored the final act. The rest I just liked, nothing bad to day about them.Story-wise ''Chicago'' it's satisfying. Some characters are introduced but don't have an ending of their own, there are some serious moments and several possibilities to go deeper into the minds & souls of those murderers but the film is not aimed at being a character study. Instead, judging it as what is meant to be, namely an entertaining, charming musical packed with societal satire, will lead to a fine appreciation and a nice time.A 9,50 out of 10 from me.",Chicago
220,chrstphrtully,Superb Direction and Editing Brings Chicago to Life,9,2 October 2003,"Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, Broadway musicals which are heavy on concept translate poorly to film.  Live theater relies upon some level of interaction with the audience (as well as some degree of spontaneity), creating an artificial atmosphere that gives a director freedom to use staging and theatrical devices that can make the most of such interaction. By contrast, film creates an illusion of reality that makes such theatrical devices look phony.  Rob Marshall's ""Chicago"" provides the exception to this rule.To tell the truth, I've never been much of a fan of the stage show.  Bob Fosse (with help from John Kander and Fred Ebb) designed the show as a series of vaudeville skits tied together by the flimsiest of books.  If you like revues with great choreography, the show worked fine; if you were looking for an actual ""musical"", you were better advised to look elsewhere. Prior to this film, I'd have thought that you'd also have to look elsewhere to find good material for a film.Then came Rob Marshall.  Conceiving the show as events as seen through Roxie Hart's (Renee Zellweger) imagination, the dance numbers become believable because she truly sees all the world as a stage.  In effect, what Marshall has done is substitute Roxie for the theater's live audience and, in the process, made the theatrical touches plausible within the film's context. In doing so, Marshall has relied upon superb editing and choreography to keep up the pace and continuity (such as it is) of the film.Perhaps the best example of this is ""Cell Block Tango,"" which on stage is a stylized number that is removed from the central action of what book there is.  In the film, the number arises from various conversations Roxie has had with other prisoners, focused through her show-biz crazy mind, and puts her own acts in context.  Likewise, ""They Both Reached for the Gun,"" played as a ventiloquist act in which her mouthpiece Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) pulls both Roxie's strings and those of the press, and uses Roxie's mind as the filter to point up the ease in which the public can be manipulated.In choreographing these numbers, Marshall has also done an impressive job. Rather than merely revive Fosse's choreography from the 1975 production, he seems inspired by it to create new choreography that plays off the editing for maximum effect.  The two aforementioned numbers are excellent examples of this choreographic technique, as well as ""All That Jazz"" (intercutting between a vaudeville dance act and two plot threads), ""Mr. Cellophane"" (beautifully performed by John C. Reilly, as Roxie's schlepp of a husband), ""I Can't Do It Alone"" and ""Razzle Dazzle.""  Marshall also allows a dose of sanity to slip into the proceedings with a non-musical number, in which a seemingly wrongfully convicted woman is put to death -- the scene slams the brakes for a moment, lest we be completely seduced by the glitter or Roxie's perspective, and lose our own rational perspective on right, wrong and justice.  It's a jarring moment, but a responsible (and some may say necessary) one.The performances are, for the most part, up to the task.  Catherine Zeta-Jones richly earned her Oscar as Velma Kelly -- vocally, choreographically, and in the acting department.  Gere is also very good (his tap dance number is truly impressive), and John C. Reilly (as Roxie's schlepp husband) and Queen Latifah (as an opportunistic warden) are outstanding.  In fact, the weakest performance in the film is Zellweger, and this seems more of a fault of the script than Zellweger.  Even though most of the film focuses on her, she remains a cipher at the end of the picture, most likely because the central conceit of the film (Roxie's perception of events) gets in the way of her character development.  She still does the best job she can with what she's given with an underwritten part (to be fair, the part is even less well written for the stage version).Did ""Chicago"" deserve to beat ""Gangs of New York"" or ""The Pianist"" for Best Picture?  I'm not sure.  All I know is that the film is an incredible achievement given its source material and the natural disadvantages of converting musicals to film.  Marshall set out to climb K-2, and he reached the top.",Chicago
221,beauzee,A real modern day Movie Classic (a rare commodity),10,26 December 2014,"thought Richard Gere was just another pretty face...man, he sings, dances, prances, and (forgive) acts his brains out in this atmospheric musical with some of the ""mood"" of CABARET.Gere looks like he is loving every second as the whole production kicks in, and features a very entertaining portrayal of a corrupt prison guard you gotta love, by Queen Latifah. Like with Gere..I did not know this kid had it in her! some REviewers did not like the ""posing...not dancing"" production numbers and they are not wrong...but I could detect plenty of smooth, balletic, flowing moves. As usual, with Fosse, it's over the top sexual...but not cheap thrills.I usually say, the movie is great-good-okay and would have been even better if it was not so long. and yes, once again, I gotta say...they could have cut or cut down a number or two.let me conclude with...buy two copies. one for keepin'. :)",Chicago
222,Blondie_,Excellent!!!,10,2 January 2003,"This movie was so excellent. I would see it again in a heartbeat. For one, the camera work was amazing. Beautiful cinematography, very creative and effective camera angles, and great editing. The cast was mostly excellent as well as far as their musical performance skills go. The one that suprised and impressed me was how good Richard Gere was. His singing was great-very old-fashioned 'shoeshine' period. Zeta-Jones was an impressive dancer and had a strong singing voice. Zellweger's dancing was good, but her singing voice was sufficient at best. It was obvious that she hadn't done a lot of singing before the movie as her voice wasn't quite developed. It seemed okay for the character though as Roxie Hart wasn't supposed to be that good of a performer. The choreography and staging of the musical numbers was wonderfully creative, I loved the puppet scene! 9/10.",Chicago
223,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - 'Chicago' Revives Old Musical,9,25 January 2003,"Storyline Entertainment has had huge success reviving old musicals. Such projects included Cinderella and Annie on ABC a few years ago and the upcoming Music Man starring Matthew Broderick of The Producer's fame. And now they try their chances with Chicago for Miramax films. But a revival of this musical was attempted on Broadway a year and since then the musical was shut down mostly due to the effects of September 11th. Will the film version of Chicago be another great success for Storyline Entertainment or will it be the first failure for the musical team? The story of Chicago focuses on the lovely Roxie Hary who is willing to do anything to get the fame that a star like Velma Kelly has including cheating on her husband with a guy that claims to have connections in the business. When she finds out that this man is playing her, she takes a gun and shoots him and then shoots again. Roxie falls into a new world of deception and lies where she is competing with Velma Kelly for the famous lawyer Billy Flinn, who has never lost a case with a woman client. But who will come out on top in Chicago? The story of Chicago is fabulous done. The musicals sequences do not come off as tacky thanks to the idea of letting these numbers be from the imagination of Roxie Hart instead of the usual one liner that sets up the song. The one thing to note about this movie version of Chicago is that all the actors did their own singing. The biggest surprise of the bunch was Richard Gere who played lawyer Billy Flinn. Who knew this guy could sing that well? The favorite numbers such as Razzle Dazzle and All I Care About came from him Cathrine-Zeta Jones is actually a Broadway veteran and shows off her stuff is great style. Renee Zellweger is good as Roxie Hart but there could have been someone just a little better to play this role. The look was there but the dancing and the singing for her role was just slightly disappointing. John C. Reilly does a great job in the Mister Cellophane number as well as Queen Latifah as Mama Morton. Overall, Chicago was as good and better then all the buzz suggested for this musical. The songs were the best that had been heard in a film for a long time. The best included Razzle Dazzle, Mister Cellophane, and the Cell Block Tango. The story didn't come off as tacky and the musical numbers were fabulously well done. The cast was great except for two members. Renee Zellweger was good but was not a great choice for the role of Roxie Hart. Another bad character was Lucy Liu, who seemed kind of pointlessly added in the story though it helped play out rest of the story. They could have done more with her character. The comeback of the movie musical was started by Moulin Rouge but Chicago continues the surge with full force. Chicago is one of the best musicals seen in years and quite possibly one of the best of the year. Make it uour high priority to see this wonderful film.
My Rating: ****1/2 out of 5",Chicago
224,benbrae76,Bring back MGM!,3,30 August 2006,"MGM would have thrown this movie out after the first reel!! How on earth did it win so many Oscars? If it wasn't for a stunning and virtually solo performance by Catherine Zeta Jones, I think the whole thing would have fallen flat on it's face. Certainly the rest of the cast wasn't anything to remember, and Richard Gere looked as if he preferred to be anywhere else but where he was.The storyline was thin, and the script disjointed. I suppose it's only a personal taste, but I found the sudden switches from story to club music and back again, time after time, extremely irritating, it was neither one thing nor the other. Try the 1942 Ginger Rogers version ""Roxie Hart"". It's far more straightforward and much, much wittier.Apart from the opening production number the musical arrangements were poor, too brash (even for jazz), one-dimensional, and had very little colour (I refer to the music here, not the cinematography). If you love jazz, or good jazz orientated drama, then try ""Man with a Horn"" (based on the life of Bix Beiderbecke), ""The Cotton Club"" (in which Richard Gere, gets to blow his own cornet), or at a pinch ""The Five Pennies"", ""The Glenn Miller Story"", ""The Fabulous Dorseys"", ""Drum Crazy"", and other biogs of their ilk. Even ""Robin and the Seven Hoods"" is better.I think ""Chicago"" is probably a good stage musical (I haven't seen it as such, so I don't know), but it somehow (for me anyway) just doesn't come over on film, and I got bored with it long before the end, and I adore all types of jazz from Dixie through Big Band to West Coast and others besides. I also enjoy a good murder mystery and/or thriller, but this film was neither musical, a thriller, nor a mystery, it was an utter mess. So apart from Catherine Zeta Jones, there is only one good thing I can say about it...that it's slightly better than ""Evita"". It's one of those you probably either love or loathe, and although I didn't actually loathe it, I really couldn't see any point to it. But there's one thing sure...an MGM musical it just ain't!",Chicago
225,eklavya-cwk,A step ahead of 'ALL ABOUT EVE',8,21 May 2014,"Just seen Chicago. intention was to complete my watch-list of Oscar winners from the date I was born till now. so obviously it is clear that Chicago is the last movie I saw in that list.I was amazed stunned and spell-bounded with the extraordinary talented movie like this. certainly not the best but sure thing its special. Absolute pointed and clear direction that presented a whole different scenario of movie-art. Again its not a big or good art but it is certainly different and powerful. A story of carving for stardom, foolish intelligent beings and usual folks, rogue people and politics all stuck by the glue of music and dance. Though it is called musical its nothing that sort, its nothing compared to 'sound of music' but its use of music is attractive.The drama in Chicago sets it above the all-famed movie 'all about eve' quite similar in theme but different in story and style. It is not for usual folks and also its not for entertainment, its plain movie with nothing much interesting except its musical weird comedy drama that is quite appealing. No doubt it won Oscar award.",Chicago

Don't be swayed by the critics on this site who don't like and DON'T UNDERSTAND musical theater. RUN to see this movie. The cast is amazing. The entire 'look' is fantastic and it's some of the best editing ever. The spirit of Bob Fosse hovers over this production like a muse. The director has wisely; intelligently; and with great talent made sure this happens. It is obvious he's seen Cabaret (film) a number of times and, liking that style and camera angles does his own turn on that film. My God!

229,mockturtle,Zeta shines - Zell and Gere pale - don't buy the hype.,5,6 January 2003,"The old Razzle-Dazzle.  `Chicago' has some of it, certainly more than the stripped down stage version you might have seen in New York or your local touring venue, after which you may wonder what the +$60 ticket price was for if not sets and costumes.  The question it asks is `Why not cast people that can actually sing?'  That one pertains to Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere. Catherine Zeta-Jones is miraculous in a part that is just too small to get her the award that could be possible from such a performance.  John C. Reilly expands on his rogues gallery of schlubs and sings better than most. Queen Latifah is adequate and has quite a lovely legit voice. Intercutting real life action and fantasy stage play makes the often boring and repetitive songs more palatable (Kander and Ebb have a tendency to repeat the name of the song 20 times in 4 minutes so you don't forget it). Zeta-Jones can sing, she can dance and act.  Toni Collette can do all three also, better than most people I've ever seen (`The Wild Party' on Bway) so why wasn't she cast as Roxie?  Taye Diggs can sing Richard Gere under the table, so why didn't he get an emcee's song, `Cabaret' style?  They cannibalize `Cabaret' everywhere else in the movie.  They really should have got Christopher Walken.  What is Lucy Liu doing in this movie?  Why don't we get to see any more of the city of Chicago than two streets and the front of a couple of courthouses?  The only song that fulfills `Chicago's potential in the screen version is the only one that does it in the stage version: the Cell Block Tango.  The camera work during the all too few dance sequences is fluid, it looks like it was shot in slo-mo and sped up so the moves look lightning fast and percussive without losing their breadth and elegance. Did I mention Zeta-Jones was excellent?  Did I mention that it isn't a crime to cast someone with experience in the other lead roles?  It isn't so much that Zellweger and Gere are BAD, per se, just that one can imagine the result given such auspicious surroundings had they been GOOD.  Or ever registered.  The only Gere scene that really worked was the tap dance, and it was undermined by his hamming.  Let me say of Zellweger's first note of the evening: the high note in `All That Jazz': it frightens away dogs. Funny that we've heard nothing about it, considering that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman (who were a f%$^ of a lot better) were widely mocked for their `Moulin Rouge' singing.  Speaking of `MR.' It was even more uneven, but the highs were a lot higher.  Colm Feore as an Assistant DA is solid in a thankless part, as usual.  The big surprise of the night is Susan Misner, who as the `Pop' part of Cell Block Tango, or first girl, or whatever the part is called, (Liz, as it says here) makes an impact in one minute that isn't forgotten for the rest of the night.  Had the rest of the film taken its cue from her it would have been truly extraordinary.  For Rob Marshall: this is a lot better than `Annie,' but he needs to realize that long takes are his friend, ESPECIALLY when you have a great dancer.  Things take time to develop.  Something can be big without filling the screen, and without a huge thunderclap under it.  And for God's sake: IF THEY CAN REALLY DO IT, SHOW THEM DOING IT OR WE'LL THINK IT'S CAMERA TRICKS.  One laughable shot is right at the end when Roxie and Velma run to cross each other - cut - they do cartwheels - cut - they come to the front of the stage.  `Stunt dancer!' And some of the dubbing (>ahem< Gere) is pretty bad.What do Zeta-Jones, Susan Misner and Chita Rivera in a cameo have that no one else in the movie does (except Reilly by his complete exclusion of it)? Presence.Strangely enough, this `Chicago' is at its best only when it is doing the thing that is hardest for a musical or really any piece of art to do: bringing out recognizable parallels to modern day.  It's a shame so much of the other stuff is so-so.  And other potential movie-musical directors take heed: you can only pull the `stage in her mind' trick so many times. Eventually, scary though it seems, someone is going to have to face the camera sans excuse and break into song.  Meanwhile go rent `Hedwig,' `My Fair Lady,' or `South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut.' You know, I'd like to pretend that I long for the rebirth of the movie musical, but I don't. All we'll get is a lot more mercenary miscasting, stars that can't sing and a whole shelf of horrific Andrew Lloyd Webber vanity projects.  Seriously: what musicals from the last 20 years would you make a movie out of?  We'll see how great everyone thinks it is when they film just the first act of `Into the Woods' with Britney Spears as Little Red, `Phantom of the Opera' with John Travolta (oh, wait, that almost happened), or `JCS' with Leo! The only recent musical I want to see a movie of is Jason Robert Brown's `Parade.'  Or how about doing `Nine' with Antonio Banderas from the Roundabout as a feature?  Even the remake of `The Singing Detective' by one of my favorite directors makes me nervous.Other than that, what are we getting ourselves into?  A movie-musical of `Les Mis' with Jessica Simpson as Cosette, Christina Aguilera as Eponine, Justin Timberlake as Marius, how about Usher as Enjolras?  Maybe Celine Dion as Fantine?  Maybe Ja Rule can play Graintaire, or Busta Rhymes.  And for Valjean and Javert?  Well, what does it matter, they won't need to actually be able to SING.  Are we really prepared for that?",Chicago
230,segacs,All that Jazz,8,5 February 2005,"What a fun movie! Renee Zellweiger singing. Richard Gere tapdancing. A superb cast with hidden talents. And who knew? Chicago a smash hit! Well . . . everyone.Chicago, for anyone unfamiliar with the story, is about a wannabe star, Roxie Hart (Zellweiger) who shoots her lover and lands up on trial for murder. Billy Flynn (Gere) plays her defence lawyer. Also in Roxie's cellblock is Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones), a former star act also on trial for murder.The story is simple on its surface. The singing and dancing numbers are what dazzle, and ultimately what make the movie so successful. The challenge faced in adapting a musical play to the silver screen is a formidable one: while it's perfectly natural and accepted for actors to break out into song and dance spontaneously on stage, it seems a bit incongruous at times in the movies. In Chicago, the movie gets around this tricky problem seamlessly, by placing itself firmly in Roxie's head. Roxie is a woman who escapes reality by fantasizing about super-stardom, so her envisioning of every scene as an act from a show not only makes the musical numbers fit the movie, it also builds dimension to her character.One of the most enjoyable aspects of this movie was seeing actors such as Gere and Zellweieger in roles that we may have never expected. The closest I've ever heard Renee Zellweiger come to singing before was her (purposley) god-awful performance in Bridget Jones' Diary. As for Richard Gere, seeing the respected actor make his entrance into the movie doing a musical number in which he strips down to his boxers was laugh-out-loud funny.Chicago delivers on every front, from musical numbers to acting performances to costumes and sets. The singing, the dancing, the showmanship, and All That Jazz . . . Chicago has it all.",Chicago

232,cafesmitty,Easily Deserved Best Picture,7,25 August 2003,"I can see why this film won best picture.  Hollywood always loved a musical and this is one of the most successful musicals in years and here is why.THE ACTING and THE SINGING: First rate by all involve.  Renee Zwellenger impressed the hell out of me, as well as the John C. Reilly in his most amazing role to date.  Who knew these people have this type of talent inside of them.  It was also rather cool to find Richard Gere in something completely different than he ever did before.  Another amazing and wonderful performance was given by Queen Latifah.  THE PRODUCTION:  I felt I was taken to another time and place and it was a nice break from the realistic crime dramas or heartstrings dramas that are normally Oscar contenders.  It's rare when a film successfully bring over the theatric parts.  At times I felt like I was watching a live show.  The use of lighting and color to express mood and setting was beyond reproach.THE SONGS:  The songs all told a story and help moved the picture along. For me, the most amazing song was John C. Reilley's Mr. Cellophane and of course followed closely by Queen Latifah's number.  Plus the number with all the prison women explaining in song, how they got there.  I also enjoyed the ventriloquism number performed by Richard Gere with Renee Zwellenger as his Charlie McCarthy.  But all the songs were well written and timed perfectlyAnd of course, Catherine Zeta Jones... a very strong role for her and she deservedly won the Oscar, but I still think Zwellenger stole the show.  All in all its a cool movie that gives you a good show and sometimes, a show is all that you want and this is one of the best ones",Chicago
233,varundelpiero,The worst movie to ever win Best Picture?,6,17 October 2008,"Don't get me wrong...this was a good movie, but any film that eventually wins Best Picture carries the burden of heightened expectation; expectation that a musical just can't live up to. I'll admit that I am a bit biased here, but I just can't appreciate musicals on the big screen. Musicals belong on stage, and should probably stay there. That's not to say I hate music; in fact I absolutely love music, but I believe that music (with vocals) only belongs in a movie as part of the background music/soundtrack or when the subject matter calls for it (as in documentaries and biopics). Seeing actors of notable reputation burst sporadically into song during the film is simply...ruinous.Like I said, the movie itself is good if you exclude the singing. The plot is decent and the Screenplay is well-written. Even the lyrics are well-thought of. Rob Marshall's directing in his feature debut is sound, and the cast is stellar, especially Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, and John C. Reilly, except of course for the singing. But seeing Richard Gere and Reilly burst into song was almost embarrassingly unwatchable. I mean, what's the fascination here? Why couldn't this have been put into a running dialogue? This movie could have worked for me if it was done in an L.A. CONFIDENTIAL-type style.I just can't see how this movie was better than GANGS OF NEW YORK, THE PIANIST, THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS or even THE HOURS. I can come up with no logical reasoning as to why the Academy voted this way.To conclude, the movie was good, worthy of a watch, simply because it won Best Picture. Fans of musicals will love this one I guess. If you're not a fan (like me) you'll become frustrated, as every time the story starts to become intriguing, the cast starts to sing and all you can do is let out a quiet exasperated sigh and try to tolerate it. The one musical piece that was clever was the crucial first scene with Zellweger and Gere but even that lost it's appeal after a short while.I recommend that you see this one at least once, for the pros mentioned earlier, and simply because it won Best Picture. But like I said, I am biased against musicals on the silver screen.6/10. 3 stars. Will NOT enter my Top 250.",Chicago

236,palacerevolution2000,Not bad,6,24 July 2020,"I like Fosse's material; he has the same thread running through them all. But I also think this film is way over-rated. The songs, and lyrics are okay. Not brilliant or especially clever. Richard Gere got some choice numbers, and he seemed to be having a great time. I see where Rene Z gets a lot of flak, for doing what she does. I thought she was fantastic. In the dance numbers she has a natural elegance and body language that came off beautiful. The weak point IMO is Caterina ZJ. I don't know the back story, but it feels like she lobbied for that role, and vowed to be the best dancer that money can buy. She works so hard at it. But that is how it comes off: like work, and a work-out. I feel like she was trying to hammer some sexuality into her step. And while Q Latifah has a much smaller role I did not get much from her portrayal. And she is usually tops. So - Rene, Gere, Taye Diggs, John C Reilly ( who is always great), good. Caterina, and the Queen, and the score, not so good.",Chicago
237,paul-nemecek,My Kind of Town and My Kind of Movie,10,2 July 2018,"I am a musician who loves movies and Chicago. This made picking a movie to review an easy task for me. The musical movie Chicago is an adaptation of the stage production written by Bob Fosse et. al. in 1975. Fosse grew up in Chicago in the 1930's and 1940's and the movie shows that Chicago as viewed through the jaded cynicism of the 1970's.Renee Zellweger plays Roxie Hart, a would-be singer accused of homicide. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Velma Kelly, a nightclub singer who has been convicted of homicide. Richard Gere plays Billy Flynn, the slick, slightly smarmy lawyer who represents the two women.Gangster Chicago is the setting of this story, but the story is really about media coverage, celebrity, and hype. Even as she anticipates her murder trial, Roxie and Billy are trying to figure out how to play the media angles so that Roxie can be acquitted and her career can be energized. Ironically, the hype surrounding the movie is just the kind of hype that the movie views with cynicism and disdain.Chicago is considered to be a front-runner in the Oscar race with 13 nominations including nominations for best picture, rookie director Rob Marshall, and acting nominations for Zellwegger, Zeta-Jones, Queen Latifah, and John C. Reilly. Richard Gere, who won the Golden Globe for best actor in a comedy or musical, was the only prominent actor in the film not nominated for an Oscar for his performance.This is the second year in a row that a musical has been nominated for best picture (Moulin Rouge was nominated last year). Two in a row is not exactly a trend, and if Chicago should win best picture it will be the first musical to do so since Oliver won the prize in 1968.Oscar hype aside, is this a good movie? Yes. The performances are outstanding, especially John C. Reilly as the not-too-sharp but faithful husband of Roxie Hart. The movie is worth seeing if only to see Reilly singing ""Mr. Cellophane"". But it's not just performances that get my thumb tilting upward. The songs are great, and the film's story is light in tone, yet delightfully cynical while dealing with the lurid side of Chicago's past.And this is the lurid side of Chicago's past to be sure. In his famous poem about Chicago, Carl Sandburg describes Chicago as the city of big shoulders with its husky workers. Sandburg also talks about a violent city with painted ladies, and this is the Chicago depicted here (""we're not in Kansas, anymore Toto""). If dark themes with a light tone viewed through a sharply cynical lens are your cup of tea, give this one a try. If you would prefer dark themes with a dark tone and a darkly cynical lens, Gangs of New York might better fill the bill. I do love New York, but Chicago really is my kind of town and Chicago is my kind of movie.",Chicago
238,severindringel,It feels like Broadway!,8,22 January 2021,"After classics like West Side Story, The Sound of Music or All that Jazz, Rob Marshall's adaptation of the Broadway sensation has revived the musical genre that was thought dead after a long drought on the big screen. Chicago not only stands for spectacular staging, but also inspires with a strong cast and a weighty plot. The protagonist Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) wants to follow her great role model Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and become the next big star in the jazz club scene. However, a murder interferes with her plans and Roxie has to answer for it. The involvement of Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), a lawyer who has yet to be beaten in court, ensures that Roxie gets finally in the headlines. This leads to a rivalry with her former idol Velma. Besides, Roxie realises: fame doesn't last long in this town.Renee Zellweger is ideally cast as the unpredictable Roxie. She convinces with her performance of a manipulative psychopath and is very believable despite her often exaggerated acting. The same can be said for Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is not always relevant to the plot, but is particularly inspiring in her musical performances. She is clearly more professional and mature than Roxie, although she too definitely has psychopathic traits. Richard Gere once again plays a one-dimensional womaniser, but surprises with his good voice and dancing skills. Queen Latifah as the inmates' ""mama"" and John C. Reilly as Roxie's husband Amos appear only rarely, but then provide the empathetic moments when they actually only want to do good for the murderous women.Chicago is colourful, lively and hardly contains any lulls due to the many musical interludes. What makes the film even more interesting is the thoroughly realistic portrayal of corrupt and criminal Chicago in the 1920s. In this film, Marshall manages to put the plot, which is often of secondary importance in musicals, almost on a par with the music. The lyrics of the songs very often tell the story and reveal valuable details. That is why it is important to always listen carefully. However, this is also a problem of the film. There are hardly any breaks and if you look away for a moment, you might lose the connection completely. This is sometimes quite stressful. The fact that Zellweger in particular, true to her character, often plays over the top is also a matter of habit. Because of its originality, Chicago is definitely a film classic that should not be missed!",Chicago
239,HiddenVoice,I was extremely JAZZZZZED,7,24 December 2004,"Chicago may be undeservedly given the best picture award but it is the most entertaining films you'll see in years.Fame comes before freedom .Thats the tag line this movie should have given.Performances could not have been better ,i can't believe that Mr.Gere did not receive any nominations for his outstanding performance unlike all the other actors.The Choreography,cinematography,direction,art direction,costumes,music and most especially the editing were all top notch.Especially the editing,it's one of the best editing I've ever seen.A well written and directed and acted film from beginning till end, although it wouldn't be the best choice as a best picture.But still a wonderful film.",Chicago

The cast sang and danced with an energy one sees in musicals done for the stage and I liked the seamless movement from the narrative to the song and dance numbers. The movie was edited in such a way that not only did the plot move logically but the dance numbers added to what you learned about each character.Each actor fit the character and with Renée Zellweger and Richard Gere, it was fun to see them in characters they have not been seen in before.While Catherine Zeta-Jones's Velma Kelly was great, I thought it strange she got the Oscar for the role. I only say that because she really wasn't on screen alot even though it seemed that Renee and Zeta-Jones were equal co-stars. I think Renee did the better job since she had a majority of the scenes.John C. Reilly had a great song ""Mr. Cellophane"" and Queen Latifah added to her resume as the Matron.My favorite numbers is the opening ""All that Jazz"", the six murderess, ""Mr. Cellophane"", ""Roxie Heart"", and the closing number.",Chicago

242,RJBose,All That Hype,6,11 February 2003,"The movie version of ""Chicago"" now garnering so much praise and attention (not to mention award nominations)is only a moderately well put-together adaptation of the well known Broadway musical of the same name.  What is good about the movie is what was good about the Broadway show: innovative choreography by Bob Fosse and the imaginative set designs which moved the story along.  What is not so good are the ""famous"" actors and actresses of distinctly limited singing and dancing ability who have been foisted upon the unsuspecting (or indifferent) audiences who apparently long to see them sing and dance simply because they are famous. The brilliant irony, of course, is that this is exactly the premise of the show-within-a-show we observe with Roxy, Velma and Billy.   These roles were played on Broadway by top class singers and (especially) dancers who made ""Chicago"" an event- performed live every night on stage. The story serves as a mere vehicle for the athletic and inspired dancing Fosse designed.  Catherine Zeta-Jones may light up a cell phone commercial, but this show calls for more than the earnest efforts which may fit the bill at a dance hall in Cardiff.  Richard Gere talks through his songs, and stiffly lumbers through his dance steps like the aging, past-middle age actor he is, and Renee's voice is even thinner than her non-dancer's legs. The only performers who can hold their own are Queen Latifa (who is of course, a real singer), and the ""extras"" in the cast and chorus who continually show-up the featured ""stars"" in ability and style.   The plotline of the story involves a small talent aspiring song and dance performer (Roxy/Renee)who lands up on Death Row in 1920's Chicago after murdering her lover, who had falsely claimed connections to aid her in her quest for stardom.  In prison, she finds a night club performer of small renown (Velma/Jones) also awaiting trial for a similar infraction.  Her strategy has been to retain well a known attorney (Billy/Gere) who specializes in winning cases by playing to the press, and building up a following in the tabloid newspapers.  The merits of the case don't matter, it's the fame of his clients which wins the juries over. 
   Here then is the irony; the plot of ""Chicago"" revolves around efforts to cultivate interest in the press in people who's only claim to fame is being famous.  Who needs a musical with actual singers and dancers when you can cast movie stars?  The audiences will come just the same, drawn by curiosity for celebrities no matter how vapid the subjects, before turning to whatever the latest hype extols.  As Billy/Gere smugly informs us, ""That's Chicago"".",Chicago
243,Buff2001,Entertainment First Class!!!,10,11 January 2003,"Forget all the naysayers or pseudo-critics on this site. This musical, and it IS a musical, is top drawer.

Based on this criteria this movie rates an 11, better than the best.Refer to Cabaret, which won 8 academy awards. Just because it had the under tone of the nazi menace and the homosexual requirement, does not make it the equal of Chicago. I like Cabaret, but Chicago is better.People have said that they don't pull for the characters. Forget that!. The characters are the ones that were written into the musical. The important thing here is the music and the people performing. In this case I can not dis-associate myself from the real people: Zellweger, Zeta-Jones and Gere. I am pulling for them and they come through in spades.There is no way I can see Cabaret and not see Liza and Joel. Actually when I think of them I only think of those one single characterizations. When I see Gere (Officer and Gentleman, Intersection, etc. etc); Zellweger (Jerry McGuire, Nurse Betty, etc) and Zeta-Jones (Entrapment, etc), I am amazed at the performances they turn in way out of their previously exhibited capabilities.A MUST SEE MOVIE,",Chicago
244,Jona1988,Brilliant technically and good entertainment.,7,3 March 2011,"Chicago is a widely praised and much awarded film. Is it really that good? According to me the answer to that question is no. Still that doesn't in any way mean that I think it is a poor film. Chicago is great entertainment! So the main point of a musical film should naturally be the music. The music I thought was good but not fantastic. The song lyrics were very well done fitting in to the story and the performances were very good for most of the time. Still the music is nothing that stayed in my mind after the film was over. Richard Gere made a really great role in this film. His character is great fun, good acting and also great singing very impressive. However I don't like Renée Zellweger very well, but I suppose it's not her performance thats the problem, she just doesn't work for me. Catherine Zeta-Jones who plays her rival here I like much better and I think she is also better in this film. Even if her part is smaller and maybe one is supposed to relate to Zellweger's more she almost stole the show according to me. Both their singing is very good also but I wasn't overwhelmed in any way. Still that may just be me and doesn't mean that the performance was flawed. Queen Latifah has a great and funny part kind of a comic relief I felt, works brilliant. The thing that is massively impressive is the visual points. The editing is just brilliant, how the music numbers are woven together with the real events is amazing. When it jumps from people standing talking in front of a crowd to a enormous concert scene I as a viewer is just amazed. Now over to the story which for me was a positive surprise. Maybe I just wasn't expecting anything from that part thinking that any plot would just have been thrown in to tie together a bunch of music numbers. But what I found was that the story was much more, not just there to serve that roll but actually a story worth following. Well written and thought out. At the beginning it might feel kind of straight forward but then it expands to something interesting and when it nears the end I'm at full concentration to see how it will finish.Chicago is great entertainment. It is nothing perfect. Some really strong parts and a couple of obvious weak ones. Supprisingly well made story and outstanding visuals but some of the acting and singing is just OK but nothing special. I'm no big fan of musicals and haven't seen many. I will not see Chicago any time again soon but my experience of it was positive, it is not as good as it's reputation would imply according to me but I was not disappointed. I give it a strong 7 out of 10.",Chicago

246,folsominc2,Unethical Hogwash!,1,23 January 2006,"The music isn't too bad, but the plot of the story infuriates me more than I thought it could.Not only are they delivering an example of almost all people as pure trash, as women using their sexual wiles to influence men (where is the sexual equality? They are nothing but flesh and sex!) but the fact of the matter is that Roxie Hart KILLED a man. She gave sexual favors out to a man who she thought would give her something she wanted. She didn't get it so she immediately killed him in anger. Velma Kelly, at least, had a more legitimate reason for a ""killing in passion"" when she found her husband and sister together.Hart horribly manipulated her poor husband who was just a hard-working slob and thought a PLUMBER! would have connections in a night club. How stupid can you get?! AND on top of all this, introduce the character ""Billy"" who is so typically a lawyer as to manipulate the law and truth for his own personal gains and show everything as a ""Circus"" show - unbelievable but showy enough to distract from the truth.But the final insult was that they publicized their killings and became popular again. No justice, no satisfaction for the audience, just the same monotonous tone that was throughout the entire movie.I can say that this is one of the two or three movies that I actually fast-forwarded through parts because it was hung up in boredom! My ending thoughts? I would have had her poor slob of a husband shoot her in the ending when he found out she had used him yet again, and the last scene is her picture for the last time in the paper.",Chicago

Zeta Jones is wonderful and the dance at the end brings an icy reality to coincide with the weather of Chicago which as I write this will turn brutally horrendous. Reciprocity singer Queen Latifah is incredible. I just adore her in that part. She is trilling, talented and oh so sexy!

I have read some other reviews that question the rating of this movie and I have to join them in saying this movie was given the wrong rating.  The material presented in this movie is borderline R rating.  The movie in itself is about wives who murder their husbands and use their sexuality free themselves and make them famous.  The movie contains a hot and heavy sex scene along with several other tid bits of seductivity.  The dancing in this movie, while very well choreographed is mainly erotic and seductive.  As for violence, I do not have much complaints.  Strong sexuality and language in a PG-13 are what bother me and this movie carries it.Adults and older teens who can push aside the objectionable material will find CHICAGO quite enjoyable.  It truly doesn't let down and it is a great effort in revival of the ""movie musical"" genre, in which I hope to see more of.Filled with a number of classic songs, great costumes and dancing, I give CHICAGO a 9/10.",Chicago
253,Servo-11,"OK, but nothing special, just RAZZLE DAZZLE",6,26 February 2003,"The songs were catchy, but I would prefer to just listen to the CD rather than sitting through the entire film again.  The format of introducing the numbers quickly grew tedious and added little to the plot, just what the characters were like (which could have been summed up in a couple lines). It dragged on too long and I checked my watch at least 5 times.  I don't hate musicals, but I'm not overly fond of them either.  However, I much prefer Singin' in the Rain where the dialogue sparkled and there was more meat to the story.  This movie was just all style and no substance, which was my opinion of Moulin Rouge.  If this is the way musicals are heading, I think the genre should just retire gracefully.The only high points of this film were Catherine Zeta-Jones, who was a knockout in the looks, singing and dancing departments, and Queen Latifah, for all that we saw of her (and only one number!  What's up with that?). Richard Gere surprised me pleasantly, but I fail to see the appeal of Renee Zellweger.  I don't think she or John C. Reilly did well enough to earn their nominations.  From what I have seen of Reilly in other films, he's just playing the same role over and over.  And Zellweger just didn't have the talent -- or lipsynching skills! -- to hold her own against Zeta-Jones.6/10 -- it was fun for one viewing, but a 2nd one would serve no purpose. All that it contains is right there to see, unlike The Two Towers where even after seeing it 6 times, I am catching subtleties and underlying images and themes.  I think all the ""razzle dazzle"" Richard Gere sings about has fooled audiences big time.",Chicago

My jaw dropped open as I saw the show come to life: I could not imagine a better cast. Richard Gere was an unbeleivable Billy Flynn - a song and dance man extraordinaire. Renee Zellweger an absolute perfect Roxie Hart. Catherine Zeta-Jones was almost ""too"" pretty to be Velma Kelly, the hardened criminal she was supposed to be but her amazing singing and dancing made up for it. Queen Latifah a dream, but the biggest surprise was John C. Reilly --- this man has always been a hidden gem in most movies --- but the voice --- what a hidden talent to be reckoned with for years to come!!!!I could see this movie every day for the rest of the year and not get tired of it --- if this movie does not win Oscars, the Academy is more foolish than I ever thought it could be after the Gladiator debacle/crap a few years back.

He makes stars out of them in prison and gains the sympathy of the jury--------------------Sometimes things happen that are so dumb that you don't even want to know why or how they happened. I'm no big fan of the Pianist"" but that movie was definitely superior than Chicago"", a chaotic and only marginally interesting musical which looks as if it was taken from an outdated era and placed today to look even more outdated. I mean, come on! 13 Oscar nominations for Chicago"", including best director and best supporting actress Queen Latifah? 6 won Oscars, including best picture of the whole year and best supporting actress Catherine-Zeta Jones? 3 Golden Globes? What is this? It looks as if the academy was having a yard sale and handing out nominations for free. The list of Oscar stinkers lately is alarming, from The English patient"", Shakespeare in love"" up to Gladiator"".All right, admittedly there were some good points in this. Richard Gere was surprisingly excellent in this as the clever lawyer Billy ( his great line about how If Jesus was alive today living in Chicago and asked for my help his whole case would have turned out differently."" ) but was ignored by the Oscars. Also, there are some clever observations about the rotten nature of show business and the media obsessed society. But they are not strong enough to carry the whole wooden story into a better territory. There are dozens of excellent Musicals, like The West side story"", but here the musical scenes are presented in an annoying manner, in form of weird fantasies of the soulless characters, and only create a slimy feeling.Grade: 4/10",Chicago

The movie's cuts between the central narrative and the musical stage were well-done too.The acting is phenomenal, particularly from leading light Renée Zellweger, but also from everyone else.The plot rips along, and while the characters are caricatures, they are fun caricatures.

258,timothymcclenaghan,Richard Gere Can't Tap Dance,5,3 August 2005,"For those of you who were faked out by the alleged tap dancing of Richard Gere, here's the scoop. Go back and review the dance scene again. There is only one very brief whole-body shot of Gere dancing where he does a very simple move that anyone could learn in five minutes. Otherwise, the camera is shooting waist-up (where it's really easy to pretend to dance while the tapping sound is dubbed in), or the camera is shooting knees-down, where Gere's stunt double did all the footwork. Nobody could have done complex footwork like that without years of training. Hollywood is very clever when it comes to working with actors who can't dance or sing. The camera can do long shots (from a distance) where you can't really see who is actually doing the dancing. This technique was used in the film Footloose to make you think that Kevin Bacon could actually dance as proficiently as was shown.On the other hand, Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta Jones really can dance, which is proved by the camera filming their entire bodies while performing the dance numbers.",Chicago
259,proffate,Interesting new take on the musical genre,10,28 August 2003,"The Broadway musical has pretty much retained the same format since it first appeared: characters go through the play and, at critical moments, BURST INTO SONG! Chicago is the first I've seen to take a different tack.Here, the somewhat drab dramatic plotline goes along telling the story with the spectacular musical numbers serving the function of a Greek Chorus, accentuating elements of the plot. So a press conference turns into a puppet show, with attorney Billy Flynn manipulating reporters. A scene in which Velma describes her nightclub sister act becomes a full-fledged routine with Catherine Zeta-Jones performing both parts.Beneath the glitz of the musical numbers, the film presents a cynical message. The three major roles, two murderous women and their sleazy lawyer, all come out smelling like roses. The only objectively admirable character is John C. Reilly's Amos, who hocks everything he owns to defend his unfaithful wife. He is used, then cast aside. If this is the movie's message, that morality is for chumps, then it manages to slide it in smoothly.I'm not sure this is a good thing in an otherwise highly entertaining film.",Chicago
260,rtrnt,"Glossy musical, a great testament to the genre",9,19 October 2020,"Rob Marshall's cinematic adaptation of this extraordinary musical is definitely gripping and eye-popping. I only wish all musicals could be the stylish and provocative. Renee Zellwegger is Roxie Hart, an aspiring jazz singer who winds up killing her lover and seems destined for an easy conviction until flamboyant, dastardly corrupt lawyer Bill Flynn (Richard Gere, stepping up his lawyer game) comes into the picture. Catherine Zeta-Jones is fellow inmate who comes to despise Roxie for knocking her off the front pages.The musical numbers in this film are colorful, vociferous and riveting to watch. It fully captures the musical genre and period detail of 1920s Chicago. Although Zeta-Jones won an Oscar for her performance in this film, I thought Zellwegger out-acted her by leaps and bounds. Her coy-but-calculating Roxie is truly the gem of the whole story. Queen Latifah is a great presence as the prison warden. John C. Reilly is a sympathetic presence as Roxie's scorned, but still loyal husband. Colm Feore is solid as the determined Chicago district attorney who grapples with defense attorney Flynn's antics. All told, a visual feast, a musical delight and an acting tour-de-force. Grandly recommended.",Chicago
261,perlner,"The movie's good, but Broadway is better.",7,1 January 2003,"This movie is not bad as movie musicals go, but it's no ""West Side Story"" nor even ""Evita.""Part of the problem is the source material -- the movie is *very* true to it, capturing the feel of the Broadway show quite well, but the music isn't all that pretty, and there's not much variety in the setting either. Although the movie uses some cinematic magic to provide some different angles and scenes, it's still all very much the same. Not much story, and not much character development either.However, what the movie did right was the way in which it exploited its medium to capture the feel of a movie and a stage show at the same time. There are extra scenes in the movie that make the story clearer and the characters, especially Roxie, more interesting. And there's much more in the way of makeup and costuming, which sometimes enhanced the scenes, and other times was just distracting.Where the movie falls short of the show is in the casting. Taye Diggs and Richard Gere alone stand above their Broadway counterparts (sorry Queen Latifah - you're good, but your stage double was amazing). Roxie, Amos, and Mary Sunshine of the movie were especially lacking that spirit which made the audience go wild on Broadway.The movie cut some important scenes as well to make way for its extra material and the shorter expected running time of a movie. Mostly, it serves efficiently as just another staging of the musical with brand-name faces and expensively-enhanced production values.If you have never seen the stage show, and you like musicals, you will enjoy this movie. But in the end, the song ""Razzle Dazzle"" captures what this movie will do quite well - if you're lucky, and you have nothing to compare it to, you will enjoy yourself in the spectacle without noticing the missing talent and content.",Chicago
262,Teebs2,Stagefright,7,17 January 2006,"The rather dubious winner of the 2002 best picture Oscar is as shallow a film as you can find, but the slick musical numbers more than make up for lack of depth through sheer exuberance. Renee Zellweger plays Roxie Hart, a neglected housewife with dreams of returning to her abandoned career on the stage. When she attempts to sleep her way back into show business, her dreams are shattered when her lover turns out to be no more than a predatory furniture salesman, and when he dismisses her she pumps him full of lead.The cast are all obviously having a great time - Although initially I thought Zellweger was hopelessly miscast, her usual nervous sweetness here hides a ruthless and calculating attention seeker. Catherine Zeta-Jones uses her killer combination of slightly brash attitude, killer figure and aggressive sexuality and a belter of a voice to near steal the film as Velma Kelly, the incarcerated stage star whose publicity Roxie steals.Rob Marshall missed out on a directing award and it's clear to see why - The choreography is very slick with enough dizzyingly edited flesh on view to make it genuinely raunchy for a modern MTV crowd but with very well performed musical numbers and well staged performances for fans of the stories previous incarnations on stage and screen. However it lacks the cinematic flair of something like Baz Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge"" and the real life scenes are largely uninspired. The decision to make the musical numbers as ""fantasies"" I found effective, and commented on the plot well.It's also quite refreshing to see a musical that is at it's core deeply cynical - rather than the sickly optimism often associated with the genre. Billy Flynn controls Roxie and the press like puppets, in perhaps the most striking musical sequence. In another scene, a girl's very real execution by hanging is contrasted with her performing an acrobatic rope act to rapturous applause. Billy creates a frenzy of media attention around Roxie's inexcusable criminal action and the final scene is a suitably sly dig at show business. Velma assures Roxie that the fact they hate each other shouldn't stop them performing, and they take to the stage to great applause, ending in an act where they use imitation machine guns to form their names in lights.It is in this respect that Marshall's film seems most uncertain. He seems too fond of all the showbiz glitz of his cast and the song and dance numbers to wholeheartedly create a subversive and cynical film, attacking the superficiality of celebrity, the media, the public and the strikingly amoral women's revenge theme. The film is undeniably entertaining, but not as lethal as it might have been.",Chicago

I had a nice time at the play so fast forward a few months and I decided to watch the movie. Honestly it's pretty much the exact same on film as it is on stage.Renee Zellweger plays Roxie, a housewife wanna be starlit who kills her lover on the side when he won't contact an agent friend of his. Roxie's husband is played by John C. Reilly and he's a pushover. He's trying to save his wife from the death penalty and hires a shady lawyer played by Richard Gere. Catherine Zeta Jones plays the original starlet wannabe who kills a lover but no one cares about her anymore because of Roxie. Queen Latifah plays Mama who acts as a prison agent getting Roxie and Veronica gigs on the outside.The setting is 1920's Chicago so prohibition and mobsters are of the times. Newspapermen make the murdering women stars but their 15 minutes of fame is almost up until they are released from prison and start a successful vaudeville act.Not terrible for a musical and all the songs are catchy and will get stuck in your head.

Countless actresses, including Madonna and Goldie Hawn, had been considered for roles.  Scripts and directors changed with every news item.  Finally, in late 2002, the finished version was released to a wary and eager public. What they saw was a sexy, dark, colorful musical with the potential to re-ignite and entire genre.Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) is a mildly-talented wanna-be jazz singer who idolizes Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a singer who killed her husband and sister when she found them in bed together.  Roxie beings an affair with Fred Casely (Dominic West), who promises to get her a gig at the Onyx Club. When she finds out that this was a lie to get her in bed, Roxie shoots him and tries to pin the blame on her mild-mannered husband Amos (John C. Reilly), but ends up giving herself away.  In jail she meets Velma herself under the eyes of Matron Mama Morton (Queen Latifah), and both of the merry murderesses hire slick lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) to defend them in court.At first glance, the casting of this movie would give one doubt, but in reality, virtually all of the leads with the exception of Zellweger have had previous musical or dance experience.  Zellweger herself brings in a surprisingly effective performance, simultaneously playing Roxie's vulnerability and her delusions of grandeur.  Zeta-Jones is beyond fantastic as Velma Kelly: eager to please, undeniably sexy, and ambitious as all get out with a great pair of legs.  Even Gere is good in his role, the ultimate lawyer with more razzle dazzle up his sleeve than a three-ring circus.  The stand-out, however, is Queen Latifah, who's only number -- ""When You're Good To Mama"" -- is a powerful, amazingly sensual and confident performance that will leave those unfamiliar with her abilities breathless (fans of the Queen already know about her power and grace).  Additionally, a host of enjoyable and colorful cameos abound including newly-accused socialite murderer Kitty Baxter (Lucy Liu) and eager reporter Mary Sunshine (Christine Baranski, in a role traditionally played by a drag queen).The film was directed by Rob Marshall, who had previous experience choreographing ""Chicago"" for the stage.  Watching this film, one is shocked to realize that this is his first film.  Marshall has a confident hand, and a gift for amazing choreography and pace.  The sets are simple but effective, the costumes provocative, and the whole movie coherent and even. Some musical numbers, like the dazzling and sexy ""Cell Block Tango"" are reminiscent of the quick-cut fury of the early parts of ""Moulin Rouge!"", but Marshall is equally skilled at more languid numbers, like the wonderfully two-toned ""Funny Honey.""The only negative comments to be had revolve around the removal of a wonderful duet between Zeta-Jones and Latifah called ""Class.""  Although featured on the soundtrack, it was cut out of the final cut of the film, which is a terrible shame, as it's a very humorous song and the two voices work very well together.  ""Chicago"" has the ability, even more so than its predecessor ""Moulin Rouge!"", to revitalize an old, tired genre like the musical.  It's Oscar wins, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress for Zeta-Jones, and the glowing reviews bode well for other musical adaptations. If they could all be made with as much love for the source material as this film, and with as much talent and skill on both sides of the camera, then bring on the jazz.  9 out of 10.",Chicago

But, when I saw Chicago I had a totally different view of musicals. The songs were fantastic, and the acting was the best overall of 2002. Renee Zellweger did her best performance ever, and Catharine Zeta-Jones does very well. And Richard Gere did his best job ever. I don't think he'll be in that good of a movie anymore. Queen Latifah was also very good. And I can't believe John C. Reily! He was really good in this. He was in three Best Picture nominees this year! They were Chicago, The Hours, and Gangs of New York. Overall, Chicago is the best musical ever made, and definatly worth watching. It deserves an 8/10.",Chicago
267,taikman,Impressive musical spectacular,8,24 February 2003,"The scene: a smoky, swinging jazz club in 1920s Chicago. Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger), aspiring singer and dancer, watches in awe as Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) sizzles through her rendition of All That Jazz', minus the sister and cheating lover whose murders she is about to be arrested for. Roxie soon chalks up a killing of her own when she shoots her scumbag boyfriend so she too is sent to prison, where with the help of the warden, Mama (Queen Latifa) and Roxie's loving but dull husband Amos (John C. Reilly), she hires the slick and greedy Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) to be her lawyer. Flynn is also the lawyer for Velma and the two women begin a vicious competition for publicity as they try to manipulate the scandal-loving media so that they get off their charges and get rich off their fame. It's big, it's bold, it's got 13 Oscar nominations and yes, it is really good. The musical numbers are all very impressive, with the standout being the The Prison Rag', the production is high quality and both the acting and musical performances are  good (though Richard Gere's singing is only adequate). For me the most impressive thing though was how Chicago', unlike Moulin Rouge', managed to tell an interesting story as well as razzle-dazzle us with song and dance spectaculars. Rather than have the characters suddenly and unrealistically burst into song Chicago'  weaves the musical numbers cleverly into the plot by showing them as actual stage performances or as taking place in Roxie's vivid imagination while a real' event is happening. For example one of the movie's most powerful scenes takes place as Roxie imagines a hanging, another when Flynn questions a key witness. Chicago' is excellent, but I still went away not wholly satisfied, because towards the end all the music was just beginning to get a bit much and, despite how deftly the plot was handled, there were still moments when I wanted more acting and less singing. But mainly the problem was that the main characters are basically horrible people. Charismatic yes, but still selfish, nasty and egotistical, which means that while they're interesting you don't care about them as much as you would about people you actually liked. Still, part of the point of the movie is that nasty but charming people can get away with an awful lot in our society if they know how to work the system, so I haven't marked Chicago' down for that. If you like musicals, then you'll probably love this. 8/10",Chicago
268,talkymeat,This won Best Picture?....Inconceivable!,4,15 July 2010,"Roxie Hart is a Broadway hopeful in a fading marriage who is having an affair with a man named Fred Casely. Upon learning that Casely has been lying to her about his connections and plans to leave her, Roxie shoots him and is sent to death row. Running low on options, Roxie pays for the service of a sleazy attorney named Billy Flynn who just may be her only hope of getting out of prison.Chicago is an extremely bad movie. The fact that is was even nominated for a Best Picture Oscar is a complete sham, but it winning is just beyond words. The Academy has a long history of ignoring excellent movies and giving Oscars to inferior pictures, but this is ridiculous. The acting is bad, the writing atrocious and nearly every person in it is horribly miscast. Renee Zellwegger can't sing at all and Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere don't help matters much. It appears that this was cast solely on how famous someone was, not on acting/singing ability. A couple of the songs are good, but most of those aren't good either. Many of them are poorly integrated as well as being too long.Worse than all these failings would be a certain hard to describe ""full of itself"" quality. It's as if every actor is saying: ""I'm such a great actor, don't you just love me."" I hated every character, and not because they are morally reprehensible. Many flawed and even mean characters can be interesting and even comical if done right; these aren't. Like the actors the characters are disgustingly full of themselves. Fans of Chicago would no doubt say that this was making a point about show business, and if that's what this movie was trying for it failed. Just like an experiment every movie needs a control; something to balance out all the bad characters and create a acceptable contrast. There is no moral center here, every character is equally flawed and irritating. Avoid Chicago at all costs. It is a musical at it's worst: self-indulgent, overly elaborate and poorly sung. In addition to being a perfect example of how incompetent the Academy can really be. The fact that this beat out LOTR: The Two Towers and Gangs of New York is a complete joke.",Chicago

Zwick and others in a similar vein (I recall reading several ""professional"" reviews making similar points) Chicago is simply terrific! I would remind Mr. Zwick that there are many different types of musicals. Not all musicals are created to make us feel warm and good. The movie of Chicago is true to its many incarnations and to the reality of the city in the 1920s. One of the earliest sound film genres is the gangster flick. These wonderful pre-Hayes code movies were extremely cynical, sexual and violent. Chicago quotes from these in many scenes in a wonderfully informed way, then turns and spins them around into an original,flamboyant creation. This is the first film in years that I have paid 5 times to see in the movie theatre. I saw and loved the 1975 Broadway version and Rob Marshall has seen that the movie keeps true to its source. I believe Chicago will take its place among the great movie musicals.",Chicago
273,RNHunter,A real treat - from many aspects,10,27 June 2004,"Chicago is an exceptional movie. Exceptional because it revives the era of musicals - which many of us had loved and thought were missing now forever. The story was not at all what I expected, yet the story works and works excellently. Humor and insights into human nature also were both fun and well done.The big feature of this - at least for me - is ""who knew that Renee Zellwegger and Richard Gere could sing and dance as well?"". They did great at that also. I would imagine to become big stars that actors and actresses often must have talents that we don't see every day from them - but it was still a wonderful surprise.I know that Renee Zellwegger would have wanted a best female actress for her role in Chicago. I would have voted for her if I had been asked.",Chicago

Catherine Zeta Jones sets an early fast pace with ""All that Jazz"" [the best of many good numbers, in my opinion], and the pace never lets up.  I even enjoyed Richard Gere's tap dancing, though Gregory Hines, he ain't.But, this is an awful movie in one important respect:  there is no virtue in this movie universe anywhere.  There is nothing to like about any of these people.  They are immoral, amoral, corrupt, degraded or degrading, disingenuous, dissimulating, depressed, fatalistic, self-centered, or some combination.The music is wonderful, lush, and like the movie's overall ambience, a little decadent.  The dance numbers are intricate, colorful, original, and too quick for the eye to follow in some places.  But, one leaves this move feeling depressed and a little dirty, like ""maybe I'll take a bath when I get home.""That is the consequence of spending two hours in this sordid universe with no redeeming values.

275,highkite,Best Musical. Without a doubt!,9,17 May 2006,"All right, let's talk musicals... We have a melodrama classic Hollywood narrative structure formed into a movie where characters break out into (usually) inspirational songs that override the thoughts or speech they should be expressing.But what makes a musical boring is the lack of creativity in the way it's presented. Very few musicals find a new way to visually stun the audience, and Chicago does this in an almost mind-blowing way.The deep character development is an awfully hard process for a director to capture, but Rob Marshall not only takes us through each character both visually and musically, but intelligently supplies each scene with powerful mise-en-scene and superb editing that lures us into the world of the 20s Chicago media scene.The acting is without a doubt a handful. Each character in the movie creatively sways about the screen in such a realistic form that we automatically assume they were born to play that role. The playful set design speaks volumes, and the bright colors of the lighting and costumes let us feel that we are really watching Roxie's (Zellweger) thoughts.Rob Marshall really delivered. He found a way to have a musical steer away from the classical melodrama tripe, and decided to have all the numbers play out in the main character's head -- which initiated one of the most creative, artistically-stunning movies of all time.To many, Chicago is a masterpiece; and to me it's no different. I saw this movie when it came out in theaters because, well, I was obsessed with Zeta-Jones. I walked out not only impressed, but also influenced. Being an aspiring filmmaker of my own, I'm actually not hesitant to attempt to be a director for a musical some day! The songs are great. Each song pays homage to the original Broadway musical while spicing it up a little to create originality and uniqueness. It didn't hurt to have all the songs catchy, and stuck in your head for a long time! Chicago influenced a generation and I'm glad it won an Oscar for Best Picture, because to be truthful, not as many people would have seen it had it not won that award. I'm glad that many people agree that this movie is fantastic, and numerous watch it over and over.It's the most entertaining movie out there.

There is not one dance or song number which is dull, or one character which is not larger than life.  Queen Latifah and Catherine Zeta-Jones bring attitude to the movie, but it is Renee Zellwenger (sp?), who is the real star of the movie. It is easy to see why the public of 1930s Chicago loves Roxie Hart, she is like your sweet baby sister gone terribly wrong.  Roxie is transformed by her experiences from a naive, albeit promiscuous, former country girl (her parents are probably still rocking on their porch) to a media-suavy city girl.Roxie's adventures through the Chicago legal system begin after she naively expects her lover to help her out professionally.  ""I would have said anything,"" he tells her when she asks him why he lied to her about knowing the manager of the local club.  Roxie is indignant that any man would use her, so she kills him.  Enter Roxie's naive husband, Amos.  His first reaction after discovering the body of a man in Roxie's bedroom is to protect her, but he realizes quickly that he has been cuckoled, so he turns Roxie in, only to later pay for her lavish defense.Roxie is taken from her apartment directly to ""Murderess Row"" to await her trial.  Upon arrival, she sweetly declares to the matron, ""Mama"" that she does not think that she belongs in prison because she ""didn't do anything wrong.""  Roxie than tries to befriend Velma Kelly, whose glamarous job as a singer and dancer at the local club Roxie wants.  ""I was there the night you got arrested,"" she declares with admiration, to which the snobby Velma responds, ""so was half of Chicago.""After securing the services of Chicago's most notorious criminal defense attorney, Billy Flint, who seems to represent only women, Roxie becomes the darling of Chicago.  Roxie sees her upcoming murder trial as a ticket to stardom on the stage, but Flint reminds her that fame in Chicago is short-lived.  Roxie, of course, is naive enough to believe that it will be different for her.I will not say whether Roxie is acquitted or convicted, but you can guess the outcome.  For the audience, there is none of the suspense associated with other movies involving courtroom drama.  This is not ""Grisham, the Musical.""  The trip is more important than the destination.  There is a lot of singing and dancing, and sparkly dresses.Roxie, Velma, and the other inhabitants of ""Murderess Row"" show no remorse for their crimes.  The declarations of the other woman that ""he had it coming"" echoes Roxie's feeling that she did nothing wrong.  For the women of Chicago, it is enough to be glamorous, beautiful, and deadly.  Even as Roxie's trial ends, another woman kills two men on the courtroom steps.That's Chicago.",Chicago

I know many found this tripe entertaining, then again we are the same nation of people who have elected some rather low quality politicians to rule over us, so with that said. My main advice-Avoid this film if your idea of a musical is something like The Sound of Music or Singing in the Rain. See it if you honestly thought Moulin Rouge with Nicole Kidman was entertaining.

283,McHuevo,Probably the best musical I've ever seen,8,7 June 2003,"I despise musicals. To me, most of them are movies in which all of a sudden, and for no particular reason, people just start communicating with songs. I think it is a very difficult job trying to make this kind of stories convincing, for who in their right mind start singing out of nowhere? Animated and Disney-like movies make me more forgiving, but that's where I draw the line with one single exception so far: Chicago.""Chicago"" is two hours of pure entertainment. The whole plot is very well paced, even with all those musical numbers. The tiny difference that made me like this movie so much is that all the songs aren't real. The director does not try to convince you that all those people in jail or the courthouse just happen to like singing; instead, all the musical numbers are treated as Roxie Hart's perception of things. I just loved this way of telling the story. It fits perfectly with Roxie's personality and helps define her character: for her, it's all show business. Also, it made possible for all sequences to be cut from 'reality' to 'musical' freely, without sacrificing any of the credibility of the situation, displaying an outstanding editing work.On top of that you get to see Reneé Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere in roles you never thought they would be so good at. My personal favorite was Reneé; she nailed the role of Roxie Hart, the girl who seeks (and finds) fame at any cost. The movie is hers completely. Catherine shows off her singing and dancing attributes (more of the first than the latter if you ask me) as Velma Kelly, Roxie's idol. Richard Gere performs surprisingly well as Billy Flynn, Hart and Kelly's lawyer. I never would have guessed he could sing, much less tap-dance! Good job Mr. Gere!

284,WilliamSG,Not bad....but not great.,7,11 January 2003,"Tricky to write a review of this one. On the one hand there are some excellent numbers in the first half of the movie. On the other hand the second half dragged a little too long. Also, the second half featured too few memorable songs. However, and rather smartly, the movie ends with a good stage act which concludes the movie on a sweet note.In regards to acting abilities in this movie, I was pleasantly surprised. Catherine Zeta-Jones shows that she can act and sing, and Richard Gere enters into the movie with style which he carries through to the end. Renée Zellweger I felt was was the weakest of the main actors. Although she possesses a Marilyn Monroe quality about her, especially in a few songs, she just came across as rather weak in her acting ability. However, during the best song in the movie which features her as a puppet, she does a great job. That can't have been easy to do!When all's said and done, this movie in my opinion isn't as memorable or original (obviously) as 'Moulin Rouge.' As a movie 'Chicago' had a little too much sexual imagery which was unnecessary. Thankfully there was hardly any in the second half which made for more comfortable viewing. I enjoyed the songs (mainly in the first half) as they've always been great, but I'd have been just as happy listening to the soundtrack.

Of course, through the whole film they proclaim their innocence, albeit we as the audience know the real truth: they in fact DID kill the men they were accused of murdering.  Since this is nothing but a musical comedy, we are willing to use suspension of disbelief and think that it is okay for women to in fact murder those men who hurt them when in fact there is nothing okay about murder in any way, shape or form.  But the audience doesn't care one way or the other, they're simply there to have a great time.Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta Jones give tremendous performances as Roxie and Velma, respectively.  It is interesting to note that before this film, Renee Zellweger had no musical theater experience whatsoever while Catherine Zeta Jones starred as a chorus girl in musical productions in London's West End before she went on to fame and fortune in Hollywood, not to mention becoming Mrs. Michael Douglas. The supporting cast is just as good with the ever-wooden Richard Gere as shyster lawyer Billy Flynn, Queen Latifah as the Matron ""Mama"" Morton, John C. Reilly as Amos Hart, Roxie's dim-witted husband and Christine Baranski as Mary Sunshine, the role that was originally played on Broadway by a man.The overall picture of Chicago is stupendous.  You really need to see this one on a big screen if not for the sheer fun of it all, but then for the musical numbers.  They do take your breath away, especially All That Jazz, the Cell Block Tango and the finale.Something that I really loved about this film was the way it was written. It is done in a differnt style from most musical films.  All the musical numbers are shown as fantasies in the head of Roxie.  The script of the film was expanded from the one of the musical, letting the audience see more into these people's lives.All in all this is a great film done in a style all its own. Chicago takes a lot of risks and succeeds totally.  Well done.My rating: 4 stars",Chicago

I have this feeling that the directors and producers of this new wave of musicals realize that they just can't top -Singin' in the Rain-, and want to try something different for today's audiences.  In the process, they've made it difficult for some of us to see why we had gotten interested in musicals to begin with.  I think it has to do with the fact that these old-time musicals had enough substance behind them to make them great movies, not just flashy set-pieces.  I dunno, this kind of thing may delight plenty of folks, but count me out of subsequent viewings....",Chicago
289,swipht1,A fun movie.,10,19 August 2003,"This was a great time. The songs in this really got my blood flowing. It portrayed well the racy, liquor and jazz filled times of the 1930s Chicago. The action was well done by Renee Zellwegger and I especially enjoyed Queen Latifah's musical number. A storyline that everyone can enjoy and songs that will have you humming for days.",Chicago
290,aleator,Yawn.....,4,1 February 2003,"Despite all the frenetic activity on the screen, this is truly a tedious movie. Kander and Ebb must have used up all their best songs in Cabaret for there is nothing memorable here to compare with 'Money' or 'Maybe this time'. In fact the music tries hard to sound better than it actually is but the songs are simply derivative of their earlier work. The storyline upon which the musical is based is pretty uninteresting and hardly edifying. It is impossible to feel anything for any of the characters so the whole thing adds up to a totally uninvolving experience.",Chicago
291,strangie,All Jazzed Up About Chicago,9,9 February 2003,"Personally I find the return of the musical to the screen is a wonderful thing - and there should be more of it (with kudos going to Mr Lurhmann for ""starting"" the trend).  I'm sure that there'll never be a return to the heyday of the movie musical ... but tastes every now and then is very satisfying.And that's what Chicago is ... immensely satisfying!  Those familiar with the stage musical may well be disappointed with the most recent screen version - there are several songs omitted, characters changed (most notably Mary Sunshine), and there isn't the level of humour injected in the movie as there is in the stage, resulting in a much moodier piece.  But it is worth seeing!!Catherine Zeta Jones, whose pedigree was in song and dance before moving to TV and movies, positively sizzles as Velma Kelly.  Renee Zellwegger brings a cutesy naivety to Roxie Hart, but her songs I felt needed a little more ""guts"" behind them.  The real stand out for me, however, was Richard Gere. This is the first film in AGES I've seen him in that I was absolutely astounded with - his Billy Flynn had the delightful sleaze/schmooze factor turned up full boar - and it was wonderful!  The supporting cast shouldn't be forgotten - Queen Latifah's Matron ""Mama"" Morton was uproariously wicked, John Reilly's Amos was tenderly bitter sweet, and Taye Diggs as the Bandleader/Narrator was wonderful.Don't miss this film - you'll be sorry if you do!",Chicago
292,ProperCharlie,I've got it coming...,7,19 January 2003,"If you like big stage musicals with big production numbers, lavish sets and scantily clad women then this is right up your street.  It is really impressive production with some excellent performances.Roxie dreams of the stage, Velma Kelly is on the stage until they both wind up imprisoned for murders under the custodial charms of Mama Morton.  The only person who can stop them hanging is unscrupulous lawyer Billy Flynn, master manipulator of Chicago's press.  What happens when the limelight finds another caged bird to shine on though?All of the leads give wonderful performances.  I was impressed by Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and John C. Reilly, but I was most impressed by Richard Gere.  I thought (and still do) that this was a piece of miscasting.  I could almost feel creeking during some of the numbers, but give him credit, he sang and danced with the best of them and really gave the role his all.Chicago does suffer from the straight-jacket of its structure.  Chicago appears to be an almost straight conversion of the stage musical to the big screen.  Yes, I know there are songs and plot lines missing, what I mean is that it is structured in a very Act 1 Scene 1 followed by Scene 2 and so on. There is no sense of what you can do with film and instead we are presented with what could have been footage filmed at a performance of the stage show. I almost wanted the curtain to fall between acts.  It's really a resurrection of the big musicals of the past.  This is not a Moulin Rouge or a Sound of Music, which are more film-aware musicals.  They have threads of narrative we can follow when the scenery changes.  This is more reminiscent of Fred and Ginger films.  You know, those ones where the plot is really an excuse for some great singing and dancing.  Maybe you can even compare it to pantomime...In the end, despite the excellent production and performances, Chicago feels too rigid and brittle.  It's liable to snap under it's own impressive weight.  It doesn't really escape from the page.  The weight of expectations of those who've seen the show seem to have weighed heavily on the director, in a similar way to the Harry Potter films.  A good musical, but not a great one.",Chicago
293,tashlast,The best instance of where the Movie adaption is better than the staged show,10,27 April 2020,"This has gotta be the most brilliant, most inspired, most interesting, and most entertaining movie musical I have seen since The Sound of Music, which is a classic! I kid you not, every aspect about this movie is just pure genius! And there's a lot of people who made it amazing.First, the Cast. And Renee Zellweger, Cathrine Zeta-Jones, Queen Latifah, and Richard Gere performances were AMAZING! Just, whoever casted them were all right on the money! I never got bored of their characters once throughout the entire movie. And for me, it really easy to get bored of characters in movies really quickly. But I never could. They kept rhe energy up the entire time. And it's only fitting that they all got Oscar nominations.The music and dance? Holy hell. Holy freaking hell. The music, the direction, the CHOREOGRAPHY were all just freaking brilliant! And I gotta say, if you got bored during any of those musical numbers, I don't know what to tell you. I guess nothing can entertain you then. Because that was the most fun two punch trip that you'll get.I notice so many complaints about the plot and how about it's law enforcement corruption. And all of yiu guys need to get off your high horses. This movie is fiction and yeah, it might be a little jab at the hypocrisy of real life events, but it was made to be entertaining satire. Which was what it is. Nothing short of genius. The direction deserved every bit of praise. The plot was smartly, dramatic, and comedically handled. It's everything I could want in a movie.Hands down best Movie Musical since The Sound of Music, and if any future movie musicals are gonna win Best Picture, they're gonna have to be better than this. Because I hate to break it to you La La Land fans, but it was nowhere near good enough to take the Movie Musical Best Picture mantle away from Chicago. Chicago has set the bar too ridiculously high for any of its musical successors. Not even it's staged production can beat it. Which is a first. Where the Movie adaption beats the original.Final score- 12/10",Chicago
294,rockproductions,All that Razzle Dazzle & Chicago is Still Hollow,6,14 December 2003,"Chicago""- This Oscar winning (Best Picture, on & on) Musical, Black Comedy, is about the baser side of the human condition, mostly the female condition. It's also about how the media gets manipulated & in return manipulates the public, & how far people will go to get their hearts desire.A married woman shoots her lover after she finds out his promise of getting her into showbiz was just a ploy to get her in bed. Another woman shoots her sister & husband, after finding them in bed. They both go to jail & meet a lawyer who promises them freedom & possible glory. That is what this film is about ...period.""Chicago,"" like the words of the song in it, is filled with razzle dazzle & hocus pocus, but is as hollow as it's unlikable characters. Most successful Black Comedies at least parody their characters & in the end they get their just deserts. No so in this movie, it seems to glorify everything that is despicable about it's characters, with no moral implications for their behavior. Maybe this is the real world, but I don't have to watch it in a movie.It has been said that ""Chicago,"" is one of the lesser films to receive an Oscar, for best picture. I couldn't whole-heartedly agree more. Though not a technically bad film, it's cinematography & choreography are truly astounding, but everything else about this film cries mediocrity. I really can't understand how a film like this could have got awarded the Oscar over a masterpiece like, ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,"" other than the Academy has a long standing prejudice against Fantasy, Horror, Science Fiction genres. Maybe we'll get vindication with the third ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,"" but I wouldn't hold my popcorn. Surely we won't, if we get a ""Chicago II,"" god forbid the idea. I really can't tell people not to see this film, if only to see how bloated it really is, but then again there are those who will really enjoy it. I for one will wait for the real razzle dazzle & hocus pocus of, ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.""(warm)",Chicago
295,Dave-430,Not entirely as annoying as I had expected,4,8 September 2003,"I recognize the fact that this is a very well-crafted movie. Great choreography and set design, however, leave me fairly cold when there isn't much else to rejoice about. Richard Gere is, well, Richard Gere; his acting ability is still limited to two facial expressions: the smug smile and the intrigued look with an air of superiority. Moreover, I wasn't all that impressed with his singing voice. I must say that I was expecting something more annoying, and John C. Reilly does go along way toward making the movie watchable. Still, at the end of the day it is a musical - and musicals are inherently stupid.",Chicago
296,Jenny Ho,You're better off watching the musical at the theatre,6,15 February 2003,"This is, as you are probably already aware, the hit stage musical transferred to the big screen.  The scene is set in 1920s Chicago: Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta Jones), a top showgirl, is sent to prison for murder; Roxie Hart (Rene Zellweger) is a housewife who cheats on her husband with a man who has promised her the glitzy lifestyle she has always dreamed about. When these promises turn out to be empty, Roxie shoots him dead and is given a death sentence.  While both women await trial in prison, they vie for the help of lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) to get them off the hook.The film is packed with great tunes which are sung impressively by the three leads, especially Catherine Zeta Jones who gives a confident and mesmerising performance.  However, John C Reilly as Roxie's husband is a little bit of a letdown after witnessing a heart breaking performance of the same role in the stage version.  While she dreams of becoming a star, Roxie chooses to take refuge in a fantasy world in which everyone she meets take to the stage to sing a musical number.  The result of tagging one musical number after another in this way makes for an uninventive style which left me feeling that I'm better off just going to watch the musical at the theatre.  There are even scenes that are choreographed in virtually the same way as the stage show is.  What would have been more interesting is a merger between Roxie's fantasy and reality worlds as I found that the frequent intercutting of the dialogue scenes with the show tunes only served to overshadow the narrative.
I really do not think that Chicago' is worthy of a Best Film Oscar this year as there are other films I've seen this year which are more deserving of this accolade.",Chicago
297,Jatoy,Oscars went to a right movie!,9,4 May 2003,"Despite the dark and cold surroundings and the sad beginning of this musical, it was very entertaining and made me laugh and wait what will these two women Kelly and Roxie get in their heads next.

298,VAndolini,User review hypocrisy at a zenith here,10,10 February 2019,"Some of the user reviews here just made me laugh hysterically. They rail about how ""amoral"" Roxie and Velma are, when scores and scores of films are admired, I suppose one could say, because of the immoral acts shown. Examples"" ""Goodfellas"" (which I love, by the way) or ""Wolf of Wall Street"" (whichI hated) both show murder, depravity, drug use, law breaking, hooker using, midget bowling, etc., Etc. So I guess films where guys do all sorts of heinous acts is fine, but God forbid women in film should show even half of the immoral acts. This is a FANTASY, a make believe musical, not intended to be taken literally. A musical. Period. An excellent film, great performances, especially Zeta Jones and the Queen. Very enjoyable. So the teenage boys here who want to beat their chests in unison to the awful Wolf can take a breather and grow up.",Chicago
299,boomerchinde,Solid entertainment worth multiple viewings,8,10 July 2007,"Many people panned this film, deriding it for having won too many undeserved awards. I disagree. It was entertaining from beginning to end, with fabulous dance sequences (although the viewer must admit that all the cuts and editing made them look much better than they deserved). There were some anachronisms, but they could be overlooked. A high energy film with original songs a bit too close to period songs to suit me, bordering, I thought, on near plagiarism. My only complaint is, oddly enough, the dance sequences I loved so much. While they were sexy beyond belief, and wonderfully choreographed, I couldn't get past that editing which made them seem fuller and more professional than they really were. When Astaire and O'Connor and Kelly danced, their sequences were fluid and mostly without camera cuts, which meant they were true professionals. With enough cutting and editing, Trigger could look like Fred on the dance floor. Still, a great period piece, with an earthiness the gangster films of the '30s weren't allowed to present. Zellweger is simply fabulous in every nuance, and shows why she is arguably the best in the business. Costuming and set design are great, and this film is directed with an eye to offering pure entertainment without a moment of boredom. Those who deride this film are usually those who want to compare it to the Hollywood musicals of the 40's and 50's, and are offended by its sexual tension. Too bad for them, because this film works well.",Chicago
300,wildstrawbe,pointless and undeserving of the Oscar it won,1,1 October 2003,"I really can't understand what all the fuzz about Chicago is about.  I thought the movie was pointless and I really can't understand why it won an Oscar.  There is nothing in this movie that can change one's life, that can teach us something.  It doesn't even tell us a story that needed to be told (like the Gangs of New York did even if the movie was over-rated and the incredible Pianist who should have won the Oscar last year).  The best film that came out last year IMO was ""Roger Dodger"" and while I know that a movie like that would never win an Oscar I still can't understand why Chicago would win over the Pianist.I wasn't very impressed by the performances either.  I don't know maybe I missed something but I really don't understand what the purpose of making a movie such as this one is (other than making money of course and winning Miramax a few more undeserved Oscars).",Chicago
301,dbracco86,The most entertaining movie I've seen in a long time...,10,12 January 2003,"Before Chicago even came out, the Chicago vs. Moulin Rouge question filled the air.Moulin Rouge is pretty much my favorite movie and I've seen it countless times, so it was pretty hard (in my mind) to beat.  Like almost everyone else, I was anxious to compare.Much to my surprise, the two are almost impossible to compare.  Other than the fact they are both musicals and the vocals and dancing are amazing, they share nothing in common.  Moulin Rouge is a love story, and Chicago is a...different story.I gave Moulin Rouge a 10/10, which hardly seemed fitting for a movie of that caliber.  I also gave Chicago a 10/10. Chicago, in my opinion, was more entertaining than Moulin Rouge.  The only comparable parts are the beginning of Moulin Rouge with all of Chicago.  I personally feel Chicago is better at this comparison. However, if I had to choose a movie, it would be Moulin Rouge.  The love and sad songs of that movie overpower any fantastic dance number in Chicago.Anyway, back to the movie.  WOW!  I had a smile on my face the whole time. Although I think Richard Gere has a great voice, I don't care for the sound of it.  Catherine's and Renee's voices are unbelievable, and they both act their roles incredibly well.  The ""cell block tango"" and Queen Latifa's number were my favorites of the whole movie.  I would say this is the best movie of the year that I have seen (which, has yet to include: The Hours, About Schmitt, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, The Pianist, Far From Heaven, Gangs of New York, and the new Lord of the Rings...I'm WAY behind!)DEFINITELY see this movie...you won't regret it!",Chicago

303,pedrosmgfan,Wonderful musical,10,13 June 2006,"This it is sincerely the best musical I've ever seen.It is actually my favorite musical movie. It tells the history of Roxie Hart, an ingenuous and charming young woman who kills her lover and is taken to prison, where she knows in person the woman she admires: Velma Kelly, an ordinary and unfriendly singer of a night club. Roxie will try to become a star as then Velma at any cost, and she contracts the best lawyer in Chicago: Billy Flyn.The songs of the film are really wonderful, and the assembly, the clothes and all the others things are brilliant. The performances of the actors are really good. Richard Gere does one of his better roles, Renée Zellweger is charming and Catherine Zeta-Jones is the best one of all. She moves and sings in a spectacular way. The script of the film is also very good. The director, Rob Marshall, has done his best work.

304,Bilko-3,The Best,10,30 December 2002,"My wife & I saw ""Chicago"" last night.  I was worried about how they might screw it up.  I've seen the show several times (including on Broadway), and have played Amos twice.  It's my favorite musical, right after ""Assassins."" I was extremely ready for disappointment.  As a matter of fact, let's get the complaints out of the way:1. (not serious) In every other incarnation of this material, Roxie is a redhead, not a blonde.2. (not serious) They made Roxie more ""sympathetic"", though not as much as the Ginger Rogers version, where she turned out to be innocent.3. (serious) For its limited release, Miramax booked this into a theater in Oak Brook, Illinois that is an armpit with floodlights.  Don't they care that the people from whom they are soliciting Word-of-Mouth publicity are seeing their musical in MONO?  And it was the only theatre showing the film within 30 miles of us.  We HAD to see it there.That's it; three complaints.  Otherwise, I have to report that (in my opinion) ""Chicago"" is the best film version of a Broadway musical EVER.They've solved the problem of how to make an extremely vaudevillian script work on film, they've kept 80% of the songs and they didn't ""reinvent"" it. One of my best friends and I get into arguments about reinvention, which he is in favor of.  For me, reinventing means that the director makes the material serve him instead of having him serve the material.  It basically says, ""I'm so much more clever than the people who created this; I need to Help Them Out a Little.""  You know the type of thing: ""We're doing 'Oklahoma!' and setting it in Taiwan, because it's never been done that way and it'll say SO much about the universal appeal of the material!""  I hate reinvention.What Rob Marshall (director) and Bill Condon (writer) do with ""Chicago"" is not reinvention.  They interpret the material for the new medium... brilliantly.Renee Zellwegger is fabulous as Roxie.  Catherine Zeta Jones is perfect as Velma.  Richard Gere is really good as Billy Flynn, which is not something I usually say about him.  Queen Latifah is just right as Mama and John C. Reilly REQUIRES an Academy Award as Amos.  After he finished ""Mr. Cellophane,"" I heard several women in the audience let out a massively pitying ""OOOhhhhh!""  The musical numbers are filmed brilliantly and in a way that makes sense with the plot.  And there's a cameo by Chita Rivera, the original Velma on Broadway.For those who know the earlier versions, there are visual gags kept from the 1942 Ginger Rogers film ""Roxie Hart,"" as well as lines of dialogue reinstated from the original 1926 Maurine Dallas Watkins play.If you like musicals, SEE THIS.  Speaking of which: I'm very puzzled by the number of reviewers here who say, ""Well, it's just a MUSICAL; I HATE musicals.""  Why exactly did they go see it in the first place?  I love musicals and this is one of the best I've seen.",Chicago
305,TheMovieeGuy,"I know this will win for best picture, but I consider it the most OVERRATED film of 2002!",1,12 March 2003,"Okay, I'll admit it, I HATE musicals, (even though I somewhat tolerated Moulin Rouge!) Chicago, to me at least was a huge waste of time, the costumes were terrific to look at and I liked Queen Latifah, but, Renee Zellweger ALWAYS gets on my nerves and she really irritated me as Roxie Hart, a woman who dreams of becoming famous only to end up in prison where she mingles with other people who plot to murder people to become famous.
The script, is very uneven, and whenever someone stopped to sing a stage number I was tempted to hide my face under my seat! Only Catherine Zeta Jones was able to completely capture my attention with her fantastic musical numbers, and yes moviegoers, even Richard Gere, a lawyer representing Roxie Hart gets in on the act in the end with his own tapdancing musical number.To be fair, the sets were terrific to look at and a couple of numbers were not bad at all, but as I stated earlier I simply can't stand musicals, and Chicago hasn't changed my mind, in fact I would rather watch Moulin Rouge a thousands times repeatedly, than to watch Chicago again in theaters.I did not like the musical number at the end with Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta Jones, especially after they so dispised each other throughout the film, not to mention I just didn't buy the ending at all!All in all, thanks to the HUGE and DISGUSTING marketing tactics to academy voters (They bought the votes for Shakespere in Love to win best picture over the TRUE best picture candidate Saving Private Ryan in 1998!) by Miramax and Harvery Weinstein, you can be sure that Chicago will win best picture, even though I feel that Gangs of New York (Another Miramax release) and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (To which Harvery Weinstein is an executive producer) are far more worthy of winning the award for best picture of 2002!All in all, Chicago is not a terrible film, and in fact it most likely works much better as a stage musical but it's also NOT the grand film experience that everyone outside of Miramax's marketing department are claiming it to be!An average 3 on a scale of 1-10!

306,FilmWiz,Worthy of Best Picture? Absolutely But far from the best picture ever.,8,13 June 2003,"Chicago was a wonderful film based on the Broadway show of the same name. The show has been in existence now for over 25 years, yet the story itself was originally a play in the 1920's. In fact there has been two movie versions previously. `Chicago' (1927) and `Roxie Hart' (1942).	 The Razzle Dazzle plot is wonderful. In Jazz Age Chicago, two jailed murderesses - nightclub singer Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and the ambitious, wide-eyed Roxie Hart (Renée Zellweger)- compete with each other for newspaper headlines and the attention of their debonair attorney, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere).The songs are wonderful. Who doesn't know `All That Jazz'? All I have to say is that I was pleasantly surprised at the wonderful choreography (`Cell Block Tango' comes to mind). The moves are both beautiful and sexual, and they are not anything near what teenagers go for today (thank God!). (It was set in the 1920's you know.) Richard Gere singing!! That's a treat. He does rather well, especially in the `All I Care About Is Love' scene. The film is a must see. It is a sin if you don't see it.At the Oscars. Best Picture nominees were: CHICAGO, GANGS OF NEW YORK, THE HOURS, THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS, and THE PIANIST Well, (I know I'm going to get a lot of hate mail, but) cross off Lord of the Rings, and The Hours. And we are left with Gangs, Pianist and Chicago. Of the nominations, it was a no-brainer. Chicago would definitely take it home.Now that I have that cleared out of the way, I want the compliment Queen Latifah on her wonderful performance as Mama, and also to John C. Reilly for his wonderful performance as Amos, and for doing a wonderful job with my favorite song- Mr. Cellophane (though I liked the incomparable Joel Gray on the new Broadway album) Congratulations to the entire cast and crew on this wonderful film!",Chicago
307,POG-2,good but not stunning,8,14 March 2003,"I saw the musical Chicago in London and bought the CD immediately as I was so impressed. Maybe the film didn't have such a strong effect on me because of that. It's well made but it just didn't convince me the way the musical did. The musical is a hard-hitting satire but the film sometimes loses its satirical edge and I think all the flashy tricks in the film are somehow distracting. I was most impressed by Zeta-Jones. Although I like Zellweger, I don't think she could quite cope with the job. In general, I fell you an notice that the actors can sing well, but they're not singers, which again is a big difference to the stage production.

308,geoaar,It is a musical after all,5,26 August 2003,"I enjoyed the movie, but...I should preface my comments by saying that the ""musical"" is my least favorite of movie genres. But, having said that, I do agree with the criticism that this one was pushed well into ""overrated"" territory.The story was shallow and only marginally important to the film. This is a musical, and the plot was simply a vehicle to bring us to the musical numbers. And the musical numbers were, well, mediocre.
While I'm sure the cast gave it their all, the music they were selling just wasn't worth the effort. Most all the songs were forgettable, lack-luster tunes that seemed strangely unfinished to me. It was sort of like listening to the first draft of something before it was fully-formed.The ""puppet"" scene I got a kick out of, and it was fun seeing Richard Gere tapdance - not because he was over-the-top wonderful though - only because he could. Fred Astaire he ain't.So, yeah, it was entertaining, but surely not ""film of the year"" stuff it's being pushed as...",Chicago
309,davidkennedy-91087,Who Says That Murder's Not An Art?,9,27 October 2020,"How far would you go for fame? Would you kill for it? Roxie Hart would. Not that she originally intended to, but when her lover, Fred, told her that he wouldn't be putting in a word for her with his entertainment industry friends and Roxie would be stuck in a lousy apartment with her sweet, but nobody mechanic husband, Amos, she snapped and shot him.After telling the police that he was an intruder, Amos blows her cover when he remembers that they both know him from selling them some furniture. This sends Roxie straight to prison where she meets a variety of ""merry murderesses"" who each tell her why they did what they did. Most interesting of them all is Velma Kelly, a genuine entertainer like Roxie wants to be, who shot her husband and sister in a jealous rage after she caught them in bed together.With the threat of the death penalty looming, Roxie secures the services of Billy Flynn, a cutthroat attorney with a solid reputation of defending scum, and they work on rehabbing her reputation and lie to the press, making her into the celebrity Roxie always dreamed of being.Chicago is flashy and exciting with maybe too many quick cuts that distract from the excellent dancing and staging of the musical numbers which have all be re-designed to take place in Roxie's fame-hungry head. Performances are all excellent around the board with Catherine Zeta-Jones threatening to walk away with the movie every time she shows up as the vampy Velma.There are truly no likable characters in the world of Chicago and, if that bothers you, perhaps you should find another source of entertainment.",Chicago

So with much fanfare and ado ""Chicago"" is served up, garnished with garish hyperbole.""Chicago's"" story is a back-drop to the song and dance scenes, which is by design because of the nature of musicals. Though ""Chicago"" is a stylish and polished piece it just does not take off for me. And there's an undeniable traditional Broadway style lurking beneath the entire contrived production, that reminded me why musicals had fallen out of favor, at least with me.Richard Gere just did not seem natural in the song and dance numbers with his forced rictus like smile. I chuckled to myself and not in the way that the makers had intended when Gere made his appearance. Though I have to give him a nod for enthusiasm.Zeta-Jones, though phenomenally agile and graceful, looked a little clunky when standing next to the svelte Zellwegger. Both displayed exceptional talent and displayed classic curves and costumes.My favorite performance was that of the underrated John C. Reilly. His character was both sad and funny, and his song about being invisible was spot on.But in the final analysis, I found that I was not moved, charmed, nor inspired-by Chicago-the way I had been when I saw ""Moulin Rouge"".

It's hovered around 7 out of 10 for years. It really boggles my mind. It was well written, beautifully directed, and is filled with intriguing characters, save one.I literally gave it an 8 because of Richard Gere's performance. If not for him, it would have received a 9 from me. I recall when Chicago came out, a big deal was made of how Richard Geer took the role on short notice, and how, under the stress of that and the learning curve, he did an acceptable job. I remember watching it and thinking ""no, he didn't."" He nearly ruined it for me, stinking up the screen with his horrible singing and dancing. Some movies are remembered for incredible performances, but after Catherine Zeta-Jones's performance the thing that stays in my mind the most is Gere. Not in a good way.So now, I watch La La Land and various people have panned Ryan Gosling for his singing and dancing. If only they would compare it to Richard Gere's performance they would realize Gosling wasn't so bad. I very much like Chicago, and I skip the Gere parts. He's a likable enough guy, but I can't bring myself to listen to him sing that terrible song ever again. Chicago has its flaws, but a 7.1? And La La Land has a 9? Something is definitely wrong here. Don't get me wrong, I really like La La Land very much, but even though it's not worse, it certainly isn't better than Chicago, in my opinion.",Chicago
313,asticht,Brilliant and well done,10,17 February 2003,"I have been reading some of the comments that some viewers have written about Chicago and I really am wondering if they saw the same movie I have seen.  I have never seen the play itself which the movie is based on nor have I seen the broadway musical.  HOWEVER, I felt that Chicago was very well written and was very artistically portrayed on the screen.  I read a review that both of the female leads were replaceable and could have been done by any number of different actresses.  I disagree entirely, I felt the casting was very well done and deserves credit.  When the movie began I had some worries that maybe the positive reviews I had seen written were wrong.  The movie starts out kind of slow and takes a good 15 to 20 minutes before it starts rolling, but from then on the movie picks up steam and continues to crescendo to the end.  The musical numbers and choreography were well conceived and portrayed the mood of the moment well.  Almost all of the main musical numbers were done in an almost dreamlike sequence where the storyline departed from reality into a kind of fantasy world for the characters.  The movie develops a rhythm and flow of its own that builds sympathy and revulsion for the various characters in the story.  I do not think that there was a single character that I didn't have mixed emotions about.  Even the main characters had both good and bad qualities that left the audience trying to decide who was likeable and who was dislikeable.  I think that this was the intent of not only the filmmakers, but also I would believe that this duplicity was written into the original play.I found myself staying in the theater during the credits just so that I could see if the actors themselves sang their own parts.  Renee Zellweger demonstrated another facet in her repertoire which is not only complimentary but surprising.  Catherine Zeta Jones was brilliant and has a beautiful singing voice.  And lets not forget Richard Gere... Richard Gere is not someone whom I would consider being a song and dance man, however his performance was nothing if not inspired.  Queen Latifah has only one musical number of her own and it was very well done, however if there was only one detractor to the movie is that she only had the one musical number, I would have liked to see more of her.All in all I wanted to dispell the few negative comments I have read about this movie and ask those people who felt that this movie was lacking that they seek treatment or at least a new pair of glasses because they definitely missed the boat when seeing this film and it is a shame.  This movie garners much deserved praise and should perform well at Oscar time as much as I would like to see the Two Towers win best picture, I believe Chicago has the potential to give it a run for the money.",Chicago
314,Freedomisanillusion,Brilliant,9,14 February 2003,"*Possible Spoilers*I have always been a fan of musicals, such as Singin' In The Rain, My Fair Lady, Sound of Music etc. etc., but sadly this genre hasn't been picked up in modern movies. I was so glad to see that they were being revived again with Moulin Rouge (which, just for the record isn't anywhere near worth all the hype that it gets), and due to that, we get a remake of Chicago. What with it's great songs, fantastic performances and strong acting, this movie could still have been a movie without the musical numbers (nowhere near as good of course, but still could have pulled it off) because the songs enhance the storyline, but don't add anything to it. Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is one half of a stage performance in a jazz club in 1920's Chicago, the other half being her sister, who she has shot after finding her sleeping with her (Velma's) husband. Roxie Hart (Renee Zelwegger) is a young hopeful, dreaming if a life on the stage, who shoots her lover after she finds out he has double-crossed her. Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) is a greedy, mildly arrogant lawyer who is representing both Velma and Roxie, and thus causing Velma and Roxie to become arch-rivals. Also starring Queen Latifah as the sassy Mamma Morton, matron of the prison, and John C. Reilly as the neglected Aimus Hart, Roxie's husband, this movie overflows with style and grace and delivers an all around enjoyable movie. 10/10",Chicago
315,quincy-white,Still don't like musicals,3,15 September 2003,"I don't like musicals as a general rule, so I admit I am not being fair.  I only saw this because Catherine Zeta-Jones has never looked better than in the 1920's style.  I would not call her performance Oscar-worthy, but she does light up the screen.  The revelation in the end of what Richard Gere's plan was all along was also something I found interesting.Take away Renee Zellweger and the musical numbers, and this might have been an interesting movie.  Zellweger gives a waxwork performance.  She did not even look convincing as a dummy.  The musical numbers are all tiresome and drawn out, especially the one at the end, which shows just how bad the chemistry between the lead actresses is.  At least Moulin Rouge, a movie I both hated and loved, the music was quick and dramatic. 
Finally, there was one major thing missing from Chicago, namely the city of Chicago.  Where as Road to Perdition had glorious scenes in Chicago, the movie Chicago did nothing to showcase its namesake.  It all looked like it took place on the same drab city street.  It should have been called Street in Chicago.",Chicago
316,Flamio,Cleveland,1,24 May 2005,"You might as well make an awful musical about Cleveland, it would stink just as bad! I try to be fair and objective, but to be honest, this film flat out sucked! I'm not gonna go into detail, but the top two characters are lousy. Renee never could act. She always has a depressed face all the time, is as white as an albino, and always acts the SAME WAY Every time. My gosh, watch her in Nurse Betty or anything else, she's awful! Zeta looks like a pig in this flick and hopefully found out that short hair makes her look like a dike. Both of them overact. Basically, you can tell they're acting and force themselves to look away from the camera. Nether one is a good dancer. OK, they did their best, but paying customers should see great dancers who do this for a living. Zeta wouldn't be anywhere unless she married her grandpa husband Mr. Douglas. This is the only way she was getting into Hollywood. Zellwigger looks like she's always about to have a nervous breakdown. Man, what a train wreck! Gere is Gere. Boring, boring, boring. Rob 'pit face' Marshall probably couldn't wait to make this gay musical. Hollywood loves the immorality, songs, and more songs. At least they let 'I'm not a Queen' Latifa go on stage fat and showed that you don't have to be a Zellwiger bone to be a woman. Zeta, she wasn't as fat, but man was she mean and dikey. Yuck. Six awards, yecch! Zell, get some sleep and take a few hits of Siberian Genseng! Don't even waste your time renting this flick, or getting it for free at the library. Flamio, and I'm glad I'm out.",Chicago
317,chengyiting,Classic works,8,22 April 2020,"An unprecedented tension in song and dance! From action, from song, from camera lens, from editing. An ordinary story of Ragtime, a showbiz of human farce. The stage setting of ""Dance Hall"" is similar, but the song and dance design and some dance elements and objects are exquisite! Prison dance, puppet show and that sparkling monologue are all amazing works. A kind of ups and downs of madness and loneliness are also revealed! God made.",Chicago
318,ericventura,A Film of Masterful Parallelism,9,27 June 2017,"Not surprisingly, this film is adapted from a play. To put it simply, the film feels as if they took the play, filmed it with a nice camera, and put it on the screen. But they did it nicely and made a great film full of fantastic acting, emotion-packed scenes, and vivid visuals.A story of an aspiring showgirl in Chicago, it transcends the shallow emotions of the primary characters, instead painting a rich and deep portrait of tough human emotion with a hint of satire. When caught too deep in the tragedy of the story, Marshall plucks the characters out of the depths and inserts a bit of humor and satire, keeping true to both the subject matter and form of film.To imbue emotion into a musical of this scale is a tremendous and monumental task. But the cast do it. Zellweger, as the main character, portrays a perfect naivety and shallowness, showing off her skills as an experienced and talented actress. Zeta-Jones is a wonderful supporting actress who illuminates the wonderfully paralleled stories and emotions of the two main showgirls. Gere is outrageously funny. Whether by purpose or on accident, he feels out of place and awkward in a musical, adding humor, but still turns in a fine performance. John C. Reilly in his sparse amount of scenes is absolutely splendid. In what must be the best performance of his career, Reilly embodies the character and makes the viewer earnestly pity and understand him. His solo is spectacular.Every song fit. The songs were set up to both parallel the plot and illustrate the plot at the same time. The set-up is not only artistic, but serves a thematic purpose for the film. However, many a times utilizing song as the main instrument in a film detracts from the rest of it. In this case, the music acts to bolster the emotion of the film, effectively conveying the powerful feelings of the character through carefully constructed music, perfectly exuberant acting, and aptly shiny visuals. The incorporation of these songs into the dialogue makes for a brilliantly crafted screenplay. A film of masterful parallelism on all levels and stimulating plot, Chicago is a story of highs and lows, dramatized to the fullest potential.",Chicago
319,morningkeith,"good show, bravo bravo!",10,18 January 2003,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's one of those few films that I could recommend to anybody, regardless of tastes. Renee Zellweger's skill as a comedienne reminds me of Carol Burnett and Lucille Ball.  Contrasting with her innocence, Catherine Zeta-Jones reaches out and grabs your collar.  She's totally believable as an old black magic kind of babe. Richard Gere probably surprised even himself by having so much fun. Yet when he turns and says, ""That's Chicago,"" you see there's still some real world grit in him. And guess what Canadians, Pierre Trudeau plays the assistant district attorney! (Nice to see Colm Feore on the screen again.)My real hats off goes to the director, the choreographers, and especially to all the lighting, cameramen and sound technicians that made this happen. ""Entertainment Weekly"" says they went from start to finish in two months. Absolutely amazing. You people behind the scenes, step up and take a bow. You made this movie wonderful.",Chicago

It's only good and well regarded because it's a musical with hot actresses and actors singing. The storyline itself has no intrigue, interest, etc. Richard Gere has done better work in other movies, including one where he played the cynical lawyer, not the sleazy one. Renee Zellwinger who's character is guilty as hell portrayed her well on script. No interwine though. Catherine Zeta Jones looked hot, but not much to her character either.",Chicago

After some time she hires the best lawyer of Chicago at that time, (Richard Gere) and soon she becomes famous, she's in the front page of the newspapers everyday, and she totally overshadowes the character played by Catherine Zeta Jones. Not gonna ruin it for you anymore but Chicago is one of the best movies made since the new millenium, with a great choreography, brillian direction by Rob Marshall and wonderful performance from Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta Jones (she deserved her best supporting actress Oscar) and let's not forget to mention the great score and cinematography.

The story is loosely based on real incidents, and could easily be turned into a great, ironic film noir mood piece. The storyline here (such as it is) gets lost among all the spectacular music sequences. This film gets a '4' rating for the music spots alone--some of them are great, especially the finale in which Renee Zellweger proves she can dance every bit as well as Zeta-Jones. Zeta-Jones got an Oscar, too--for what-singing and dancing well? I thought the academy awarded performers for acting, not hoofing.The music is fine, but every song spot is treated as if it were THE ultimate set piece for the whole show.

After the success of ""Moulin Rouge"", Hollywood has given us another musical that lives up to its hype.  Beautifully filmed, well-acted, and smartly directed.  Catherine Zeta-Jones sizzles as Velma from the very beginning, singing ""All That Jazz"".  Renee Zellweger is perfectly cast as Roxie, and holds her own in the singing and dancing department.  As an actress, she has truly come into her own with this role.  Gere is a surprise!  His Al Jolson-esque singing voice and cocky swagger brings the role of lawyer Billy Flynn to life.  Queen Latifah is a scene-stealer as Matron ""Mama"" Morton.  Her solo early in the film is worth the price of admission.  John C. Reilly is fast becoming one of the better character actors in Hollywood.  His performance of ""Mister Cellophane"" is great.  Christine Baranski is also good in a supporting role as Mary Sunshine.  Overall, I would recommend this film to musical lovers and cinema lovers.  A rare treat!  Overall: 10 out of 10! A+",Chicago

I also thought Queen Latifah was perfect for the part of Mama Morton and did a good job at it, too. Catherine Zeta-Jones wholeheartedly deserved the Oscar she got for this performance.

The first delight was how well Catherine Zeta Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, and John C Reilly did with these roles-- acting, Singing!!, and Dancing!!! I was surprised, and amazed! In addition, the cheeky satire about America's obsession with the cult of celebrity and the three-ring circus that the media and opportunistic lawyers make of our justice system is razor-sharp and very timely. (It's a little like watching ""O.J.: The Musical""!)The creative and brilliant direction by Rob Marshall is entertaining and wonderful.

I have found this is not a movie that can be enjoyed through a casual watch, because everybody I know who has done this did not understand the plot, nor did they understand how the film splices the reality of the situation with the incredible dance numbers.The themes of this movie are no different today than they were in 1920s Chicago where the story takes place. Reality is often not as important as what the majority of people believe reality to be. With a pretty face, some expert media manipulation, and the right lawyer, a person can get away with murder.The jazzy songs are well-written and well-performed by actors I never realized had musical talent. The dance numbers are incredible. The movie is both hysterical, and sad. So laugh at the lawyer and the murderesses as they put on their puppet show for the public; cry with the innocent as they are jilted and executed; and have a great time in the process.",Chicago
333,LeslieLLKing,Chicago - edgy and smug,1,25 October 2006,"· The film  Chicago · Time  jazz age, roaring 1920's · Place  of course, Chicago · Scandal  Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger), married to Amos (John C. Reilly) childless, noted singer and dancer, in anger shoots her lover, Fred Casely (Dominic West) repeatedly in the chest, after their love making and his physically abusing her, very roughly pushing her to the hard wood floors of her bedroom. Richard Gere, as Billy Flynn, plays Hart's defense lawyer, often times his undeniably smoothing talking manners weigh more than his periodic snide remarks, which seem to wash out. One just shrugs his shoulders. He's a defense lawyer not a charm school instructor. His goal is not to be the leader of reform for women, culture, or society, rather more simply to make the most of circumstances as they play out around him. Mama Morten (Queen Latifah) isn't supposed to charm us with her song and dance. On stage she presents herself as the dominating tool that men need her in order to be loved by ""mama."" Don't all men want to be made love to by a mama? Actually, according to Comedy Central, not necessarily. There are varying viewpoints on this issue. In this case, 'bigger is better' is the rule, not the exception. How shameful or just childishly devilish of her? Off stage, in contrast, she is dressed in potato sack grey, as guard to the female prisoners, rather empathetic to their passions gone awry. · Film's Outcome - watch and see this surreal blend of life and stage style song and dance production of the main character, one woman, Roxie Hart's predicament, whose infamy is quite clearly considered before, during, and after. · Outcome as I see it  Hart's anger - yes. Latent self-defense - yes. Justified  no. Sentence  yes, prison 1 year, that includes anger management, self-defense, and marriage relation classes just to name a few. What does the movie really do without giving away the ending  celebrates female use of machine guns against lovers who dun' them wrong. Comic, absurd or just a crude display of crude women? Flynn thought it amusing. I didn't. Did I like the film? Not really. Too much of an edgy smug portrayal creating an uncomfortable, if not obnoxiously superficial barrier between actors and movie audience.",Chicago

I didn't mind the editing in ""Moulin Rouge"" because the plot was linear and framed. ""Chicago,"" though, chops up the plot into two, three, four parallel tracks and so-called acting is interspersed by vaudeville song and dance routines.

337,oso_travis,"""I can't do it alone"" (and certainly you couldn't)",10,28 July 2003,"A lot of people has criticized `Chicago'. A lot of people has criticized the Academy for giving it top honors in the past Oscar Ceremony.  A lot of people went mad, when `Chicago' won 6-Oscars, and  `Gangs of New York' none. I think `Chicago' it's a really, really good movie, but further more an excellent musical. And probably that's its main problem. It's a genre film. Not since `Unforgiven', a western, a genre film had won the Best Picture award. And of course, the problem with certain genre of films is that some people just love it, are some just hate it!!
Above that, `Chicago' as a musical is outstanding. What more can you ask?? There's a criminal plot on it, there's all that good singing and dancing from ALL THE CAST. And there's a legendary closing musical number,   in which we are truly witnesses that `it swells with two people'. That energy and that razzle-dazzle shown by Velma and Roxie, are potential cinema classics.
Third is a charm. Two previous Bob Fosse's musicals had been nominated for Best Picture. But none of them won. `Cabaret' won a nod for Fosse's direction. `All That Jazz' swept at Cannes the top honors, and won some well-deserved Oscars for art merits. And, although `Chicago' wasn't directed by Fosse, his ghost was around all the time. So giving an Oscar for Best Picture to `Chicago' was like, awarding Fosse and his great bad boys band: Fredd Ebb and John Kander. All we are thankful, because All That Delicious Political Incorrectness ( A Fosse's trademark) is everywhere in `Chicago'.
Was `Chicago' the best picture in 2002? Certainly not. There were far more interesting  and risky films like `Far from Heaven', `Narc', `Secretary', `Confessions of a Dangerous Mind', `The Pianist' and even Almodovar's new masterpiece `Talk to Her'. But certainly `Chicago' was the best film produced in the Hollywood system. And it became one of the greatest musicals of all time.",Chicago

If he had sung any of those songs at an American Idol audition, do you honestly believe he'd get past the first round? There's only one reason he was cast - STAR POWER = BOX OFFICE! The producers/directors could easily have gone with a slam dunk choice and cast James Naughton, who won a Tony award as Billy Flynn in the late 90's Broadway revival. Ahhhhh! - but how many people have heard of James Naughton as compared to Richard Gere? By the way, if you don't think there's much of a difference, watch the movie again.

Renee Zellweger is not comedian enough for the role, Catherine Zeta Jones is GORGEOUS but she's too gorgeous and her performance is too pretty and not gritty enough, Queen Latifa plays it too soft also. there's comedy in the Mama character which is her being SUCH a bull diesel and would've been perfectly played by Orange Is The New Black's Lea DeLaria.

344,lschmalz,A Must See!,10,27 January 2003,"""Chicago"" is slated for many Oscar nominations, and I attest that it truly deserves each and every one.  This magnificent musical brings to life the story of fictional Roxie Hart (Zellweger), who dreams of becoming a famous show girl, like her idol, Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones).  When Roxie shoots her boyfriend in a heated rage, she ends up in jail along side Kelly, both vying to get Billy Flynn (Gere) as their lawyer.  The fun is non-stop.  The choreography magnificent.  The performances superb.  Zellweger is perfect as Roxie, winning a Golden Globe Award for this great performance.  Richard Gere has tapped danced his way to a most deserved Golden Globe award also. Who knew he could be so darn charming? My votes for the Oscar wins however, go to the supporting players in this film.  Zeta-Jones is a knock-out and steals every scene she's in.  John C. Reilly is outstanding as Roxie's sympathetic and simple husband; his performance will break your heart. Finally, the musical numbers are so spectacular, that I wanted to jump up and cheer after each one.  I think I should have. ""Chicago"" is a movie to stand up and applaud for.  It's that good.",Chicago
345,Doctor_Mabuse,"10/10 *****/5 ~ Ideal filming of Broadway masterpiece lacks ""Class"".",10,1 March 2004,"Chicago triumphs in meeting and overcoming enormous challenges in adapting a seemingly unfilmable, high-concept stage piece for the screen. The solutions found by director Rob Marshall and screenwriter Bill Condon are not only ingenious, but they ""work"", and the resulting cinematic/theatrical hybrid is one of the most exciting Musical films since Bob Fosse's Cabaret (1972) -- not that much competition has been available in the anti-Musical interim. The Chicago/Cabaret comparison is both inevitable and valid, yet the two films are as different as they are similar. Fosse's Cabaret was a radical reinventing of its stage original which threw out the book and half the songs, starting from scratch with a fresh screenplay and a wholly realistic, ""in-performance"" approach to each musical number. Chicago, on the other hand, goes to great lengths to maintain its innate theatricality in a fresh cinematic context.Okay, enough already, you've read it all before: This is a wonderful film of an American Musical masterpiece. Especially impressive is Marshall's vivid evocation of the cinematic and editorial manner of Fosse's five brilliant films as director (Sweet Charity, Cabaret, Lenny, All That Jazz and Star 80) while avoiding any slavish imitation of Fosse's approach to the original Broadway Chicago or to that one-and-only Fosse choreographic style. The Fellini influence (Variety Lights in this case), the contrasting reality/fantasy sequences, the vicious fascination with the cult of Celebrity, the obsession with death and the extravagant razzle-dazzle showmanship are all there, but the the film both embraces and transcends Fosse to become an entity of its own. It is in this arena that the film attains its greatness, but the performances in the center ring are its most amazing feature: Catherine Zeta-Jones' super-pro Oscar devastation; pug-nosed-dream John Reilly's sweet-heartbreak ""Mr. Cellophane""; and that incandescent ""who knew?"" miracle, Renee Zellweger. ""All That Jazz"", ""Roxie"" and ""Nowadays"" take their places among the all-time great movie-musical numbers.The one regrettable error is the cutting of the memorably vulgar song ""Class"", surely one of the highlights of the John Kander-Fred Ebb score. It is generally for the best that several songs were dropped from the score, but the film's lack of ""Class"" is an unconscionable blunder. Marshall and Condon stage a three-ring circus of their own on the DVD commentary track to explain and validate this post-filming decision as Compromising the Film's Conceptual Integrity, yada yada yada, but nothing justifies divesting Chicago of this distinctive song -- or robbing the astonishing Queen Latifa of a second number. It's nice that the scene is included as an extra on the DVD, but until Marshall relents and restores it to a future cut, the film will remain incomplete. Even its ""Classlessness"", however, cannot prevent Chicago from being a great movie Musical.",Chicago

347,jessied,Encore!,10,6 January 2003,"In the blink of an eye Chicago envelops its audience in the 1920's world of jazz, cabaret, and liquor.Hands grip freshly poured cocktails. Women in beads and bangles flirt with men who have money to burn. Trumpets blare in the background. The plush, low-lighted room smells of smoke, lust, and crisp dollar bills. Performers primp and savor one last drag on their cigarettes backstage. Audience members find their seats. Roxie and Fred stumble into the streets. Velma wipes the blood from her hands and adjusts her stockings and fringe. Good evening ladies and gentlemen. The bandleader's fingers warm the piano keys, and with a quick 5-6-7-8! the stage show begins.
Don't expect opening credits in this dazzling film directed by Rob Marshall--it doesn't have any.  Don't expect a plethora of surprising plot twists or a lack of campiness--it's a musical.  Don't expect a linear story--its brilliance relies on fantastic parallels and skillful editing that might easily confuse an inattentive viewer.
Expect corruption--it's the story's premise.  Expect award-winning performances--its cast would sellout performances on Broadway for years. Expect an overall stimulating production--it might make you forget to breathe during the film's greatest moments.
Screenwriter Bill Condon privileges the character Roxie Hart played by Renée Zellweger.  Her eye shuts, the title splashes across the screen, and as soon as she appears onscreen the story is told from her perspective.  The choice to tell the story from Roxie's point-of-view undermines the inherent sexual nature of 1920's nightlife and the overriding corruption of Chicago during this era, and instead accentuates the performer's desire to perform. Chicago is not about skimpily clad performers or their crimes--it's about the performance both on the stage and off.  Roxie doesn't want to be a star like Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones)--she needs to be a star and will do anything to see her name in lights.  She craves the stage and views the world through eyes that entertain an audience even though that audience does not yet exist.  Time stands still when she appears from behind the curtain and sings stretched out across the piano.  Her dreams are her realities, but they are not easily realized in the real world.  She needs publicity. She needs people to take her picture.  She kills and shares a cellblock with Velma.  They share the spotlight in the papers, and the competition for the most dramatically compelling persona and court case ensues.
Roxie and Velma compete for press, and Zellweger and Zeta-Jones compete for top billing in one of 2002's best pictures.  Zellweger ultimately deserves the most praise for her versatile and convincing performance as Chicago's sweetest little murderess, but Zeta-Jones sets the mood and delivers a nearly perfect performance as the seductive cabaret killer.  The women initially struggle when they must interact with one another, as do other characters in this film that prospers largely because of individual performances rather than unblemished cast chemistry, but their somewhat flawed but infrequent exchanges hardly affect the film's overall success.
The film prospers because of impressive individual performances and these performances are numerous.  Marshall and the casting team of Ali Farrell, Tina Gerussi, and Laura Rosenthal assembled a celebrity cast that includes Richard Gere as Billy Flynn, John C. Reilly as Amos Hart, Christine Baranski as Mary Sunshine, Queen Latifah as Matron Mama Morton, Lucy Liu as Kitty Baxter, and Taye Diggs as the bandleader.  None of these characters possess depth, and the performances are hardly subtle, but again, Chicago is a musical.  Billy is a detestable, self-interested attorney--he's not going to change.  Amos is a lovable fool--he's not going to change.  Mary is determined to get the story and cares little about the people who she interviews--she's not going to change.  And so on and so on, but neither the writer nor the actors should be criticized for not making the characters more dynamic--flat characters are a staple of the genre, and each and every one of these actors skillfully exhumes his or her character's most engaging qualities.
The singing, the dancing, and the combination of performances elicits applause throughout the film, and loud cheers of approval erupt during the closing credits.  Theatergoers readily participate in the suspension of disbelief when they attend the theater, and moviegoers must do the same for this stage show adapted for the screen.  Characters might lack sufficient motivation for dramatic action and important social and political criticism is lost in the spectacle, but that's show business and the movie musical has rarely looked so good or evoked such emphatic cries for an encore like this production of Chicago.",Chicago
348,phantom110,"Best Musical since ""The Music Man""",10,13 March 2003,"This is the best musical I have seen on screen since the 1962 screening of Meredith Wilson's ""The Music Man"".

Great job to everybody, especially to Kander and Ebb for making ragtime jazz popular again!",Chicago
349,ObscureAuteur,One of the all time great stage musicals on screen.,9,16 February 2003,"I can scarcely imagine a better translation of this stage musical to a real movie (not a filmed stage performance).  It ranks at the top with West Side Story and My Fair Lady in this regard.   It is completely faithful to its theatrical source while being a movie in every sense, a rare accomplishment on film.  And with no major cuts or revisions to the music (even the famous Rodgers and Hammerstein based movies have significant cuts such as A Lonely Room in Oklahoma.  Then there are the ones where none of the stage score survives, Why bother? one might ask.)  The Fosse dance numbers were perserved and appropriately magnified as he might have done (as in Cabaret). The acting was first rate, and the singing and dancing was never worse than acceptable.  The problem with many here is that Chicago is not a ""feel good"" musical, nor a charming (or even tragic) love story.  It is a hard cynical tale of seriously flawed people in a shallow materialistic society.  In short in highly resembles tabloid America in the year 2002.  If you want great sugar, drag out Sound of Music.  If you want harmless feel good, albeit with top quality performances, drag out your Fred Astaire videos. If you want a light drama with music video inserts masquerading as a ""musical"" drag out Saturday Night Fever.  But if you want a great example of Broadway in movie form, then you will find it in Chicago.  Ranks with the very best of this genre and one of the few to capture a close equivalent to the stage work for perpetuity.I think it inaccurate to regard the music sequences as ""dream"" (with the exception of the short Roxie insert in All That Jazz).  Rather they are visual/musical subtext to the straight story running in parallel.  We see the literal events as flat action, and their true flavor in the flamboyant musical numbers.  This worked brilliantly.And for what its worth I have no use whatever for the flashy, derivative music sampling exercise known as Moulin Rouge.  It is not even in the same country. It is sheer coincidence these two have come out with a year or so of each other. But it does have a love story doesn't it?",Chicago

351,21bostoncalifornia,The movie and the stage musical are both different and both great,9,5 April 2003,"I am a big fan of musicals. I have seen dozens on Broadway andtravelling shows and acted in many regional and college theatreproductions. The stage show CHICAGO is great. I don't argue that.What I don't understand is why purests have to criticize the movieso much. Can't you see it for its own strengths? I love moviemusicals because they reach a wider audience. Rather than keeppeople away from the stage show, as many authors have suggested this movie will, I think the popularity of this movie willencourage MORE people to see and appreciate the stage show.Just look at the ad in the NY Times: the stage show is capitalizingon the success of the movie.Now, for the movie itself, all movie adaptations are different thanthe stage original. I think they pulled it off very well. The stage showhas lots of great songs that didn't make it into the movie, but themovie also added a lot where the show is lacking, like incontextualization and dialogue. Renee kind of bothered me herebecause she had so much make up on, but then Roxie is notsupposed to be a very likeable character. That's the point of theshow. She is SUPPOSED to be untalented. Catherine on the otherhand, was fantastic. As were John C Reilly and Queen Latifah. AndRichard Gere was very impressive. I especially liked Hunak, theHungarian. Her death scene in the movie was much more movingthan in the musical.And to all of you complaining about the immorality of this movie, it'sjust a movie, folks! No one's really condoning murder here. Relaxand just enjoy the razzle-dazzle.I want to recommend anyone who enjoyed this movie to seeDancer in The Dark, starring Bjork. Another good recent movie musical that unfortunately went straightto video because of an evil studio chairman is THE FANTASTICKS, starring Joel Grey (Amos Hart in the Broadwayrevival of Chicago)",Chicago
352,hoopoe,Terrific! I would give it 15 stars if possible.,10,2 February 2003,"I was completely spellbound by the great talents of the performers, the camera work, the costumes, the choreography, the musical arrangements. Except for My Fair Lady, perhaps, it is the best screen adaptation of a Broadway musical I have seen in my 75 years as a movie buff,and a former professional singer.

353,misslv80,"""Slickago""",6,8 September 2003,"I avoided seeing this movie for a while because I had the feeling I was going to be disappointed. Sadly, I was right. There were a couple of performances that really surprised me, especially that of Queen Latifah - sexy and sassy! Catherine Zeta-Jones was also impressive as the Ice Queen murderess Velma Kelly. Renee Zellweger was not bad as the main character Roxie Hart, but I couldn't stand her character, as probably was the intention. Richard Gere was not bad either although the tap dance number really irritated me as the punctuated rhythm coincided with the dialogue. The ""Cell Block Tango"" and puppet numbers were well choreographed, but other than that, the film left me feeling very hollow and empty at the end. I understood the film's social commentary about corruption, greed, and the three-ring circus of the media, manipulation of and by the media, how some people will do anything to be famous, even lie, cheat, and kill, but I had no real feelings for any of the characters. The songs are catchy, but kind of cliched, a lot of 20s-style ""wah-wah-wah-wah""s here and there. It was very colorful, dazzling, beautiful eye-candy, but no substance or warmth, very slick and cynical. I felt at times the story was forced and tried too hard. Of course, there are movies where the ""bad guys"" win, but in this case it didn't matter who came out on top at the end because I didn't have any real emotional connection to the characters anyway. The golden age of musicals in Hollywood has long since past. There will be new modern movie musicals like ""Chicago"" in the future, but like they say, ""They don't make 'em like they used to.""",Chicago
354,nixxnutz,I've been waiting 22 years to see this movie,10,8 February 2003,"I saw a college production of Chicago in 1981. It's one of my favorite shows. After umpteen postponements of the nationwide release date, I finally got to see this movie yesterday. Even after reading about it for weeks, I thought it was better than I expected. Unlike many movie versions of stage musicals of the past, almost all the wonderful songs from the original Broadway show were included (I hear ""Class"" was filmed but later cut, although it will be on the DVD), and the only new one, ""I Move On,"" was written by the same songwriters (Kander & Ebb) and played over the credits. It was pretty good, too. See, I love musicals. I love to watch tap dancing, and I don't want too much plot interfering with it. I love '20s music, although I wasn't around for it when it was new. There's plenty of drama on TV, including movies, if that's what I want. But if I'm going to shell out $5 (senior matinee), I want a good musical. The last movie I went to in a theater was Evita, a disappointment precisely because it did not follow the original show closely enough. Chicago was brilliantly staged from start to finish. Like one commentator said, I hated to blink. I've been going to musicals since before most of the other commentators here were born, and I'm having trouble thinking of another musical I enjoyed as much as this one. All the things everyone else has criticized-well, they're probably good reasons why this film is so satisfying. Flashy production design, lots of quick-cut musical numbers, and over-the-top performances of cardboard characters, with no boring, moralizing message. Read my lips: this is not Macbeth, it's a MUSICAL.",Chicago
355,CharlieB-5,"Flashy, fun, forgettable",8,6 January 2003,"Bob Fosse in the 21st Century? Chicago works. Fosse's love/hate relationship with fame and celebrity is showcased in Roaring Twenties Chicago, with the stories of 2 incarcerated murderesses (Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger) and their manipulative, cynical attorney (Richard Gere). The movie moves seamlessesly between the external and the inner world of characters, expressed as musical numbers. Great fun. Well directed and acted. Gere, Zellweger and Zeta-Jones are surprisingly good hoofers and singers. Something to relish in the moment, and hum while getting out of the parking lot. This movie just wants to be entertaining, and when it's this well done, there ain't nothing wrong with that. Someone with cajones should recast this as the O.J. Simpson trial.",Chicago
356,evso,Richard Gere can sing?,9,13 January 2003,"Things I learned from Chicago, one of the best films of 2002:1) Not only is Catherine Zeta-Jones a marvelous dancer, but she can sing, too! She is terrific as Velma.2) Yes, Richard Gere can sing, and he can dance.  Although his singing style is a bit nasal and he seems to adopt a British accent when he sings, he does a great job, especially in the ""They Both Reached for the Gun"" number.  And ""Razzle Dazzle"" ain't bad, either.3) While Renee Zellweger isn't the world's greatest dancer (she looked a bit shoddy in comparison to Zeta-Jones), her voice is amazing! She gives Roxie a believable vulnerability, even when she is giving her best lies.4) The supporting roles almost steal the show.  Queen Latifah's number gave me goose-bumps, and John C. Reilly was so pitiful as Amos that you have to feel sorry for him.  There was no one in this film whose singing made me cringe (and I do cringe easily).  It is a beautiful film, with great costumes (mostly lingerie, it seemed) and amazing acting AND singing.  I strongly recommend it to any fan of musicals.  I will say if you liked ""Cabaret"", you will probably enjoy this film, since they both use the ""stream-of-conciousness"" plan for inserting the musical numbers.  I don't think this film will disappoint you.",Chicago
357,reddpill,"Good, but not perfect",7,5 January 2003,"Chicago has a lot of style.  The costumes, songs, coreography, lighting, etc., are all wonderful.  Queen Latifah and Catherine Zeta-Jones perform well and the script is solid.  Renée Zellweger is great in the comic moments but a bit weak in the dance numbers.  The biggest failing, however, is Richard Gere.  His dancing is horrible and the ADR dubbing on him is amazingly obvious.  (ADR is also quite noticeable in some of Zellweger's scenes.)  If the producers had hired Kevin Spacey (who was reportedly considered for the part of Billy Flynn), this would probably have been a much better film.",Chicago
358,reddragon1110,Razzle Dazzle Musical,8,10 June 2004,"Chicago id based on the Broadway Hit `Chicago' starting Renée Zelweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah and Christine Branski, Chicago became the 2003 award winning film at the Oscars.Chicago is a good film, but it is not definitely the best of the year. Chicago is the story of aspiring actress/singer Roxie Hart, who idolizes Velma Kelly (cabaret singer), who kills his lover in a night of passion, ends up at jail. There she'll meet Velma, who has killed his husband and sister. At jail she meets Mama Morton, and a successful lawyer Billy Flynn, who has never lost a case. The story intercalates musical numbers (Roxie's fantasies) and reality. With some outstanding cinematography, some extraordinary edition and fabulous sets filled with contrasting colours and glitter. The story also uses a great variety of costumes, from dark and sober (reality, the streets) to colourful, crazy costumes used at the musical numbers. Renée's performance as an aspiring actress is very good, she shows she can actually act and sing. Queen Latifah is surprising; John C Reilly is great as Roxie's looser husband. Richard Gere is completely annoying; he is such a bad singer and a bad actor. Catherine is fine, very sexy, but definitely not the best performance of the movie. The movie's main flaws, is that the story is not that rich, the film is quite slow, and its one of those films that the first time you watch it it's very good, the second boring and slow, and the third completely bad. Considering the other best picture nominees: Gangs of New York, The Hours, The Pianist and The lord of the rings, this film is definitely not worth and Oscar. The other four stories (well maybe not gangs of New York) are so rich in story (script) so rich in other aspects that this is defiantly one of the most unfair Oscar winners. 7.12/10.00",Chicago
359,oldmovieman,Huge Disappointment,5,27 September 2005,"And you thought ""Chicago"" was such a great musical that no one could foul it up? You were wrong. First, you substitute Fosse's brilliant work with Rob Marshall's schlock choreography. It's not even close to the style or spirit of Fosse and just putting your dancers in Fosse-like costuming doesn't cut it. Second, you cast the homely Renee Zellweger to play Roxie, the ""cute girl."" Yikes! Worse, someone should have suggested to Renee that badly channeling Marilyn Monroe all the way down to the pout looks ridiculous. So what are we to do with this Academy Award winner? It's best to watch it the same way an accident reconstruction expert looks at the scene of a train wreck. In so doing we learn from this awful mishmash of MTV quick cuts, strange lighting, and massive over-direction that 1) Catherine Zeta-Jones can't dance, a fact that Marshall and his editors try to hide by rarely letting you see CZJ dance more than a few steps without a cut and by taking a lot of shots from the waist up; 2) Richard Gere is a surprisingly good song and dance man (never would have imagined); and 3) We should have bought the musical's cast album and saved ourselves a long 113 minutes.",Chicago
360,DarrenHorne,Richard Gere steals the limelight,6,7 March 2005,"Chicago was written way back in 1926 as a play, became a non musical film in 1942 starring Ginger Rogers, and a stage show which opened in 1975 to mixed reviews. However it's recent revival on Broadway and the West End has been very well received, meaning the timing of the film version could not be better. The story stays quite true to the original, set in 1920's Chicago which is a vibrant city of Jazz, sex, crime and media hype, where fame, or notoriety, is everything. Roxie Hart (Zellweger) is the wannabe star that is imprisoned for shooting her lover. There she meets fellow murderess, and famous jazz performer, Velma Kelly (Jones) who is using the media to increase her fame and win her freedom. Roxies attempts at friendship are rebuked and so she hires Velmas lawyer, razzle dazzler Billy Flynn (Gere), in order to play the same game, and a battle for column inches begins as they both try to avoid being hanged.Chicago is packed with musical segments, which could alienate the audience, but the songs are of such great quality that they will be running through your head long after you leave the cinema. ""All that Jazz"" is obviously a classic, and both female stars have surprisingly good voices, but it is Gere that brings an added zest to his songs, especially with ""We Both Reached for the Gun"" and ""Razzle Dazzle"" which will make you want to stand and applaud the screen. Gere often plays roles in which he takes second place to the female lead and allows his co-stars to take centre stage, but here he gets a chance to shine and have fun. He does this superbly with a stunningly charismatic performance of the manipulative and devilish Billy Flynn. Men will want to be him and women will want to be with him, in this film Richard Gere is God. It will make you want to rent out his entire back catalogue. The ladies fare less well, with the masculine, vampish Velma and innocent doll like Roxie almost bordering on being a women in cages lesbian stereotype. Thankfully the two stars steer their characters away from that (just) and both add a vulnerability that makes us want to protect them, even if we don't like them. That is impressive considering how shallow the characters actually are.The support casts performances surpass the female stars, especially John C Reillys endearing and pitiful performance of Roxies trod upon husband, and Queen Latifah as Matron ""Mama"" Morten who gives the only sensuous performance in the film, which is surprising considering how many scantily clad ladies there are.This is a wonderfully nostalgic film that captures the mood of the era and has a great deal of relevance in today's fame obsessed, spin doctoring world in which money buys freedom and media is truth. Unfortunately it is too stagey, and it is often only the bright lights and glitter that holds your attention. However, it should make you want to go to the Theatre, which is never a bad thing.",Chicago
361,Jvbway,Wonderful,8,28 April 2006,"The saga of translating ""Chicago"" the musical to the screen began in the late 70's, with Bob Fosse reprising his role as director and Liza Minelli and Goldie Hawn in the lead roles. Then in the 80's Baz Luhrman was mentioned to direct a version with Wendy Wasserstein supplying a screenplay. Then, after the success of the 1996 Broadway revival of the piece, Nicholas Hytner was attached to direct a version which would hopefully star Goldie Hawn and Madonna. Both of the lead actresses dropped out, Charlize Theron was briefly announced as a replacement for Goldie Hawn in the role of Roxie Hart, but ultimately the production was scrapped. That is until 2000, when Rob Marshall, who had recently directed an unprecedentedly acclaimed t.v remake of ""Annie"", brought in the idea, and the result was this, which proved for a time to resurrect film versions of Stage musicals and became the first musical to win best picture since ""Oliver!"" in 1968. ""Chicago"" was not an easy show to adapt for the stage, The musical numbers are presentational and not naturalistic, not a problem on stage but posing a fairly big problem on screen. Marshall solved the problem brilliantly by having the musical numbers be extravagant dream sequences, and shifting back to realism for the spoken scenes.The cast is all around superb, Catherine Zeta-Jones' Velma is especially excellent, with Renee Zellweger a convincing Roxie, and Richard Gere well cast as Billy Flynn, and superb supporting turns from Queen Latifah and John C.

Goodness no! First, Richard Gere can't act unless he's opposite Julia Roberts anyway. Renee Zelwegger gives a pretty mediocre performance, not one that deserves an Oscar (Nicole Kidman's gonna win for The Hours anyway.) Catherine Zeta-Jones is just annoying. Queen Latifah was actually ok. This corny musical does not deserve any Oscars in my opinion. It does not razzle-dazzle at all. =(",Chicago

It most certainly did not deserve the Best Picture Oscar over The Two Towers or The Hours. Zellwegger is not a very good singer. It's like she's trying trying to imitate Madonna, Marilyn Monroe, & Brenda Lee all at once. Catherine Zeta-Jones wasn't that much better. For starters short hair does not look good on her at all. Then there's the deal with her accent. She tries to cover up her Welsh accent, but it sneaks in too many times. I did however like some of the songs. I did not like how they were played out. The numbers would start with singing then cut to a scene with talking while the music is still going so you can't enjoy the number to its maximum potential. I enjoyed Queen Latifah though. She really added a lot to the film, which did not offer much else for acting. The film had a lot more potential with its story line and music, but Rob Marshall somehow screwed it up.

Zellweger is great as the pampered prisoner, and Zeta-Jones is back to her sexy self.

I had no reservations at all about it as I walked out of the theater, two nights prior to its winning the best picture Oscar. Seeing it again on video though left me with a doubt or two.Rob Marshall did an outstanding job directing the movie. The photography is sensational, some of the best lighting and camerawork I've ever seen. (It looks as good on DVD as it did on the big screen.) The musical numbers are thrilling, esp. the ""We Both Reached for the Gun"" scene with Richard Gere manipulating both a mannequin-like Rene Zellweger and the media. And the acting is some of the year's best. Gere has never been better in a movie, and Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah turn in strong, hypnotically sexy work.That's the good news, which there's lots of. Unfortunately, ""Chicago"" doesn't hold up well where characters and story are concerned. I just didn't have anybody to root for. Roxie Hart is essentially a heartless b---- who exhibits no growth whatsoever, just a greater hunger for attention and manipulation. Velma Kelly, well, she's just a hyper-sexual killer, and Gere's Billy Flynn is just another scheming lawyer who'd do anything to win a case. John C. Reilly's character, ""Mr. Cellophane,"" ends the picture on a flat note -- just a loser, fallen victim to Roxie's celebrity. What are we to make of all this? That crime pays? That we should feel good about these characters?The writing is also a little muted. There are few zingers outside the song lyrics, and the basic story seems trite and forced. I couldn't tell if the movie ended on a ""realistic"" note, or if it had morphed into some kind of crazy, surrealistic cartoon. You're sort of left wondering, what was the point?A note about the songs: They're good fun during the movie, but I'll be darned if I can remember a single line or lyric, much less a whole chorus, from any of them.Don't get me wrong: ""Chicago"" is a good movie. It just makes me want to go back and watch ""Cabaret"" and ""All That Jazz"" (also Bob Fosse productions) on DVD.",Chicago

Which is why my musical-loving wife looked at me somewhat cross-eyed when I suggested we go see this unorthodox musical.  But Moulin Rouge and Nicole Kidman, step aside, because this one has Oscar written all over it.  Very cleverly done, Catherine Zeta-Jones shows talent you did not know she had, and Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere are delightful in their roles.Quick plot outline:  The two Z's are in jail for murder (one killed her husband and two concubines; the other her boyfriend), and Z-J is the nightclub star while Z is the wannabe.  Richard Gere plays the smooth attorney.  Queen Latifah the jailhouse mama.  John C.

The Broadway cast was just adequate. Why was the great song ""Class"" deleted from the movie? Is the song, sung by Latifah and Jones, restored in the DVD version? The song was not shown in theaters nor is it on the VHS tape. The songs sounded great in the film. Gere and Zellwegger did great jobs singing and dancing. The casting and costumes were superior. The film editing was great, too. Although the plot seemed like just fluff, it is relevant because it shows how corrupt our justice system is.

I didn't find any reason. The movie was hours of boring stuff, heartless portrayals of people. There was no real story and there were too many dances and songs (I know it is a musical but still...it wasn't entertaining). Kept on dragging for a long time and really got me bored. I think the only thing worth noticing was how real life was compared to life in Broadway. The rest was pretty boring and not worth the time. I don't know how this movie had 13 Oscar nominations and was the Best Picture winner. NOT FAIR AT ALL!!! I don't know how the Academy was enthralled by this...stuff.

I am also a HUGE fan of Broadway shows, and I think that Chicago is one of the few movies that was better then the Broadway show. When Chicago first came out in movies, I saw it with my entire family (parents, sister, aunt, uncle...) and we all loved it! My sister and I were obsessed with it for a while. It's just a really REALLY great movie, with amazing songs (All That Jazz, Cell Block Tango, We Both Reached For The Gun, I Can't Do It Alone, Mister Cellophane, Razzle Dazzle... basically every song is great!) I recommend it for anyone who likes Musicals and anyone who doesn't like musicals, because it's not your average Movie Musical. It's way more than that... it's Chicago!!

It's entertaining - yes. But one of the best films of 2002? Not even close.If you are a fan of musicals, it's certainly worth seeing ""Chicago"" at the matinee admission price. If you are a fan of Geere, Zellweger or Zeta-Jones you may also enjoy this film. The music is also quite good, and unlike Moulin Rouge - original. But if you are looking for story or substance, it just isn't here.The scenes/numbers that worked best IMO were 1) ""When You're Good to Mama"" w/ Queen Latifa (she just gets better and better on screen); 2) ""Cell Block Tango"" when the murderous women introduce themselves and their crimes via song & dance in the jail house; and 3) ""We Both Reached for the Gun"" in which Geere balances Zellweger on his lap in a ventriloquist/dummy bit that was very artfully done and funny to boot.I do think this movie will hold up over time, b/c the costumes & set design were beautiful and the music is surprisingly GOOD... and as a big fan of musicals I am glad to see that the Hollywood machine has started making musicals again. My only regret and/or wish would be that Bebe Neuwirth and Joel Gray had been in the starring roles of this film instead of the cast that was ultimately assembled.

Nowadays, some movies put me to sleep due to slow pacing, a sagging storyline, or uninteresting characters.  But not ""Chicago!"" From beginning to end, this movie held my attention with its jazzy fantasy numbers, smooth film editing, knockout choreography, superlative acting, appropriate sets and costumes, and snappy screenplay adaptation. This movie version of the famous 1975 Broadway hit and 1996 stage revival stays true to its creator's vision (the late and brilliant Bob Fosse), and never disappoints.  In fact, the lighting and the clever staging of the musical numbers are a bit reminiscent of 1972's ""Cabaret"" and 1979's ""All That Jazz."" And yet, ""Chicago"" is able to stand on its own as a classic herald for more 21st-century movie musicals, and it deserves our applause.  Sexy, cynical, sassy, and ultimately, triumphant, ""Chicago"" deserves all the accolades its receiving.  I hope other Hollywood studios take notice and follow suit.  This is what moviegoers of all ages and nations want - entertainment that's exuberant, memorable and smart, yet accessible to the masses.  ""Chicago,"" you're my kind of movie!",Chicago

Would the Broadway version work on the big screen...I have no idea!Once I got the play out of my head and concentrated on the movie, I was able to enjoy it and would recommend it to everyone...weaknesses and all.  Also, if you enjoyed the numbers ""Class"" and ""My Baby and Me"" in the show, be prepared not to hear them in the movie.

I thought I would have a miserable time... and I did... for about the first half minute.
  Then the excitement, energy and joy of this movie captivated me!!!  All the hyperbole in the world couldn't do this movie justice.   It was playful, imaginative, and so very vivid. I have raved on and on to friends (and even those ""fleeting friends"" we stand next to in the grocery check-out lines.) I cannot think of any scene in the movie without smiling. My mind continues to happily belt out the songs (even though I have enough sense to not try to sing along!). Guess I found out that I don't hate ALL jazz.

The first half was rather serious and dark - all that talk of jail and hangings, plus a gunshot at close range - but the second half was fun.  I especially enjoyed Richard Gere as Billy Flynn. He really ate up the role, playing Billy with a twinkle in his eye, as though he was really having fun playing a sleazy lawyer, singing and dancing.My daughter has been singing ""All That Jazz"" since we came home, and I know she enjoyed the dance numbers and the humor.  I was surprised at the level of sexual content, but actually I was more disturbed by the shooting and hanging scenes and the number where each woman on Death Row describes how she did her man in.

384,nivekj1,Mix Razzle-Dazzle and Reality For a Pitch-Perfect Musical [SPOILER WARNING],10,20 January 2003,"Wow! I was aware of the play Chicago, yet I hadn't seen it. The first time I heard ""All That Jazz"" on the trailer, I got my hands on a copy of the song. By the end of the day, I was an expert on all things Chicago, the play, the true story, the revival, even the London production. I was juiced to see the movie. It opened small, and a little wider, until suddenly it was playing in my town. As soon as I knew it was in town I grabbed a ticket. The opener, better than I imagined. The ""Funny Honey"" number starring Roxie completely set the tone for the critical transitions into Roxie's psyche for the musical setpieces. The music and dialogue were sharp, biting, and fresh. I mean, one hit after another. Mama's song, Cell Block Tango, Billy's song, even ""We Both Reached for the Gun"", which I thought would be hokey, was brilliantly pulled off. Roxie's love letter to herself was when, if we hadn't realized how vapid and conceited Roxie was, this hammered it home. All she truly cared about was fame; it's kind of scary actually. Velma reminds the audience she's still part of the show with ""Can't Do It Alone,"" while John C. Reilly steals the show and earns some unexpected sympathy with ""Mr. Cellophane,"" my personal favorite from the movie. Once again, Richard Gere proves why he won the Golden Globe with ""Razzle Dazzle"" and The Tapdance. These musical numbers not help the story move along, they ARE the story, as the case should be with a musical. We see enough of the real world to remind us that these events are actually occuring, which is nice because it makes me feel more comfortable. Plus, ""Chicago"" is more of an adult movie, and not your old-fashioned mushy love story. It hits hard and plays for keeps. I can't remember such a chilling scene in a musical than that of Hunyack's disappearing act. I wasn't expecting something that harsh and I'm glad they held back as much as they did. The end was pitch-perfect, and in more ways than one. Amos moves on to hopefully a better life, Flynn moves on to a better case, and Roxie and Velma become partners in fame, their ultimate drug. ""Nowadays"" is my second favorite tune, followed closely by ""All That Jazz."" In their case, it's a happy ending, although Roxie doesn't become a better person, nor should she. People like her don't deserve consciences. But everybody, all the players, dancers, singers, and musicians gave it their all, and Bill Condon and Rob Marshall should consider this movie to be a crowning achievement, and to that I say Bravo! This is one movie that keeps you wanting more, and there are few movies that are so deserving of an encore viewing. I can't wait for the DVD. Four out of four stars.",Chicago

386,FoxGarrison,Save the dime and go dine.,4,18 February 2003,"I'm not a fan of the musical genre per se, however I do have my moments when I'm swept away by the gosh-darn song and dance so much so that I actually do fancy it now and again.  Moulin Rouge did that for me with the extravagant costumes, enchanting melodies and the irresistible story.  Chicago unfortunately did not.  There are a number of reasons for this, but overall I thought the movie did not have a good story.Now there are a number of good things with this movie I would like to highlight to let you know that I'm not completely negative about it all. The music for one is very period and appropriate for the era.  Much like today, the music back then was a reflection of the general mood of the time. The costumes were fairly accurate and really enhanced the feel for the film.  Although I did not agree with the Academy's lavish outpouring of trophies, I did agree with the award for Cinematography-this is rightly deserved.This film does have its problems.  Many of Chicago's flaws lie in the filmmaker's presumptions that all potential viewers of the movie are abase. Drawing a comparison with Moulin Rouge seems fitting since both are somewhat period and both are done with a fantasy type of theme.  In Moulin Rouge the suggestion of sex went a long way even though the actual act was never seen. In Chicago much of the mystery is dispelled by the blatant act.  This is a minor issue, but for it to not have an R' rating then it would be more than justifiable to leave the bedroom scenes out on the cutting floor-we're talking about a musical and not Fight Club.Contrary to critics' opinion though I believe the singing, dancing and acting was average and not award-winning.  Keeping in mind the film being a musical and comparing it to other musicals where Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland reigned in the field, the protagonists in this movie were mediocre at best average.Finally, if I had to rate this I would give it a 4/10 for the great-looking ending.  There was no excuse why this feature could not have operated within the bounds of morality to make it an enjoyable family film instead of being less than sub-par for a hollywood flick.",Chicago

It was a great thing to see and listen to. The song ""Cell Block Tango"" is the highlight of the film. One of the best choreographed sequences I have had the pleasure of watching.  What really shines is the overall look of the film. Paced perfectly and all the songs just work so well with the overall style of the film. I have not seen the original stage version so I am not going to compare but on its own merits I must say this is one of the best musicals I have ever seen.Overall, I would recommend this film to musical lovers and cinema lovers.

390,Sterling52,'Chicago' truly has 'all that jazz'...and then some!,6,23 September 2008,"'Chicago' is one of those films that, while not my favorite, captivates me from start to finish every time I sit down to watch it. It's flawlessly directed and executed, brilliantly acted and otherwise advertised and comes off as the whole package, flawless from just about every angle. Yes, some of you have mentioned that the lead actors voices aren't the greatest, and really, other than the magnificent John C. Reilly and the superb Queen Latifah the singing is below par as far as you would expect Broadway to be (Zellwegger and Gere have nothing on 2001's Kidman and McGregor). But that's not really the point, because all the glitter and glam and attitude that drips forward with every word you begin to forget the fact that these people can't really sing. I for one felt that the entire cast (Gere aside) did an outstanding job, and yes, even Gere did fine, I just felt his Billy Flynn was a bit miscast. Renee did an outstanding job as Roxie Hart, a girl dreaming of the big lights who murders her lover when he refuses to give her that. She's imprisoned for it and its there that she meets Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones in her Oscar winning role) who is currently serving time for offing her husband and sister. Through Matron 'Mamma' Morton (Queen Latifah in the role that should have given her the Oscar) Velma has been set up with hotshot lawyer Billy Flynn, the best money can buy, and Roxie wants him too. Left to pick up the bill is Roxie's loyal if not albeit naïve husband Amos (Reilly in his Oscar nominated role...great year for him by the way) who seems to be being used by everyone. The film of course revolves around the court case and Roxie's determination to work the crowd, work the judge, the jury and the world in order to not only be released of all charges but become a star. She of course has obstacles every step of the way, between Velma's jealousy, Billy's fleeting interest and her husbands growing distain. The real shining areas here are of course wrapped up in the musical numbers, the shimmer and grace that lines every word, every scene, and every number. Numbers like 'Cell Block Tango' and 'All I Care About' get the star treatment (and look wonderful) while songs like 'Mister Cellophane' and 'When You're Good to Mamma' shine brighter than the rest based on the voices alone. One of my favorite numbers though is Catherine's 'I Can't Do it Alone' just because of her sheer determination...she's wonderful. 'Chicago' arguably deserved the Oscar (I'm still on the fence) but regardless it deserved to win or not, 'Chicago' is still a brilliant musical that any fan of the Broadway play or fan of the musical in general will enjoy. Rob Marshall did deserve that Best Director Oscar, I will say that. His direction here couldn't have been better. 'Chicago' is a film that will never grow old, never grow tired and never leave my collection.",Chicago

The opening just made it better, Catherine Zeta Jones takes ownership of the film with the opening number.Renee Zelwegger worked hard, but was completely out shone by both Catherina Zeta Jone and Queen Latifah, who were both fantastic.Richard Gere wasn't what I expected, but grew on me the second and third time I saw this film.The musical numbers, were staged brilliantly. I cannot praise this movie enough.Alas every movie has some downsides. Having bought and watched the DVD and hearing that the film, particularly the music numbers, were supposed to be in Roxie's imagination, I think they failed here. Further disappointment is this concept being the main reasons they cut the song 'Class' from the film, Queen Latifah deserved an extra number.But a FANTASTIC film all the same.",Chicago

The musical numbers flow well with the story, and vice-versa, so it doesn't feel like the movie is coming to a grinding halt for the sake of a song, which is the main thing about musicals that bothers me most of the time.Excellent performances on the musical side, you can tell the actors and actresses had a lot of fun making this.  But Richard Gere is severely stiff on the musical side, though does a good enough job acting.Queen Latifah's musical number really had a great Jazz-era feel to it, and is my opinion the best of all of the musical scenes.I give this 8 out of 10.",Chicago

Another thing that upsets me: Why didn't Rob Marshall win Best Director? Roman Polanski is good, don't get me wrong, but Marshall did a superb job. He also choreographed it, so he deserves some recognition.One more thing: this easily deserved Best Picture over Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.",Chicago

LES MISERABLES???)...but it's full of winning numbers.  Going into see the movie I looked forward to a few of them...ALL THAT JAZZ, CELLBLOCK TANGO, RAZZLE DAZZLE....but figured I'd be bored with the rest of the film.Was I?  Nope.  Not for a second.  The acting was pheonomanal.  The choreography was top-notch.  Overall the film is an easy 9, possibly even a 10.  This high rating comes out of how incredibly smooth the film rolls along.  The whole movie glides along, from number to number.  It makes one realize just why this show has so many Tony's under it's belt, and hopefully now some Oscars.A quick overview of the acting:  Catherine Zeta-Jones IS Velma Kelly.  She captures the glamour of that part in a way you could only hope an actress would manage to do.  Not only that, but she can sing and dance too!  So she's a triple threat!  Go Catherine Zeta-Jones!  Renee Zellwegger...what can I say about her?  She's not my favorite actress.  I honestly wasn't sure how she'd fit this role, but she proved that she could be Roxie Hart.  As for Richard Gere, he hasn't looked so handsome in years.  He carried Billy Flynn's arrogence like he was born with it himself.  His singing wasn't the best, but the acting he did manages to make up for that.  And how about that tap dance!  Great!  Queen Latifah was great as Mama Morton, fleshing out the character, bringing her to life.  And John C. Reilly was probably the most perfectly cast in the nearly invisible role of Roxie's husband Amos.  Loved his MR. CELLOPHANE.Now for the film itself.  The transition from song and dance numbers to 'real life' was done smoothly and usually was quite intricate with the numbers running at the same time as the 'real life'.  I wasn't sure how they'd handle it after seeing the show, but I think the way they did it gave the movie an excellent sense of realism about it (something you can't see on stage where they mostly focus on the song and dance.)  The film has smoke and mirrors, bright lights, color..... dancers....acrobats...got it all.
The only recommendation I would say is leave the kiddies at home.  This is not a show for them.  But for the rest of you (16 and up) it's a great show. There's a lot of laughs and the music will get your heals tapping.",Chicago
397,jansen-aui,"109 minutes of razzling, dazzling entertainment",8,20 June 2006,"Rob Marshall's feature-directing debut Chicago is the smashing, dazzling film adaptation of Bob Fosse's 1975 musical, and is a picture whose 109 minutes of fantastic and fantastical singing and dancing is never anything but wildly entertaining. From the opening number, ""All That Jazz"", you either decide to buy into the tone of the film or you don't  it's the type of sexy, polished performance that is scattered all throughout the picture. You let go of any preconceived notions or expectations from that moment on, and you're taken on an exhilarating ride through vaudeville 20's Chicago, but if you don't, it's likely that you'll take no enjoyment at all from a film that can't seem to throw any more at you.Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) is an ambitious singer, who murders her lover when she discovers that he isn't going to make her a star as he'd promised. She manages to convince her husband Amon (John C. Reilly) to take the blame for the crime but when it's revealed to him that the man is their furniture salesman, he puts two-and-two together and Roxie winds up on murderer's row in the Cook County Jail. There, Roxie meets her idol, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who's killed her husband and sister after learning about their affair, and Mama Morton (Queen Latifah), the matron of murderer's row who'll be good to you, if you're good to her (read: in cash  she even does a song-and-dance about it!). The only hope for both Roxie and Velma to avoid a hanging is the charming, charismatic lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), who's never lost a case and can achieve anything with a bit of the ""Ol' Razzle Dazzle"" in front of the media or in a courtroom (there's a number about that one, too).Director Marshall, originally a choreographer, makes the excellent decision to contain all the musical acts in Roxie's fantasies, allowing for a more stylized, fantastical world to be inhabited momentarily with all the lights and costumes of Broadway. The musical sequences are extremely effective, with well-written lyrics that propel the plot, and energetic, vigorous performances polished to perfection. Not a single member of the principle cast is a professional singer and dancer; Zeta-Jones comes closest with a dabbling in the art during her schooling years (she's indeed the most convincing  confident, sexy, and channels the established star that is Velma), but each and every one of them deliver stunning turns. They must be commended for their daring to break out of their comfort zones, Zellweger (whom we've never known as anything but a delicate, quiet girl) and Gere (who simply exudes the Clooney-like charm of Billy Flynn), in particular.Chicago is a film that will probably have no fence sitters  you'll either buy into the fantasy and love it, or you don't and you won't. I did, and I was wowed. It has its detractors as the Best Picture of 2002, and its something that must be considered outside the measures of emotional resonance, drama, or even storyline: the typical criteria. Best Picture: I'm not sure myself  but best experience: hell yes  as a whole, there was not another picture as wholly entertaining or as plain and simply fun as Chicago was that year.",Chicago

It's well shot, well played etc. Moreover - and more importantly - it has a terrfic music score and script, wonderful dances, dialogues etc.: which is hardly surprising in one of the best Broadway shows of all time. And this is the main point of my disappointment: it is a replay of the musical, but no more. Once you saw the show on Broadway (as I did) the film adds nothing to your experience except for the second-had pleasure of reliving the show highlights. And they missed a couple of scenes (probably to avoid R rating?). I imagine that this is different for those who never saw the show  - which is like 99% of moviegoers. The singing and dancing is fine - but they must have spent dozens of takes and hours of audio and video-editing to produce it - little wonder. My admiration goes to Broadway actors who have to do it almost every day and live...",Chicago
399,puckbond007,"Chicago-9/10 is a wonderful, lively and truly entertaining musical...",9,14 March 2003,"Possible SpoilersChicago is a wonderful, lively and truly entertaining musical featuring a great cast and technically is great. Chicago is set during the roaring 1920's where the city was full of corruption, scandals, murder, Al Capone, bootleggers and lots of razzle-dazzle. That is really what this film is...its all a show and its an eye-popping one at that. Renee Zellweger is great as Roxie Heart in an Oscar worthy performance as a young performer trying to get into vaudeville and have her own show. She winds up in jail after murdering her lover after she learns he has been just stringing her along with promises of getting into the music business. In jail she finds Velma Kelly played by Catherine Zeta-Jones equally impressive in a forceful performance as the established star that Roxie admires, who is also in jail for killing her adulterous husband and her sister. Roxie needs help in a clear open and shut case so she hires flamboyant and unbeatable lawyer Billy Flynn played by Richard Gere who is also terrific. A media storm is created as the trial of the century is under full scrutiny from the eager press and a town where you are only as popular as the newest news you can produce. Chicago is obviously a musical and there are plenty of amazing and wonderful musical numbers throughout the film from Velma's opening of ""All that Jazz"" to the final rousing duo beween Roxie and Velma...and in between there are plenty more even people like Richard Gere and John C. Reilly who plays Amos, Roxie's neglected and unnoticed husband get into the act of singing and dancing. Queen Latifah also has a strong presence as Mama Morton, the corrupt head of the jail and even Lucy Liu makes a fun appearance as a murdering heiress. A couple of my favorite moments was when Zellweger was a ventriliquist dummy moved and controlled by Gere...and Gere's tap-dance courtroom scene. This also brings me to another point that the film technically is a marvel...from the glorious setting of 1920's Chcago and the production design needs to be credited with the wonderful way the musical numbers are shot, edited and the lighting was amazing. Overall, Chicago is a wildly fun and entertaining movie musical that features great music and a wonderful cast especially Renee Zellweger in a great performance. One of the year's best fims...don't miss it.",Chicago

I found it was actually pretty good, with a lot of dark humor and some really dazzling choreography.  This includes a dance number with Richard Gere removing a lot of clothing. (Gasp!)

It surprises my friends and myself that I love Chicago so much I can watch it over and over without tiring of it and constantly talk about it and sing its songs (I am also not a big music person in general). The big difference between Chicago and other musicals is the fact that the songs are either legitimate performances (like on a stage at a night club) or the protagonist's (Roxie Hart, played superbly by Renee Zellwegger) interpretation of events. The songs are not repetitive, they capture the time period (the 1920s), along with the dialog and costumes and sets and props, and they will stay in your head, but you will want them to stay in your head. The dances are mesmerizing and so well-done I sometimes wonder whether the actors are doing the dancing or if robots or computer graphics are doing the dancing for them. The story is compelling and darkly hilarious. The characters are real and performed excellently. The movie-making is inspired and inspiring. Encore.",Chicago

The concept is very much like that of the movie of CABARET.  The musical numbers for the most part take place on a stage in an old theater.  There's a lot of cross-cutting during the numbers to the reality-based segments. Really brilliant editing.  After many of the numbers the audience was applauding.  They were that thrilling (the numbers, not the audience).	The acting of the musical numbers was really toned down in my opinion.  All the music was presented more as a ""number"" rather than a plot-advancing song.          Catherine Zeta-Jones was excellent.  As a theater person, I would still rather have seen someone like Bebe Neuwirth, for example.  Although I've never seen Bebe Neuwirth dance, I imagine she'd be really impressive.

Reilly-Amos Hart Queen Latifah-Matron Mamma Morton Dominic West-Fred CasleyRuntime: 113 min Certificate: 12A for sexual content and dialogue, violence and thematic elements.A Movie Interpretation of the Musical Play Chicago, written by Bob Fosse and Fred Ebb. This Movie Is a Black comedy/Crime/musical about what it takes to become a star, and what lengths some will take to become one The Movie becomes at the club ""the onnex"" where the Kelly sister is meant to be performing, but only Velma (Zeta-Jones) turns up. As Velma performs the show single handedly we see Roxie Hart (Zellweger) watching in the audience, and it becomes clear that we are watching the whole, movie through Rosie's eyes .As the show continues, we see Roxie having an affair with Fred Casley (West).Towards the end of the show we see a couple of policeman walk into the club and look straight at Velma, Velma then Finishes the song superbly and the light go out. It then cuts to Roxie and Fred and it is obviously a couple of weeks later. The two of them start to have a fight as Fred lied to her about setting her up to performs at the onnex as she wants to become a star. Just before Fred leaves, it a volatile state Roxie pulls out a gun and shots him 3 times. We later return to the scene of the crime ,where policeman and investigating the murder, and we see Amos Hart(Reilly) Taking the blame for the murder and saying that the deceased body was a burglar, but when he discovers that the body is Fred Casley he twigs that Roxie was having an affair, and gives away the whole thing. Roxie is then carted off to jail, where she meets matron mama Morton (latifah) who basically tells Roxie that if Roxie helps mama, Mamma Morton would help her. Mamma starts helping Roxie by phoning the best lawyer In town who has never lost a case, Billy Flynn (Gere), but first she has to give mama 100 bucks to make the phone call, but also Billy wanted 5000 bucks before he would even start the case .So, Amos, as he still loves Roxie tries to get the money together but only gets 2000 bucks but Billy agrees to take the case as he felt sorry for Amos. Billy was also the lawyer of Velma Kelly, and at that moment she was getting a lot of press, and was acting like a queen bee, so prior to an argument they had both had on one of Roxie's first days, it was then a race, to see who could get the most publicity, and get let free first. Roxie started to gain some popularity but lost it when another woman shot 3 people, so to get it back Roxie made up a fake story that she was pregnant. Of course Amos was over-joyed but what he didn't no was that there wasn't a kid. As Roxie's popularity grew Velma was pushed out of the limelight and even lost her trail date. As Roxie trail date grew closer, Velma decided she would have to suck up to her, if she wanted to get anything anymore, so she tried offering Roxie to take her sister place and so they could become a double act. On the day of her trail Roxie was very nervous, but she felt a bit better with the encouragement from Billy, but we she get off, or will she get hanged and what tricks has Billy got up his Sleeve. This movie shows how badly, some people want to be in show business and what extreme lengths they will go to, to get what they want. The storyline of this movie on its self, would make an okay movie, but with the added songs, it is a terrific movie. The songs are very catchy even though what they are normally singing about is quite vulgar. Also the dance number's in these songs a perfectly executed. What also makes the movie so good is the all star cast. Renee zellweger does a terrific job as Roxie and really shows, how she changed while in prison very Well. Catherine Zeta-Jones, show off her superb Dancing and singing as Velma Kelly. John c. Reilly does an incredible performance as Amos especially when he sings the sing Mr. Cellophane. Even Richard Gere pulls out his good dance moves along with his always good acting. The Only Problem with this movie is that some may find it a bit confusing at times, as sometimes when the dance numbers come up, you don't know whether they are in Roxie's imagination or they are actually happening. Altogether this Movie is rather good, and keeps the audience interested with all its twists and turns, and how the mind's work of these Murderess, That just wanted to be a star that started with a bang.",Chicago

The costumes and set totally realistic. The music is reminiscent of 1920s ragtime and vaudeville, but it has a contemporary edge to appeal to modern audiences. The musical numbers, some of which are worth watching again and again, are fantastic. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger are swanky and sexy. As for Richard Gere, after seeing him in Cotton Club, in which he plays his own instrument, it doesn't surprise me that he is so talented. In fact, all the performers are top-notch.

I liked how they cut back and forth between reality and the musical interpretation of that reality. The supporting cast was incredible, especially Queen Latifah (Mama Morton) and John C.

Catherine Zeta-Jones was wonderful. I thought she was perfectly cast.  Renee Zellweger was pretty good. Compared with everyone else, her performance wasn't as impressive. It wasn't that she didn't sing and dance well. I just think I preferred the Roxie I saw in the Broadway play.

I can't say Gere has the greatest voice, but it was right for his smarmy character. Queen Latifah was outstanding in her moment in the spotlight - too bad it was her only solo. Taye Diggs was most definitely underused (which is mainly why I rated it a 9) and so was Christine Baranski. At least Baranski had the opportunity to sing.

Fosse and Verdon are rolling over.  At the least, Reinking or Neuwirth should have been consulted re. sets, staging, cinematography, choreography, dance coaching, etc.  Certainly, the director should have selected actors, for whom dancing was a core competency.  Perhaps Zeta Jones, et.al., studied dance in their youth, but none of the main characters exhibited more than dilettante-level skills.  I wonder how many takes the actors needed, just to achieve their mediocre dance performances.  The fact that this movie won major awards and substantial public praise merely reveals how little exposure people have nowadays, to the art of the musical.

417,hhhrahulhhh,Reality? Musical? Movie?,7,30 December 2013,"Chicago.. what does one say about it? I must admit that it is perchance that I even opted to watch both the movie and the musical. The poster was my only inclination to even consider it and a cheaper ticket to the Broadway version than Spiderman the motivation to go for it.My first exposure to Broadway was refreshing and I really had not expected to enjoy the musical art form as much. That considered I was perhaps predisposed to enjoy the environment and the art than the story and that is what happened. While the plot line is pretty basic and apparently based on real life events, what finally gave depth to it was the expressiveness of the actors and an exaggerated depiction of the character flaws of society.So it made sense that the big screen version would have to be theater on a tape with enough connecting clips to be able to justify the broader resources available. I felt that the movie just did enough to entertain but you really get your money's worth with the Broadway version. Perhaps unfair to the movie, I was always drawing comparisons in all its choices with the musical. For me both Fred Casely and Amos Hart could have been better cast as the performances I witnessed in the musical were impeccable. Although Renee Zellweger was lovely as Roxie Hart. Her portrayal does bring out an adorable naivety which really endears the character of Roxie with the audience.The plot line is simple but engaging and all the sub-plots usually enforce the various choices made by Roxie in her ordeal. Her character has many aspects from innocence to seduction and her success is a depiction of the society. It is also a depiction of the reverence of the society for the claimed ""degenerate values"" such as celebrity, gossip, scandal and sex. It is interesting as to how well a musical can touch on these subjects when the audience is sensitive to such portrayals.Overall, an enjoyable watch in either format. Simple and thought provoking but for those who enjoy this form of cinema.",Chicago
418,PsychiatricPezDispenser,A fantastic stage show turned into a mediocre movie...,6,9 August 2012,"Now, I actually saw the movie first and really liked it... then I saw the stage show and realised that the movie was really very dull in comparison. Here are just a few things that they could have done to make this so-so adaption fantastic:  Not change Roxie's back story. It didn't make her any more likable.  Not settled for Renée Zellweger who is a decent singer but can't dance and clearly knew nothing about the Roxie character.  Leaving the score in tact. No Me and My Baby? Are you kidding?  Finding a woman who wouldn't say the Hungarian part in a Russian accent.  Bringing the tone down a little. They were so hung up trying to make Cell Block dynamic that they didn't give the characters any personality.  Bebe Neuwirth as Velma? I did like Catherine, but Bebe would have been a better choice. She's a sensational dancer, she's drop dead gorgeous, (at the time) she was a bigger name than Catherine, and she would have attracted and appealed to a much larger audience. If they had kept at least some of Bob Fosse/Ann Reinking's choreography, I'm sure she would have agreed to it. Overall, it was okay at best. If I were you, I wouldn't waste my money on the DVD, I would make a trip to the city to see the real show which is surprisingly very fresh considering it's been running for about 17 years.",Chicago
419,taos65,About the 1920s,10,26 February 2004,"I did not see the original 1927 silent version (yet), or the Broadway musical, just this version.  However, as a professor of 20th century U.S. history, I think that this film captures the spirit of the 1920s very well. People who don't get it might not have studied this time period in depth. The U.S. was just out of World War I, and the violence of that war (the use of bombs and torpedoes for the first time) scared the Western world into thinking that perhaps they had little time left to live it up.  Then Armistice Day (11/11/18) was supposed to be the end of all wars, and a decade-long celebration ensued (ended only by the crash of the stock market in Oct. 1929).  This is the time of Prohibition, speakeasies and rumrunners, jazz clubs and gangsters (think Al Capone, who controlled Chicago in the 1920s).  Women still were thought incapable of heinous crimes, and male chauvanism *could* well be and was exploited to the advantage of women, as most people in the U.S. held a dim view of law and order.In the midst of this celebration were the press, as liberated as the rest of society, as always a reflection of the values of its society.  And the reporter Maurine Dallas Watkins covered these stories for the Chicago Tribune.  As was the style of the day, female murderers were made into heroes, women who been done wrong, and committing a crime of passion was fashionable.  Many modern viewers may not understand that this really was true.  Go to the library and ask to see microfilm of the Chicago Tribune for 1924, read the headlines of Beulah Annan's murder trial (this is the basis for the play and musical, Chicago).  Those viewers of the modern film (or even the play) may think that the view of the prisons, court system and subject matter are either overly critical or overdone, but there was a great need to clean up corruption on every level in the 1920s.  Too bad not enough historians out there get a chance to teach about society and culture in these earlier time periods in U.S. history.To that extent, Chicago, the 2002 film, really captures 1920s Chicago and U.S. values in the most prosperous decade of the 20th century.  The costuming in the 2002 film is awesome -- Renee Zellweger has the PERFECT 1920s figure (the flappers strove for small busts - even binding their breasts to create the illusion of no bust), as the androgynist look was a must for the flapper.  Catherine Zeta-Jones, who has a gorgeous figure in the modern day, would have not been considered sexy in the 1920s but is stunning in this film.  As with some others on this database, I am not a fan of Gere's, but I am not disinclined to liking him, especially as his natural charisma makes Flynn the perfect schyster lawyer of the 1920s.  And Queen Latifah runs away with her role, too.  The entire cast is brilliant.  As Roxie isn't supposed to be a professional-caliber singer, Zellweger's own lack of professional singing background gives the character legitimacy. The rest of the cast have performed in musical theater, and Zeta-Jones was a professional dancer before she was an actor.  Gere had never tap-danced before, and again, his inexperience gives credibility to his tap-dancing lawyer (how many lawyers are professional-grade tap-dancers, besides the late-great Gregory Hines' portrayal on Will and Grace?).All in all, I think that this film is fun.  If you understand that the 1920s was a bad time in American society, one filled with violence and crime and illicit activities, then you understand why everyone in the film (except the ""innocent,"" Amos, a throw-back to the days before The Great War) is complicite in the lies and debauchery.  The music is great, really captures the mood of the 1920s.  I just showed a documentary film on the 1920s to my students earlier in the day from watching this film, and it rang true to the historical information.  That some of the costumes were updated and there are some original songs is okay to me, because all of it was meant to capture a spirit, not completely replicate the past or the stage play.",Chicago

What's not to like?Personally, I liked Catherine Zeta-Jones much better than Renee Zellweger. For the basic casting, her body type is just better for the time the script is supposed to be set in. I also think she has a better range throughout the movie where Zellweger has her moments but is otherwise flat.I wish I had something to compare this version to.

If  this chick flick wins the Oscar it will follow in the footsteps of other horrible winners like Shakespeare in Love and Titanic.",Chicago
424,Mendo,Entertaining,8,7 January 2003,"It is no 'Moulin Rouge', however 'Chicago' is still a very entertaining film. I thought the casting/acting was great, although Richard Gere seemed a little overmatched in the singing department. The fact that the musical numbers are all in Roxie's imagination threw me off for a second but I got over it. All of the musical pieces take place (primarily) on stage, so it doesn't have the same flow as other musicals in which the actors in scene break into song. Still there were a couple of numbers that had the crown applauding, and the film kept me engaged the entire time. 
Recommended for anyone who like musicals. If you don't enjoy that type of film, I don't believe that this is the movie that will convert you.",Chicago

Richard Gere can sing like a charm, Renee Zellweger is the prettiest thing since Monroe, and Catherine Zeta-Jones is stunning!  I can totally see why the Academy went nuts for it in '03.

Spectacular, Spectacular no words in my vernacular could describe Chicago's wonderment!!",Chicago
426,bluestylus,But what does it mean?,4,27 November 2004,"If you enjoy scantily clad jazz dancers, you will like this movie. If you like jazz music & dancing, you will like this movie. If you like musicals, well, you'll like this movie. If you like costumes, yes, you will enjoy this movie. If you like the 1920s, then you will enjoy this movie... And last but not least, if you like Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger, you will like this movie. Who is overlooked? The best performances were by Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly, particularly the latter. And who is the hair dresser of Renee? Give that man an award!! Kudos to Dale Brownell and Colleen Callaghan... outstandingly creative.But what of the story-line? There are spoilers here, so if you haven't seen the movie -- STOP RIGHT HERE.If you have seen the movie, here are seeds for thought. This movie is about two spoiled, selfish, white girls who get away with murder and still have their cakes and eat them too. All the while, husbands suffer, and the innocent immigrant hangs because she can't come up with the dough to pay for a sleazy lawyer to get her off.Social critique? Or misogynist bent? Even the press comes off less than pretty. The only decent character in the whole she-bang [puns intended] is the woman who didn't kill her husband and hangs for someone else's crime. The reporters, the legal system, and even the audience partake in the guilt of the guilty for adoring infamy, and dismissing nobility.Is this story the workings of someone truly brilliant? Or is it the sour bigotry of someone who can't see beyond the crescent of the landscape they're standing on? Hard to tell, but fun to wonder about.",Chicago

My viewing experience was slightly spoiled by being so close to the screen because the theater was sold-out and thus some of the quick edits caused the brain to scramble as it tried to make head-or-tail of what it was  seeing.The film had a narrative that didn't seem to be there merely as a means from getting from song to song  and timing wise is was just the right length, 20 minutes longer (2hr films seeming to be the rage these days) would have been too long.Strangely enough did anyone notice that Catherine Zeta Jones looked very much like the character she was playing in the ""Time after Time"" film within America's sweethearts",Chicago

Because they're largely unrealistic. In a typical musical, you have characters that have problems and obstacles to deal with. Then during various times, they break into a song. As much as I hate musicals, I really loved ""Chicago."" This film was beautifully directed by Rob Marshall, and it was masterfully shot and edited.

Having said that, everyone does a nice job with it. The singing and dancing are fun, it takes advantage of the fact that it can be edited (as opposed to the stage) very well, and gives us about as much as we can expect from this play without a serious re-write. About the only problem with it is that it came out *after* Moulin Rouge, which raised the bar on movie musicals. Chicago is a lot of fun but suffers in comparison to Moulin Rouge.",Chicago

Boy was I wrong. This movie may have actually been the worst film that I have ever seen in my entire life. This film is legitimate proof that The Academy can, and will, get their awards really, really wrong sometimes. I admit that this film, probably, did have the best sound in 2002, and maybe the best editing, and just barely the best set decoration, but costume design should have been awarded to The Pianist, LOTR, or Gangs of New York. Best supporting actress did not have the strongest crop of nominees that year, but Queen Latifah did a much, much better job of acting than Catherine Zeta-Jones did. In fact the only two actors in this film who actually deserved their nominations were Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly, because all of the other actors over-acted SO badly in this movie it was almost laughable. The only convincing thing about Renée Zellweger's performance was when she shoots the guy in the first 5-10 minutes and is crying and calling him names. Catherine Zeta-Jones didn't use facial expression at all in the film and that was probably the director's fault and not hers. The music and dance numbers were fine but everything else plain-old SUCKED!!!",Chicago
437,owenmul,The best musical I have seen,10,27 March 2015,"This film is amazing, it deserved all the Awards it was given and more (Especially Richard Gere and Renée Zellweger who were stumped at the Oscars).The characters are all so vibrant, sleazy and fascinating; making every single scene as memorable as the last. There are too many to choose from but the two stand out performances were Richard Gere' sleazy lawyer Billie Flynn and Renée Zellweger's ditsy murderess Roxie Hart. The props have to go out to all of the actors though; who flawlessly performed the musical numbers with flawless passion which never got boring and never ceased to entertain.The cinematography and editing in this film is without a doubt some of the best I have seen in a while, the quick switches between real world encounter and Broadway-esque performances are amazing and really help to bring the musical numbers to life. The contrast between scenes helps to highlight this, for example the transition from bleak courtroom to the vibrant colours of Richard Gere's dance number on stage. For once this is a film that's vibrant colours and effects do not deteriorate the scene itself, which is what films such as 2013′s Great Gatsby failed to do. (I still love that film regardless) The script is amazing as well, it managed to weave together sleaze, comedy, drama and satire into one overwhelming spectacle, the tightly woven musical numbers escalate the story and take the film to new heights. The satire about America's obsession with the cult of celebrity and the media circus that is stirred by opportunistic lawyers and the press is razor-sharp and very relevant (It is quite reminiscent of films such as Natural Born Killers and Gone Girl) In conclusion, this film is a spectacle and even better yet one that is not drowned down by the glitz and glamour and carefully weaves it into the ever so interesting storyline.More Reviews at: http://12yearsacinephile.tumblr.com/",Chicago
438,sseidne1,Musicals are Back!,10,11 January 2003,"Don't walk - run and see ""Chicago"". All of the memorable numbers from the Broadway show are there. It is not Reinking and Neuworth but it is just fine. I couldn't wait for the next musical number. All of the leads (as well as the supporting cast) were thoroughly enjoyable. After the credits started to roll, most of the audience remained in their seats waiting for more. A small complaint is the closeups and coverage of the dance numbers. Dance numbers are meant to be seen as a whole. Many times the camera was just too close. Fred Astaire was right in insisting on full body shots. That is not as high tech but you get the full scope of the dance action. It as amazing how the camera just loves Catherine Zeta-Jones. You can't take your eyes off her. Tell your friends - get them all to see ""Chicago"".",Chicago
439,Princess5363,strangly addictive,5,2 March 2003,"Okay, I just got back from the movie after seeing it for the third time. I saw the original on Broadway and was not impressed with themovie the first time I saw it.  I thought the acts didn't add up to thegenuine talent in the Broadway performance.  Weeks went by and Icouldn't get the songs out of my head.  I downloaded all the songsfrom both the real musical and the movie and compared them.  Imust admit that the singing is better in the movie.  The movie is put together in a way that one can actuallyunderstand the plot, whereas the only thing I remember about theBroadway show was the dancing.  The costumes are gorgeousand I love the Roxie number where she's dancing in front of themirrors.  True this movie is no Singing in the Rain, but it stillmanages to stick in ones mind long after seeing it.   Thetransitions from the scenes to the different numbers were doneexceptionally well, especially in Cell Block Tango.  The moviedefinitely deserves the Oscar for Best Cinematography.As for the acting, I don't know why everyone is panning Renee'sperformance saying she was too innocent or cute.  I saw the moviethree times and couldn't find an argument to support that.Catherine Zeta did a very good job playing Velma, but I don't thinkit's quite worth the Oscar.  Velma doesn't really have a big enoughpart or the character depth for that.  I liked Richard Gere andQueen Latifah (even though I can't understand why her giganticboobs had to be falling out of her dress during her ""When You'reGood to Mama"" number.  As for John C. Reily, I honestly don'tunderstand why he's getting an Oscar nomination.  Maybe it wassympathy for his character (he did a really good job making youfeel bad for him, but not worth an Oscar).My one MAJOR CRITICISM= all of the anorexic dancers.  It mademe sick to my stomach a lot of the time to see all those rib cagesprotruding out like the dancers hadn't eaten in weeks.  I thought itwas really unnecessary and somewhat gross to see all thosebones sticking out, even in a society obsessed with being thin.  Itdistracted me a lot.  The actresses in musicals from the pastweren't that thin (either that or they weren't showing it off soobviously).Overall, I strongly recommend you see the movie.  You might justend up like me, going back to see it over and over and over again...(10/10)",Chicago

Itisn't touching or poigniant or special, just fun and full of peoplewho surprise the viewer by being good at singing. I think this film'spopularity is more a result of Hollywood types loving that otherHollywood types because they can sing and dance. Had this beencast with real dancers and real singers, even if they turned inbetter performances, it wouldn't even make ripples. K. Zeta Joneshowever, looks simply amazing. Best picture for 2002?

441,xphile_621,Moulin Rouge -- eat your heart out...,10,20 January 2003,"This was by far the best musical I have ever seen.  And being an 18-year-old male, I am a very tough critic when it comes to movies like this one. Previously, I liked Moulin Rouge best, but Chicago surpasses it a hundred times over.  Chicago centers around the life of a young wannabe jazz singer, Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger).  When she is promised the deal of a lifetime by a man she is cheating on her husband with and he backs out of the deal, she shoots him.  When she is sent to ""Murderess Row"", she encounters the formerly famous jazz singer Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones).  Richard Gere plays a greedy lawyer who always wins his case and helps make Roxie famous like she wants to be with all of the trial publicity.   The best musical numbers were ""Cell Block Tango"", ""When Your Good to Mama"" (performed by Queen Latifah), and Richard Gere's ""Razzle Dazzle"".  With an all-star cast, a great script, and a wonderful soundtrack, Chicago is likely to go all the way and win at the Academy.  5 out of 5 stars!",Chicago
442,grotchly,How did I get conned into seeing this?,1,21 February 2003,No likeable characters.  Plot was dull.  Dancing seemed more like the smoke and mirrors of fast-paced editing.

Jones was the best singer of them all and that's not saying much.I'd rather see a double feature of Glitter and Joe Dirt before seeing this again.How could it get so many nominations???

POW",10,1 January 2003,"From the moment Taye Diggs as The Band Leader starts his set, and we are thrown into the scandalous world of ""The Onyx"", you fall in love with ""Chicago"".  The few comments I have heard or seen that are not positive, are often from people who are too hung up on the original stage production, and are too busy pointing out differences in the two, to really enjoy the movie. Casting was superbly done, and I even found myself liking Richard Gere as Billy Flynn, a choice I originally believed would kill this film.  Renee Zellwegger is absolutely amazing, and genuinely believable as sexy saucy jazz killer Roxie.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is the ideal Velma, and her voice has a robust, forceful zest, that was quite a surprise.  Queen Latifah makes a divine Mama Morton, and she breathed  new life into ""When You're Good to Mama"", a song that I never really loved before.  Amos Hart was a staggeringly well-acted character, pulled off by the always impressive John C. Reilly, and his rendition of ""Mr. Cellophane"" blew me away.The songs were all adapted well, but ""Cellblock Tango"" was nothing short of genius.  I was humming ""pop, six, squish, uh uh, sicero, lipschitz"" for hours after the movie was done.

444,darthmaus,"Even if you don't normally like musicals, this one's great",10,25 January 2003,"I've never seen the stage musical, so I don't have any opinion as to how well it was adapted from the stage medium, but as a film it was fantastic.Not only is Catherine Zeta-Jones just mind-blowingly gorgeous, she can really sing. I had no idea, but apparently she used to do stage musicals before her film career took off.  Rene Zellweger delivers a believable balance of naivete and ruthlessness as Roxy Hart.  All of the performances were brilliant -- even Richard Gere, who I normally don't appreciate at all.The most remarkable thing about this movie-musical is that it does not require one to suspend one's disbelief from dizzying heights -- the one near-universal fault among musical films, I think. The story is told in two parallel modes: one being with lifelike costumes and spoken dialogue, and the other being the show tunes belted out from outrageous feathered costumes. The latter mode is subtly placed as the Roxy's-eye-view of events, and because it is in her head there is none of the usual disorienting ""...So they were singing and dancing, and now they're stabbing each other..."" disconnects that movie musicals are prone to if they're not scripted, staged, and performed smoothly. This one *is* smooth, and it's just brilliant.So even if you don't normally appreciate movie musicals, this one could have something in it for you.  It's funny, cynical, witty, and visually beautiful, and it lacks many of the unfortunate traits that can turn lesser musical films into big cheesy non-sequiturs to someone who isn't a fan of the genre.",Chicago

I guess I went into this movie hoping it would be something like Moulin Rouge, and it wasn't anywhere near as good.  The movie is too long, gets very boring, and has characters that you hate.  I can't watch a two hour movie about three main characters that are really just horrible people, because you dont care whats going to happen to them.

The movie lacked something, though. It seemed to really drag. Numbers that should have had zip and pizzaz seemed paced and somewhat flat. I especially wonder about the ""Razzle Dazzle"" number. It seemed to move at a near geriatric rate. It made me wonder if someone other than Richard Gere could have played it bigger, bolder, and at a more lively pace.I certainly enjoyed the stars chosen to headline this film, but I can't help feeling that a professional Broadway troupe would have pumped more life and spontaneous action into this production.",Chicago

Roxie gets the top criminal deffendant lawyer who never lost a case, Billy Flynn to defend her and the two hope that she doesn't hang for her crime.  Roxie also wants desperately to act on stage, like Velma Kelly was before her arrest.  So, Roxie sees everything as though it were a musical number in a cabaret.  For example, cell block tango is how roxie visions the Merry Murderesses telling her why they came to Cook County Jail.  See the movie cause it is one of the best and should be on the top 250.

449,sikobabel,"Nice try, but it's no Moulin Rouge...",6,27 August 2003,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this film.  What I got was surprisingly predictable.  It is a good looking film, with very good editing and has some outstanding singing & dancing.  But as entertainment, it falls a little flat.  The energy of this film is a polar opposite of Moulin Rouge. In this film, the energy has to come completely from the actors and performers, as stage settings can only do so much.  In Moulin Rouge, every pixel on the screen is alive and the actors have to double-time things just to keep up.  In Chicago, things are much more linear, as if the director found it impossible to sustain more than two simultaneous subplots.  It is simpler plot with characters that are much more shallow.I know that this is a stage adaptation, and the attempts to stay true to those roots are quite admirable.  But admirable attempts alone do not make for great entertainment.  The songs are simply too long for the big screen, because unlike a stage presentation, you can only see what the director wants you to see.  On a stage, you can focus on any aspect you like.  It doesn't translate well if you don't thicken the visuals up.I give this a 6 out of 10.  It might get lower but a few of the singing and dancing numbers possibly could qualify as classic scenes (especially the puppet and tap-dancing numbers).  They also managed to put Richard Gere in a role that didn't make him annoying.  However, I hardly think that this was worthy of the ""Best Picture"" Oscar.",Chicago

At least I didn't pay full bore for this. Zeta Jones nominated for an acadamy award?..for what? A USC cheerleader could do what she did. Then there was boremeister Richard Gere. He said his lines and hoofed his way to the top of my eyelids making them heavy with sleep forcing me to use straws from my overpriced coke to keep them propped open until mercifully, at long last, the credits finally crawled up the screen.I'm sorry to be so negative about this film.  But I saw what most feel is the finest musical ever filmed.. Singing In The Rain...  and Chicago is no Singing In The Rain. Furthermore Chicago should not be mentioned in the same sentence with Singing In The Rain.  Even with all its special effects and state of the art sound and technology Chicago doesn't even hold a candle to those Fred Astair-Ginger Rogers black and white flicks of the 30's and 40's.

All the main actors and singers portray their own voices, and did their own dancing. Renee Zellweger and Catherine Beda-Jones put on a display that you can rarely come by these days. Unless a man is made of concrete, not even dreams could bring out such talented beauty. That isn't to say, all the other actors didn't do a great job in this movie. You'll find real voices of actors that would amaze you, and you'd want their record. If you like music - this is it! If you like romance and passion - this is it too.

453,blowoutthecandles,Give Em' The Ol' Razzle Dazzle,10,3 June 2017,"I watch too many musicals for my own good.. Moving on:This is honestly one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. The songs are memorable and each of them unique in its own way. Sure, you can't sympathize with any of the characters apart from Amos, but the point of this movie isn't about rooting for a hero. It brings forward the ugly reality and deceit of show business: nothing is what it seems. The only way to truly enjoy it is through suspension of disbelief and just watching it for pure entertainment, not awaiting any moral lessons (there are none).All of the acting was brilliant, even the minor characters. Richard Gere as usual is snubbed by the Academy Awards, but I thought he really delivered in his role as the corrupt yet charming lawyer. Catherine Zeta Jones is beyond incredible, but I wouldn't say she stole the show because really everyone shined in their respective roles.By the way, this movie made me want to seriously consider taking dancing lessons. To call my dancing horrifying is an understatement. It's more like that bug that you know is harmless, but it's so unpleasant to look at that you just can't help but feel you want to kill it. Overall, a very exciting and intriguing film. Just don't take it too seriously. :)",Chicago
454,krajo,What Jazz?,2,16 March 2004,"I've tried to watch this movie 3 times. The first two times I couldn't make it through the first song it was so bad. I've heard plenty of great jazz singers in my time, and I think this movie does great injustice to them. The third time I managed 20 minutes, but then I realized how unbelievable the characters were and gave up. Why this movie won 6 oscars is beyond me.One more thing, a friend of mine said that it had a song that was in hungarian, but when we listened to it, it was just jibberish with a few hungarian words thrown in for good measure - sad.Let me finish by saying that I enjoyed Buffy's Once More With Feeling much, much more, for although it was roughly the same quality in singing, it was at least funny, had good actors and a story to it.",Chicago
455,Donolog,Lack of awareness of its strength and weaknesses kept it from being great,6,26 May 2003,"I remember when I saw Fantasia 2000 at the IMAX, I was very impressed and really enjoyed the new material; however, there was one thing that seemed off. It took me a while to figure it out, but what I soon realized was that it was the music. Now the sound at an IMAX theatre is generally pretty damn good, but the problem was the nature of what I was listening to. Now in case you're not familiar with the Fantasia movies, they're Disney animation set against classical music. And so here I was in the movie theatre, listening to classical music, but the problem was that I was comparing it to sitting in the Orpheum listening to the Vancouver Symphony play classical music.I remember being blown away the first time I experienced a live symphony orchestra. It was so much more alive than listening to a CD on my stereo, or hearing a live performance broadcast over a P.A. system. It wasn't until I was at the IMAX presentation of Fantasia that I realized just how spoiled I had become in listening to live classical music. It was also strange to be at an IMAX presentation, and be thinking about the technical limitations of the presentation.When turning a live musical into a feature film, it is also important to remember the limitations and the strengths of both a film and a live musical. A musical has many limitations that are overcome with film, such as being able to move from set to set and location to location. When a musical is created, it is created bearing in mind the constraints and strengths of a live presentation. Obviously all the sets have to be on the stage, special effects are limited to what can be pulled off in front of a live audience, live music adds an element of electricity, and an audience applauding after every major number adds to the overall atmosphere. Furthermore, dance routines are created from a viewpoint that they are seen from a distance and a stationary position; as opposed to a film which allows for many camera angles, close-ups, etc.And so one big question remains when turning a musical into a film: do you film a musical, or do you convert a musical into a film and film it as such. The producers of Chicago chose to do it half-way, by going from one scene that is filmed as a musical number (presented as a musical) to the next scene that is filmed as a film, where peformances are done on movie sets.I believe the film would have been much better if it had gone all the way and treated the entire film as a film. If I think of all the great musicals I've seen on screen, they've all done this. Sure the odd number can step away from the world of film into the world of musical, such as the ""Greased Lightning"" and ""Beauty School Dropout"" scenes in Grease, but the majority of the film is staged and produced as a film and not a musical that happens to be filmed.I did enjoy Chicago. It was quite entertaining, but I think it could have been much better had they remained true to the movie format. If I want to see a live musical, I'll go to a live musical.All that aside, the actors were great, the music was great, the singing was great. I was actually pleasantly surprised by Richard Gere, he owned his role and somehow didn't annoy me in a way he often does.Bottom line: 6/10",Chicago
456,castrobear,It's safe to go back to the movie musicals once again!,10,24 December 2002,"Dear Fellow Movie Buffs;Last evening I was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening of Miramax Film's movie adaptation of the Bob Fosse musical CHICAGO.When the film went into production I had my apprehensions, were they able to capture the excitement of the stage show with a cast lead by two actresses way too young to play Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly and a directed by a helmsman that had three TV movies to his credit?  Would the curse of the movie musical stand in the way of ticket buyers spending as much as $10 to see this film?  Could Richard Gere really pull it off as a song and dance man?I am pleased to let you know that it is safe to once ago go to the movies to see a musical.  Something tells me that Baz Luhrmann's success with MOULIN ROUGE has brought back this lost movie art form.CHICAGO works its magic on every level.  As a musical it won't disappoint its hard-core fan base of showtune cronies (thought I wound say Queens, didn't ya).  For the non musical moviegoer the film succeeds by keeping the story interesting and humorous, allowing the viewer to absorb the musical numbers as they are told in fantasy sequences...what a brilliant concept and wonderful achievement.Catherine Zeta Jones's Velma Kelly is hot, hot, hot with a vulnerable dash of Natalie Wood from ""Gypsy"".  Richard Gere hams it up as the flamboyant lawyer Billy Flynn whose job it is the get these dames off death row.  His rendition of ""Razzle, Dazzle Them"" received applause from a pretty jaded group of moviegoers at the screening in San Francisco.  Queen Latifa plays prison matron Momma Morton to the hilt and should receive a much deserved supporting Oscar nomination for her brassy performance.  The movie however belongs to the amazing Renée Zellweger who plays Roxie Hart with the kind of passion that light's the screen on fire.  After Uncle Oscar so poorly chose to overlook her performance in NURSE BETTY with a nomination, the race is on for the Best Actress of 2002 with front-runners Zellweger, Julianne Moore (Far From Heaven) and Nichole Kidman (The Hours).When you go to see CHICAGO which opens December 27, sit though the end credits.  There is a brand new song composed by CHICAGO's musical author's Fred Ebb and John Kander and a special dedication that reflects the studio and director's respect for those that paved the way before themThanks for letting me rant and rave about CHICAGO.  I saw the show opening night on Broadway, back in the stone age's (1975) with Gwen Verdon, Chita Rivera and Jerry Orbache, I was also in the audience when it was reinvented with Bebe Neuwirth, James Naughton and Ann Reinking.So, over the past 25 years I have finally come full circle with this wonderful show that once stood in the shadows of another great musical, A CHORUS LINE. Ironically, it was that show that signaled the official death to the movie musical until last",Chicago
457,pourleschiens,"artificial, superficial- is it OK to have flaws if you don't consider them flaws?",5,9 November 2007,"The 5 rating is a compromise. As a certain sort of film, it's a 10. It's well-made, fun, flashy, all that other crap.But let's look further into this, to find the way in which the film is also a 1.What is the movie's sell? What does it offer, why does it exist? Well, it features singing. By singers? No, by actors. Are the songs good? Some of the standards are all right, but some songs are immediately forgettable. What else does the picture offer? Dancing. By dancers? No, by actors. Is the dancing good? Some seems all right. Nothing earth-shaking, nothing too difficult or memorable. What ELSE does the picture offer? Style, wit, and sex appeal. And how does it fare on those fronts? Pretty poorly, to be honest. It's never quite as stylish as it thinks it is, never so witty or charming or ingratiating as it thinks it is, and as for being sexy- once past the opening number by Zeta-Jones, there's scarcely a sexy scene in the picture.What we have here then is a film filled with actors in which precious little acting is required, a story with no characters, a musical told too much with music, and a lead actress so unattractive, physically and otherwise, that all a viewer wants is for Zeta-Jones to somehow hijack the film. When Lucy Liu, in a wonderful cameo, momentarily becomes the center of attention, I was thrilled- at last, no more watching Zellwegger try to seem sexy or interesting- but it was a false alarm, and the 'wegger was soon back in charge.So you see there are some problems. It's such a vacuous film. It's such a vacuous TYPE of film- and I don't mean all musicals, necessarily, though they do tend to that. But there is no there there. Film can tell a story- this hardly qualifies as having done that. Film can inspire our awe with great visuals, great music, or a perfect mixture of the two- this does not do that, though I am sure some would argue it intended to. Film can elicit our empathy- but not this one, where there is no emotion whatever, nor was meant to be. Or- last and perhaps, but not necessarily, least, film can serve merely as another sort of art, filmed- musical performance, dance, and so on. But as I said, these aren't dancers, but actors- not singers, but actors- and so however good the songs and choreography might have been (and they are hit-or-miss), they could never have been good enough to merit their being filmed, due to their being done by people not especially gifted in those arts.So. What we have is an empty, pointless film, not even as FUN as it should have been (for in the end this film has no claim to any purpose but to have been fun for the viewer), yet extraordinarily well-made along certain lines, and for certain undemanding, unreflective viewers.I did enjoy some of the acts and actors and elements, anyway. Reilly and Gere were very good. Zeta-Jones for all her beauty was mis-used and under-used, though that opening number is dazzling. Reilly's Mr Cellophane bit and Gere's press conference and courtroom numbers were wonderful. Still many of the numbers fell flat, worst of all the one with all the women prisoners singing about their crimes- just bad, badly done, and boring. As I go on I'm wondering where those five stars are coming from- there's just a certain quality to the production, I guess- and what I admire about it I admire truly- but on principle I would've been bound to disapprove of so empty a film, even if it had been ten times better, which this wasn't.",Chicago
458,sdlewis-3,A Little Song and A Little Dance,9,2 June 2009,"Chicago, the Broadway musical turned Oscar-winning motion picture, follows the story of Roxie Hart, a young woman striving for stardom but finding instead the inside of a prison cell after being accused of murder. While imprisoned, she befriends a number of fellow murderesses as well as a slick defense attorney who tries to showboat her way out of a death sentence. In so doing, Roxie becomes a sort of celebrity around Chicago, much to the chagrin of the other inmates also looking for a path off death row. As with any musical, incredible song and dance routines depict the story, keeping what could be a wholly depressing tale light-hearted and comedic. The film garnered both critical and public success, riding its sensation to six Academy Awards, including best picture of the year.Aside from the storyline and the strong performances by lead actresses Renée Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones, the film succeeds as a musical portrayal through its use of song and dance. By telling the story through musical numbers, the film stays true to its Broadway predecessor. However, these numbers do not only tell the story; rather, they help to add a distinct tone, ranging from comedy to pure sensuality, to the overall production. These elements create a truly distinct experience when it comes to recent cinema.From the start, the film bleeds sexuality, opening with Zeta-Jones singing ""All That Jazz."" As she parades around the stage, she constantly finds herself intertwined with the dozens of men dancing alongside her. She presents a supposedly lustful image for the club's patrons and for the audience itself. Later in the film, after Roxie has been taken to jail, she meets the other women on death row as they perform the ""Cell Block Tango."" If the opening number could be described as sensual, this song blows it out of the water. Each woman tells the story of the man they killed, all the while repeating that each man deserved his fate. In a way, they use their sexuality to plead with the audience to believe their side of the story.At the same time, some of the musical interludes help add comedy to the production as a whole. Although most of the songs can be considered comedic in some way or form, the two most obvious examples both come from Richard Gere, who portrays the attorney Billy Flynn. In the songs ""All I Care About Is Love"" and ""Razzle Dazzle,"" he does not do much of the dancing himself, but his background dancers help to add humor to the topics he satirizes. In the case of Chicago, simply saying some of these things would no create nearly as humorous a situation as it can through song and dance. Even the way that the dancers move around the screen seems to add to the absurdity.Throughout the film's entirety, the characters portray an entertaining tale fit for both the stage and the silver screen. It can be quite a spectacle to watch the drama and the comedy unfold through such a medium. The film uses all the qualities of an award-winning Broadway musical to create a similar atmosphere and feel so the audience does not lose any of the interpretation. Through the use of song and dance, viewers can visualize the entire storyline in a different and more entertaining light, and Chicago uses these elements effectively. Even the film's tagline states, ""With the right song and dance, you can get away with murder."" Chicago excels as a result and makes for an extremely enjoyable experience.",Chicago
459,molefsky,Hypnotic,7,6 April 2003,"The heartwarming story of schemers who get away with murder. Set in 1920s Chicago, the film is populated with some of the most despicable characters you will ever see on screen. Richard Gere, playing shyster Billy Flynn, steals the film. He sings, he dances, he smirks, he connives. Gere looks like he was having a lot of fun with the part. Queen Latifah, playning prison matron Mama Morton, is surprisingly good. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zelweger were amazing as singer/dancer Velma Kelly and performer wannbe Roxie Hart.The music, the singing, the lights are hypnotic. I could not take my eyes off the screen. Unlike a lot of musicals, the song and dances blend right into the plot and show us what the characters are thinking.On one level the story is a cynical, satirical look at the criminal justice system. On another level it is fun. Go see it.",Chicago

""Chicago"" was by far the most entertaining movie I've ever seen, period. I found myself tapping my feet and bobbing my head to the great music. The plot was average, at best. But the acting carried this movie. And when I found out that each of the actors/actresses sang their own songs, I was even more impressed. Oscars all around!!! 10 out of 10.",Chicago
461,sablauet,"It's not ""Singing In The Rain"", but it's still a hell of a movie.",9,11 March 2003,"Well I finally saw the film that everyone says is going to clean up at Oscar time, and with events in the world being what they are, I'd say a good musical would pretty much be a shoe in, and this IS a good musical.  I was a big fan of the broadway show and was excited to hear they were planning on turning it into a movie, though that was four or five years ago.  Now that it has at last arrived the first thing that jumps out is that it really has been reinvented, the Bob Fosse trademark bowler hat, gloves... are no more, but it is, in true Fosse fashion, very sexy, and smart, and entertaining. Interestingly enough, when I think of great musicals, I think of great DANCERS, and long camera takes that let them really show their stuff, obviously Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly's Singing In The Rain is the mother of all these.  This film cast really good ACTORS that managed to do some decent dancing, helped along by none stop editing.  Richard Gere is certainly no Gene Kelly...  So this movie was less about showing off great dance talent and more about, well just being a damn good movie.  Certainly characters were far better fleshed out, and there was plenty of technical razzel dazzel that infused the whole thing with a wonderful energy, and it never hurts to surround the leads with countless hot looking babes.  So much for the old formula.  Though if you are looking for the whole package, the very best in singing, dancing and powerhouse acting, rent Fosse's ""ALL THAT JAZZ""!",Chicago
462,santiarango94,Not only that this doesn't deserve it's awards....,6,6 April 2010,"(This review contains spoilers)I was expecting more than ever from Chicago, knowing that it competed for the best picture Oscar with my two favorite films The Pianist and gangs of New York. And we cannot forget the lord of the rings as well. I could not understand how a musical could be better than the Palme d or winner or a historic film. I hate musicals and one of the worst movies I've watched is Moulin Rouge. Musicals use to be annoying with too much songs and they are not serious enough to talk about society in a good way. This is were I expected Chicago to reach. Unfortunately this film didn't fill the blank and could not make me have a different view of musical genre. The film had some positive details in acting and set decoration, but it was too much filled with songs that were very poor on their lyrics (the clear example is all that jazz). Chicago didn't show morality on it's plot or it was simply on the knees of the pianist or gangs of new York. This film is not that deep on history or human values as it's fellow nominees, it hadn't as good music as the pianist had, and didn't make you be impressed for it's violence as ""Gangs"". Chicago was too brief, too superficial on it's theme. The time used on singing the singing was very long that the ending looked to me very fast enough to say that this film did not deserve to win the BP Oscar.",Chicago
463,vman13,The most energy pact 2 hours at the theatres,9,8 May 2003,"Say what you like about this film, but most will have to admit that this is a wonderfully directed film. Making the musical numbers figmants of Roxie Hart's(Zellweger) is an ingenius premise. Why didn't anyone think of it before. It's the first musical to actually make sense. In fact, it's alot less of a musical, but a movie with alot of music in it. Moulin Rouge wishes it could have been as good as this. What I loved most about the film was that it was able to capture the energy of an actual Broadway performance. The energy absolutely jumps out at the audience. I almost wanted to stand up a clap at the end of every musical number!!! I can't wait till the DVD comes out.",Chicago
464,cory_j_adams,"Song, Dance, and All That Jazz",9,27 February 2011,"I first saw Chicago in August of 2010 and I didn't know what to expect from it. I had never seen the original musical and I only heard that it was good from people who told me so I rented thinking lets give it a shot. I have to say, I was exceptionally pleased with what I saw. All the songs and musical numbers were filmed perfectly and the performances were absolutely amazing.My first impression of this film was that it was a satire, which it is, and I don't think I've seen to many satirical musicals. When I heard the plot I didn't think it was going to be that great and I wondered how this had become a smash hit musical. After a while, I realized that the plot was the reason it had become a smash hit on Broadway.As I said what really drew to the film was the music and the performances. ""All That Jazz"" is one of my favorite songs and I hadn't realized that at the moment that it had come from this film. ""Cell Block Tango"", ""Razzle Dazzle"", and ""Nowadays"" is also on my top 100 songs list from this movie.Then there's the performances and I all I had to do was watch the opening number and Catherine Zeta-Jones had a 10 for her performance. I think we can all agree that Catherine's performance was by far the best. I could not have seen anyone else as Velma but her. Renee Zellweger also gave an equal as Roxie Hart, the star of the movie. Her transformation from a timid, soft-spoken housewife to an outrageous vaudeville was absolutely priceless. Richard Gere played the perfect Billy Flynn: He was slick and cool all the way to the end. How he didn't win an Oscar or even get a nomination still eludes me. Queen Latifah showed a side I hadn't seen coming. I knew her from being a famous rapper, now I only see her as Matron Mama Morton. All in all, this film is spectacular and deserved to win Best Picture that year. Rob Marshall delivered a masterpiece and I can't wait to see what he will do next.",Chicago

Chicago is nothing like Moulin Rouge.Although there were some moments of genius, two of the song and dance numbers. The first being when Renee's character pretends to be a wooden puppet with Gere's character pulling her strings and talking for her, and the second being the number done by the female inmates about why they were in jail.Other than that I could have lived without ever seeing it and was sorry that I rushed to the Theatre after it started winning awards just to make sure I didn't repeat my mistake with Moulin Rouge.I will say that my opinion seems to differ from most of my friends that I introduced Moulin Rouge too, the likewise fell madly in love with Chicago, but for me it just didn't quite cut it.",Chicago

NOTE TO PARENTS: Please be aware that just because its jazz doesn't mean it clean. There are some racy scenes to watch out for.Plot and story line? Ya...that's my only complaint. It wasn't bad, but you can see some flaws. In the beginning it took a while to get the movie going. It wasn't til the part Richard Gere's character came in that I actually started to get fully interested. But once it gets going, the movie is a blast. Just a lot of build up, that's all.

And as a man, the idea of women murdering their partners just didn't appeal to me.But Chicago isn't your typical Hollywood bloodbath. The violence is surreal and after seeing the movie, I'm sure you'll agree, you remember more about the characters than their heinous acts of violence.Chicago takes a cast of actors, none of whom I previously liked at all, and somehow makes them all very likable.When I heard that Richard Gere was in this film, I immediately thought ""chick flick"". But Chicago also has a lot of sex appeal, enough to keep any man glued to the screen.And who would have ever thought Queen Latifah could contribute so much to the strength of any film? I surely didn't. But she does, and she is surprisingly good in the role of Big Mama.Chicago has just the right blend of music to make this movie magical. Maybe it's the way they combined memorable songs with witty one-liners. Or maybe it's the fact that some of the music reminded me of one of my all-time favorites, Annie. Whatever it was, I enjoyed this movie and think most other viewers will too.",Chicago
469,jeremyscholes1200,Jones & Zellweger top class in the windy city,8,30 August 2005,"Just seen Chicago after originally seeing it in the cinema when it was released and the sheer quality of the production still hits home. The staging, costumes and music are of the highest class and this is matched by great performances throughout the production.Those who only know Catherine Zeta Jones as a celebrity wife and Hollywood actress might be surprised to know she was a stage musical singer in the UK before she hit the big time and has also released records. Her voice, dancing and overall personality impact here is huge and she was a perfect choice to take on the role of Velma Kelly.Renee Zellweger's musical antecedents are less known to me but she puts up a fine performance here. The ventriloquist scene with Billy Flynn is brilliant and she holds her own in all the musical sequences as well as showing brilliant timing and nuances with the comedy aspects.I was also aware that Richard Gere had been a stage hoofer some time in his past but his performance here was also a revelation. His voice was a little weedy in all reality but his dancing and demeanour as the lawyer/showman Flynn was spot on.John C Reilly also gives an excellent performance as Roxy Hart's ineffectual husband Amos and the scenes between him and Flynn are masterpieces of comedy and pathos combined.Mention also should be made of the entire dancing and singing troupe in this show as they keep up the high standards set by the name cast.In summary a great translation of Kander & Ebb's musical to the screen. Best seen on the big screen but given that that chance has now gone then pick it up on video or DVD. If you like screen musicals this is one of the very best.",Chicago

472,Ed-217,takes us on a journey through the musical fantasy world of Roxie Hart,9,27 February 2003,"CHICAGO Directed by Rob Marshall Starring Richard Gere and Renée ZellwegerThis ""Golden Globe Award"" winning movie takes us on a journey through the musical fantasy world of Roxie Hart during the Chicago of the 1930s where the tabloids made you or broke you.  The reality of that world was not as much fun as the musical fantasies that will bring you back to see this movie again and again. Chicago was nominated for the most academy awards at 13 ... and we will find out if it wins the Oscar for the Best Movie of the Year on March 23rd. Whether it wins or not, one thing is for sure, it is definitely one of the best film musicals in many years.As Billy Flynn [Richard Gere] tells us: ""The world is a circus....""  and he is one of the ring leaders as he razzles and dazzles us as lawyer to the celebrity of the moment.  He even tap dances.... as well as doing great as a song and dance man.  Winning is the principal thing in life to him with ethics, integrity and principles of far less importance.  Yes.. Lawyer Flynn would have been very comfortable in our contemporary society.  :-) 
Now I see why so many people have told me that they have seen it more than once.  The first time for the story.  The other times to further relish the delightful musical numbers.Little did our aspiring Roxie Hart ever dream that the actress that portrayed her on the screen one day [Renée Zellweger] would have an excellent chance to win the Oscar for Best Actress of the year.  She already has won a Best Actress ""Golden Globe Award.""  She was exceptional in this movie and surely deserves it.

473,Taxi-4,Sensational in Every Way,10,10 January 2003,"This film was obviously heavily influenced by the Liza Minelli Cabaret, but it goes it many steps better: the screenplay (Bill Condon) is more muscular and imaginative, the editing is stunning, and there is no one on this planet like Catherine Zeta Jones.  To be that beautiful and talented, well it's just unfair but you can only gaze in wonder and appreciation.  Gere, too, seems completely in his element (He can really sing!) and even though I kept thinking to myself, ""Who else could have played this role?"" while watching Rene Zellwegger, she has a lovely voice and was still more than serviceable as a dancer. (Too bad they had to put her in that Marilyn Monroe garb, however; the comparison is unfair.) It's hard with a musical to know just who to give credit to, but given that Rob Marshall both directed and choreographed it I think we can start right there. Bob Fosse's shoes are big ones to try to fill, but the dancing is brilliant, and the direction fluid and kinetic at the same time.  Yes, I've heard comments that the editing was too jagged, you couldn't look at the dancers for long enough, etc.  To some extent this is true, but let's remember they were directing this film to a public that has just come off the almost epilepsy-inducing short cuts of Moulin Rouge. This editing in this film is much more judicious, in my opinion.  The only place where I could have used longer dance shots were with Zeta Jones, who is so clearly a great dancer I would have enjoyed seeing what she can do, unassisted.",Chicago

In some, it did.  Visually, the piece is stunning - walking a fine line between its theatrical trappings and the celluloid world of film.  Any strange idiosyncracies it showed were almost completely wiped out by the musical numbers.  The staging and choreography of the musical numbers was brilliant, and are unmatched in the world of movie musicals, in my opinion.""Both Reached For The Gun,"" in particular, features some of the most insightful, creative staging I've ever seen in a movie musical.  Bob Fosse's movie take on another Kander and Ebb musical, ""Cabaret,"" was wise enough to move the songs to the stage of the cabaret... nothing was done as a book song: only presentationally.  ""Chicago"" followed the same sort of approach, only in addition to the songs done onstage, there are several songs which take place in Roxie's imagination, albeit mostly with a theatrical, ""onstage"" presentation.  This proved very effective, as did the split stagings of action and counterpoint.The ""Cell Block Tango"" was another fine number in the movie, albeit one that didn't maintain its energy throughout.  By the time we got to Lipschitz, the number was tired and overdone.  Not that there weren't some odd bits... for example, cutting ""Class"" out of the movie was the wrong decision.  And casting a female (even the wonderful, fabulous Christine Baranski) as Mary Sunshine, and completely omitting ""Little Bit of Good""?  Sinful.Richard Gere proved to be a rather surprisingly good Billy Flynn, and Catherine Zeta-Jones was fabulous, as always, in the role of Velma Kelly. Roxie Hart could have been better cast than Renee Zellwegger... rather than a sultry, seductive vixen of the stage, Zellwegger portrays Roxie as a whiny bee-sting victim.  And she lacks the charisma and moxie to pull off a role of this caliber.All told, however, the movie does a fine job with what I consider to be a rather weak musical.  Kudos.",Chicago

But I'm _shocked_ that Chicago is being treated as even a _good_ movie (let alone receiving so many awards). The story is laughably absent (which doesn't make it a bad movie); the characters are either 1-dimensional (at best) or inconsistent (RZ's character is savvy enough to come up with the pregnancy angle, but too dumb to realize that she can't get extra blankets on death row); the dancing is passable (so many quick cuts gave me the impression that the actresses weren't actually dancing their own steps, like in Flashdance); the music was, well, spotty. The only salvation of the film was (gasp!) Richard Gere - the only person who looked like he was having fun. RZ looked like she had been taking diet lessons from Whitney Houston, and was painful to see in clingy clothes. CZJ, on the other hand, apparently didn't mind that she looked like a linebacker standing next to her. I'm no scholar on 20's era sexuality, but something tells me that neither of these two ""dames"" were terribly attractive then (let alone now).Moulin Rouge at least recognized that, without creativity, the musical has become a sleepy formula (news that was apparently lost on Chicago).

I was right and then some. You've got top-notch acting, singing, and dancing mixed up to churn out a fantastic satire on the criminal system; all this is accomplished using the main character's wild imagination as a canvas. Think Scrubs when you imagine this fantasy world, but all in a jazz entertainment setting. Real events are juxtaposed with musical numbers played simultaneously, and sometimes what actually happens can only be supposed by the number itself. Though this may sound hard to swallow, it isn't at all because of the editing that seamlessly weaves the two together.I just have to mention the three main performances now: those of Richard Gere, Renee Zellweger, and Catherine Zeta-Jones.Renee Zellweger plays Roxie Hart, and her biggest strength has to be her ability to transition from nervous housewife stepping out on her husband to aspiring celebrity not caring who she steps on to achieve stardom. Her burning desire to be famous is apparent throughout, and is one of her obvious trademarks by the time you finish the number ""Roxie."" Catherine Zeta-Jones is Velma Kelly, who plugs her husband and her sister. Roxie eventually steals all her thunder and publicity, and she reacts according to the jealous but resourceful murderess she is. You get the feeling that she's a bit underused after you're done watching, but probably only because she's the best singer and dancer in the cast. This is about all I have to say, because her songs and scenes simply could not have been done better by anyone else.Richard Gere is Velma and Roxie's connection to the outside world and to their publicity as the lawyer that takes both their cases. He's simply the best sleazy and smooth-talking individual I've seen since Michael Caine in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. His numbers are some of the funniest in the movie, especially ""Razzle Dazzle 'Em."" As far as the dialogue goes, it's very witty and never takes itself too seriously. The same goes for the whole movie, really. Some of the more minor characters, namely Mama Morton and Amos are equally up to their tasks and respective numbers. Amos (John C. Reilly) is the perfect honest but dumb husband of Roxie, and Mama (Queen Latifah) is a great prison warden who does people small favors for a few bucks under the table.All in all this is the best musical in many years. See it now if you haven't already, as it has tremendous reviewing potential.",Chicago

But I guess its typically Hollywood to force a happy ending.The fun parts were done very well, but the occasional drama was not very convincing. The movie never really touched me.

481,Scottfeinberg,"All the pieces come together: New Director, Unexpected Stars, and (You guessed it) All that Jazz!",10,30 September 2003,"To me, ""Chicago"" is, to a degree, the modern day ""Casablanca"" in terms of how it beat the odds of a strange production to become a fan favorite and Best Picture winner. Marshall came from Broadway to work under the Steinbrenner of the industry, Harvey Weinstein, and not only didn't crumble, but thrived. Reports are that he did come close to a breakdown on the set after working unbelievable hours, but he never once lost the respect of the multiple established stars who also put their careers on the line to try to beat thirty-five years of odds and make an award-winning musical. Zeta-Jones, who may very well be the highlight of the movie, is one of the most beautiful women that Hollywood has ever known, and she brought her childhood talent of singing and dancing to the national stage for the first time in this production. But it was her co-stars, Zellweger, Gere, and Reilly, who had no musical background, who most impress--if for no other reason than because you would never guess they were new at it had it not been broadcast so often in praise. Though producer Martin Richards often did when Chicago was picking up award after award, I will not forget to compliment the long-talented singer Queen Latifah, who stepped into the medium of acting full-force in a fine role, picked up an Oscar nod, and kickstarted what promises to be a solid, comedic second career. All in all, the movie succeeded in appealing to a broad spectrum of viewers of all ages, sexes, races, and backgrounds: As a young male, I was not supposed to go to or enjoy a movie like ""Chicago,"" but those of us who did came away very pleased with our investment. *****(A+)",Chicago

I wouldn't credit it as being the comeback of the movie musical (they said that about Moulin Rouge! and Evita also), I will credit it with being the best movie musical since Fiddler on the Roof. To start with, the performances.  Catherine Zeta-Jones was flawless, Renee made me a fan by the 2nd number, Gere was unreplacable, Queen Latifah brought soul to her character like no one else could have, John C. Reilly was amazing, and the entire ensemble pulled off roles I couldn't imagine them doing.  With these performances, you already have 7 stars, but.. The cinematography was like nothing else I've ever seen.  The shots between the cabaret and reality were seamless and it blended together into a great work of art. Lastly, tying it all together were the classic musical numbers, and Fosse-esque dancing.  The musical highlights for me included ""Funny Honey"", ""When You're Good To Mama"", ""We Both Reached For The Gun"", ""Mister Cellophane"", and ""Razzle Dazzle"". Together, this became one of the greatest movie musicals of all time.",Chicago

The hype is enormous - 13 Oscar nominations, a sweep of the Golden Globes, huge critical acclaim, etc, etc. Unfortunately, Chicago simply doesn't live up to that.Chicago has a lot of plus points - the choreography is excellent, some of the musical numbers equally so, and since that's what a musical depends on, Chicago can never be classed as a failure. But then, we come to the flaws - of which there are many. The direction, particularly in the (admittedly brief) intervals between the song and dance numbers is uninspired. Plus, I've never been much of a fan of Renee Zelwegger or Richard Gere, and this film hasn't converted me.I know I really shouldn't compare Chicago to Moulin Rouge; I know they're completely different, but it's impossible not to. And Chicago comes off much the worse in the comparison - Moulin Rouge is simply much, much better than this. I'm not damning Chicago, it's an entertaining film; I liked it, but I couldn't love it.

I don't know that I'd deem it as Best Picture, for which it won, but it's definitely interesting to see the Academy award a film for being this fun and entertaining.I was impressed with the depth of the characters and that the musical numbers added even more depth to the story and characters.  Everyone's performances, with maybe Richard Gere, were really outstanding.  I've seen most of the other films up for Oscars and I personally think that Renee should've gotten the Best Actress instead of Nicole Kidman.  Her performance showed much more range than Nicole's (not that I mind that she won, but you know how the Academy works).People at my office played the soundtrack over and over to the point that it annoyed me to not wanting to see the film.  I don't think the soundtrack is good enough to stand on its own... you REALLY need to see the film to appreciate the songs, which is a great versatile, but hooky soundtrack.I see a lot of films and altho I enjoy most of them, rarely do I use the word ""entertaining"" to describe them.  _Chicago_ is definitely one that is ENTERTAINING!",Chicago

After every song, I was tempted to stand up and clap, and after the show I turned to my friend and said, ""There's another show starting in ten minutes, why don't we get tickets for that one too?""I strongly feel that this movie deserves the thirteen Academy Award nominations it got, and that it will win Best Picture.",Chicago

Reilly, Queen Latifah, TayeDiggs Chicago is a musical film about a young woman that killed a man she was involved with, intimately. Because of this she was sent to prison, where she realized it's not like she thought it would be.Renée Zellweger stars as the young woman, Roxie Hart. Roxie dreams about making it big out on the stage, and becoming famous. She becomes infamous after using her court case to get recognition. Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is after the same goal. She too is in jail and was very well known for it, until Roxie showed up. The reason why they both are getting so much recognition while in jail is because of their lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere). He likes to represent those that he knows are going to become famed.The movie starts with Velma Kelly showing up late to perform in a show. The reason for her being late is because she caught her husband being intimate with her sister. Roxie Hart is there to see the show with her ""manager"", but they leave a little early and go back to her apartment. When he admits that there's nothing he can do to make her famous, she pulls out a gun and shoots him.Roxie's husband, Amos Hart (John C. Reilly), makes up a story for the cops, so that he could protect Roxie. But realizing what she was doing with the ""manager"" before the incident, Amos told what really happened and Roxie was sent to jail.In jail Roxie meets Matron Mama Morton (Queen Latifah), who's sort of in charge of the jail. She basically tells Roxie if you scratch her back she'll scratch yours. Through Mama Morton Roxie gets her lawyer, Billy Flynn. He was working on Velma's case, but saw more controversy in Roxie's.Flynn tells Roxie exactly what to say during interviews, and how to act, he even created a whole fake past life, and at one point Roxie decides to mention that she's pregnant. During all this the media is having a frenzy. Roxie is in every newspaper and always being talked about. Women start trying to look like her and young girls see her as a role model. She became famous after all, and all she had to do was kill some guy.All this attention makes Velma jealous, and even tries to ruin Roxie's trial. But thanks to the cleverness of Billy Flynn, he saves Roxie from having to stay in jail for a really long time.I thought this movie was great. At first I was expecting to be bored and complain during every time they break out into song and dance. But my reaction was the complete opposite; I even enjoyed the songs (especially the ""Cell Block Tango"").All of the actors put on a great performance. I thought they were just good actors before, now I think of them as a triple threat, acting singing, and dancing. John C. Reilly really surprised me with his singing ability. And I thought Richard Gere was perfect as Billy Flynn, who knew he could tap dance.Overall Chicago was a great movie.4.5 out of 5 stars",Chicago

But I think that Richard Gere and Queen Latifah deserve more credit, they probably acted the best.  The soundtrack also isn't great because without the visuals it brings out how mediocre a lot of the singing is...if you like the music I recommend purchasing the new broadway cast cd.

Renee Zellweger gives an astonishing performance as Roxie Hart, a wife longing for her place in the spotlight, but the shining star of this picture is Cathrine Zeta-Jones as Velma Kelly. Having history in musical theatre, Cathrine's performance earned her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and well deserves it.

And here was an Oscar winning musical that was all the rage.For what?  This film deserved only ONE Oscar nomination and that was for Richard Gere who stretched himself with an incredible un-Gere-esque performance.  And he wasn't nominated.Nearly every other aspect of this film was bad, bad, bad.1) Renee Zelweger - so what if she looks like nothing on earth?  She can act!  Can't she?  What?  She can't?  Ok, then she's truly good for nothing2) Catherine Zeta Jones - this woman can act (she's lost her looks though) but she is pushed into the back rows of this film with a minor supporting role3) The music - this is a musical, there have to be songs - in S of Music the songs were good , hell they were great.  Not one song in this pathetic film is catchy or good.  Not one song lasts in your head as you come out of the movie except for All that Jazz - which lasts in your head because the main line is musically out of sync and off-beat with the rest of the song!4) The plot - is quite intricate - for a 1 year old.  No harm done, we don't expect great plots in musicals.  But this one comes under the ""who gives a rats ..."" category.  It is beyond lame.5) When you get out of the theater, you find that you couldn't have cared less for any other characters - Velma, Roxy and frankly, you just wished they were all dead6) Ok, so some say that one should'nt dissect a film as long as it provided entertainment.  Fine.  This film is BORING people.  I heard that the Hours is a slow mover.  After seeing this, The Hours might be non-stop, edge-of-your-seat action that never lets up!Just when I would start getting into the dialogue, they fade reality into a pathetically low-beat, dull, unattractive song made even more unattractive by Zelweger who looks like troll.The Oscars have fallen from grace over the past 20 odd years and this is truly the final nail in its coffin.Btw, I had a friend who saw it in England who walked out of it in 5 minutes. If you want to torture someone, or lure them into a coma or get even with someone who did something to you once, then CHICAGO is the movie for them.And if in the highly, highly, highly unlikely event that the Oscar was awarded to the truly best picture, then this is THE worst year in movie history.Shardik",Chicago

Despite remarks to the contrary, the dancing by Zeta-Jones is excellent, as expected from her West End days; Zellweger, a little less so, but still very good.

501,jamietalon,Undoubtedly the best musical I've ever seen.,8,30 March 2008,"""If you can't be famous, be infamous."" Chicago is an unusual comedy - it draws humor from a courthouse with dirt, blood, and dirty shame spilled all over it. Rob Marshall revives this Tony Award-winning stage musical and transforms it into a movie that made history by winning a prestigious Academy Award (and a Golden Globe too!) for Best Motion Picture of the Year, proving that movie musicals are still alive and kicking in Hollywood and had never lost its appeal to their audiences.Catherine Zeta-Jones gives a dazzling entrance as the bob-haired, stupefying chanteuse, Velma Kelly, with her ""All That Jazz"" act starting off the movie with a head-turning blast.But here comes trouble-posing Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger), a star-strucked dreamer who's battling it out for a chance to dance and sing on-stage, who eventually lands in jail with her idol Velma Kelly for separate murder charges under the care of the laid-back Matron ""Mama"" Morton (Queen Latifah).Now for our third act, here comes the immodest, triumphant, all-he-cares-about-is-love attorney, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) who sparks up the vie between the two murderesses. Inspired by the loyalty of Roxie's husband, Amos (John C. Reilly), Billy, with all the attention coming from the media, opens the gates to fame for Roxie Hart, posing her as ""the sweetest lady in Chicago ever accused of murder,"" overshadowing the famous Velma Kelly.But the clever, persistent and washed-out Miss Kelly won't give way for Roxie to take all the glory. Out of desperation, she formulates a conspiracy to obliterate the new-found notoriety of Mrs. Hart for the sake of the spotlight to shine on her again.Seriously, I have no idea how to separate myself from this film. It became a habit of mine to watch this at least, two times a month? The energetic style of Rob Marshall is successful in capturing the essence emanating from stage plays and enters the eyes of its spectators with a scrumptious bedazzlement, hanging out their tongues, begging for more.The lights, the costumes, the cinematography - it all makes this title aglow with glitters and glistening sequins. The conversion of the tense aura in the courthouse into a tongue-in-cheek hilarity is a big bonus - I gotta lay some flowers in Bob Fosse's grave for that. The idea of infamy overrunning the show business also made a rouse.Now, about the soundtrack... Dammit, ALL THAT JAZZ gets me every time. Pair it up with Catherine Zeta-Jones in her black, glimmering couture and it astonishes you even more. That song is, by far, the most excellent song I've heard in a movie musical. Meanwhile, the voice of Renee Zellweger fails to tickle my ears. But I cannot imagine any other actress playing the role of Roxie other than her. The ""Nowadays"" reprise is a very good track too.The three antagonists (yes, analyze the film further and find out that Roxie, Velma and Billy are indeed, EVIL) are portrayed by actors that surely won't disappoint the fans of the stage play. Richard Gere's performance was not comparable with those of Zeta-Jones' or Zellweger's, though. But the supporting roles of John C. Reilly, Queen Latifah and Colm Feore still adds up to the hype.I RECOMMEND THIS FILM TO EVERYONE! What we have here is a rare Hollywood gem that is incessantly stepped on by many (because it snagged the Best Picture award from ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Pianist""), but, the hell we care!

I also hate movies that are hyped and hyped, get 13 Oscar nominations, when they're really mediocre.  Sure, Renee and Catherine dance and sing well--but Richard Gere's singing was a joke.  His tap-dancing was okay.  The musical numbers were silly songs but good dancing.  In any case, I am so glad other movies won in the major categories (go Pianist!). Watch Chicago if you're bored one day, but it's totally not the experience people say it is.  It's just a bunch of musical number mushed together as a film.  And the characters are paper-thin.

Velma Kelly, an ex-vaudeville performer, whom Roxie admires, has also been arrested for the murder of her husband and sister. Velma Kelly is played with fiery passion and sexiness by Catherine Zeta-Jones, who astounds in her dance/songs. Both Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart fight over the sleazy lawyer, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere). Richard Gere has an amazing tap dance and a few good numbers. Other key characters are Matron Mama Morton (Queen Latifah), Amos Hart (John C. Reilly), and Mary Sunshine (Christine Baranski).The two actors that impressed me the most were Queen Latifah, dazzling in a rare performance as a corrupt prison warden; and John C. Reilly, proving once again that he can disappear into a role entirely. His solo number Mister Cellophane, is disturbingly sad, and you feel entirely sympathetic for him.I loved the scene work, the editing, the music, the dancing, the singing, and especially the acting in this movie. It has been nominated for eight Golden Globes, and deserves every one of them.**** A+",Chicago
507,star2B13,Visionary,9,26 March 2004,"The most impressing aspect of this movie is its translation form stage to screen. Never have i seen such genius. What is beautiful on stage, would not have worked at all on screen. Chicago: the Musical is a cabaret style musical that is only for stage, so it was hard for me to imagine its translation to screen. You can imagine my surprise! Zeta-Jones was no surprise, as she is amazing in anything she does. Obviously Latifah has an amazing voice, and she was wonderful. Reily was great and truly pitiable. The two surprises were Zellweger and Gere. They both exceeded my expectations. The performances are wonderful, the creative aspects are great, this film is truly a leader in its genre.",Chicago

Much better than the play I saw in Ashland...,10,4 January 2003,"Admittedly I've never seen the Broadway Musical, so I could not tell you if it lived up to its name but this movie was wonderful.Rene Zellweger has what it takes. Her timing is excellent and her singing much better than I expected.  Catherine Zeta-Jones does a nice job, especially with the low, breathy notes, and Richard Gere carries his part (actually able to reach the high notes -- unlike say, Antonio Banderas who has the vocal range of my cat).One of my favorite aspects of this movie was the style in which it was filmed: the picture presented to the audience was always a lush one - the makeup was spectacular, although not so much on the main characters. It brought to mind Moulin Rouge but it was so much better because (a)it used Chicago music, not a bunch of junk collected and foisted off as semi-original, (b)the actors had stronger voices and, in my opinion, more talent, finally (c)it had a convincing plot and most importantly humor!See the movie! It's worth $10. **10/10**",Chicago
510,brdwaygirl,BEST MOVIE-MUSICAL EVER!!!,10,2 January 2003,"As a fan of Chicago, and a very big fan of musicals in general, I was filled with anticipation when I heard Chicago was being adapted for the screen. I was worried that it would be ruined as many other musicals have been when made into a movie (like A Chorus Line). But, after seeing it, I could put it no other way, CHICAGO IS THE BEST MOVIE-MUSICAL EVER!! And one of the best movies, for that matter. It is very faithful to musical (what was cut in no way takes away from the movie), and it was extremely well cast. All the actors give amazing performances, especially Catherine Zeta-Jones whose energy fills the screen for all 107 minutes of the film. All the musical numbers are redone amazingly, especially Cell Block Tango. I give it 11 out of 10 (not a typo). It is impossible to describe the thrill I got from watching this movie.

On the contrary, I believe that Chicago is the best MOVIE, not just movie musical, EVER! The actors and actresses ( especially Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah), are amazing, and the musical numbers (especially Cell Block Tango, When You're Good to Mama, Razzle Dazzle, and of course All That Jazz) have no equal!

However, I was equally ready to be disappointed.I was not disappointed to say the least. I was blown away by all the musical numbers (esp.

I didn't like these two, because one was boring and the other had one half of the movie boring and the other half good.The other reason I didn't think I would like it is because I didn't think that Renee Zewelger was the type of woman to do a musical, and part of me couldn't see Catherine Zeta Jones either, or Richard Gere.But I admit that I was shocked how well Catherine did because last time I liked her in anything would have been the Mask of Zoro.  Even though I am a woman I got to say she was a definately sexy mama in this movie.  As for Renee she shocked me with a great performance, because the last movie that I liked her in was Jerry Mcguire, but I was happy to admit that her winning golden globes was worth it.  I don't know but part of me didn't think she was as great as Catherine.Go watch the movie it is worth it.As for Queen Latifah I think that she was perfect for her character, I mean I never expected this woman in this type of movie to be any good, because I have never seen her in a decent movie, but she proved me wrong too, and I am glad.",Chicago

517,silverknife,Didn't you know? All men are evil. Women have every right to kill them...and like it.,1,9 June 2004,"As an adaptation of a broadway musical, Chicago definitely delivers. As a movie, all it's really about is a popularity contest between the lead characters in the film. The binding factor between these characters is that they share a certain joy in killing and/or ruining men. Because, you know, men are the scourge of the earth and should justifiably be destroyed by any woman who feels the desire to do so.Essentially, the movie's theme, plot and purpose consist of little more than glamourized BS.This is a movie for man-hating feminists who are simple enough to delight in the fantasy of not only killing men and getting away with it, but gaining popularity for it in the process. Fans of broadway musicals may enjoy it as well, as its style emulates a stage performance feel very well, but the movie's themes are still so ridiculous that even broadway lovers may be turned off by it.The strongest good aspect of Chicago is the quality of the acting. Pretty much everyone on the cast delivers good, strong performances. The adapted screenplay is well done, despite the overall crappiness of the story. The music in Chicago is of typical broadway style and doesn't really offer anything special.Overall, Chicago is a well-produced pile of steaming dung that has no real merit as a story. Honestly, I've taken dumps that are both more interesting and more meaningful than Chicago. It's movies like this that completely eliminate any respect I once had for the Academy Awards. I want my 2 hours back that this film has robbed from my life.My voted IMDb score: 3 out of 10",Chicago
518,mjazz1,Masterpiece,10,16 October 2005,"A few years back, while cleaning out my storage for a major move from Arizona to Georgia, I came across, within 15 minutes, a white scorpion the size of my fist and a black widow spider the size of a silver dollar. At the urgings of my helper, I reluctantly killed both,after first marveling at their beauty. I believe this experience helped me to prepare for ""Chicago"", a beautiful/ugly, mean-spirited masterpiece. Never before had I witnessed a major film in which the principle characters were either loathsome or pathetic. I can marvel at the beautiful dance numbers, the colors, costumes and performances of ""Chicago,"" but I don't particularly enjoy the bitter aftertaste. Nonetheless, this movie is a keeper.Brilliant performances abound, from Richard Gere to Catherine Zita-Jones to Queen Latifah (although John C. Reilly is one of my favorite actors, his one-note portrayal of Amos Hart is overpraised). However, Rene Zellweger, as Roxy Hart, is beyond brilliant. She's phenomenal. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new star in Hollywood. When a homely, skinny, shapeless Rene Zellweger can perform beside them shapely, beautiful and talented Catherine Zita-Jones, and my eyes are completely drawn to Zellweger, I know I'm watching a major star.Certainly Zellweger's character, the murderous, slutty, adulterous Roxie Hart, is one of the great creations of the theater. Nevertheless, Zellweger has demonstrated she not only fully understands the character, she is capable of affecting every necessary nuance. Unlike most lead characters, Roxie Hart doesn't develop; she slowly disrobes, revealing layer-by-layer until we realize Roxie is an utterly ruthless, incredibly dangerous psychopath. ""I fear for Chicago,"" Gere's character says at one point. I strongly agree.While the songs are no great shakes, the dancing is uniformly terrific, as are all the technical elements.My only quibble with ""Chicago,"" is the ""Mr. Cellophane"" number. It slows the film to a crawl and is totally unnecessary. I much prefer the deleted ""Class,"" which, I believe, would have left me feeling much better about enjoying this movie.One other observation: Queen Latifah, sans makeup, is one of the most naturally beautiful women I've ever seen. One can only imagine how she would look 75 pounds lighter.",Chicago
519,csabarish,How could they deny Renee the Oscar?,9,7 March 2006,"Well let us start with the one thing about the Movie that sets it apart. It is in your face. No one involved in making it seems to be doing the least to hold back anything. Not the camera, nor the art designer, nor the director; and definitely not the actors. It booms every instant with vitality and fills every frame with talent. And what an ensemble of talent! The direction and screenplay are top notch. Four lines worth of story sequestered into brilliant moments with ample opportunity to act and dance and sing. You never feel that the sequences are being forced or - why is she singing? It is pure entertainment. But the biggest achievement of this movie is that it manages to show the darker side of people, society, fame and success, humorously sometimes sadistically but never hiding the degradation that such opportunism and hypocrisy is.And finally the cast. A brilliant cast. Career best performances from every player. Yes Rob Marshal wanted Hugh Jackman (who may have done well) but Richard Gere was excellent in his own style. Catherine won the Oscar, Latifah's fee increased after this movie but what did Renee get? The distinction of being one of those fine performers who did not win the Oscar they deserved. Then the Academy was always a year or two or shall we say a performance or two late at recognizing this brilliant actor who just transforms into being the bitchy, mean Roxie Hart. You hate her and yet root for her because she wants to succeed at all costs just as Renee pulls out all the stocks to give one of the most luminous performances of all times. How did they not give her the Oscar? But then who cares?",Chicago
520,Dave-448,"This beat The Two Towers, The Pianist and Gangs of NY????",2,4 August 2003,"It is not necessary to worry about Spoilers in this review as Chicago does not have a plot which could be ruined. I am a guy and I freely admit that any type of musical is not exactly my preferred type of entertainment (or my cup of tea as we like to say in Britain). However after all the awards and the reviews, I thought I'd give this a go. After all, Catherine Zeta Jones is very sexy as well as being a great actress and Renee was good in Bridget Jones. I have now seen it! What can I say? Shell-shocked, stunned, two hours of my life gone which I will never have again. The only good point was Catherine Zeta Jones, who I still feel deserved her Oscar (and not just because she's British). This complete Cow Pat of a movie must constitute the biggest fraud ever perpetrated by a film studio on innocent peaceful moviegoers. Academy members who voted for this movie should be added to the 'Axis of Evil' (letter already being typed to the White House). The Pseudo intellectual Jazz was awful, there was no story even threatening to emerge. The characters were nasty, uninteresting and there were at most about two pieces of music which one could say were 'right for the period'. My mother, who plays Jazz Piano and used to play in a band was very disappointed when she saw this film as she had been so looking forward to seeing it. Most of the old classic musicals at least made an effort to offer a storyline. Watching this movie actually made me think that The Cotton Club was a great film. That is how bad it is. It may be possible to watch Chicago and enjoy it but only if you leave your brain in the foyer on the way in.",Chicago
521,polystyreneman64,"Proof that the musical, as a film genre, is not dead after all.",8,16 March 2003,"**SPOILERS POSSIBLE**Chicago is a rousing spectacle of a motion picture, a first-class debut feature from director Rob Marshall, and proof that the musical, as a film genre, is not dead after all.  Set in 1920's Chicago, it tells the story of Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger), an aspiring singer/dancer who, in a fit of rage, kills her lover and is sent to Death Row, where she meets up with her idol, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a once-huge star who is serving jail time for a double homicide of her own.  With the help of her supportive, cuckolded husband Amos (John C. Reilly), her money-grubbing yet successful lawyer (Richard Gere), and Mama Morton (Queen Latifah), the prison warden who serves as the ""Mother Hen"" to the women on Death Row, along with some fabrications of her own, Roxie is able to win her innocence. The story itself may be simple, but it's punctuated by a great set of songs, all sung by the cast members themselves, including Zeta-Jones' slinky opener ""All That Jazz"" and ""Give 'Em the Old Razzle Dazzle,"" where Gere preaches the virtues of bending the truth in the courtroom to obtain a favorable ruling.All in all, Chicago is lightweight entertainment, but the film raises many questions to think about in the post-O.J. Simpson era.  How much of a role does the media play in building a star?  And is it possible to swindle a jury into letting a guilty person go free based on one's lawyer and one's star power?One aspect of the film I thought could be better is if, in some cases, the musical numbers were better integrated into the story itself.  Sometimes it's glaringly obvious that Chicago had previously been a stage production with several of the songs being performed against a solid black background, but this does not serve to distract from the sheer entertainment value of the film.  I also thought the film ran perhaps a bit long; it seemed to lose some momentum in the closing minutes before the finale.  Gere's performance is weak compared to those around him--it's not bad, but it pales in comparison to the knockout performances delivered by Zeta-Jones, Zellweger, and Reilly, to name a few.However, Chicago's faults are few. This film is definitely a success, and one that will probably have a big night come the Oscars.  Chicago is one of the most fun moviegoing experiences I had in 2002.  Go see it! 8/10",Chicago

523,GMPasqua,Top filmization of Bob Fosse's Hit Broadway Musical,10,13 December 2002,"One of the best films of the year (and the best musical film since ""Little Shop of Horrors"") Rob Marshall has filmed the stage show with an inventive eye and the film works on all levels.  The musical numbers are performed on the vaudeville stage much like the numbers in the film of ""Cabaret"" so audiences won't be shocked into seeing actors sing and dance.  The cast was incredible. I was most surprised by John C. Reilly and Queen Latifah. Both actors stopped the film with their solo numbers. Catherine Zeta-John's is sympathetic and sexy as a murdering showgirl with excellent singing and dancing skills, and Renee Zellweger should be nominated for an Oscar as the dizzy blonde who dreams of stardom. This role has always been difficult - the audience must sympathize with her even though she is a murderer and seems to only care about herself. Richard Gere seems born to play the role of Billy Flynn and he steals every scene he's in. The screenplay follows the stage show almost scene for scene (with a few song eliminations). A new song ""I Move On"" performed over the end credits is in keeping with the tone of Kander and Ebb's classic score. The film was well edited and the musical numbers were inventively filmed. ""Chicago"" is for sophisticated audiences but at the same time it's a lot of fun. Highly recommended.Well done by Rob Marshall, cast and crew",Chicago

The music, while it does flow with the story, is dull, certainly not catchy. The story has been done to death (see Cabaret, Natural Born Killers). The script is not funny enough to make this a comedy, nor is it poignant enough to make it a drama.  The viewer feels nothing for the characters because they are all reprehensible. If Chicago is designed as a satire, it misses the mark at best or at worst it is completely obvious. If you want to see a great musical, see Cabaret with Joel Grey, The Music Man with Robert Preston, or any adaptation of Guys and Dolls. Avoid Chicago.",Chicago

Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, and John C. Reilly are at the top of their form in this film. All of them deliver superb performances that should be recognized when the Oscar nominations are announced on February 11th. The standout numbers in the film are: Catherine Zeta-Jones singing All That Jazz, Catherine Zeta-Jones and the Merry Murderesses singing the Cell Block Tango, Queen Latifah singing When You're Good To Mama, Richard Gere singing Razzle Dazzle, and Renee Zellweger/Catherine Zeta-Jones singing the final Nowadays/Honey Nut Rag.

The musical numbers are first rate and many of the dance routines are a pleasure to behold. I also found the movie unfortunately and needlessly distasteful in some of the choreography, camera shots and film editing. Of course one of the main themes of the tale is sexual profligateness (see dictionary), and the movie is a paean to Bob Fosse (my only other exposure is All That Jazz). But in my opinion, up-close, rear crotch shots and simulated intercourse detract from, rather than enhance this film. It may be one thing to watch these routines on the stage, but close proximity on film isn't the same. Chicago should be rated R rather than PG-13, and you should think twice about who you watch it with.",Chicago

It comes down to this...Chicago is the most creative movie of 2002, hands down.  No doubt about it. The problem is, I go to the movies to be ENTERTAINED, not to marvel at how CREATIVE a movie is.  And creative in cinematic terms boils down to originality.  The whole film was an original concept.  But I don't care!
I want a great plot, superior acting (especially from a cast this great!), some suspense, some wonderment as to what is going to happen next. Speaking of wonderment, if you happen to go see this movie and wonder what's going to happen next, I'll let you in on a little clue: don't wonder.  It will ALWAYS be another long, drawn out, WAY too loud and obnoxious song.  Do I dislike musicals?  Nope, like 'em just fine.  I simply just couldn't STAND this annoying movie.  What a waste of a great cast and a horrible way of telling a story.  Even one of the greatest musicals ever filmed, ""Grease"" doesn't have a new song every four to six minutes.  That movie at least lets its actors tell the stories instead of singing and dancing their way through it.
Ask yourself this: why even have these three huge actors in this movie? THEY DIDN'T ACT!  Did they even sing those songs?  Zeta-Jones maybe, but the other two, NO.This movie will win awards and other accolades.  But think for yourself: is it really THAT good?",Chicago

Well, that's what a musical is about!  People start singing and dancing out of nowhere - but that's the beauty of it all.  When you go into a musical, you have to suspend reality and embrace the world of fantasy.  God forbid any of you people ever go see an actual Broadway show. My recommendation?  Go see Chicago.  The fact that Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renée Zellweger, Richard Gere, John C. Reilly, and Queen Latifah all actually do their own dancing and singing is impressive enough unto itself.

530,littleblackduck,Smoke and Mirrors,1,24 January 2003,"Cannibalising movies of the past seems to be the latest thing with the current crop of young directors.  Having no ideas of their own, they resort to lifting composition, lighting, and framing in order to sell their movie. A modern audience, which does not know the original, will scarcely notice. Let's face it a modern audience would scarcely care.  The current flavour of the month, Chicago, is a poor man's Cabaret (1972).  Director Robert Marshall should stick to choreography and directing for TV and the stage because there isn't an original, fresh idea in this mess of a film. Firstly, he ditches the balance of the two stories of Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart making the Hart story the focus of the film - bad move Mr Marshall. Secondly, he thinks he understands the structure of Cabaret (with its musical numbers kept to the stage of the Kit Kat club) so he exploits it, cutting songs to insert dialogue which is supposed to be clever but he just cuts, cuts, cuts and cuts jarringly and quickly (think Baz Lurhmann school of editing - a meat cleaver approach to a subtle art).  If you thought that Moulin Rouge was ripe offal then you are in for a treat here.  Moulin Rouge had a weak story and suffered because of it.  Chicago has a strong story but you would scarcely know it because it all is delivered at the same tempo and pace so that there are no highs and lows, just the same level of frenetic cutting and annoying close ups (there are so many of these that the whole sorry mess begins to get tedious very early in the piece).To those unfamiliar with the story, stage struck wannabe, Roxie Hart, kills her lover and is sent to gaol where she meets famous hoofer, Velma Kelly, who is doing time for the killing of her husband and her sister.  Mama Morton is their prison warden and into this world comes corrupt lawyer Billy Flynn who represents the two women who become celebrities through the `work' of Morton and Flynn.  The story is based on a real case in 1924 and filmed as Roxie Hart in 1942 with Ginger Rogers and Adolphe Menjou.  Kander and Ebb took the original play and turned it into a musical.  In 1975, Bob Fosse created his legendary version with Chita Rivera (who is in the film in a small role) and it  was revived in 1996 with the original Fosse choreography intact.  Along comes the current film and much has been made of how fresh and original the whole thing is.  Well the ghost of Fosse is present because some of the routines are bastardisations of his great work and some parts just give in and plagiarise unashamedly.  There are some good numbers (He had it comin'; Mr Cellophane,) but the excellent song `Class' has been dropped just as the final lines of dialogue:  `You know, a lot of people have lost faith in America and what it stands for, they say.  But we are the living examples of what a wonderful country this is'.  These lines sum up ironically and cynically what the whole musical is about but sadly, they are omitted and the whole film softens the impact.  American films are getting soft.  They are sugar coating the pill and this is another example.  This softly softly approach almost buried a fine film like The Quiet American, made Sweet Home Alabama excruciatingly banal and is a dangerous trend in sanitising movies to appeal to the right wing zeitgeist.  Mass audiences will love this film because it appears fresh and innovative, it appears to have a strong message, it appears to have high production values - that it never comes close to being great will be lost as the ticket queues stretch around the block and the awards come rolling in.  This is mass entertainment, folks - gush gush here, gush gush there.There is much to be annoyed about in this film.  Musicals should be about dancing and singing to advance the plot.  The songs in this version intrude and are cut with dialogue and exposition which, done once is good but tedium sets in here because there is no pace or tempo, just editing to give the illusion that something grand is happening. The cinematography is amateurish and derivative. Marshall and his cinematographer have lifted entire structural devices from Cabaret (1972) and Metropolis (1927) often using them incorrectly (as in the song, Mr Cellophane). Borrowing is different to being influenced by someone's style.  Fosse used camera techniques to enhance and stylise not as a gimmick. The production design and costuming are anachronistic and incorrect.  Are the 1920s so long ago that we can confuse them with the 1930s? There is incorrect hair, architecture and even underwear.  The casting is puzzling (while Queen Latifah is a fine performer, the idea of a black prison warden in 1924 is unconvincing) and the performances uneven.  Renee Zellweger has begun to win her truckload of awards but the acting honours go to Zeta Jones who looks good, acts Zellweger off the screen and can sing and dance.  La Zellweger gets her podgy face up against the prison bars a lot, pouts, shimmies and walks away with the prizes - where's the justice?  To top it off she cannot dance. Her routines are edited to give the illusion of fluidity.  I didn't like her other films and I sure as hell didn't like her in this one.  Chicago on the stage was erotic.  This version was pure high school end of year drama production - lots of huffing and puffing but no heat.  Just watch Zellweger do a sexy walk and wriggle her behind and you'll crack up laughing - I did. Richard Gere is good.  I always though he could act.  The supporting cast works well but hey have little to do.  Here are some questions to ponder: Why did the filmmakers ditch the Mary Sunshine subplot, reducing Christine Baranski to a couple of close ups and one really bad production number? Why Lucy Liu (doing her Charlie's Angels schtick)? Why the inclusion of foreign thespians (Colm Feore, Catherine Zeta Jones, Dominic West) doing their American schtick?  Why do the American accents tour the country (isn't this supposed to be Illinois)?  Why cast Zellweger (now there's a face for radio).

Reily and Christine Baranski all add to the fantastic feel of the movie.This movie will be known as a classic mark my words from the extremely witty and cynical story to the fantastic jazzy score , Finally a good musical , Please if you hated Moulin Rouge (one of the worst movies ever made) then give this a try , I think you just might walk away loving it , Like I did.",Chicago
535,NovakMonkey2628,An Amazing Piece of Cinema,10,11 May 2003,"""Chicago"" is a stunning, brilliant piece of cinema.It tells the satirical story of a group of characters living in the windy city, in the roaring twenties: a voluptious vamp that burns in the spotlight, a red-hot mama matron, a greedy, flamboyant lawyer, a wannabe-star chorus girl, and her neglected, suffering, and lovable husband. There lives are interwoven and elaborated on, centering on the chorus girl's rise to fame, through shooting her lover.  The genra here is musical. And every number is wildly entertaining, taking on the musical form of a vaudevillian show: there is a flashy, signature opener (All that Jazz), a legendary closer (Hot Honey Rag), a circus-show me act, and each character is rewarded a song of their own, to express themselves: the chorus girl, Roxie (Roxie), the voluptious vamp, Velma (I Can't do it Alone), the red-hot mama matron, Matron Mama Morton (When You're Good to Mama), the greedy Lawyer, Billy (All I Care About) and the neglected husband (Mr. Cellophane) dance gorgeoussly around in gold lamee, flapper outfits, sultry black vixon dresses, and tramp costumes to exagerate their personas.The story's main center (the telling of the voluptious vamp and the chorus girl, fooling the public with their murders) is filled with juicy dialogue, and a beautiful flow from song to scene to song.The talent of ""Chicago"" is unsurpassed.  Renee Zellweger gives a legendary performance as Roxie, the chorus girl.  Her brilliant, realistic acting, and her oozing charismaa through her musical numbers earned her an Oscar nomination, a SAG Award, and a Golden Globe.  Richard Gere gives a fine, haughty potrayel of Billy, the lawyer, with a marvelous tap routine elaborating his talent.  He was awarded a Golden Globe.  Queen Latifah, and her wildly entertaining number (When You're Good to Mama), as well as her red-hot potrayel of Matron Mama Morton, earned her Oscar and Golden Globe nominations, the same as John C. Reilly who gives a beloved, funny, and heartbreaking potrayel of Amos.  Mr. Reilly can belt out a mean Mr. Cellophane.  But the highlight of Chicago's cast is Catherine Zeta-Jones, as Velma Kelly.  Every time I view Chicago I am reminded of her brilliant talent.  Miss Jones is a phenominal dancer, in rememberence of Cyd Charise and Ginger Rogers, as well as a fabulous tune belter, up there with Judy Garland.  She's also an amazingly real actress, and brings beauty and class back to the movie musical.  Her frankly beautiful potrayel of the vamp earned her a Golden Globe Nomination, a SAG Award, a BAFTA Award, and the grandaddy, an Oscar.However, the man of the hour involved with Chicago is Rob Marshall, who is forever-presesnt behind the camera.  He weaves a perfectly gorgeous mood throughout the memorable scenes, and his choreography and dancing abilities are on par with Bob Fosse.  The star of Chicago is its impeccable dancing and choreography, with sure and creative movements everywhere you look. Mr. Marshall earned a DGA Award, and an Oscar nomination.Chicago is one of the best films of the year, of the generation.  Never before have I seen anything quite like it.  It brings back the old movie musical, while giving a Broadway flare.  It is completely revolutionary and legendary.  A perfect 10/10.",Chicago
536,dirtygold00,"Some splendor, so yawns, but some kinda SEXY!!",7,16 June 2003,"This film has some exceptional scenes, but call me an idiot, but the storyline was not overwhelming to me.  Don't get me wrong, it is a must see, but more so for it's accomplishment and acclaim, more than for it's brilliance.  John Reilly and Renee Zelwegger's performance stand out most, especially Reilly, who owns to me, the movies best scene and musical performance.  Richard was in a word annoying and Catherine Zeta-Jones flat overrated after watching the Academy Awards.  If nothing else, this film is extremely sexy.  Almost every woman in this film, exuding a special sex appeal, mostly attributed to the overall presentation, which is stylish. Overall, I score it a 7, politically I think the Academy was prepared to recognize a musical after possibly ignoring Moulin Rouge, and the benefactor turned out to be a good but not great film.  But then again, what do I know?",Chicago
537,maildest,B musical on speed,3,24 October 2003,"Dance is the thing: the mediocre plot, one-dimensional characters, insipid music, and weak acting are all calculated to stay out of the way of the frenetic Bob Fosse-style dance numbers.  I felt like I had seen the dance numbers before in All That Jazz (1979), and I did not have any urge to see them again.  Personally, I had more fun with Roxie Hart (1942), another campy B musical based on the same story.  The earlier musical has more silliness and less of an ugly hard cynical edge.  The earlier musical also had more heart.  Ginger Rogers' Roxie Hart was sexy and vulnerable and seemed like a real person in spite of a weak story and script.  By contrast, all the characters in Chicago (2002) are cartoon characters.",Chicago
538,mcdonellbrf,well crafted film,7,13 January 2004,For me this is the ultimate movie. The dance is fantastic but the camera and lighting were beyond belief. Dion Beebe (the Australian cinematographer) does work on this that is beyond his very high standard on his classic Australian work.,Chicago
539,mattreviews,A musical that I can stand,7,20 January 2005,"For a film that tells most of its story through song, more so than many other musicals that I've seen, Chicago really stands its ground as a decent flick. Some quality choreography, strung together with a great selection of actors tackling roles they aren't renowned for doing, makes what is essentially a very simple story a lot more entertaining.Renée Zellweger was perfect for the part of the sinister murderess behind a doll face, making the part her own. Lucky Catherine Zeta Jones wasn't cast for the bit of Roxy Hart; she was bad enough in the role of Velma Kelly, bland and unsuitable, really letting the film down. Richard Gere surprised me, with a unique voice that initially had me cringing, but once I allowed myself to have an open mind to what the film's intentions were with the character of Billy Flynn, the charismatic and arrogant lawyer, I knew there couldn't have been anyone else better than Gere for the part.What left me uneasy was how the story ended, with Roxy Hart, killer of the man she was having an affair with, got found innocent and became a big stage star, along with Velma Kelly, in a similar situation to Hart. There was no happy ending for the people who deserved it, only for those who didn't. In fact, the film really had no characters that were innocent, besides Roxy Hart's husband, Amos Hart, played by the always impressive John C. Reilly. His song in the film the highlight for me, just because I love all his other work, and to see him, like the rest of the main cast, take on such a different role was such a treat.I found myself yawning in some scenes, and it's not the kind of film I will willingly return to, but Chicago did have its moments, and for a musical  not my personal favorite genre of movie  it certainly did well to impress.",Chicago
540,watermelonsparkless,Unpleasant,4,12 August 2017,"Unpleasant Chicago is a Broadway musical turned into a movie. The title is misleading , we thought it was about basketball yet it turned out to be about unpleasant violent showgirls and wannabe Vaudeville performers. The main character was schizophrenic and imagined that her brutal court case was a musical and her chipmunk lawyer was a caring man who was the complete opposite, he charged her $639498.50 (Jamaican Dollar) for his disloyal service. her husband Amos was also a misleading character, you see we expected that since his name was Amos he would appear a biblical prophet. Another disappointment as he was just John C. Reilly playing a gullible husband who was defending his psycho wife who had an affair. The whole movie was about crazy women who killed their husbands for no proper reason. The songs were catchy and the dances were great but your better off watching the basketball",Chicago

I really wanted to see them succeed, but instead I was left feeling embarrassed for them most of the time. Bad casting. And the Hungarian monologue?

544,gretchkuhn,Absolutely Amazing!,10,19 January 2003,"I just saw this today, 19 January, and I was amazed! I have seen the Broadway Revival 4 times, and LOVE the Stage Show... When I heard that Richard Gere was going to be Billy Flynn, I was a bit skeptical, until I did some research on him... He was on Broadway, in ""GREASE"" as  understudy to Barry Bostwick (Rocky Horror Picture Show) as Danny Zuko. When ""GREASE"" went over to London's West End, Richard opened as 'Danny Zuko.' Granted, it has been 25+ years since Richard has really sang, I thought that Richard did a most admirable job as Billy Flynn... Catherine Zeta-Jones is Velma Kelly. She is astounding! I knew prior that she could sing, as she put in her time in London's West End herself... Sing more, please, Catherine! I wish I had her legs! Renee Zellweger as Roxie Hart did a commendable job. Roxie Hart is a Performer-want-to-be... A Third Class Act, good enough for some places, but not Quality enough for the Big Time... But Renee pulls it off perfectly! Renee, keep on singing! I really liked the fact that they had so many Broadway Actors in the Movie, primarily as the Dancers in the Jazz Clubs, or as the Husbands of the Murderesses of the Cook County Jail. Granted, I would have loved to have had Broadway People as the Main Characters: Roxie, Velma, Billy, ""Mama"" Morton, but I do realize that you need ""Name Actors"" especially for a Hollywood Production, and for it to at least break even... Even though I was around for the Original Broadway production in 1975, and I did not see it then, but from what I have read about it, this is closer to that than it is to the Current Broadway production... When you mention ""CHICAGO"" to the right people, and they will say ""Bob Fosse,"" as he choreographed the Original B'way, and Ann Reinking (one of his Dancers) choreographed the Revival, there is really nothing FOSSE in CHICAGO the Movie. But I did get glimpses of ""Fosse"" throughout... Rob Marshall, who was the Choreographer of ""CABARET"" currently playing at Studio 54 in NYC, a Fosse show to the utmost, did a wonderful job as Choreographer & Director for ""CHICAGO."" Cannot wait until your next Movie! Rob was both Director and Choreographer for Disney's re-creation of ""ANNIE"" with Victor Garber and Kathy Bates. Rob was the Choreographer for Disney's ""Rodgers & Hammerstein's CINDERELLA,"" also with Victor Garber & Whoopi Goldberg as King & Queen, and Brandy as Cinderella.",Chicago
545,gretchkuhn,"ASTOUNDING! AMAZING! SEEN IT TWICE, WANT TO SEE IT 100 X MORE!",10,20 February 2003,"I have seen this movie twice so far, and I want to see it at least 100 more times! I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! I have seen the Broadway Musical 4 times, and I want to see that at least 100 TIMES MORE ALSO!!! I am a Die-hard Bob Fosse fan, and despite the fact that the Choreography is NOT FOSSE's, I STILL LOVE THIS MOVIE! I absolutely adore the storyline, in which these women murder either their husbands or boyfriends and they end up in the Cook County Jail, in Chicago, IL... The story focuses on 2 particular ladies, Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger), and Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones)... From all of my research on this Show, I have discovered that this was based on a true story way back in the 1920s... When this originally opened on Broadway in 1975 with Gwen Verdon as Roxie, and Chita Rivera (who has a small cameo in the Jailhouse) as Velma, it was actually a huge production, with major sets, and I consider the movie to be reminiscent of the Original... Billy Flynn, the lawyer who defends both Roxie & Velma, when we first meet him, singing ""All I Need is Love"" was originally staged as a Striptease, and Richard Gere does just that! Granted, it is only down to his boxer shorts & t-shirt, but it is tastefully done... Richard also sings pretty well, considering it has probably been 25+ years since he sang in London's Original Production of the Now-Classic 1950s musical GREASE as Danny Zuko (John Travolta's role in the Movie of the same Name), and was the Understudy to Barry Bostwick (Rocky Horror Picture Show - Brad Majors) on Broadway, in the Original Broadway Production! GO SEE IT! YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY! Unless if you just do not like musicals to begin with... DO NOT COMPARE IT TO MOULIN ROUGE, either as they are 2 very different musicals! Granted, Moulin Rouge's success sure has helped CHICAGO, but Bob Fosse was even trying to make CHICAGO into a movie way back in 1975! This has traveled a very long and winding road, to finally be on the Silver Screen! Rob Marshall was absolutely inspired when directing this movie!",Chicago
546,itf-65501,A Showstopper For The Screen,9,12 November 2021,"My judgment may be influenced due to the sequence of witnessed events, but after several viewings over the years, Chicago remains that rare musical meant to be seen on the big screen. Not very many stage shows adapt easily to film, RENT is a good example of this. I say this as a Generation X-er who has not only seen RENT on the live stage at least 8 times, but no other musical has made such an emotional & moving impact as seeing RENT for the first time in Boston, 1995. That said, as much as a successful stage show it is, I don't feel it translates to film with nearly the same impact or emotion. I would categorize RENT as rock-opera(ish) in show format, written for the stage. As far as Chicago (this may be over the top for some, but it's honest), not since watching Wizard of Oz as a child had I seen such a memorable musical adapted for the screen. Now, I must admit I saw the film version of Chicago before I saw it on Broadway, but to this day I feel (unlike RENT) the film version is superior to the stage show. (Although perhaps I would feel differently had I been fortunate enough to see Bebe Neuwirth as Velma on Broadway). Point is, even after multiple viewings, Chicago remains a top-notch film musical.",Chicago
547,pinkhippos,i love Chicago don't you?,10,6 November 2006,i absolutely enjoyed the movie Chicago it was one of my favorite musicals besides grease. Catherine zeta-Jones is a fantastic actress playing Velma Kelly and a great singer as well.My favorite number was the cell Block tango and it sucks how the Hungarian lady is innocent but she gets hung.You realize she is innocent because in the cell block tango number she is the only one who has a white scarf thing which symbolizes her innocence where as all the others have red ones which symbolizes there guilt.My other favorite number is if you'll be good to mama which makes you realize Evan big woman can be hot as Queen Latifa proves by playing Morton the head of the prison in her very sexy outfit in this number.,Chicago
548,MammaMiaSuperfan,Amazing,10,8 October 2006,"Amazing story, amazing cast, amazing talent!Let's begin with Renee Zellweger (Roxie Hart). Zellweger's performance is impeccable. While singing and dancing, she also is entirely believable as married chorus girl Roxie. Her ability to learn how to sing wonderfully in just a few months is incredible. She was able to convince me of her deserving the part of a wannabe vaudeville star.Next is Catherine Zeta-Jones (Velma Kelly). Gorgeous and talented, Zeta-Jones's musical background makes her a perfect Velma Kelly. With a flawless performance, Zeta-Jones is an incredibly impressive performer. Opening the movie with the best performance of ""All that Jazz"" I've ever heard, she shows how perfect she is as the vaudeville headliner.Also, Richard Gere (Billy Flynn). As the greasy lawyer, only out to make his clients and himself famous, the role of Billy seems written exactly for Gere. Showing that his talents exceed acting and piano playing (Pretty Woman), Gere also proves to us that he can sing and tap dance. His performance is marvelous.Then we have Queen Latifah (Mama Morton). This amazing actress's portrayal of the ""You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"" Matron is wonderful, yet lacking one thing: Singing time. With only one song, we are robbed of seeing her second performance, ""Class"" (With Zeta-Jones), which you can see in special features, but is not in the movie. Otherwise, she's amazing.Finally, John C. Reilly (Amos Hart). Reilly is the oblivious, completely trusting sap, Amos. He is a great actor and his performance of Mr. ""Cellophane"" is PERFECT! Sadly, that is the only song written for Amos.This is currently my favorite movie ever. The cast is amazing and there is chemistry between all of them. Sadly, Zeta-Jones and Reilly never have a scene together. It would have been fun to see them complain to each other about his wife and her competition as Legal Legend. Zellweger and Gere's chemistry throughout the whole movie is undeniable, as well as the chemistry between Zeta-Jones and Latifah and Zeta-Jones and Zellweger.""That's Chicago""",Chicago
549,jchernesky,"Disappointing, overrated...Oscar material?",5,7 September 2003,"Wow.  My expectations were high, but man this film disappointed me. Despite some very clever set design, choreography and scene transitions, this film lacked any emotional connection to any of the characters and reminded me of a sketch comedy show (without the humor), where some numbers worked and others fell flat.The only highlights? Catherine Zeta Jones was remarkable.  Renee Z had a surprisingly good voice, although her acting seemed flat (as though she was busy concentrating on the singing/dancing).  Richard Gere was horribly miscast - he simply can't sing. Jonathan O'Riley was good, but not Oscar worthy.  Without Miramax and their marketing genius behind this film, I suspect it would have had minimal presence at the Oscars.People have compared this to Moulin Rouge.  Sorry, not even close. That film pushed the limits of the medium and set a new standard for musicals on film. It's a shame Chicago couldn't achieve the same.",Chicago

When the movie was over my feet were exhausted from constantly tapping them on the floor.At the end of the movie we saw something we have never seen before in a movie. There was at least ten minutes of titles while a reprise of the music from the movie was playing. Nobody got up but all stayed to hear the music again.

Visually it's Stunning, and the music is superb. And how the music, carries the storytelling of the film, which then coincides with the Broadway act. The film is amazing. You leave the theater humming the music, and verses, like Catherine Zeta-Jones Singing `All That Jazz' ,Queen Latifah singing `When You're Good to Mama' The Female Prisoners singing a sadistic humorous number called `The Cell Block Tango' which is reminiscent to Elvis Presley's `68' Comeback special. And of course Richard Gere singing 'Razzle Dazzle' And Slowly Tap Dancing to the stand. It's like watching the actual Broadway show,on the big screen. At times, I forgot that I was watching a film.

First off there aren't any likeable characters because they're all shallow and totally self absorbed and second the main characters hardly dance, you may think they are but look again there are so many quick shots you almost couldn't tell who's who.

""Moulin Rouge"" was a start... but I found ""Chicago"" a lot more pleasing to watch. (Although, it would be nice to see the producers/directors/editors tone down the use of so much film-editing during the musical numbers. I would love to actually watch someone sing and dance for more than a few seconds at a time.)Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta Jones & Queen Latifah all performed very well in my opinion --- although, I felt like Zeta-Jones was the real ""eye-catcher"" throughout the movie. My eyes were on her in every scene she played -- a real scene-stealer. Zellweger was great, too, and perhaps since her character was the rather meek ""up and comer"", she played her role with less ""show-stopping charisma"" than Zeta-Jones... but that seems to be in line with her character.  The final musical number of the film, I felt, really let Zellweger shine as a singer/performer. (Although, now that I think about it... Zellweger was fantastic in the puppeteer/mannequin scene.)The film is not exactly wholesome, family entertainment.  And if you are thinking you'll see a musical with singing and dancing to the likes of Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly & Frank Sinatra... you'll be disappointed. But in the year 2003 it holds its own.  I gave ""Chicago"" 9 of 10.",Chicago
555,rezzon8,"dflayne, I don't think you quite got the point of ""Chicago""...",10,20 February 2003,"First of all, I'd like to say how much I loved ""Chicago"" - an achievement, as I normally hate musicals. It was just so brilliantly acted (Renee Zellweger in court), directed (""Roxie Heart"" and the mirrors), choreographed (""Cell Block Tango""), and it had a MESSAGE.This is the message that I think people like 'dflayne' (comment below) missed; the movie does show two murderers getting away with everything, and the public applauding them. But that's exactly what the musical is about; it's an allegorical, satirical comment on our celebrity-obsessed society: two women can kill a man, but that doesn't make people hate them; in fact, it gets them more publicity. I know, it's a tragic flaw in our world, but it does exist; people get famous for the wrong reasons, and they'd do anything to get their ""15 minutes of fame"". But soon, those 15 minutes are up, and there's always some new person around the corner waiting to get famous for something completely undeserving respect.This is the main reason I love ""Chicago"" - as a musical, it's one of the cleverest I've ever seen. It's dark, cynical, crazy, sexual and raw; rather than applauding Velma's and Roxie's behaviour, Fosse is asking the audience to view them as negative aspects of our society. It would be great to see them locked up - or worse for them, FAIL - but the real world is not that bright. And ""Chicago"" makes a great job of showing that.My rating: 10/10",Chicago

The musical has never inspired me very much as a film lover, but Chicago is pretty entertaining and is one of the year's Top 10. Chicago promises to be a film the Hollywood loves for years and for good reason. Rob Marshall does a great job of putting this musical to screen. The editing and direction are both very well done. Also the acting is very strong, especially Renee Zellweger.But like most films it has its fair share of problems. For one, nothing really happens and the story doesn't really go any where. Now this is generally well accepted if the story has some sort of irony or deeper plot that makes one ponder thoughts in their head for days, but this film never does that. It is just simple entertainment, but very good 'simple entertainment.' It is certainly not the type of film that usually wins Best Picture because of its lack of emotion that it draws from the viewer.
Overall this is a well made film and is easily the best musical in some time, but Best Picture material it is not. Good fun, nothing more. B or 7/10.",Chicago

The incessant length of overly loud music left me irritable, as well as the lack of a single likable character (other than the husband, who's role is minimal). Less than an hour into the movie I grew restless and was certain I had been there for at least twice as long.  However, the use of parallels and cut-in's is worth the viewing.

This was a brilliant vehicle to bring the flashy, jazzy music numbers on the the screen.The editing was wonderful. This is again referring to the musical numbers and how the filmmakers switched back an forth from dream sequence to real life (especially noting the music and tap dancing during the trial). If the editing between the two plotlines was done improperly, it would have murdered the film. However, this mistake was not made, and the editing actually added the the charisma of the film.The casting was well done, however I was kind of unsure about the casting director's pick of Renee Zellweger to play Roxie Hart. I wasn't sure if she could pull it off vocally or acting-wise. But after I actually saw the film, my concerns quickly washed away and now I can't think of any other actress who could have done a better job. Catherine Zeta-Jones was a definite pick for Velma, given her musical background. I had no worries about whether she'd be able to pull of the role physically-speaking. Richard Gere's was good, however not as charismatic as the other two actresses. I was glad that his singing and dancing wasn't a complete fallout as I had expected, however I feel that the part of Billy Flynn wasn't meant for Richard Gere. Again, who am I to speak bout it, because no one comes to mind when I think of replacement for Billy. His tap dancing was excellent, however I don't understand how the tap dance sequence added overall to the quality of the film. TO me, it was just hype saying that Richard Gere can dance.
The music was excellent, the storyline was excellent, and the entire cast was very well picked (the leads as well as Queen Latifah, John C. Reilly, Colm Feore, and  Dominic West). Kudos to Rob Marshall and Bill Condon for an excellent big-screen Chicago.Favourite Song: Cell Block Tango",Chicago
562,OliviaF,All that muscle tone,9,24 January 2003,"After the editing monstrosity that was ""Maulin Rogue"" (spelling error intended), I was cautious about going to see another musical film. But I'm glad I did, cos Chicago has everything that MR lacked - an engaging storyline, smart, snappy editing, interesting characters, marvelous songs....and all that jazz.Chicago is interesting as a play/story because it intertwines so many topical themes into the one film, particularly its focus on media sensationalism and exploitation that turns suspects into celebrities, and shockingly in this case, heroes (think: OJ Simpson). The case connived by Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) has an intimate ""behind the scenes feel"" of how the evidence can be easily fabricated and public opinion swayed to influence the outcome of a trial. That Roxie Hart (Rene Z) and Velma Kelly (Catherine Z) are acquitted while the innocent Hungarian woman is executed illustrates that ""justice"" is only affordable to those with the resources to pay for a ""silver tongued"" lawyer.But Chicago is also a film that doesn't aim or pretend to preach, or take itself too seriously - as seen in the wonderfully performed ventriloquism scene. It took a few moments for me to work out whether the performers were actually dolls or actually real! (Mind you, that is not a comment on anyone's acting ability in this film).However, while I wouldn't have cast Richard Gere as Billy Flynn (the scene where he dances in his jocks left me pleading he put his trousers back on), he does a passable job. My respect for the character (albeit a corrupt one) increased when it transpired there would be no romance between him and either of the two attractive leading ladies - which is unusual for this sort of film that was dripping with sexual energy.That's all I can really say about Chicago and all that jazz, except if you still are hesitating to sit through two hours of flashy dancing and raging female hormones dominating the jail rooms, then watching Velma Kelly - the ultimate vamp if ever there was one - sucking up to Roxie Hart is well worth the two hours.",Chicago
563,brownrecluse62,Brilliant yet rather depressing,8,17 August 2003,"On the surface, this is an incredible movie. A very successful musical in modern times is something one might not expect. ""Chicago"" is almost everything you could want in a movie musical -- it's a stylish, sexy, sensational powerhouse bursting with cynicism and immorality. It's a delightfully dark story, as well as a rather insightful look at the justice system. The film is superbly made on all fronts -- it's brilliantly directed, with a smart, fast-paced screenplay, spectacular cinematography, and amazing production and costume design. The acting is superb, with surprisingly good musical performances from all five principal actors.However, the film is also a sad statement about movies today. Brilliant as it is, one can't help but notice what it lacks, in comparison with the classic musicals of old. Those movies had a wonderful way of being easygoing and pleasant, yet at the same time powerful, rousing, and energetic. ""Chicago"" is not in anyway easygoing. It's powerful and rousing, but its constant over-the-top motion is beyond energetic -- it's frenzied. The film constantly gives the impression that its makers were trying very hard. The classic musicals like ""Singin' in the Rain"" conveyed an almost effortless charm, which is just about lost by today.Don't get me wrong: I'm not saying that nothing should have moved in ""Chicago"". Quite the contrary - the motion of the camera and of the dancers put together is extremely powerful. However, in the old musicals, the power would come from the dancers alone. Today we no longer have dancers who act; we have actors who dance, and their dancing alone isn't quite enough to hold the movie up. However, the editing overcompensates greatly. It's good editing, but there is far, far too much. This is frantic, overdone, rapid-fire cutting, and it tends to give me a headache. It helps to heighten the kinetic energy of the movie, but it also deprives you of an opportunity to really take in the excellent visuals. The movie tends to cut away before you can really appreciate what you are seeing. ""Chicago"" demands repeated viewings in order to fully comprehend everything that is so obscured by the editing.In short, watching ""Chicago"" is like having your head in a pinball machine for two hours -- but it happens to be an exceptionally brilliant and beautiful machine. You never get to focus on any part of it for very long, but everything you see looks great as you are whisked along from one image to the next.The musicals of today sadly cannot become the classic musicals of yesterday. While watching today's musicals, we'll just have to accept their new-millennium shortcomings. But with that in mind, ""Chicago"" is about as good as they get.",Chicago

I didn't want to see this movie in the first place, because I didn't expect too much of it. But when it received a bunch of oscars, I went to see what all the fuzz was about, in case I was mistaken. But it was even worse than I thought! My friend left the cinema in the middle of the film, because he couldn't take the torture any longer. The film looks like a freakshow, with bad singing, bad dancing, and a crappy story. And don't get me wrong, I love musicals, I loved Grease, Moulin Rouge, The Sound of Music, The King and I, Victor/Victoria, Mary Poppins... to name only a few of the great ones. But this was nothing compared to those movies. This movie was complete rubbish! I think the Academy gave this movie a lot of Oscars just so people would go and see it, and they confirm what I already suspected: they know nothing about film! I wouldn't even want this movie in my dvd collection if it were given to me for free. The thought alone almost makes me vomit. It would ruin my dvd collection of good movies. But there's one positive aspect: if you have a grudge against someone, and you want to give him/her the worst torture imaginable, then advice them to see this movie! -100 stars out of 10",Chicago
568,ninerzguy18,"Intriguing, innovative, and well-performed",10,24 November 2003,"I have seen many musicals and to me, many of them are annoying. For instance, you get the classic spontaneous breaking into dance and song that everyone seemingly knows the words to. Yet in Rob Marshall's ""Chicago"", performances and emotions are, though partly imagined, very real and human. I won't waste your time with a detailed plot summary, as if you reading this review you already know what the film is about, but to quickly sum up: Roxie Heart (played by a marvelous Rene Zellweger) cheats on her husband (John C Reilly) and then shoots the other man. Subsequently, she gets sent to jail with the infamous Velma Kelly (career-making performance by Catherine Zeta-Jones) and under the ward of Matron Momma Morton (a surprisingly talented Queen Latifah), where she enlists the help of a womanizing lawyer named Billy Flynn to set her free (an underrated Richard Gere) and makes enemies with Kelly in the process. Anyway, onto the review; first off, Rene Zellweger is fabulous as the aforementioned Hart. In the beginning of the movie, the viewer sees her as wide-eyed, innocent, ambitious pretty girl who just wants a chance. We ever sympathize with her as she is shooting her husband. As she hears that hers is a ""hanging case"" she realizes what she has done is serious, and arrives at jail naive, thinking that she will receive special treatment on murderer's row (""Could I possibly get a few blankets? Becasue it's kind of chilly in here..."") However, as the movie goes on we slowly see her character transfrom; from the moment that Kelly insults her (""Keep your paws off my underwear""), Hart realizes that the only way to gain respect is to play it tough, and that she does. By the end of the film she seems heartless and self-absorbed, basking in her new-found fame even while still in jail. Her bitterness towards Kelly turns its ugly head toward anyone else who dares step in her way (warning: mild spoiler coming up- it doesn't ruin the movie's end) and even fakes a pregnancy to achieve more fame (okay spoiler over). Catherine Zeta-Jones deserves a truckload of Oscars for her turn as Velma Kelly. From the start of her magnificent dance number for ""All That Jazz"" we see her as a seasoned veteran, a girl who knows how to pack a punch with her razzle-dazzle. As the cops enter the club she is performing she gives them an aggressive motion amongst her dance moves, and from there she's sent to the big house. ""Half of Chicago"" was there to see her get arrested, in her own words, and for that she too is bitter. As Roxie comes to greet her in awe, Kelly replies with a snide comment from which the latter quote is extracted. Her character is portrayed as the ""Bad Guy"" in the movie, if that title doesn't better suit the police and government. Though her feelings of jealousy that Roxie has stolen her fame are bad, they are also very real; who wouldn't, in that situation, feel jealous that a young rival has stolen you career, lawyer, and trial date? While Zellweger's coos are lovely, it's Zeta-Jones's singing that steals the show. Her voice resounds throughout the whole theatre (or living room), and every scence she's in- singing or not- she's the best. One has to give credit to Richard Gere for taking this role; though he's a lead, this is truly a movie about the two females. Yet his role as the lawyer who claims to only care about love but truly cares about money is an interesting one. By the way, his voice is impressive- he can really hold a note. The most intriguing thing about his character surrounds his ambition for fame, if he has one. About halfway in the film, at the peak of Roxie's fame, Velma Kelly, half kissing-up, warns Roxie that ""Billy Flynn's number one client is Billy Flynn"" before walking away, leaving Roxie to ponder whether she's really the star of the show. Her suspicions are further supported by the press conference she holds soon thereafter, in which Flynn says everything for Hart (including a fantastic musical sequence). The viewer is left to decide for him or herself whether Billy Flynn tries to steal the limelighs. Additionally, the viewer is left wodnering whether Flynn takes Hart's case because he truly admires her husband for taking the blame every after being the victim of adultery or whether he just needs the money. Queen Latifah and John C Reilly's marvelous singing both raise eyebrows, and Reilly does the best he can with an othersiwe one-dimensional character. Many of the musical numbers are in Roxie's imagination- for sequences like ""Cell Block Tango"" and ""I Can't Do It Alone"" she is simply a spectator to seemingly real singing and dancing, but the lights and stages and backup dancing are all imagined in her mind. This is very innovative; Marshall chooses to do this in order to make the numbers seem more grand than they really are. The musical numbers are very catchy as well; ""All That Jazz"" is one of the movie's two ""real"" numbers (not imagined by Hart) but is the one you'll be humming the way home, while ""They Both Reached for the Gun"", which features Flynn controlling the almost-scary-looking Hart as a ventriloquist to a dummy, finished spectacularly and is another memorable one. It's the perfect comment on the press; they'll eat up any story weaved by a great storyteller like Flynn. The fact that he lies about nearly everything provides perfect satire for the legal system; it'll eat up any story weaved by a great storyteller like Flynn. Finally, the fact that Hart is portrayed as a dummy parallels her and Flynn's relationship- Hart's got the pretty face, but the brain is all in Flynn's head. I would go on further but I'm pretty sure that I'm nearing the word limit, because I could go on forever about the symbolism in this movie. If you have any other questions just ask me- I've seen this movie 8 times and own the DVD so I should know ;)   Go see this one for yourself; you won't regret it.**** out of ****",Chicago
569,athousanddreams,Deserved the Oscar,9,12 July 2003,"One of the best movie musicals I've seen.  Second only to Moulin Rouge. The songs are great, the choreography is great, the acting is great.  Renee, Catherine, Richard, Queen Latifah, John C. Reilley were all great.  Who knew they could dance & sing so well?  Too bad they removed ""Class"" -- I heard they put it back in for the rerelease, but I missed it.  I'll have to wait for the DVD, I'll definately be picking that up!9/10",Chicago
570,hackeron-1,Speechless...,10,22 March 2004,"After seeing Moulin Rouge, I was partly disappointed. It was a wonderful spectacular show, but I have seen so many musicals and operas that all share same story, it wasn't something that put much of an impression on me. I may be wrong, and I will surely watch it again to compare but I was simple speechless after Chicago while only vaguely impressed with Moulin Rouge.This is just such an uncommon scenario and while sexy, witty and funny, also extremely deep and disturbing. The scene of the hungarian disappearing act, the 'we both reached for the gun' scene. It just gives a picture, no matter how exagurated, of what the world we living in is like. Its all a show, and we must do all we can to survive.This movie has also made me finally believe Renee truly deserved the Oscar. She's given meaning to the words: stupidness, shyness, fear, emptyness, confidence, madness and charm all in just 1.5 hours. I have never seen acting like this, switching between personalities every few minutes with such accuracy of character and making the viewer really get into her character so much it becomes scary.The rest of the cast was also, extremely well chosen, and did a superb job, without any flaws or criticism, but it was well covered in other reviews, so I do not wish to simply repeat.Also a fantastic ending, showing Roxy turned her dream to reality, at great costs, but she made it!PS, just a small observation about Moulin Rouge is what gave it such a high rating on IMDB was the high votes of the under 18s, while Chicago scores higher among the older audience, no pun or flame intended, just a fact.I rate this 10/10",Chicago
571,register_register2002,"Well-directed, well-acted, well-shot but ultimately not memorable",7,16 May 2004,"I'm a fan of the musical form, ""My Fair Lady,"" ""Les Miserables"" numbering among favorites, but of the few screen adaptations I've viewed I've yet to see one I enjoyed even half as much as the stage version. I've not seen ""Chicago"" on stage but I'm sure it would be no exception.For me the true mark of a fine musical is the music, melodies that stick with you long after the storyline has faded, such as the half dozen each from ""My Fair Lady,"" ""Oklahoma,"" or ""South Pacific."" But the music of Fosse's ""Chicago"" (pleasant but forgettable outside of ""All That Jazz"" and ""Mr. Cellophane"") is not the standout, it's the dance--in this direction well-choreographed and well-shot but diminished in grandeur through the lens of the camera. Had I been audience to the dance and spectacle on stage, I may have dismissed the slow-moving, semi-compelling storyline, the mediocre music.After the cinematography and direction, the set and costuming seemed seamless and fully transported me back to the era of flappers and the cabaret. Gere, Zellweger and Zeta-Jones all turned in fine acting jobs though were clearly cast first for their star power rather than their able but unexceptional singing and dancing skills.Rate: 7 out of 10.",Chicago
572,blu_razberry-1,Vastly entertaining,9,13 May 2005,"Can you say OBSESSION? hehe I spent a few weeks singing and dancing to the Chicago soundtrack. Definitely worth seeing, this movie.It's about a woman named Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) whose biggest dream is to become a jazz star like Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) She hooks up with Fred Casely who says he can get her into show biz, but when she finds out he lied she shoots him dead and is shipped off to Cook County Jail for women where she awaits sentencing to death.There, she meets up again with Velma Kelly, the jazz star who got arrested for the murders of her husband and sister. Hehe it looks like everyone gets arrested for a murder, but Roxie is saved when the warden of the jail, Mama Morton (Queen Latifah) gets her a phone call to Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), a lawyer who really knows how to lie to a court. Not that Roxie hasn't got any tricks of her own. She fakes pregnancy just when she starts to lose her fame and wins the attentions of the world. Pretending to be a innocent girl, rather than the shameless fame-loving murderess she really is, it's odd how we all love her anyways. :P The upshot of the story is that all the guilty people win out in the end. Both Velma and Roxie are acquitted and they have no problem winning over the jazz world as a team and becoming big stars.The great things about this flick? Catchy songs, catchy dances, great storyline, etc. I can definitely see how it won Best Picture. There's also this kind of sense of female empowerment, because in this story the strong women definitely get everything they want, including revenge on the men who wronged them, even if the revenge is rather murderous.And who knew that Renee Zellweger could really sing? She belts it out pretty well even if the songs are easy to sing. Her dancing and acting are great too, no complaints here. Catherine Zeta-Jones is in her element since she started out on a Broadway sort of affair before becoming an actress and Richard Gere plays his part as the sly lawyer well, not to mention the fact that he sings and tap dances. The cast is pretty strong.There are actually no true morals in the storyline - my only complaint. All of the good people like Roxie's husband, Amos, lose their happy ending when the bad people get exactly what they want. The only woman innocent of murder in Cook County Jail is hanged, while murderesses get off. However, this just adds to the movie's irony that kind of sends a message that good people don't always win. Still, there's something catchy about Chicago's plot, not to mention the music and dancing. All in all, definitely worth seeing.",Chicago
573,dumbblonde416,My favorite movie!,10,1 August 2005,"This was such a great movie. When I first saw it, I didn't think I would like it too much, because I normally don't like movies about murders and crimes, but this was more of a comedy than a gory, murder mystery. I was amazed at the skill and talents of the actors. Catherine Zeta-Jones, although I expected this since she has been singing and dancing since she was a little girl, still stunned me with her expertise. She has a beautiful deep voice that resonates in her songs, and can dance better than any movie star I've ever seen. Her acting was also flawless, and I found myself being glad that she and Renee got out in the end, because even though she plays a character in the movie that everyone is supposed to hate because she is mean to Roxie (Renee), I still found myself liking her best. Renee Zellweger was extraordinary, and it amazed me that she could sing as well as she did with never having sung in a film before. She was a beginner at the singing as well as the 20's style dancing; but she pulled it off like a pro. She also has a gift of likability, because even though I found her character of Roxie Hart unbelievably whiny and selfish, I still liked Renee! Richard Gere was great, too, especially with his tap-dance that he worked forever on. He plays the style of a suave, debonair, sleazy lawyer just right! All in all,I give this movie a 10, because it always kept me entertained, and it is one of the movies that you can watch over and over again, which I have! :)",Chicago

The question however remained: Would the world, or at at least movie going public ever except a real,  motion picture musical built in the same manner of the great musicals of the past? ..and more importantly, would CHICAGO be that musical?Hold on to your hats folks, because I tell you with great glee and not quite a little bit of shock, ""Chicago: the movie""  is everything a great film musical should be, More so, in fact, it's everything a great film should be.It stands slightly behind ""Y tu Mama Tambien"", as my favorite film of the year.Brilliant direction and choreography. A talented cast. Glorious lighting and production values and an excellent screenplay add up to an exciting and enjoyable two hours.It seems a lot of people dislike Catherine Zeta Jones for reasons that I've never really understood (I mean is she anymore obnoxious than anyone else in Hollywood).  All I know is those haters are going to get down on their knees and bow to this woman.  Miss Jones delivers, in no uncertain terms, a magnificent performance.  A fantastic dancer, a terrific singer, a sublime presence, all her talent comes to a raging boil in her big number ""I can't do it alone"". Jones attacks this number like a lion attacking a predator and beats it to the ground with such affirmation, it  leaves one wondering if Bebe and indeed Chita, were really any better.Great Praise, indeed.If someone would have told me 7 years ago that Renee Zellweger would become one of the most  talented and versatile actors working in film today, well, I would have scoffed but  Miss Zellweger  as Roxie is as near perfect as one could wish for.  I have heard people saying that Miss. Zellweger  is not the accomplished singer and dancer Miss. Jones is.  What they are forgetting or ignoring is the incredible fact that she can sing and dance at all. Her marvelous face and her dead on acting is complemented by a lovely singing voice (oddly reminiscent of a young Peggy Lee) and although she is perhaps a more athletic than graceful dancer, Zellweger  is a mighty force to reckon with. She deserves whatever nominations will come her way
Richard Gere, in a sentence, gives the performance of his life. Gere, obviously having a helluva time, singing with brio (not a lovely sound but bolstered by a good range) and dancing with real ability. Acting wise he is alive alert and quite funny here.Queen Latifa  was good in her song. But honestly she didn't do much for me. John C. Reilly, as the hapless Amos, did.  His performance of ""Mr. Cellophane"" was beautifully executed (with one of the better voices in the cast) and  combined with the heartbreaking sweetness of his performance should help to earn Mr. Reilly an Academy Award nomination. All in all, a great night at the movies....and a great night for musicals, too.",Chicago

I know that they has to have stars to ""sell"" the movie (b/c musical movies haven't been very popular for the last 30 years), but couldn't they have picked stars who could sing and dance?  John C.

579,XvPanteraX,Chicagoan's Point of View On The Musical Of The Century,10,3 January 2003,"WOW. Is the one word that I could say for how I felt after watching this movie. I went hoping and praying that it would be decent because it held such high regard, a little disappointed for a few weeks because only select theaters in the Chicagoland Area were playing it. This movie not only survives as just a good movie, but actually holds up as an incredible musical in an age where musicals are nearly unheard of vs. the 40s, 50s, and 60s where that's all that was playing.   Instead of the average musical where the actors stop and break into song and dance all of the sudden making the whole aspect of real-life seem unfathomable, they keep the movie as a movie and the singing and dancing numbers as their own. While a character may be acting in the movie part, they'll cut to that same character singing a song and dancing while cutting back to the character in real life. It may not make too much sense to you now, but believe me how it was done was just ingenius to say the least.   Among other things the movie also contains conspiracy, humor, love, jealousy, it covers all angels of the human psyche, while still dazzling us with singing and dance numbers. A few people not show in the previews also make their own little cameos which were an added bonus.   If you are a Chicagoan as I am it is also fun to view this Old Time Chicago and hear familiar places and streets that exist today like, ""Cook County Prison"", ""Lakeshore Dr."", and ""Cicero"". While being a Chicagoan while experiencing Chicago has it's pluses, people from all over the WORLD should bare witness to this great piece of work. It's a thousand times better then the last musical we had...Moulin Rouge, and if you can find a theater near you that has it, do yourself an insanely huge favor. Long live Chicago.",Chicago

581,tubkas,Unique Movie Musical,8,19 January 2007,"Movie musicals are rather few and far between when you look beyond the confines of animation which seems to require that the characters sing for some reason, and Chicago gives us a bit of a unique format for a musical setting. Rather than Rodgers & Hammerstein's classic scene-song-change format, we get musicals numbers interspersed within other scenes set like they are actually musical numbers behind the regular storyline.Fortunately, we are also given a decent reason for seeing it happen like this.Roxie Hart is a wannabe star who is going out with a guy who promises her that he knows a guy who can make her a star. One evening, he reveals that he only told her all this to get some action out of her, and so she kills him and ends up on death row. The songs are frequent and serve to fill out the characters of those who sing them in most cases, with the exception of the notable tap dance number in the climax of the court scene which was nothing short of clever.Roxie meets a host of colorful characters in prison while waiting for her trial including another wannabe/has been by the name of Velma Kelley, who was the big name in the news under the lawyer-ship of Billy Flynn until Roxie came along and whisked the newspapers out from under her (until Roxie gets her dramatic irony). Velma moves from flippant to desperate as Roxie takes the whole spotlight away from her, and almost sends Roxie up the river in a final attempt to get herself off.I see the musical numbers as the way Roxie sees the world. She is so desperate to become that big name on stage that she sees the world as a night club stage and everyone in the world players in a cabaret type show. Hence, all the musical numbers (except the deleted scene) occur ""on stage"" while real life goes on behind them. It's a fascinating device for a musical and only slips up in one way: a musical needs some plot songs too.The songs primarily advance characters as they introduce themselves or react to situations; the tap dance number was the only one that advanced the plot. This means that every time a character reacted or introduced, the plot came to a grinding standstill as they sang. This is okay in the beginning, but near the end, we needed the songs to advance the plot as the character sang, and not continue with just show numbers; this is the reason I enjoyed the tap dance courtroom number so much because it advanced the plot and integrated itself with the scene. Very cool.This was a fun, simple little story with some nice musical numbers and some interesting characters. I can see why it did so well. Not a bad viewing at all.",Chicago

This movie was sooo great and was awesome from the very first shot to the very last. The musical numbers were awesome - my favorites are The Cell Block Tango and Roxie. I was soo glad that none of the main cast (Jones, Zellweger, Gere, Riley) had other people do the singing for them and they all had great voices - I was particularly surprised at how good Jones and Zellweger's voices were. I loved the choreography and the costume and set design, everything was amazing. Having been in a high school musical production of ""Chicago"" (I was Roxie!!) I know the long hours and time and dedication the WHOLE cast and crew would've had to have had when filming this. There were nights when I wouldn't get home until 1 from practice and then I would have to get up at 4 to be at the school by 5!!Overall the movie was really good - the acting was a bit iffy, but the singing and dancing more than made up for it. Also, Renee Zellweger looked a little scrawny and bony - much different from her healthy look in Jerry Maguire or even Empire Records. But, hey, thus the evolution of a actress who's moved up on the Hollywood social chain, I guess. I give Chicago 10 out of 10 stars.",Chicago
583,tehknophiliac,The worst movie I've ever walked out of.,1,12 May 2003,"I very rarely walk out of movies.  Even the worst have some redeeming value. I sat there, my jaw dropping in my lap, my brain astounded by the assault of pure un-adulterated crap and the Hollywood/Las Vegas imitation of a first night failed show, to rival ""The Producers"" attempt to put on a sure-fire failure musical about Hitler and make it fail for sure. Only this show didn't fail, the audience didn't get the joke and I guess it was like a Fellini film, incomprehensible, astoundingly bad and so horrible that the audience all must have thought someone smarter than them must know better, so like all good sheeple they filed dutifully out exclaiming the virtues of piles of steaming longhorn patties, baked mongoose feces and parboiled urine cakes called ""Chicago"".",Chicago
584,jimroman,An Instant Classic!,10,7 December 2002,"""Chicago"" is the best movie musical made in my lifetime. Even better than ""West Side Story,"" this film is in a league with ""Singing In The Rain,"" an instant classic. We'll see this dazzling film again often.Following the original stage conceit, the story is told as a series of racy vaudeville numbers which move the plot while steadily commenting on it. Switching between actions in the jails and courts of Jazz Age Chicago to the fantasies behind a proscenium that represent those same actions, Rob Marshall's film finds even greater depth in the stories of Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly  than their original source. And what performances bring those characters to life! Renee Zellweger as Roxie and Catherine Zeta- Jones as Velma sing and dance in star-turns that leave us breathless. And so do the other girls. While there's not that much flesh flashed, this vaudeville show is naughty, thanks to the vision of the original stage Director  Bob Fosse. Here's the chick-flick that will keep guys lining up for more.Equally terrific are Queen Latifah, Richard Gere (he tap-dances!), Taye Diggs, and John C. Reilly. Credits at the film's conclusion confirm that no stunt-doubles sang or danced for  Richard, Renee, and Catherine, who may start new careers in the music business! Kander & Ebb's Broadway musical ""Chicago,"" opened just weeks after ""A Chorus Line"" wowwed theatergoers to tears. Directed by Bob Fosse, fresh from his ""Cabaret"" success on film, ""Chicago"" s praises were lost amidst ""A Chorus Line's"" acclaim. Twenty-five years later, ""Chicago"" arrives ablaze onscreen. It's sassy dialog and cynical wit play refreshingly well to the audience in 2002.Somewhere in the heavens, the late Bob Fosse is smiling. Somewhere in a theater, you'll be smiling too, again and again.",Chicago
585,UselessRob,"For the love of all things holy, just stop singing for a minute!!",2,12 March 2003,"WORTH IT FOR: Well, the cinema's seats were kind of comfy...IMHO: Ok listen, I want to make it clear that I don't hate musicals. Sure, I don't love them, but that doesn't mean I'm going to hate a movie just because it's a musical. I'd rather judge them on a musical by musical basis. For example, I quite liked Moulin Rouge and I thoroughly enjoyed South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut, and they're both musicals. I did not, however, like Chicago much, for several reasons. Firstly I think there's a line between ""ok so they sing a bit"" musicals and ""for the love of Jeff stop singing for a minute!"" bionic musicals that should not be crossed. This thing tap dances on that line's grave. There are long stretches where they just don't stop singing. One song ends, 2 words are spoken, and before you know it the musics started up again. This might not matter if more than one or two of the songs were slightly catchy, toe tappin' tunes. But they aren't, and that's my second complaint. Maybe they are great tunes and the non-stop-edness of it made them all bleed together into one big thing? But I doubt it. Thirdly, somewhere along the way I've picked up the impression that most musicals have a comedic element. Some part of them that is funny. This thing tries to be funny in parts, but rarely succeeds. Sure there's the odd giggle, but there is not one big laugh. Forthly, what's wrong with Renee Zellweger's head? She spends the entire flick with a stupid pouty look on her face. It's as if she's busy sucking a toffee or has something stuck in her teeth she doesn't want you to see. On top of that she over-acts the whole thing as if she's in some cheap-ass school production. And that brings me to what annoyed me the most: This is a movie isn't it? Then why do they seem to have gone to so much trouble making it look like a stage production? If you're going to make a movie out of a stage show I would expect you to do something special. Something that can't be done on stage that requires it to be a film. But besides the quick cuts, instant costume changes and the lack of an interval, there's really not much in this that couldn't be done as good, if not better, on the stage. So what's the point of making it into a movie?? Sure, I understand that parts of the story are like Roxie's fantasies that everythings a show or whatever, but that's no excuse! That just means that this is completely the wrong choice to be made into a movie. When I'm sitting in a cinema washing down popcorn with enough salt on it to choke a zebra, with overpriced, watered down coke I expect to see something beyond what can be done on stage. What's worse is it feels like a stage show, yet when you heckle it doesn't put the actors off! So yelling ""Gee nice tap dancing, buddy"" doesn't have any effect! And before you start throwing things are your monitor in an attempt to injure me, let me tell you that I'm not the only one who felt like this. I checked without others who've seen it to see if there was something wrong with me. There is, but it's nothing to do with this movie. Now, I haven't seen the stage version of this (and I doubt I ever will now), but I would think that if you have, and you liked it, that you'd be even more disappointed with this. All that said, I didn't walk out, and it never seemed to drag on, so it can't be all bad. Maybe it's just not for me? Maybe I missed the ultra-interesting storyline because of all the endless singing? Maybe I should stick to watching more intellectual musicals like the aforementioned South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut? Who knows. If you dig endless show tunes and watching school plays you'll probably love this. But I didn't.SCORE: 2 / 10",Chicago
586,washsem2001,Pure spectacle. Exactly the point.,10,9 March 2003,"""Chicago"" is a masterpiece on two levels. On the surface it's possibly the best time you'll have at the movies all year: wild, exhilarating, and fun, with rapid-fire wit, terrific music, and spectacular choreography. It's almost impossible to watch ""Chicago"" without a grin on your face: the music is just so catchy, the dancing is just so exciting, the lights and the sound are just so dazzling, and the actors are just so darn cheerful. (Even the brilliantly melancholy John C. Reilly belts out the heartbreaking ""Mr. Cellophane"" with a smile.)(MINOR SPOILERS IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.)But on a deeper level, ""Chicago"" is a stinging and poignant critique of modern American society: the flaws of the legal system, the harsh reality of capital punishment, and the unfailing willingness of Americans to ditch substance for style. Whether the ladies of Murderers' Row are convicted or acquitted depends, not on whether or not they're actually guilty, but on whether they can get the best lawyer...and ""the best lawyer"" is the one who's best at turning the trial into a circus. Billy Flynn (Gere) works the audience--sorry, the jury--like P.T. Barnum, his flashy showmanship always triumphing over fact. Those poorer women who can't afford Billy's 5000-dollar fee are (literally) hung out to dry--whether they're actually guilty or not. (It's telling that the only woman we see executed in ""Chicago"" is also the only woman who is actually innocent. Innocence, it turns out, is a liability in this corrupt system, in which you have to lie in order to win.) Billy, the master puppeteer, manipulates the media as easily as the jury, working up public sympathy with a touching (and completely made-up) sob story.There are numerous sobering parallels between the world of ""Chicago"" and the America of today. The O.J. Simpson trial, among many others, shows us that the real American legal system is just as flawed, and in all the same ways, as ""Chicago""'s fictional courtroom was. (Maybe the Lorena Bobbitt trial is a more appropriate example.) The real-life governor of Illinois, George Ryan, has just granted clemency to every single death-row inmate in the state after DNA evidence cleared almost thirty falsely-convicted prisoners (in Illinois alone!) who had been waiting for their own execution. (How many ""Hungarian disappearing acts"" have there been?)Of course, ""Chicago"" is not the kind of movie that makes you think about these things. In fact ""Chicago"" isn't the kind of movie that makes you think at all. ""Chicago"" is a fun ride, a dazzling experience, with catchy songs, tap dances, flashy costumes and happy jazz that can't help but put a smile on your face. And when you exit the theater or shut off the VCR you'll be humming some song you have stuck in your head or talking about how great the acting was, and the fundamental flaws of American society will be the last thing on your mind... ...which is exactly the whole point. ""Chicago,"" like Billy Flynn, razzle-dazzles us into submission, hits us with such a barrage of lights and sound and spectacle that the deep and serious message flitters by completely unnoticed. And we the audience, like the jury, are utterly taken in by it. We--us, me and you, sitting there watching this movie--*we* are the biggest suckers of them all. Don't believe me? Read the comments below about how the movie is all style and no substance, so much flash and nothing to show for it. That's it right there.""Chicago"" is really a horrifying story. Roxie Hart, so pathologically deluded that she views the world as her own personal cabaret theater and other people as either her costars or her audience, works with a terribly corrupt warden and a spectacularly corrupt lawyer to get acquitted, any way she can, for a murder she proudly committed. Fun stuff. But like the public in the movie, we focus on the flash and dazzle, and utterly forget about the sleaze and deceit and crime.""Chicago,"" at bottom, is about how we all get suckered in by a catchy song, a touching image, a celebrity--about how we can all be led, like puppets, to follow the flashy, colorful, and meaningless, blindly ignoring what's really important--so much that we don't even see it's there, even if it's right in front of us. (""Razzle-dazzle 'em,"" Billy sings, ""and they'll never catch wise."") In this sense, ""Chicago"" is not only the most fun movie of the year, but also, very possibly, the most important as well.10/10.",Chicago
587,czsnow,"Spell-binding, twice!",10,12 May 2003,"On an evening with nothing scheduled, my husband and I decided to take in a movie - Chicago. From the very opening shot, the pacing, energy, visual acrobatics, and music kept us riveted to the screen, almost afraid to blink lest we miss something. We have actually paid to see it a second time. A very rare thing for us. We seldom go to the movies in the first place, but to repeat a film, now THAT is a exceptional. When it is available to buy, we will get it. It is not a movie if you are wanting something calm and soothing because calm and soothing it is not! If you want something to wake you up and get you humming - this is it.",Chicago
588,ballerinadreamer,"Dancing, Singing, Murder, Sex and all that Jazz- Wow!!!",10,22 February 2003,"This movie musical has it all, bringing a classic musical into a format that contemporary viewers can enjoy and understand.  Intertwining story and song, performance and reality, Chicago stuns us with a fantastic soundtrack, a fantastic storyline, complimented by a fantastic cast.Catherine Zita Jones (with her West End musical background) sizzles as the dark beauty Velma, while cute Roxie is played with skill by Renee Zellweger. Richard Gere brings the characteristic, smooth charmer Billy to life. When I first saw the cast for this I remember wondering ""They can sing and dance???"" Yes, they certainly can!!  Zellweger isn't quite as skilled a dancer and singer as Jones however her performance does nothing to detract from the movie.The Cell Block Tango would have to be my favourite musical number, with fantastic choreography and great effects with the sillhouettes.
The movie combines comedy, murder, intrigue and all that jazz for a combination that will delight audiences and help give the musical genre greater recognition amougst the general public.",Chicago
589,ultimatexman,OK-but Spider-man should get the oscar nomination if this one did,1,20 February 2003,This is a movie that has a very loose plot and the director obviously is very amateurish. Throughout the entire production pointless dance scenes areinterspliced with little explanation. The director's job is to make sure that the movie flows smoothly and tells a single-or multiple cohesive storylines. This movie makes you feel like your head would were it bounced backward andforward without point.  The intersplicing of the dances makes the whole thing rather jerky and confusing. Also the jokes come off rather flat. I rather liked Richard Gere's lawyer tho.,Chicago
590,srussell10036,Succeeds beyond expectation,10,2 January 2003,"Rob Marshall has succeeded at what many may have thought was impossible. He has brought a stage musical to the screen with all of its jazziness, flash and finger-snapping, toe-tapping energy.  This success must also give credit to screenwriter Bill Condon (""Gods & Monsters"") who while keeping much of the stage book has expanded upon it in a few inventive and intelligent ways. Since this is Marshall's first big-screen attempt (his previous director and/or choreographer credits all on TV), I suppose mention must also be given to Martin Walsh (editor) and Dion Beebe (cinematographer) for helping give ""Chicago"" its ""look"".  A few cast members are wasted such as Taye Diggs, Dominic West and Lucy Liu, though a pleasure to have them around. Christine Baranski is as always a pro who you wish had more screen time. Queen Latifah is surprisingly good, John C. Reilly is the movie's heart and soul as Amos.  Zeta-Jones we knew had a musical theatre career (in London) before the movies stole her away so her wonderful performance is less a surprise than that of Gere and Zellweger.  Zellweger is the only cast member who never came near a musical whether it be professionally or in college (Gere at one time was in the original Broadway production of ""Grease""). She's obviously worked hard and it's paid off.  It's a delight to watch her transform from sort-of vulnerable to hardened conniver.  She even holds her own with Zeta-Jones in the final dance duet.  Gere may be a better actor than a singer but I can't remember the last time he was so animated.  He grabs the role and runs with it and seems to be having a ball.  Out of five numbers cut for the movie, the one I truly miss is ""I Am My Own Best Friend"".  ""Class"" was supposedly filmed and will be on the DVD.  The new Kander & Ebb song over the final credits, ""I Move On"", is okay.  But, why?  Is there some Academy rule about what defines Best Original Song?  This movie is heaven and nowadays that's saying alot.",Chicago

It was so awful.  20 minutes of movie and already 5 songs...  Too much for my brain to bear...  I went to see it at a theatre, because this thing got nominated 13 times.  Thirteen bleeding times. My girlfriend said: ""It's with Richard Gere, Zeta-Jones and Zellweger.  So I think I'll like it."" Forget about it. I ran out of the theatre after a scene where drops of water were falling.

593,l-trane,Stunningly brilliant,9,8 March 2003,The interplay here between the world of Roxy's (Zellweger's) imagination and the real world of the Chicago fame game is absolutely brilliant.  The choreography is stunning throughout and the film never resorts to song and dance just for the sake of it.  Every musical number seems to move the plot of the movie along and it just feels natural (which is not something I ever felt about Moulin Rouge) with each of the actors playing their dual role in the real world and the stage world effortlessly.  The editing is absolutely amazing.  Highly recommended.,Chicago

The only people that should have won anything are Andrew M. Stearn, Gordon Sim, or Colleen Atwood and ideally only if it was a Tony not a movie award. I was expecting something special from this movie as it beat out several films I really enjoyed AND I felt as though I might like it as much as Moulin Rouge but Chicago didn't have any of the originality, acting, or singing that Moulin Rouge has.

595,Daftdinosaur69,But Oh I love my life! ..and ALL THAT JAZZ!,10,31 December 2002,"They pulled it Off....And for the longest of time, I really didn't think they wouldn't. I had big doubts on this reproduction of CHICAGO...the legendary vaudeville musical..onto the screen. What a strange choice for Roxie Hart? What a strange musical to pick to do a movie? In the show most of the time the stage is bare...what the heck were they going to do to make this work?.....Whatever you did Rob Marshall...don't tell us your secrets...magicians never tell...you pulled off magic....Chicago is the groundstone of the modern movie-musical. I think we're witnessing a rebirth. Not only is it the groundstone for the modern movie-musical, but this movie-musical ranks amongst 'West Side Story' and 'Cabaret'.What makes it work is for the most part Academy Award winner (Gods & Monsters) Bill Condon's script. What a masterpiece. It managed to retain the script of the show, add lines from the original play in which the musical was based on, and add a bit of his own wit and masterwork.
Carrying out the script is a remarkable cast full of hidden talents. They all perform vibrantly and the only thing left for you to do is applaud their genious. John C. Reilly is remarkable as the poor lonely Amos Hart. Queen Latifah not only pulled it off as Matron Mama Morton...she WAS Matron Mama Morton...I didn't think she could do it...but she strutted her stuff saying 'Put that in your pipe and smoke it'...Richard Gere was an amazing surprise, his tap dancing number is so intense it makes you sweat, and yup! That's really him...holy bajeebus...even the cameos are great.And onto our leading ladies: Catherine Zeta Jones.......oh catherine.....her performance makes you want to jump for joy...she puts everything she's got into making Velma...into dancing Velma..into singing Velma....her dance numbers are sooo hot....you'd think they were making her dance at gun point..she dances her heart out and deserves and Oscar for her performance which quite reminded me of the vibrance and energy Rita Moreno had in her oscar winning turn as Anita in West Side Story. Renee Zellweger is charming and witty. Her performance has got to be the best of her career. And who knew she could do it??? I didn't...When she gets in that silver bead outfit for 'Roxie' your jaw is dropping..your tongue is drooling...And when those two girls get together for their finale, they are dancing like there is no tomorrow. The finale is jawdropping and beautiful.The dance numbers are beautiful thanks to Rob Marhsall's directing and choreography...and applause to Dion Beebe...the cinematographer of the year in my mind....bringing us the perfect atmosphere for what is CHICAGO...the lighting is fabulous and reminds us perfectly of the movie-musicals of the 30s and 40s....the best use of cinematography in my eyes was in the stunningly beautiful dance number 'Roxie'..filmed around rows of mirrors....its a masterpiece...definately Oscar worthy..Other valuable assets are John Myhre's production design, Colleen Atwood's beautiful costumes, and Martin Walsh's outstanding film editting...all deserve an Academy Award...Look out for the new song at the end of the credits...""I Move On""..written by John Kander and Fred Ebb...CHICAGO is a masterpiece and the best film of the year and the best movie musical since ALL THAT JAZZ in 1979.",Chicago
596,knarlysheila,curiosity for crime,10,19 March 2003,"This film is set in the early 1900's, as is evident from the costume and set designs.  The story revolves around Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) and her fantasy of becoming a Broadway star, and her criminal record.  She is accused of murder and winds up in jail with her idol Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who is in jail on the same conviction.  In jail she is introduced to the head warden, Matron ""Mama"" Morton (Queen Latifah) who guides Roxie, and the other inmates, through jail while also profitting off them by way of favors.  While in jail she is accompanied by other women on death row and enlists the help of the famous lawyer, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), who has a reputation of getting female offenders a not guilty verdict.  A twist in the plot pits Roxie against Velma in a fight for their freedom and their fame.  Chicago introduces the world of the female criminal, and also the fame and media attention that often follows high profile cases, and how those cases become high profile. The director used the medium of musical to portray this story.  The musical aspect of the movie is set in the fantasy world of Roxie and the other characters.  In one scene, the inmates reveal how they had gotten to jail through song.  The setting for the musical section is a stage, elaboratly lighted.  The costumes were also reminiscent of the era and of Broadway shows.  Chicago was originally a Broadway show, and the director did a fantastic job of bringing this classic to the screen.  The costumes and set were phenomenal, but the singing was magical.  These actors took on the challange of singing and dancing, even if it was not their strong suit in the past.  Thier performances were outstanding, and from the point of view of a amateur movie watcher and critic, it was surprising and impressive to know that is was their own voices, not an overdub.  With Queen Latifah having the only background in music, it was refreshing to see the actors expand and explore their own abilities.  As a viewer it was most enjoyable to watch on screen. The content of the movie I found very refreshing also.  It was a humorous look at female offender crimes, and the hype that some offenders recieve. Roxie enlists the help of a high prfile lawyer, Billy Flynn, whose apprach to law is to make the offender famous, and appeal to the peoplpe's curiosity of criminals, especially female criminals.  This sentiment rings true in our society, and other films, such as Natural Born Killers (Oliver Stone) have addressed this very issue.  We have seen many murder cases on the news, and have followed them intently; this film expresses the curiosity of us all of criminal acts and those who enact them.  Overall, I found this movie to be very entertaining and would recommend anyone go and see it.",Chicago

Being a fan of the era and jazz music in particular, I expected to enjoy the music more than I did.  It had its moments, but I felt that the music shone brightest in what I consider to be 'secondary' songs, like 'Mr. Cellophane' and 'We Both Reached for the Gun', rather than the blockbuster sizzler 'main' songs, like 'Cell Block Tango' or 'Roxie'.An enjoyable movie, and worth seeing on the big screen, but not one I would buy and wouldn't be missing out by waiting for it as a rental.",Chicago

She was the force behind this movie, although the others did very good jobs. Renee Zellweger has always been a bit... scrunchy for me, but I thought that she carried her songs very well.  She was good for the role of Rozie.  Queen Latifa was also very good.  I thought it was asthetically very beautiful. It really was very dazziling.  The costumes and set were beautiful, and the score was arranged to completely catch the mood.  I thought it was beautiful, entertaining, and easy to sit through.

Its because the main female stars of the movie kill men. And not only do they get away with it, they become famous stars become of it! I think it must be a guilty little pleasure women get seeing female characters getting away we being so terrible. Especially towards the opposite sex.

Whilst in prison both characters meet a variety of different characters including Matron Momma Morton(Queen Latifah) and the silver tongued lawyer of the courtroom Mr Billy Flinn(Richard Gere).

Coming out of this with nothing is Mr Cellophane Amos, Roxies invisible husband.

Both Velma and Roxie find themselves on death row and are fighting for fame.This story takes place in 1920s Chicago about a young girl who dreams of stardom, a night club singer, and a lawyer who they hope can help make their acquittal certain & make them huge stars. I was impressed with the director's work and I was quite surprised that the film is the winner of six Oscars. This film includes some great supporting stars: Taye Diggs, Queen Latifah, Christine Baranski and Lucy Lu.The actors did a great deal of work with their roles. First off, I am quite surprised at Renee Zellweger's work. Zenee Zellweger (Down With Love, Jerry Maguire) portrays a young girl named Roxie Hart who dreams to become a famous night club singer. Her role was in a way different from her previous roles and her acting is much better in this film. She also did a fine job with her singing as well. Catherine Zeta-Jones (The Mask of Zorro, Entrapment) plays a night club singer named Velma Kelly who fights for fame after finding herself on death row. She's a really good actress and I am very impressed with her acting and singing. Richard Gere (Runaway Bride, Shall We Dance) plays a lawyer named Billy Fynn who helps Velma and Roxie win their case by twisting their stories of what happened when they murdered their loved ones. He also did a fine job with his role as well. The rest of the cast did great with their roles in the film.And all I can say in conclusion: ""BRAVO! BRAVO! What a razzle dazzle showbiz that was!""

The music was funny, clever, dark, sensual, unforgettable, and over all probably the best musical soundtrack, along with Jesus Christ Superstar and The Producers. The art direction and set design were pitch perfect, and darkly vibrant. The mood was dark yet not depressing, it was very fun to watch even though it's about murder and a lot of the movie takes place in a prison.The cast is the best thing this movie has going for it. Renae Zellweger is great as Roxie Hart and shows Roxie's desire for the spotlight with great truth. Even though I've heard a lot of complaints about Richard Gere's Performance I thought it was fantastic. He played it kind of low key and conservative, which was great because it really let's the spotlight shine on the stars of the show. Richard's character Billy Flynn was sly, untrustworthy, greedy, and deceitful. However by the end of the movie we are rooting for him because he just seems like such a nice guy. ""Wait, cut out god. Stay where you're better acquainted"" Catherine Zeta Jones is Velma Kelly. She is so great and believable that you can just imagine her ""popping"" her husband and sister at the ""Cicero"" with no remorse whatsoever. And man can she sing. Queen Latifa was in my opinion the best casting choice of this movie. Who would have thought of her in a musical? But she belts out ""When You're Good to Mama"" like a pro. Lastly John C. Reiliy was fabulous as Amos Hart. You really feel bad for this guy being ""Mr. Cellophane"" and being tricked into believing Roxy is going to have a baby.The Music. Oh Lord moses, the music. Catherine Zeta-Jones is really the most amazing singer out of this cast. She killed all the notes in ""The Cell Block Tango"" making it one of the best scenes in the movie. Queen Latifa was also brilliant but only got one song so it's hart to compare that to Cathering Zeta-Jones' 4 or 5. My favorite songs are ""When You're Good to Mama"", ""We Both Reached For the Gun"", ""The Cell Block Tango"", ""I Can't Do it Alone"", ""Mr. Cellophane"" (kind of a creepy song but really haunting), and who could forget ""All That JAZZ""? Everyone should see this movie, even if they don't think they'll like it. I can count the number of musical's I like on one hand, but Chicago is at the top of the list. It's such an adrenaline rush and has no boring moments which slow down most musicals (The Sound of Music anyone?). Great film 10/10 watch it!",Chicago
605,vidzzycool,how can i forget this movie!,6,3 October 2018,"Integral part of my being. I love this movie!

The film maintains the stage show's presentational style, has lots of color and movement like Moulin Rouge but has strong identifiable characters and strong story.The performances are excellent the dancing spectacular and comic elements work well; this is the first movie I have seen in a long time where the audience applauded at highlights during the film.   Most of the score is intact although fans of the original show will miss every omission from this exceptional Kander and Ebb score the performances of all that remains is a feast for the eyes and ears - who knew Richard Gere could sing?Catherine Zeta-Jones, Rene Zellweger and Queen Latefah are wonderful in their roles with excellent singing and dancing performances.  Gere does an excellent job with his songs.  John C. Reilly (is there a film out without him these days?) is excellent as the husband without a clue and is wonderful in his `Mr. Cellophane' song.Rob Marshall's very cinematic direction and choreography is unique, exciting, stylish and original but retains elements of the Bob Fosse original.  This film is so good I can forgive the cutting back of `Mary Sunshine' and her `A Little Bit Of Good' song.  And the cameo by original Velma, Chita Rivera, was short but appreciated.",Chicago
607,outlaw-6,"Weak plot, but magnificent music, choreography.",9,11 February 2003,"My wife hated it. She said it had no storyline, which isn't quite correct. But Catherine Zeta-Jones' musical number ""And All That Jazz"" was, by itself, worth the price of admission.  The other cast members followed with many more excellent musical performances. My own favorite was Richard Gere's tap-dancing  manipulation of the jury during the trial scene.  See it twice, and buy the soundtrack.  I did.",Chicago
608,wyaduck,Fosse and film musicals: Resurrected!,9,9 December 2002,"What a great time! Left me breathless. Masterful direction by Rob Marshall who had only few scant credits prior to this. You'll think that Fosse came back from the Great Beyond to direct this himself.And who knew that Zeta-Jones, Zellweger, Gere and Reilly were capable of such incredible musical-comedy performances? (And Zeta-Jones is back on my short list of fantasy women, even though she betrayed me by marrying that Douglas guy.) Each musical number brought applause at the screening I attended. A remarkable achievement. A perfect screen adaptation of a difficult piece of musical theater. Is it possible that the film musical isn't dead, after all?",Chicago

The staging and camera work is incredible -- so much so that I enjoyed the movie more than the stage version, which is saying a lot.  The one less-than-perfect, although not too bad, note was Richard Gere, whose singing voice is a bit odd -- he's not up to the caliber of the two leading ladies.",Chicago
610,mattmc-3,Tragically miscast...,5,3 February 2003,"Don't get me wrong, I like Renee and Catherine, but not in this move.Catherine looked more attractive in Traffic, strange as that sounds.Zellweger is more the cute vulnerable demure type.  Not at all a sex-pot, which is what this movie needed.",Chicago
611,m0210,Engrossing...,10,12 March 2003,"I am not normally very interested in movies that are musicals.  And, in particular, I do not like jazz music at all.Chicago can change anyone's mind about musicals.  This movie is very well filmed and choreographed.  Zeta-Jones shines, and has an awesome voice. And -- who knew  Zelwegger could sing?  This movie's plot is very interesting. It has a song for every scene, and all go well with the scenes.  Queen Latifah is also a very great actress in this film.This movie keeps you wondering what is going to happen next...  It has a very good outline and ends well.Basically, on a scale of 1-100, this movie was about a 92.  It was overall excellent.  With great music, and talent.  It is no wonder this movie picked up thirteen Academy Award nominations.  This is a great remake of this hit-Broadway musical.  Definitely worth seeing, and the soundtrack is also great.",Chicago
612,bernerlove,Best picture nomination for sure,9,26 January 2003,This was a refreshing change for movies today. It was like seeing a play...indeed it is based on a play...and it does work on the screen.  Very nicely so. I did not see Moulin Rouge..but Chicago was a wonderful film. It was energizing and different. The actors did their own singing and dancing and I was impressed at how successful a job they did. They must have worked hard to achieve such good results.I was particularly impressed with Richard Gere in this film. A very different thing to see him sing and dance . He was just perfect in this movie ! The tapdance scene in the courthouse act was great.I am sure it will be nominated for best picture when the Oscar nominations come out.,Chicago
613,Maria-54,Tripping the Light Fantastic!,10,3 December 2002,"This fabulous rendition of the famous Broadway musical is mesmerizing. The editing is fast paced, the cinematography breathtaking (especially the lighting for the dance sequences), and the acting spectacular.  Who knew Renee Zellweger could sing and dance?  She creates such a vulnerable, nuanced performance of the murderess, Roxie Hart.  She will definitely be up for mucho awards!  Catherine Zeta-Jones gets to strut her stuff from her musical days in London's West End as Velma Kelly, another murderess, and well, Richard Gere.  Again, who knew he could sing, dance and still look so great?  What a terrifically slimy lawyer!Seriously, those of us who have been waiting for musicals to make a comeback in film, will be more than thrilled with this version.  It opens up the story, and ties together the many terrific song and dance numbers from the original musical.  This version really makes sense, as seen from the eyes of Roxie Hart, and really brings the viewer into the lives of the characters. Plus, these actors are playing three dimensional characters, not just Broadway babies hoofing and crooning (although both casts of both theatrical productions were not just hoofers and crooners -- they were the cream of the crop -- Chita Rivera, Gwen Verdon, and Jerry Orbach, and Bebe Neuwirth, Ann Reinking, and James Naughton).I cannot recommend this movie enough.  It is a must see for anyone who has ever seen a Broadway musical anywhere, at any time, and loved it.  You will not soon forget it!",Chicago
614,denis.corbett,I saw Chicago in Nov. at the Shubert and this was just as much fun.,10,7 February 2003,"These two ladies are HOT - the whole experience was great.  I've seen the Broadway stage play in NYC, the Ginger Rogers movie Roxie Hart and now Chicago - all three together are complimentary to each other. I hope that this marks the beginning of the revival of the Musical on the big screen. With the advancements in technology in recent years their potential is so much greater than ever before. Congrats to everyone involved in both the Stage and Theatrical productions.",Chicago
615,les_purple,I agree with review in the New Yorker magazine.,7,21 January 2003,The music part of this musical is 99% of the film. There are so many great sing-and-dance numbers--it is just that it doesn't let up. The volume is always on high. No modulation. It is in your face for two hours. My favorite number was with the brunette (Catherine Zeta-Jones?) showing her rival how they might do a duet. Very cute.,Chicago
616,lucystumom,Should have had R rating,1,24 February 2003,"I don't understand how this film did not get an ""R"" rating. The movie was hotter than a PG-13 rating.  I think the first 10 minutes of the film were extremely sultry with the Velma Kelly dance and then Roxie Hart being groped in the stairwell.  Maybe I was an idiot to take my 11 and 13 year old children, but we had to leave the movie after 10 minutes.  The film was more suggestive than I would have thought a PG-13 film would be.  My 11 year old said, "" Why was that lady laying around on the stage and smoking cigarettes while she was singing.""  I feel like a fool.  The new PG-13 film is really an ""R.""",Chicago
617,sw-12,"Charged, exhilarating, a treat and a surprise.",10,8 December 2002,"I thoroughly enjoyed the current Broadway stage revival of Chicago -- the Kander and Ebb original, with Bob Fosse choreography, opened in 1975, starring Gwen Verdon (Roxie), Chita Rivera (Velma) and Jerry Orbach (Billy), all proven musical theatre talents. I saw the revival fairly early in its current run, starring Ann Reinking (Roxie), Bebe Neuwirth (Velma) and James Naughton (Billy), who are all proven in musical theatre as well.
The casting of this new film adaptation had me wondering -- Renee Zellwegger (Roxie), Catherine Zeta Jones (Velma) and Richard Gere (Billy)? Sure, they can act, but can they sing and dance?Big time. The strength of their performances alone is almost enough to carry the film. Whether the stars come by these moves and voices easily, or were rehearsed within an inch of their lives, it's clear they come by them naturally -- they each perform their own songs, and the dance moves are both fluid and stylistically true to the Fosse choreography. Attention to choreographic integrity in this film is to be expected: director Rob Marshall is a choreographer by trade. The sizzling staging of Velma's and Roxie's ""Finale"" is practically a Fosse quotation from beginning to end, and is razzle-dazzling beyond the stage version, via the cinematography and editing techniques that only the film medium provides.I was prepared for a watered-down Hollywood take on the wildly popular, 6 Tony Award-winning Broadway revival, but sans the stage talents that got it there. But I actually liked the film BETTER. The film's screenplay adaptation, by Bill Condon, fleshes out the narrative to allow an emotional connection to the characters in a way that I didn't experience in the theater. The film integrates the songs to the story by cutting between an electrifying staged rendition and the 1920's Chicago world of the narrative. This technique gives the characters space for an inner emotional life thus letting the audience better connect with them.I did have a few quibbles. The song ""Class"", a personal favorite, was cut, likely to keep the momentum up as we rush toward Roxie's sensational jury trial, which delivers several musical treats of its own, and is the dramatic apogee of the story. And, while I found John C. Reilly a most pathetic but sympathetic Amos, I felt that Joel Grey evoked those qualities much more effectively in his Broadway rendition of ""Mr. Cellophane.""The story, while providing an opportunity for some juicy songs and sharply funny characters, is more than just eye candy. Its portrayal of cynical manipulation of the criminal justice system by creating a celebrity-hungry media circus (the raison d'etre of Richard Gere's Billy Flynn) is more than apt today. But if there's any moralizing going on here, it's with a wink and a flash of leg. Chicago is a treat.",Chicago
618,coasterdude321,Only one word can describe it.,4,26 June 2003,"Meh.From the delightfully extravagant and entertaining Broadway smash hit comes the hideously mediocre big screen adaptation. You probably have heard the story line by now: when a young woman who dreams of being a star (Reneé Zellweger, Oscar nominee) kills her cheating boyfriend, she hires a bigshot lawyer (Richard Gere) to defend her. Also features Queen Latifah (sadly) and Catherine Zeta-Jones in minor roles, both of which received oscar nominations and Zeta-Jones won it (undeservingly).The film is as Hollywood as it gets. A musical featuring four big names is sure to be a big hit. It holds no interesting aspects film wise or theme wise (though it's there in a comfortably feel-good way), it's just a popcorn movie. While it is excellent on Broadway, it just doesn't have what it takes to be a good film, just like all post-Cabaret musicals. The only reason for the countless oscars is that it is  musical. That's it. So shut up, all you Jackie Harvys, there is nothing great about this film.4/10",Chicago
619,ana_galeazzi,I really liked it,8,3 April 2021,"The way how the musical part was incorporated within the movie itself is absolutely brilliant!!! I was really captured by the plot during the entire movie and it left me wanting more, when it was over I was like ""oh, already?"". I do think that it had the potential for even more if some other moments were shown, especially of Velma (cause she was amazing) and more Velma and Roxie interaction would've also been nice. But as a whole I really enjoyed it!!",Chicago

She is an excellent singer and dancer.,Chicago

Sharp, scary maybe - looks at Cabaret - but always fun.  Not here.  This is just a sordid sad little tale about unlikeable people.  It's a long time since I've seen something that looked so much like a good film - had all the earmarks, big stars, big production values, nifty camera work - but just wasn't.",Chicago

Chicago is one of my all-time favorite Broadway musicals and there are a lot of ways to mess it up, but the entire cast and crew did an astonishing job.  Catherine Zeta-Jones was an amazing Velma (though I would have rather seen Bebe Neuwirth reprise her Tony award winning role), Rene Zellweger never fails to amaze me (remember Bridget Jones Diary and White Oleander?), and what can be said about Richard Gere?  He give his best performance in...well...ever as far as I'm concerned.  I was a little upset that some of the songs from the play got cut, but I hear we're gonna get to see at least some of those on the DVD, so I'm all set to order my copy.  All in all it was very well done and I think it has a chance of being the first musical since 1968's Oliver! to win the Best Picture Oscar.  In fact I predict a whole host of Oscar nominations will be garnered by the cast as well as Rob Marshall and the rest of the crew.",Chicago
624,AFROM,Musical comedy reborn,8,17 March 2003,"It is exciting to see, again, a classic musical style movie in the cinema screen. This genre was sadly forgotten by producers in the last years. I think the stage performance Bob Fosse release has been adapted and that is good, many parts of film remember the environment and musical numbers on Cabaret, because John Kander music and Fosse choreography is present. The work of the actors is as well as we could expect, in all aspects. Catherine Zeta simply wonderful, we don´t forget her wide experience acquired at England theater. I was highly surprised by Renee and Gere when I saw both of them singing and dancing. Excellent the rest of the cast. I think this is a very recommended film at all, a brilliant musical and if you like this class of movie genre you will find a lot of good reasons to enjoy with it, it will be possible you are transported to another times when the dance, music and songs, included in a comedy or dramatic story, were a sort of art concept in the world of cinema.Please, make more films like this.

It's true entertainment, like movies should be! If you walk in upset, you'll definitely be walking out with a smile on your face! The whole movie is shown from the perspective of Roxie, which in certain cases could have made the whole movie flop. In this case, it was amazing! Roxie's thoughts were brilliantly displayed! The way the movie flowed from one thing to the next was truly captivating. Watching it was pleasure you never wanted to end.

On her way to the top, Roxie murders Fred Casely and ends up going straight to the Big House. As she battles to get out of jail, she realizes that there is only room for one diva in Chicago. Richard Gere portrays Roxie's only ticket out of prison. He's the sly criminal defense lawyer, Billy Flynn. Hasn't lost a case and isn't about to. Velma Kelly (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart are constant rivals for the slick attorney. This film displays how one girl made a killing and a start. Don't miss Chicago!",Chicago

The acting, music, everything.The movie is basically about getting fame by committing a crime. Roxie Hart (Renee Zellwegger) murdered a man and is sent to prison. There she meets Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) a celebrity that Roxie has admired for a long time. She's also in for murder. Roxie hires Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) a lawyer who claims that all he cares about is love. Velma also hired Billy.Other acting highlights are John C. Reilly who plays Amos, Roxie's loser husband and Queen Latifah who plays Matron ""Mama"" Morton, the warden who's respected for doing favors. It's also my understanding that this is the first movie directed by Rob Marshall and he did great directing.Overall Rating: 10/10",Chicago
629,strangedevelopments,There aren't enough Oscars for this film,10,3 January 2003,"Right off the bat when I heard this movie was coming out, I thought only a moron would cast Richard Gere in a comedic musical requiring him to do his own singing and dancing (including tap).  And, frankly, after seeing movies such as Entrapment in which her butt is Catherine Zeta-Jones' main contribution to the film, I wasn't sure if this movie would be a car wreck or a blue-ribbon hit.  But, it was about jazz, and the casting was daring if nothing else.My response after watching the film was that every single performance was absolutely unforgettable.  Catherine Zeta-Jones should move from Hollywood to Broadway with her dancing skills and the set of pipes she has, and her rendition of the opening number, ""All That Jazz,"" had the audience with which I watched the film cheering at the screen like she had scored a game-winning touchdown.  I simply don't have the words to compliment Gere's performance; I'm in too much shock that he was that fine.  Renee Zellweger's turn as Roxie is a performance so skillfully done that I'm sure she won't win an Oscar, since most often the best performances get passed over by the political and economic beast that is the Academy.Of great value to the film were the performances of Queen Latifah, John C. Reilly, Taye Diggs, and Christine Baranski.  Firstly, there is only one Queen Latifah, and there's a reason she's called the Queen.  Reilly gave a wonderfully powerful yet understated performance as Roxie's husband, and his singing gets no complaints from me.  Diggs and Baranski filled out the cast with minimal but classy performances as the band leader and lead reporter, respectively.The direction and choreography were divine, the talent was unquestionably top-notch, and the music and lyrics by Kander and Ebb make Oscar and Hammerstein look like stodgy school boys with no real passion.  This is a movie to see repeatedly in the theatre, recommend to strangers on the street, and purchase as soon as it's out on VHS and DVD.  Here's hoping the award shows and moviegoers see it for the great film it is.",Chicago

You'll laugh at some parts, jump at the gun shots, feel tear-y for the poor girl who was innocent and hung, and want to jump up and sing along once you knew the lyrics.I hope to see the play someday, but for now, this movie is 10 out of 10!

The dancing -- I cant put it in words. It was that fab. Breathtaking.

632,solesister,I think this was the best movie musical I've ever seen,10,6 January 2003,"Rob Marshall takes advantage of all the cinematic developments of the past half century to present an entertainment that's a knockout from start to finish. I saw the musical on Broadway a few years ago, and although I enjoyed it a lot, this is a much better film, than that was a play. All of the brittle, sharp, spiky angles that characterized the Broadway production have been smoothed out, buffed up, and polished to such a high gloss that you don't realize how hard the edges are until they hit you in the head.Renee Zellweger is extraordinary -- I never thought she had it in her. She does that dumb-like-a-fox blonde bombshell routine better than anyone since Marilyn Monroe.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is also very good, but I almost feel sorry for because Renee' steals every scene she's in.  I think the difference is that although Zeta-Jones does everything right, it's a performance you knew she was capable of, whereas Zellweger's is such a surprise, I was afraid to blink for fear I'd miss something.Richard Gere is just perfect as Billy Flynn, and Queen Latifah is a sly, subtle Mama Morton.  There are also a number of terrific actors in smaller parts: John C. Reilly is heartbreaking as Roxie's poor dumb cuckolded husband, and I wish I could have seen more of Christine Baranski and even more (and how!) of Taye Diggs.Don't wait! Go see this movie immediately!!!!!",Chicago

What ever became of real musicals? Dancers used to use their settings and props to demonstrate their talents. I will never forget Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dancing on roller skates.

Rob Marshall as litten up the screen with a fabulous adaption of the Broadway classic Chicago.  The cast is great starting with Renee Zellweger doing a great job in the lead musical role of Roxie Hart. She sings, dancces and acts up a storm. Catherine Zeta-Jones Velma Kelly steals the eye when she is on screen. Her opening number, ""All That Jazz"" shows us all she a talented singer and dancer as well as an actress.

They are regular actors who do their jobs well enough and deserve respect and admiration for it. Whatever. I just can't stand Renée's look of short-sighted who lost her glasses all the time. She doesn't interpret anyone in any movie, and during this one in particular, the whole time, I just wished the character was interpreted by anyone else. She doesn't have charisma, she lacks completely the ""sweetness"" they claim so much the character has, she is not pretty to be a cabaret dancer and she is SO bad that she ruins everybody else's roles. It's not a great movie, but I am sure it could be much better without Renée Zellweger. I'd much rather watch Kristen Stewart ""acting"" than Renée.",Chicago
640,star4573,Brilliant!,10,20 September 2003,"This movie is brilliantly acted and wonderfully directed.  Catherine Zeta-Jones superb portrayal of saucy Velma Kelly is matched against Renee Zellweger's equally manipulative Roxie Hart.  Neither of these characters is worth redeeming, but the audience will root for them anyway.Set in Prohibition Chicago, where jazz clubs are sheik and murder is a form of entertainment, Roxie Hart (Zellweger) is on trial for her life.  Enter Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) a flamboyant lawyer more interested in manipulating the press than whether his client is guilty or innocent. Also features Queen Latifah as the warden who takes care of her charges...for a price!The musical sequences are very well done, esp ""Press Room Rag"" and of course the signature ""All that Jazz"".  Also, kudos to John Reilly whose ""Cellophane"" solo is heartbreaking poignant.10 of 10!",Chicago
641,martiia,Billy Flynn was the best!,7,11 February 2004,"Actually, whenever I watch this movie usually skip to the musical numbers. My favorites are ""All that Jazz"", ""Cell Block Tango"", ""Mr. Cellophane"", and ""We Both Reached for the Gun"".The female leads were kind of annoying, but I really love Billy Flynn (Gere).  The coolest movie lawyer I've seen!What's also interesting is how well the movie portrays how fickle society really is and how manipulative the media can be.",Chicago
642,vygandas1024,Great musical,9,1 June 2004,"It's a musical, and a great one too. I enjoyed the plot too, though it wasn't very smart or anything like that. Well the artwork is brilliant most of the times, all that 1920's feeling is very well made.Great direction too  I just love how the scenes of stage performance interlay with acting, it gives you an insight on what's really going on. It makes the movie very relaxing too  because you know what's going on, you can be unperturbed on what's going to happen next. According to the plot these murderers must be evil, but not in this movie  they are like comics' heroes  their evil isn't real, it's like a part of their characters.It's a very enjoyable movie. You can come to the theatre just to listen characters singing. Oh, by the way  characters are very well made. Renée Zellweger was great in her role too, though it's really unusual to see her playing semi-evil character. I think I liked the most Mr. Cellophane  played by John C. Reilly. His appearance in the movie is so well arranged.Though there was one scene which I disliked  the one with circus (I mean the place where the advocate sang), it's a silly idea, and poorly directed. But the movie is well worth watching it.9/10",Chicago

Sexy, sassy, strident, this scintillating movie grabs you by the throat in the first minute and never lets go. It's funny, the songs are out of this world and delivered with panache by Zellweger, Zeta-Jones and Gere. The movie put all of us on a wonderful high...strongly recommended.",Chicago

How can this movie, a mildly entertaining, somewhat original, fair movie, have won BEST PICTURE? This is more a farce then Forrest Gump beating Pulp Fiction or Titanic beating LA Confidential.  This movie is not deserving of ANY acting nominations, and definately did not deserve a Best Picture nod over Gangs of New York and to a certain degree The Two Towers.  Renee Zellwegger is barely a decent actress, yet her movies and roles have become academy favorites. The Best Picture of the year should go to a film with great vision and/or ground breaking acting, and a virtually flawless story line.  This movie lacks in all three categories. In five years, this movie will join the ranks of the English Patient, Titanic, and Forrest Gump as Oscar night tragedies.",Chicago
645,tim.bo,Chicago GREAT?,6,7 February 2003,"Chicago is a wonderful film that is unless you have seen the 1972 film ""Cabaret"" this film is written by the same people and some of the dance routines are based on the same Choreographer/Director Bob Fosse. So i was expecting similarities in style,but this is a half hearted imitation. The problem with this film is that where Cabaret is ground breaking this one is following in its footsteps all too literally and the new creative forces have not had any conviction to create anything new, The direction is lazy,the editing lacking the wit and flair of Cabaret and a script that is flimsy. You might think I am unfair to compare the two but when there have been almost direct copies within the framing or lighting I cant help it, When Roxy starts her song later in the piece I had a hard job separating this and ""maybe next time"" The actors all give good performances but had no help from the script or direction. This could have been a masterpiece and influenced a whole generation of film makers but instead it is a pale imitation of a film made a quarter of a century ago.",Chicago

Well, ""Chicago"" made me see what I was missing, and why I turned off my television.I had once read that adult movies were like musicals -- instead of characters bursting into song, they burst into sex. Modern blue movies have even less plot, and the snippets between sex scenes are called ""fast-forwards."" ""Chicago"" had a storyline like an adult movie's -- superfluous. There was something about a murder, but it was only to tie the elaborate musical acts together. Those weren't bad, though a little overblown. Not quite ""Cabaret,"" but better than something like ""Grease"".",Chicago

To me this is just a fun-to-watch flick, but no way a masterpiece of some kind. I don't understand all those people who rated this movie 10 or 9. Okay, the movie's not bad, but I don't think it's that great either.",Chicago

Moulin Rouge was so mush better, innovative and all! I can't understand why anyone would even think about comparing the over-acted performances in this movie with the subtle acting of The Hours. Dancing was boring, the first ""noise"" uttered by Renee Zellwegger (who I liked before, especially in Nurse Betty) incredibly painful, and I wanted to laugh every time one of them started to sing. Just like in a Disney movie! But right, you get used to it after a time. I thought that all the characters were hateful and I did not care about them for one second. It lacked feelings all over. Was it supposed to be funny? I did not laugh much (or inadvertently). In fact, I was bored, but more than that, I am surprised that some people would think this is the best movie of 2002...",Chicago

My friends were so upset that they couldn't go with me to see it and will have to wait untill it's on DVD. Because my small town isn't showing it. Which we are quite mad about. Instead there are these stupid movies like ""Kangroo Jack"" (so sad) But I just love this movie, it's so different and classy.

As a film, it is not as great as the musical was to see live.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is a super singer dancer, but this movie still did not have as much feeling as the original ALL THAT JAZZ of 1979. It tries hard, but looses something in the process.  Don't be fooled.",Chicago
653,rentfn,A Movie Musical for Everyone!,10,29 December 2002,"I would like to start off by saying i had high expectations for this movie and it reached everyone, and went far above them. This is a great movie for people who like movie musicals and the people, for some strange reason, do not like movie musicals. The main complaint I hear about musicals is, ""why do they always break into song?"" and people hate that. But what Rob Marshall has done with this is when people break into song it goes on in Roxie's head. And it shows what she is think and what the people are doing. I know it is confusing to read but when you see it, it will become clear.The performances are also great. The two female leads have great voices. And normally I do not like their work, and then shined in this movie. Richard Gere also plays the role I believe he was meant to. His voice is also great. John C. Reilly and Queen Latifah put in great supporting roles.I hope who ever reads this will go see Chicago because it is one of the best movie musicals I have ever seen. I think it might be the best musical to become a movie ever.",Chicago

Moulin Rouge was a positive surprise, Chicago turned out to be exactly what I expected it to be. Gere was o.k. , Zellweger and Zeta Jones were disappointing, too much noise. It's nothing fresh and new , it's a musical made into film and after 25 years of practice of course it looks o.k. but that's it. While Luhrmans Moulin swings, Marshalls Chicago sleeps.",Chicago

This movie is so fast-paced it seems more like 60 min instead of 113 min; and all the songs in this film are just incredible.Thanks to this film Renée Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, John C. Reilly and Richard Gere are now some of my favorite actors. I especially liked Renée in this film. She is just so amazing  her singing voice and acting is great. Also, the good part is that the whole movie is extremely fun and I could watch it over and over and over again. To me, this movie has absolutely no downfalls. It's just perfect, and that's why I rate Chicago a (9.0/10)",Chicago
656,abroadley,Not a patch on Moulin Rouge,7,18 January 2003,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this film but having read user comments before going to the cinema, I expected more (this film only opened here in the UK this weekend, so I suspect the comments are mainly from the USA).  I am not a fan of either Catherine Zeta-Jones or Renee Zellweger so I already had certain reservations but honestly Zellweger is just not up to this kind of role.  She is far too skinny (a polite way of saying "" a bag of bones"") and her voice is lacks depth.  Given the actresses who have played the role on stage, I think she was a very bad choice -  money men choosing a crowd puller?  In contrast Catherine Zeta-Jones was superb - everything her role required.  The others including Richard Gere were all really great too but the dancing was way below the standard of the stage show or Moulin Rouge (the film Chicago keeps getting compared with).  The dancers' costumes were unnecessarily titillating to the point of vulgarity (trying to distract from less than perfect dancing?) and emphasised how skinny the dancers were - a fact startlingly clear by the number of ribs on show!  Not an Oscar contender in my mind. 7 out of 10",Chicago
657,kynang,Whats is all the hype about?,1,6 March 2003,"What is all the hype about? Once again the Miramax Oscar Machine has managed to hype a film which really doesn't deserve any attention. Don't musicals usually require actors who can sing and dance? I was appalled by the poor quality of this film - and yet it received 13 Oscar nominations! Is that a reflection of the lousy quality of Hollywood films this year? ""Moulin Rouge,"" which made me want to leap from my deat and applaud every few minutes was overlooked by the Academy, and yet, when an American impersonator appears, praise and acclaim is lauded on a mediocre also-ran.The only redeemable (and frankly quite good) part of the film comes from John C. Reilly, who never fails to please, in his song ""Mr. Cellephane."" Very sad, poignant, and well performed. He's a great actor, and he proved it amongst a cast and director who all muddied their already tarnished careers. Boo to the Academy and all those viewers sucked in by the hype.",Chicago

Chorus Line had it, Sweet Charity had it, My Fair Lady had it, even All That Jazz had its moments. Chicago don't. The depth of this film brings to want more and not to care about any of the characters. The ONLY bright spot is the husband's soliloquoy of ""Mr. Celophane"".Definitely worth seeing (NOT!!)",Chicago

CHICAGO never failed to impress me at every leg kick and shimmy.  Characters bursting into song (as occurs with most musicals) has always been a problem for many people.  Having Roxie stage the musical numbers in her head, the creators of this film did something not seen since CABARET. They have made the almost perfect film adaptation of a musical (from stage to screen)and made it seem like the every day life of a dreamer.  Chita, Lucy, Christine, and Mya all have wonderful (but short screen time) parts in the film and they rock at what they do.  Mr. Diggs was perfect as the Band Leader and provided the smooth, sexy vibe that needed to be seen.  Everyone gave top notch to this film and I hope that come award time, CHICAGO takes the top honors!",Chicago

About Scmidt, Road to Perdition, Adaptation, and the less known One Hour Photo and Insomnia are much more deserving of the honor of Best Picture. The acting in this film is also overrated. Zeta-Jones was terrific, but past that, Zelwegger was nothing special, and Richard Gere was poorly cast.

I can't remember being entertained by a musical this much since ""Singing in the Rain.""  It had that feel of old-time goodness to it.

It's a fabulous movie that everyone will enjoy!",Chicago

I don´t like to stereotype but this film is not a crowd pleaser, it´s only for a small audience of females and homosexuals, with all due respect, but the acting is terrible and the musical numbers are dumb and annoying. If you are gay, woman or just into musicals, you are gonna like it but otherwise stay away from it..Catherine Zeta Jones saves the day as a good singer and show caser but Renee and Gere sucked big time..",Chicago

Felt like clapping at the end of each musical number. We knew that Catherine Zeta-Jones had a voice; but Renee Zellwegger and Richard Gere! Brilliant; and they can all dance too. Visually very appealing without being over the top. Captured the ""circus"" feeling of American justice well (look at the O J Simpson trial). Can't wait for it to come out on general release in mid-January and will definitely buy it on DVD.",Chicago

The songs are great...the storyline is great...I highly recommend this movie...But it's not the greatest Musical out there...If you liked Chicago I recommend that you see Cabaret, or Sweet Charity...They are some of my favorites...

669,motherbenn,So Hot! It's about darn time.,8,14 January 2003,"This film was 27 years in the making, but I'm here to tell you it was worth the wait. The stage production of ""Chicago"", Bob Fosse's cynical musical about merry murderesses using the system to their own ends, opened in 1975. I was in high school. And now I'm 40-something.Over the years there's been wild speculation as to who would fill the lead roles for the film version--from Madonna to Cher to Goldie to Streisand. The casting could not have been better in the selection of Renee Zelleweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Who knew? These women are triple threats--singing, acting and dancing their behinds off. Finally, a musical that makes the transition from stage to screen without missing the mark.Every aspect of this movie is first rate down to the finest detail of period costuming and props. The production designer provides wonderful eye candy to feast on at every turn. Director/choreographer Rob Marshall deserves all possible awards for being true to the spirit of the Broadway script. He captures Bob Fosse's style and makes the musical numbers pop with fast, seamless cuts from actors' inner-thoughts to the reality of the scene. ""Chicago"" ushers in a whole new kind of movie making. Baz Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge"" was a stepping stone toward revitalizing the movie musical. So far, ""Chicago"" is the pinnacle.Queen Latifah's characterization of the prison matron is dead on correct. She's fun to watch. I only wish she had put a taste more of soul in her rendition of 'When Your Good to Mama'. To be true to the style of black vaudeville of the 1920's, it needed just a bit little more hot sauce. She's still very entertaining.John C. Reily, as the long suffering husband, Amos, gives a compelling, endearing performance. His rendition of ""Mr. Cellophane"", based on Burt Willams' famous vaudeville number 'Nobody', is a show stopper.The dancers enlisted here are fierce, sexy hard bodies. Their Broadway training reads loud and clear. Marshall uses clever devices to tell the story through dance. Adding men to the 'Cell Block Tango' is so right. Jules Fisher's rock and roll, theatrical lighting gives you the sense of being on Broadway. This number kicks and jumps right off the screen.I have one question though: Brad, is the second reporter from the left you?A new song 'Move On' by John Kander, the original Broadway composer, is a real treat. This is a must have CD and DVD. Run, do not walk, to see this film. It is in a word--hot!",Chicago

One of the best casts i've seen. Although Catherine Zeta-Jones won an Oscar, I think Renee Zellweger, John C. Reilly, and Queen Latifah were better. Renne Zellweger is always fun and brings character to her roles. No different here. Reilly was heart-felt and refreshing, and Queen Latifah was powerful and brassy. There are so many fun, memorable songs. My favorites being: ""We Both Reached for the Gun"", and ""When You're Good to Mama"". It still astounds me that Richard Gere did not get a nod for his performance, but the 4 other acting one's it got will do! Chicago has gotten a lot o smack talked about it saying it does not deserve the Best Picture, nertz to you guys! It is, in my opinion, the 2nd most deserving (Behind American Beauty).

""Chicago"" is a musical that should go down in the books as one of the best musicals ever made and now my favorite musical. The performances are absolutely entertaining, the music is second none, and Rob Marshall's dance choreography and directing hopefully garners him an Oscar win. i had so much fun watching this film that it made me forget everything that is going on in the world. this is the type of movie people should be talking about when they need just some music in their lives. hopefully musical films should make their way back on the big screen. we need movies like this once in a while that takes the music industry to new levels, shows us dance and entertainment in new ways. since last years ""Moulin Rouge!"", filmmakers should be daring and take that next step in to making us musicals. now don't get me wrong, we don't need to see them that much like we did back in the 50's and 60's. it was nice to see ""Chicago"" come out in 2002 just like it was nice to see ""Moulin Rouge!"" come out in 2001. just to see a musical once a year should be efficent enough for me, brovo to Baz Luhrman to bring it them back and cheers to Rob Marshall for hopefully paving the way for musicals down the road.",Chicago
674,garb-1,Disappointment,3,16 March 2003,"In my view Chicago is a middling musical, and there is nothing extraordinary in its movie version. Renée Zellweger was disbelieving as sexbomb, Richard Gere can neither sing nor dance, etc. Still, there are some things to be said for it: the stunning music, nice cinematography, and - last but not least - Catherine Zeta-Jones. In general, the 13 nominations are too much for Chicago. And by comparing to musical movie classics, it is no exaggeration to say that Chicago can't hold a candle to Cabaret. 3/10",Chicago

How do you give a musical best picture. Now don't get me wrong the music was great and the acting wasn't bad but not worthy of an Oscar. How do you give this movie best picture when you had Lord of the Rings-Two Towers, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, just to name a few. I could name at least 10 films that year that were by far better than Chicago. Spiderman and Signs were both better than Chicago and neither received Oscar nods.

Nothing against musicals at all, musicals are meant for romance, adventure and possibly comedy. Not some phony baloney acting that involved a girl murdering a man and trying to get out of prison. Did NOT deserve best picture whatsoever. As I said earlier the acting was like a B Horror movie.

Catherine Zeta-Jones sparkles as the lethal Velma Kelly and Richard Gere surprises us all as the conniving yet charming lawyer, Billy Flynn. Renee Zellweger brings a naughty innocence to the wanna-be vaudeville star and together the cast is perfectly magnetic.I give this movie 10 out of 10 stars.",Chicago
682,renaisanc9,TORTURE - Gravely Vacuous & Disappointing,1,4 February 2006,"All characters were stereotypes, lacking substance, with the exception of the poor (but dumb) cheated husband, who was outstanding and brought life to his character/role. Gere was definitely ""fun""... in a sick/sleeeeezy kind of way... and it was fun watching him have fun with the role. Aside from that, it was like watching cartoon characters... but, then, perhaps that was the idea.The choreography was GREAT... but neither of the ladies managed to REALLY pull it off. (They give new meaning to the term ""heavy-footed."") It's a sad commentary when the chorus dancers are the most proficient, outshining the ""stars."" Does anyone really enjoy watching EFFORT? Massive, arduous, relentless effort? :-( :-) Chicago was SO boring, vacuous, and deliberately fluffy that BOTH my daughter (18 at the time) and I actually FELL ASLEEP (!!!) and had to fight to try to stay awake by eating chocolates and drinking Pepsi throughout.Why did it receive nominations? Simple: It was expected to... and it starred the darlings of Hollywood.Why did Katherine win an Oscar? Even Simpler: Her husband insisted upon it. (Whatever Michael wants, Michael gets.)If you're comfortable with following the crowd and are satisfied with glitz, loud parades, and superficiality, you'll love it. If you crave the likes of Scorsese, Kurasawa, etc. and expect SUBSTANCE in a movie, you'd do well to SKIP this one!",Chicago
683,dervalmccormack,A musical set in a women's jail in Chicago. It tells the story of Roxie as she awaits her trial.,10,9 April 2006,"I don't usually give films 10 out of 10 but this is one exception! It is a brilliant movie that focuses on life, love, friendship and betrayal. Chicago is set in...you've guessed it...Chicago! It tell the story of a young woman named Roxie Harte. Roxie is an adulterous wife of Amos who's secret lover, Fred Casely promises to find her a job in the theatre. This is Roxie's life long dream. However, Fred walks out on her and doesn't get her the job he promised. In a rage, Roxie...shoots him!! The musical then follows her life in the local womens' jail, where she meets fellow murderess, Velma Kelly, the actress Roxie had always looked up to. The pair fight for the same lawyer, Billy Flynn, throughout the film, as he is the one lawyer in the whole of Chicago guaranteed to win the girls' cases and the one lawyer to win them the fame they both desire. It is a wonderful film with top class choreography and songs that will have you singing for days on end! The acting is fantastic and it won a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for Catherine-Zeta Jones, who plays Kelly and a Best Actress Academy Nomination for Renee Zellweger, who plays Harte. Personally, I thought Zellweger was better than Jones. But that is just my opinion and I suppose Nicole Kidman did deserve the Best Actress Award that year for her role in The Others. If I was to fault this film in any way, it would have to be Richard Gere's (Flynn) lack of musical talents. He tried too hard and did not succeed in the singing department. However, his acting and dancing made up for this and he played his role very well. Chicago is a must see musical and director Rob Marshall should be proud of his Oscar winning story! Co-starring Richard Gere and Queen Latifah.",Chicago

685,tavrick,...and all that jazz!,9,3 January 2003,"I just saw Chicago and was blown away. I did not know it was going to be as good as it was. All of the main performers (Renee Zellweger, Katherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere and Queen Latifa) and the smaller role having actors (Taye Diggs, John C. Reilly, Christine Baranski, Dominic West and Lucy Liu) were wonderful down to the last spoken syllable; and the musical performances were fantastic and imaginative. Richard Gere's first performance put me off a bit, as I was not used to him singing and dancing, but his other performance in the first court room scene was well done. He seemed more comfortable in his role. The musical number featuring him and Renee's character, Roxie, made me wish I had a remote control that allowed me to press rewind. I wanted to see it again. It was entralling.
My favorite performance was the number that followed Roxie's imprisonment, which featured six women prisoners, including, much to my surprise, the singer Mya. This scene explained why each woman was locked up. All of them were in prison for having given their husband or boyfriend their just due. One prisoner aptly stated, ""He ran into my knife ten times. Ten times!"" This scene just like the whole movie was all about style and showmanship. Nothing was just a flash in the pan in this film but an eye-catching, attention-consuming carnival! Go see this film!",Chicago

The music is marvelous, the color is outstanding, the dancing is better than expected, and the performances by Zeta-Jones and Zellweger were impressive.  Queen Latifa was outstanding as the warden, providing a very different attitude from a warden than I've seen in film before.  Although the story is a bit far-fetched it never really tried to be realistic, I mean it's a musical. For some (like me) who are new to musicals, note that this is a very different film than Moulin Rouge, and in most ways superior.  If you thought that MR was enjoyable but missing something Chicago might fit your bill. Go see this movie provided you enjoy fun atmospheres, loud music, and lots of lingerie. 8/10",Chicago

Fosse's look and style (especially the choreography) is wonderfully re-created in the film. A very nice touch: the original Broadway Velma Kelly, Chita Rivera, has a cameo in the film. The film's Velma, Catherine Zeta-Jones, steals the show, especially for her surprisingly energetic dancing. Another nice touch was the color-blind casting, i.e., Lucy Liu as Kitty Baxter.",Chicago

Not only is it not even a decent musical, but it is awful story telling based upon an even worse true story in what has to be one of Chicago's darkest days in its checkered history.Are we supposed to be glad that two murderesses are not only freed from prison (due in no small part because of a slick, sleazy lawyer, a female reporter who champions their ""innocence"" to sell her paper, and an incompetent prosecution), but that their nightclub ""careers"" explode based upon their notoriety?

Oh man...this thing has to be 10 lines minimum! that is silly...hm...i thought that catherine zeta-jones was amazing in the movie, and so was renee zellweger (or however you spell her name) but i thought the most surprising talent was John C.

701,jamesnorman,The best film in 20 years...and it's a musical?!,10,2 February 2003,"Yeah, quite literally my favorite film since the first Indiana Jones flick back in 1981; this film is brilliant, highly cynical and loads of fun. Zwelleger is still a bit mousy, but she fits the bill just fine as the manipulative Roxie Hart, and Catherine-Zeta Jones is perfect as Velma Kelly, whose character I understand has a larger role in the play.  But the real surprises here are Queen Latifiah as prison matron ""Momma"" Morton, a woman constantly on the take who sure knows how the work the system, and of all people Richard Gere, whose mere presence made me not want to go initially... well, all I have to say is ""Oh My God!""  I never thought these words would come out of my mouth: ""Richard Gere deserves a Best Actor oscar.""Way to stretch Richard.  It's about time.John C. Riley deserves mention as the invisible Amos Hart and his subplot is one that is the (second) most heartbreakingly sad subplot in the film, until you realize at the end he is truly free.

I haven't seen it on the stage so I don't have any comparison to that version but I thought this one was wonderful. The casting was wonderful and, while I had a bit of trouble seeing many of them in roles like that, I got drawn in quickly and ended up loving most of the performances.I'm probably a bit biased because I love musicals and I'm so hopeful for more to do well but I still think everything came out great.  I've actually seen it twice now and I've liked it more each time.  It seems to be doing quite well and hopefully that will keep up.  :¬)Oh, and I thought this was interesting too: ""In limited release, the musical Chicago, starring Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger, danced away with $2.1 million in 77 theatres for an impressive $27,300 per-theatre average.

704,rwhiting-3,Chicago is an excrescence,1,22 September 2006,"This was a foul movie. It was based on a much earlier musical that was a cynical attempt to cash in on the ""Cabaret"" by the same creators, and it falls short by a mile. The film, many years later, is then, by extension, despicable. Above all it is a piece of misogynist Derek, its portrayal of women an insult in every way, every one of them portrayed as venal, dimwitted, amoral, the guys that dream this up should each have their remaining testicle removed forcibly, with a rusty spoon. The songs stink, not one of them memorable. When was the last time you whistled ""Mister Cellophane""? The dancing was a joke. Fast editing made every inept performer look almost competent. They should be made to suck on Donald O'Connor's jockstrap. The acting and production values were abysmal. I would rank this down with ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" as one of the most laughable ""Oscar"" best-pics of all time. Who put the fix in? How did that work? What did the ""Stonecutters"" like about this turkey, or were they on the payroll. Name actors like Gere and Zellweger should be publicly humiliated for this. And the claims that it was a brilliantly modern, inventive film musical! Who=ever said that had no inkling of a quality product like ""Moulin Rouge,"" a truly clever and inventive recent movie musical.

The biggest flaw was the casting, in a musical its usually a help if you can dance and sing!  Richard Gere can do nither and they had to cut him faster than a MTV video to make him look half good!  Renee was ok but lacks a vital factor of a chicago leading lady, sex appeal! I wanted to drool during her numbers not cringe!  Catherine was the best but why did they put her next to all those anorexic dancers? they made her look fat! Even she did not have the nessasary dancing skills but was sexy as hell (whats new).

709,ryankackley,Rob Marshall's Unique Depiction of Chicago Fame and Showbiz,10,15 September 2021,"The movie begins with a musical entourage by Chicago Night club star, Velma Kelly, played by Catherine Zita Jones. She seems to be in a bit of a frenzy as you late find out she arrives at her show, without her partner/sister, washing blood off her hands. The movie then panes to the main character, Roxie Hart, played by Renee Zellweger, who of which the theme of this movie focuses on. Velma is then arrested for the murder of her husband and sister and pulled off stage. Panning back to Roxie, the audience switches over to her vivid imagination portraying her in Velma's shoes, performing the song. Once the film switches back over to reality, Roxie leaves the club with a man, who was supposed to introduce her to ""a friend"" which we later find out was supposed to be someone who could get Roxie started in show business. She continues to bug him about this friend until he tells her that it was fictitious and that she would never make it in showbiz, where she gets extremely irate and shoots him 3 times in the chest. She then ends up in jail right along with Velma, where multiple characters from the jail are introduced via a number in Roxie's imagination. This includes Matron Mama Morton, the prison warden, played by Queen Latifa and Billy Flynn, Roxie's money and fame hungry lawyer, who is played by Richard Gere. The musical numbers that we continue to see through the film is a motif that highlights not only the vanity of Chicago fame, but also the passion and intensity which Roxie longs to be in show business. The lighting throughout the film is set to insinuate showbusiness. Performances come with lots of flashy lights to emphasize the fame and theatrics, which also supplements the motif. This display is similar to the movie Moulin Rouge, which is also a movie about showbusiness and theatrics with paired musical numbers to reference a character's inner thoughts or feelings (Luhrmann, 2001).A notable side plot is the competition between Roxie and her previous hero Velma Kelly. At the beginning of the movie, Roxie wanted to be Velma and when she meets her in the jail, Velma treats her like a groupie. She does not acknowledge her existence until Roxie becomes popular to the press and is talked about in the papers. Velma was also utilizing her murder incident to get more publicist, but starts to panic when Roxie beginning to take the limelight.Roxie goes on trial and is portrayed to be a sweet southern bell who falls trapped by the fame, glamour and glitz of Chicago nightlife. The audience is obviously aware that Roxie's murderous act was extremely intentional, as she was angry she wasn't going to get a break in showbiz, but the whole trail was based on fabricating a story of which the jury, and namely the press, would be sympathetic for Roxie. This story included a fake accent, an alternative backstory, a loveless marriage and a faux child. Roxie seemed to be the most caught up in the glitz and glamour during the trial. All the stories were made up and all her actions were purposefully applied to create more drama and increase publicity. This whole bit was merely a show to her, reiterating the aforementioned motif.The film ends with the freedom of Velma and Roxie followed by them sharing a musical number together, in reality and not in Roxie's head. Due to the fact they dislike each other, this gives the audience and interesting plot twist. Velma mentions that showbiz is the only industry where you don't have to like each other to make it, you just have to create a lot of publicity, so they go on the road highlighting their previous murder charges utilizing the incidents for fame and fortune.",Chicago

The non-musical actors really seem to be stumbling through this. Richard Gere looks like he's doing karaoke at home and pinch-faced,squinty-eyed Zellweger, though sexy, I guess, has the pipes of a third-string American Idol reject! Zeta-Jones, though impressive-looking really doesn't have any tough songs to sing and both hers and Queen Latifah's lines are delivered in a stilted, wooden manner. I find it surprising that Latifah was actually nominated for this role. It's also extremely disconcerting to keep jumping back and forth from the prison story to the glamorous daydreams of Roxie Hart. Never mind the fact that depravity and murder is glorified in the name of revenge and fame, this should have stayed a stage-musical and certainly should not have qualified as a contender for an Academy Award. I had an aversion to this film at the time it came out that I just couldn't put my finger on.

As well as I disagree with the statement that no one could sing . It is not TRUE ! Actores and actresses were really great and the dancing and singing were with no one mistake .

I will be adding the DVD to my collection when it is available.",Chicago
725,bah001us,fantastic,10,14 January 2003,"I saw Chicago the other night and was amazed at Renee Zellweger's subtle characterization of Roxie. Her singing voice, acting chops, and style of movement have been haunting me ever since. Zellweger does bring something magical to the screen which is hard to define, and she has slowly over the last few years become my favorite actress of all time.CZJ struck me as a conventionally excellent musical singer and dancer, which was great, but her acting was not as good as RZ's. Although she exuded charisma and was better than she was in Traffic, she did seem somewhat one-dimensional. It is hard to compare the two leads' dancing ability, because RZ did not dance nearly as much onscreen. When on together, I did not observe a big difference between their dancing, contrary to what some critics have claimed.I am recommending this movie to everyone I know, even those who have no interest in musicals. It is full of the best things in life and truly entertaining.I only wished it were twice as long, with the cut musical numbers put back in and additional acting/story. But that only makes me want to see it again..",Chicago

729,KidRadio,"Good, but not quite",4,12 May 2003,"I saw Chicago with my friend, who hates musicals of all sorts. And I left the movie theatre thinking ""Well. Urm, ok.""... Not like I did when I finished watching Moulin Rouge (A fantastic film).The plot is very simple, and with that, you need some incredible performances to add some meat to the bone. Catherine Zeta Jones is incredible as the murderous Velma Kelly, and Richard Gere is clearly having a whale of a time as Billy - however, the one role that left a bad taste in my mouth was Renee Zellweger as Roxie Hart.I think it's important, when acting, that you either do it exceptionally, or you do it really badly. Either way, you have left an impression. You have to go to either end of the spectrum. The worst sin to commit, I feel, is blandness. I think Renee's performance was bland - and certainly not Oscar-worthy. Chicago needed somebody that lit up the screen in the same way Liza Minelli did (Cabaret). Unfortunately, Renee doesn't do this - she should stick to romantic comedies.As has been said, I feel Chicago won so many awards purely because of the overlooked Moulin Rouge (a far better vision, and film) - and the soundtrack of the film version is spectacular (however, I feel we have the stage version to thank for that - except for Danny Elfman's extra touches here and there... the man is a genius).It's a shame, because if the film had a better female lead, I think it would have romped home - however, it falls at the last hurdle. Disappointing, I expected more of you, Chicago... ***/***** (3/5) (One star each for Zeta-Jones & Gere)",Chicago
730,bletul1,Surprisingly very much like the Broadway Play,8,10 April 2003,"After having seen the fantastic Broadway play, a movie version of Chicago almost certainly seemed doomed.  But this film does its best to capture most of the liveliness and excitement of the Broadway version.I thought Renee Zellweger had her best performance yet, so I was stunned to find out that she didn't win the Oscar.  And yet the slightly less-deserving Catherine Zeta-Jones won an award in her category.  I did not completely object to Richard Gere playing the attorney, but his dancing skills (or lack thereof) bothered me a bit.  Likewise, I'm a big fan of John C. Reilly, but he neglected to do the Broadway ""leaning"" bit while performing ""Mr. Cellophane"", a mistake I could not believe.Having said that, the film was fast-paced, intelligent, and well-adapted for the screen.  Audiences should keep their eyes open for the ""puppet"" sequence, one of the best scenes I've seen on film. If you're looking for a great musical film that comes the closest to Broadway, this is the film for you.Finally, while I highly recommend this movie, I cannot end my comment without the following complaint:  How in the world did Chicago beat out Gangs of New York for best picture???!!!  Friggin' Hollywood Morons!!!",Chicago
731,JobForSuperman,Best movie of the year? Umm...... no.,6,30 May 2003,"A musical is a musical is a musical; if you've seen one you've seen 'em all. This film won several Academy Awards. The costumes and sound were excellent. Catherine Zeta Jones turned in a performance worthy of the nomination, but not the statue (see Streep in Adaptation or Moore in The Hours). After watching this year's Academy Awards, I decided that winning an Oscar doesn't equate talent or excellence (ergo the awards given for best editing, best picture, best supporting actress, etc.)This film was predictable and unoriginal. If you like the music, go and buy the soundtrack. I suggest viewers see Cabaret first, and them evaluate this made-to-make-money Hollywood effort. So what, they're dancing around and singing in jail. What is the big deal? The common response seems to be, ""but people actually like it"". Great. Nothing wrong with that. On the other hand, there are people out there who won't simply settle for bright lights and choreography.If you want to see the art of filmmaking with intelligence and freshness, see The Pianist, see The Hours, see Adaptation, see Frida, see see Y Tu Mama Tambien, see Spirited Away. If you don't care what you watch, and just want some sugar-coated, mindless Hollywood entertainment, see Phone Booth, see Ice Age, see Mr. Deeds, see Spider-Man, see Chicago.",Chicago

734,jpurins,"Largely successful adaptation - Zellweger shines, Gere struggles",9,27 December 2002,"I saw the original 1975 Broadway production, the current Broadway revival, and a couple of regional productions in between.  This film adaptation successfully interprets the spirit of the original, without trying to put a stage play on the screen.  In fact, the story line and characterizations are stronger on film than they were on stage.  I believe this is due to the choreography being different for each character and actor, differentiating them more and revealing their individual personalities.  Zellweger is especially effective.  Zeta-Jones pushes too hard, overwhelming and alienating the audience with a 1-note performance.  This could be blamed in part on cutting of Velma's ""quiet"" song, ""CLASS.""  Queen Latifah was brilliant casting - I wish her vaudeville number wasn't cut up with flashes to the prison.  The only disappointment was Richard Gere's performance. It was a mistake to try to make him a dancer too -- it made him too much like everyone else.  Besides, in ""RAZZLE DAZZLE"" the lighting was so dark and the editing so quick that you couldn't really tell what he was doing.  Over all, though this was a delightful movie experience.  Not surprising, as Rob Marshall is strong admirer of Kander & Ebb, as well as having decades of experience with Broadway musicals, and his dedication is evident in this production.  Too bad he wasn't around yet when they filmed CHORUS LINE...",Chicago
735,preston_page-1,Screen adaptation of the classic Fosse musical.,9,28 December 2002,"A great job bringing the Broadway show to the screen.  The director, cast and crew did a killer job.  My only criticism is that several great dance numbers were cut - I'd have willingly sat through a longer film for Fosse choreography.  Director Rob Marshall did a fair job of imitating Fosse's cinema style; ""Chicago"" reminds one of ""Cabaret"" in many ways.  And who knew Catherine Zeta Jones, Rene Zellweger and Richard Gere could dance and belt out the tunes so well?  Every aspect of the film feels like a labor of love. I hope ""Chicago"" finds an audience.  The theme is as fresh today as it was for the Broadway debut.",Chicago
736,WhateverLolaWants,wow.,10,1 January 2003,"I wasn't expecting it to be so good. My friend and I had been planning to see it together since the end of last school year (we're both musical theater-geeks and big fans of the stage version of Chicago), but she wasn't home for Christmas break so Ii dragged my boyfriend to it on opening night. After having the theater staff take us to a separate theater from the others, almost getting stuck in the elevator on the way up to the hidden-away theater it was screening in, and waiting in the longest line known to man, we saw the movie. And..wow.  I was expecting it to be good, but not this good.  Man...it just blew me away.(esp ""Cell Block Tango"" and ""They Both Reached For the Gun"").  I am currently coming to terms with the fact that it might even be better than my latest movie-musical obsession, Moulin Rouge. And surprisingly, I didn't break out into song in the middle of some of the musical numbers. (That's the danger of knowing the soundtrack by heart before you see it.) anyways, it was definitely worth my nine bucks. go see it now!",Chicago

When i heard it was a movie a little over a year ago i almost died of happiness. When it came out in limited release (and not in my town) i was very dissapointed so my friends and i all drove down to LA and saw it there... it was worth the 2 hour drive.

Even some of the people I know who hate musicals LOVED this one! I guess it's primarily because it's not a traditional musical where the people just break out into song. I definitely will buy this DVD, and I already own the soundtrack (a soon-to-be classic). This movie will mesmerize you, even if your not very keen of musicals. A very well-paced movie... there is at no point in the movie where you loose interest. Great cinematography, acting, directing, costumes, sound... everything! Definitely best-picture worthy. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have a lot of fun at the movies!",Chicago
739,my-1,What's all the fuzz about?,6,15 February 2003,"I don't get it. Chicago has been covered in Golden Globes and Oscar-nominations - but to me it's just an old-fashioned, ordinary and unambitious musical, distinguished only by charming performances by Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones (oh, and Queen Latifah was good too).Moulin Rouge and Dancer In The Dark revived the musical genre by pushing its boundaries, by playing with the characteristics of the genre and by finding new ways of integrating songs, images and story. This one simply seeks to revive the classical Broadway-musical (albeit with a fairly juicy story) - and if you dig that, you might love Chicago.The problem to me is that almost every song brings the story to a complete standstill. And if Chicago's pastiche of 1920-ragtime/jazz doesn't make your every cell tingle with joy-joy-joy, you spend half the movie waiting for the music to be over. Furthermore, very little has been been done to lift the songs from their stage origins. Only one of the first musical numbers - ""We Both Grabbed For The Gun"" - is truly interesting to watch on the big screen (this one actually also propels the story forwards).The stuff between the songs is actually quite good. Most of the performances are great. The story is thin but still fairly entertaining, moving at a brisk pace in between those damned songs. The media satire is slightly amusing (but never poignant). Chicago isn't a complete waste of time. It's not the movie of the year, either.",Chicago
740,Candygrl1086,WHAT THE?!?!?!,1,4 January 2003,"I am a huge Broadway fan, and if you've seen the play, this is a HUGE disgrace. If you could vote a zero on this site, I would have voted a negative 8,000. The play is very humorous, not a dramatic freak show! And having Renee Zellweger playing Roxie is a DISGRACE to the name of Ann Reinking, who was the original Roxie (in the revival). And the choreography totally disrespected the late Fosse. He choreographed this show on Broadway, and there wasn't any Fosse dancing in it at all. Catherine Zeta-Jones, though a good dancer, did a horrendous job with the part of Velma. Bebe Neuwirth originally played this part (in the revival), and Catherine couldn't hold a candle to her. Queen Latifa, though semi-tolerable, was a weird choice for this part, seeing as the script was changed, her character did not work. And I personally love Richard Gere, but he was a poor choice for Billy Flynn, seeing as he couldn't sing WHAT-SO-EVER! I love his character, but I cringed every time he opened his mouth. Over all, if this wins any oscars, I will keel over, because I was soooooo disappointed. For anyone who disagrees, go and see the REAL show, and then tell me what you think.",Chicago
741,MetsAngel,Amazing ...,10,4 January 2003,"I too have seen the current run of Chicago on Broadway - I've seen it twice, with the original revival cast and again last January.  Both times I was extraordinarily impressed and while I was looking forward to seeing the movie, I felt that there was no way for the movie to hold a candle to the show.  Needless to say, I was blown away.  Catherine Zeta-Jones' rendition of ""All That Jazz"" in the opening scene gave me chills.  Who knew she could sing like that?  Renee Zellweger brought just the right sense of confusion to Roxie's character, and Richard Gere gave Billy Flynn just the right amount of sleaze and greed.  I have absolutely no complaints about the casting.  While I was disappointed that Mary Sunshine did not turn out to be a cross-dresser (one of my personal favorite scenes from the play), Christine Baransky was just perfect in that role.  My one and only complaint about the movie was that I did not get to see enough Taye Diggs!!  I think (and hope) Chicago will be the dawn of high-quality movie musicals, just like in the '40s and '50s.  I loved it and highly recommended it to everyone who appreciates a raucous, crazy, exciting movie.  Kudos to everyone involved - it was outstanding.",Chicago

""All That Jazz"" has never sounded better and my favourite number is the finale--""Nowadays"".  I loved the film and I usually don't like musicals!

745,gmgignac,My Favourite Musical and Movie,10,9 July 2009,"I Love this MovieI'm Not Going to Go Into much detail why because there are a lot of comments that tell why this musical is great. From the brilliant choreography, to the detailed costumes, to the stellar acting, and the top notch singing and dancing there is no arguing that the production value of this movie is purely amazing. I think that the idea of the musical songs and acts being inside Roxie's imagination adds a lot to the musical and even more to the depth of Roxie's character. The complexity of these imagined sequences is i think sometimes under appreciated. The fact that not only are these imagined numbers are an insight to the characters of the performer and gives them time to show the inside of the character and not only be subtle, but it is also Roxie's perception of the character (although these seem to be more like the characters then we see of them in their conniving, none musical scenes). Just imagining the actors using this new concept of what Roxie thinks of them and how they act around her and how Renee used the numbers to see what Roxie thinks of everyone else and herself just intrigues me. As well the concept, to me, works better than the stage. It gives a reason for the music and allows the movie to break away form the standard musical where the characters break out into song. IT gives more realism to the characters and story when the characters are singing in an fantasy world, rather than in the real world where people don't spontaneously sing and dance. I think the whole Roxie's imagination concept is musical genius. Another thing I want to talk about is that I often find comments and reviews where people say that the movie is uplifting and cheery and happy, sometimes this is used as a compliment and often it is not. In fact this leads to the major reason that this is one of my favorite movies. The movie should make you at first feel happy and want to cheer for the characters but then you should get a feeling that something isn't right and feel unsettled and in fact the message is the opposite of up-lifting. You should leave the movie with a feeling of deep disappointment in the ways of society*SPOILER ALERT*I find it hard to see why people would feel up-lifted by this movie, when two murder's not only are freed from jail but become famous, their lawyer frees both of them by lying and committing perjury,the one character in jail who is innocent in the jail gets hanged, and the devoted husband is left in the dust. My favorite line in the movie is in the end when Roxie and Velma are done performing their act and they get their roses and say their thank-yous and Roxie says ""Thank You. This is all because of you."" That line just tops the image of these two murderers getting of free and becoming famous because of their fame that created and because of all the people around them that deceived and connived to give them success and get their personal wants fulfilled when because of Velma and Roxie three people died.I find this result disturbing and i think the message gets across due to the disturbing camera actions at the end of the movie that leave you unsettled and a bit confused which is how you should feel at the end of the movie. You should sit and while watching the movie being clapping and cheering for Roxie and Velma then look and notice you are clapping for cold-blooded murderers.",Chicago

I do not like Richard Gere; however, this is one role I would have never expected to see him perform well in.  I have actually gained a little respect for the man as he was willing to stick his neck out and try something totally different.  Well, he did basically play himself (cocky S.O.B.)  but he did it with flair and I hope that the only roles that I will ever have to see him in again involve tap dancing.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is every inch a performer, she made Renee Zellweger look like a broomstick (I would wager that she has never danced a step in her life), she did put a lot into the role, though.  Perhaps renee's costuming could have better concealed her ribcage.  Don't get me wrong, the costumes were fabulous, but I think they were better suited to Catherine's veluptous figure.  I would like to have seen more of the dancing, I felt much of it was lost in close-ups and fast editing, especially in the Cell Block Tango.  John C. Reilly did a knock out job, he never ceases to move me and I was happy to see Colm Feore, a fellow Canadian, as the Assistant D.A..

I knew and wished she could sing with that cutsie cartoonish voice of hers and she's good in the movie! Unfortunately, the rest of the movie and cast isn't as good. Zeta Jones can dance (the only main character who can in the whole damn movie) but her dancing's unpolished and the movie doesn't showcase her talent. She has singing potential as well, but it's messy as well. Gere's funny, good banjo singing. Modern musicals suck because they forget what's at the heart of a good musical: strong and entertaining dancing and singing.

And what has happened to busty Bridget Jones? Poor Rene looks like a pre-pubescent gymnast, which i found so disturbing it made me lose interest in the film itself. Zeta-Jones is a talented singer and dancer thou and played the part to her best efforts, whilst Zwelleger also has a great singing voice. The film felt pretty flat though and i think after watching the stage version; whilst this one has a clearer, more structured plot-line, i would not recommend viewing both.",Chicago

Queen Latifah is superb as a loving prison matron who can get you anything for a price. John C. Reilly is great as always and has one of the best songs in the movie. Rob Marshall shows great promise as a film director and choreographs the movie with grace and style.

In your dreams !!!! Moulin Rouge is an inventive re-imagining if what a musical has to be in these modern times:Chicago is just plain BORING, and when it is not boring and stilted it is just plain distasteful. Couldn't care less whether the film is faithful to Fosse's Broadway effort,and therefore can only judge this film on its objective merits-- Too bad, as it has precious few unless you are so starved for entertaintment that just about anything will suffice. Just ghastly from start to finish and if anything is an illustration of why the musical as a genre was declared DOA over a decade ago.Instead of building on the example set by Moulin Rouge someone decided to "" go back to the future"" and spice up a decrepit art form with a few fast edits and stagy set pieces. If this horrible mess wins the Oscar for best picture in 2003,it is pretty clear that the Oscars have become totally irrelevant.Its not that I have anything against ""bread and circuses"",its just that I don't want to be served tasteless day old bread and forced to watch poorly mounted circuses.

Let me say this: If this movie would have been as bad as I originally expected, it would have been much, much better than it actually was.Set in Chicago in the 1920's, the movie focuses around two unlikeable, idiotic characters, Roxie Hart (Renee Zelwegger)- a jazz singing hopeful, and Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta Jones)- the star of the nightlife club scene of Chicago. Both convicted of murder, they find themselves in prison, far away from the glamour and spotlight they both live their lives to gain. After a few harsh exchanges between Velma and Roxie, jealousy arouses and the competition to dominate the public eye, newspaper headlines, and win the services of hot shot lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) begins.
The most miserable point in this film is the grotesque, terrifying seductive dance sequence starring Queen Latifah, who's role in this film still baffles me.""Chicago"" takes your through a maze of assanine skits, songs and pointless dancing, leading you to a gut-wrenching stomach ache as you leave the theater. I beckon all moviegoers, steer clear of this tragic display in the history of film making. The stench of this movie does not dissipate for quite some time. The rage you'll feel for spending your money on a film this useless will haunt you for the remainder of your days on this earth!My Rating: 0 out of 10.",Chicago
764,gsunchang,Surprisingly Fantastic Film,10,12 February 2003,"Fantastic film ... easily the year's top 5.  Catherine Zeta Jones is an amazing performer (a little heavier than I'm used to seeing her) but her singing and dancing was incredible.  She outshines Renee Zellweger on screen with every scene.But the one scene - the best scene that should take this movie over the top for its creativity, choreography, music, and simply overall performance is the mannequin scene with Richard Gere.  This scene alone is worthy of Oscar talk.  Throughout the movie, Richard Gere obviously isn't a natural singer or dancer, but he holds his own.  But this scene made the entire movie for me.Queen Latifah is worthy of her nomination, but Velma Kelly is the star of this movie and Zeta Jones should win for best supporting actress.",Chicago
765,jazzmonster,Spectacular!!,8,25 April 2003,"Roxie Hart (Renée Zellweger) is having an affair with furniture salesmen Fred Casely (Dominic West) just because he says he has connections and can get her on stage. One night he tells Roxie its over and he only said he could get her on the stage just for the sex. So angry and hurt Roxie shoots him. Roxie is arrested and taken to jail where Mama Morton (Queen Latifah) says for money, she will help her out by calling Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) the best lawyer in the whole of Chicago. Roxie's loyal husband Amos Hart (John C. Reilly) pays the bill for the lawyer expenses. But Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is also a client of Billys and her spotlight of ""Sweetest Little Jazz Killer"" has been stolen by Roxie, Velma is very jealous...This movie is one of my top ten of all time, I loved it. It had great music, humour, dancing and one of a kind acting. Richard Gere did a great job and I found his scenes the funniest. Renée Zellweger I found to be a little dry in places but pulled it off and Catherine Zeta-Jones, what can I say? She was excellent.The music was delightful and I'm going to buy the soundtrack, The best songs where ""All That Jazz"" by Catherine Zeta-Jones and ""Razzel-Dazzle Them"" by Richard Gere. Not only was the music good but it fitting into this film perfectly and didn't spoil the story line.Although I didn't give this film a top score of 10 out of 10, due to the sex in it. I think it spoiled the film and the film could of been spared. I'm impressed though, they didn't swear to much.All in All, a must see. I plan to buy the DVD and treasure it. I love Jazz music! I love Chicago!",Chicago
766,edmarod,Most disappointing movie in 20 years,1,16 February 2003,"It is incredible to me that ANYONE, other than Renee Zellweger's mother andMichael Douglas think this is a good movie.  It is dark, loud, off-key and off-beat. Katherine Zeta-Jones is not in shape.  Anyone who says it is actually her doing the dance number at the end is not looking at the screen.  The dance numbersare disjointed, and, because many of them are parts of ""dream sequences"", they neither begin nor end as one would expect of a properly choreographed dancenumber.  Although the play by play call of the trial scene is funny, it lasts only 10 seconds.  Hardly worth the price of a nearly two hour show (which because ofhow bad it is seemed like it must be four or five hours),  I wanted to leave after 20 minutes, but figured my wife would insist on staying.  Afterward, she told me she didn't like it either.  Please save your money for a good movie.",Chicago
767,MLNRGE1,Predictable & Boring,1,19 February 2003,"I heard very good things about this film & was sadly disappointed in the songs,which I forgot as soon as they were over, and in a plot that within 10 minutes you know exactly how it will end .The performers were not a whole lot better,with the exception of Zeta-Jones who was quite good. Gere & Zellweger were blah to say the least. I saw it with 2 others & they had the exact same reaction. Save your money & don't waste your time.",Chicago

774,audgie_ak,"Chicago, a surprising hit in my book.",10,16 March 2003,"I walked into Chicago thinking I would be seeing a lot of big name stars trying to dance around with voice-over songs and what I got was blown away. In fact, the movie was made exceptionaly better by these big named stars. You walked in with low expectations and to see stars like Richard Gere, Renee Zelweger and Cathrine Zeta-Jones dancing and singing was enough to blow you away. I give major props to the casting directors and to the stars themselves for this one. Queen Latifa also blew me away with her serious role. I definately recommend seeing this movie. It could easily become the next big musical following Grease.",Chicago
775,Nomarthomll,what an amazing film,10,19 March 2003,"I will make a bold statement here and say that this is the best movie I've seen in a long time. Considering that I have always been a fan of musicals Chicago definitely caters to my demographic but I was a bit skeptical of how they would pull it off with what I termed non musical actors especially Renee Zellweger. So as I sat down I had a little reservation as to how it would come off.I was happy to say that I left the theater wanting to go right back in and see it again. Rob Marshall did an excellent job of seamlessly integrating the musical numbers into the story especially with the way they were staged, the costumes, editing, cinematography, etc. were terrific. Catherine Zeta Jones was amazing as Velma Kelly while Richard Gere gave his best performance I've ever seen as Billy Flynn. The supporting cast was tremendous with Queen Latifah, John C. Reilly, and my personal fave Christine Baranski giving first rate performances. The one principal though who really blew me away was surprisingly Renee Zellweger, she was totally convincing as the wannabe star and never mind the fact that she displayed excellent singing and dancing skills, her acting was in a word superb. She definitely held her own and then some.All in all it was nice to see a film where those involved gave their heart and soul and left you thoroughly entertained. I have since seen this movie again and will probably go yet again can't say I've ever done that before. So in conclusion I give this film a 10/10!!",Chicago
776,allthatjazz213,it was superb movie,10,23 March 2003,omg chicago is honestly one of the best movies i've seen and one hell of a good musical....that includes west side story. the cast was amazing and they did a superb job singing. wow i saw the movie twice and wow is just the word to describe it.,Chicago
777,epsylon20,Not worthy of Oscar,1,26 March 2003,"Even Moulin Rouge was a better movie. This film has no interesting plot, not much special visual FX, not much special SFX that could lift it up from the other musicals. It is something I could have recorded in a theater. I admit, that the music is fine, but it outrages me that it took the Best Movie Oscar. Why don't they make a special Oscar for musicals? How could this movie compete with something like Lord Of The Rings, or The Pianist etc... It really was a DISAPPOINTMENT. Period.",Chicago
778,foxycleopatraaaa,"Disagree with other reviews, PERFECT adaptation of the show.",10,31 March 2003,"I Saw the show here in Melbourne , Australia and loved it and was eagerly anticipating the movie , I LOVED IT , Catherine WAS Velma she was born for the role and blew me away , Renee was adorable as Roxie and Richard was hilarious as Billy , And Queen latifah ? Bad casting? I THINK NOT, Perfection she totally brought the house down with her song I wanted to cheer! Such a great movie and the most perfect adaptation of the musical.",Chicago

780,Blue_Monkey,Blows My Mind!,10,29 April 2003,"When this movie FINALLY got to my podunk little corner of the world, my friends and I were completely psyched to see it, being the little drama kings and queens we are.  And I was in no way disappointed.  Catherine Zeta-Jones' and Rene Zelwegger's vocal performances blew me away, and *minor spoiler?* I found Richard Gere ripping his pants off to be strikingly funny. Queen Latifa's performance as Mama Morton shocked me;  I had no idea that she had that kind of talent!  10 out of 10!  Totally getting bought in August when it comes out on DVD!",Chicago

Each and every scene was beautifully designed.  it was full of details and full of appeal to all the senses.  Even the most simple concepts was melodramatically presented, with melodrama not over imposing.
What more can you expect, the music was amazing, the dances were the best ones i have ever seen, the drama, the humor, the satire.  Not a single moment of the movie was dull, without action.  the movie truely siezed my complete attention and throughly entertained me.  I was talking about this movie for atleast one week.  I ended up recommending this movie to each and every friend of mine.  I'll   ardently recommend viewing this movie.
This is the best musical movie I have ever seen in my life.",Chicago
782,coleylou,Saddened and Offended,1,23 August 2003,"Anyone who has seen a musical should be offended by this movie.First of all, I love the stage version of this, and I enjoy many a movie musical.  But I was both saddened and offended by Chicago.I respect everyone who enjoys this movie, but I was greatly disappointed. I went to it expecting to have a good time, because I am such a large fan of the stage version.  But instead I saw a dumbed down version of a film for an audience who wasn't going to see the film anyway.What I'm talking about was the decision to put all of the musical action into Roxie's head.  I took this as an insult.  Musical theatre isn't exactly high up on the general publics list as good.  And what I thought the director was attempting here was to ""explain"" the ""silliness"" of people breaking into song.  Rather then simply letting it happen.  I guess I figured that would be an attempt to please an audience that wasn't going to see the movie anyway.Unfortunately I couldn't get past this.  Probably because of my attachment to musicals and this particular one.  But I am glad so many people enjoyed it.  But I'm afraid that now more directors will do their musicals just like this one.Now beyond this, I was upset at the directorial choices for the costumes, the set, and even the sexual orientation of a particular character.  I would've made different casting choices, because I think there are people out there more talented then some of the big names in this film.  They did not make it bad, by any means, everyone did a good job.  But it was just good.  With a few exceptions.I was truly saddened by this bastardization of something I hold dear to my heart.  I just hope that this doesn't influence more films of the same style.",Chicago
783,zacsbabygirl1,The Best Movies I Have Seen In A LONG Time!!,10,24 June 2003,"Awesomely wonderful movie... it was great...I didn't relies that the actors could sing and dance...it was great, and the sound track is WONDERFUL!!

784,gsegg,I thought I would hate it,10,15 June 2003,"The first time I saw ""Chicago"" was because a friend told me it was a great movie and he bought my ticket.  (Later I bought my own tickets to see it again).  As I sat in my seat in the theater that first time, though, all I could think about was what a waste of time it was going to be. But then the movie started.  From the opening music I began to sit up. Then when Velma, with her eyes, called her sister's spotlight over to herself, I was thinking:  ""This is good.  If the rest of the movie can hold up to this opening.""  By the second musical number, where Roxie is singing atop the piano and changes her tune, I was laughing.  And then, by the puppet-show press conference, I knew I was not just watching a movie but a masterpiece. And, in the final scene, with the shooting-out of the lights, I knew I had just seen a true classic. ""Chicago"", I believe, will be regarded by generations to come as a triumph of 21st century film-making.  They will likely scratch their heads wondering how Marshall could have been overlooked for Best Director.  Someone will have to explain to them that Oscars during our day were not awarded based upon the work for which they were nominated, but based on past performances of the nominees; and the director of ""Chicago"", being a rookie, was thus ineligible to actually win.  The Oscars are considered opportunities to recognize Lifetime Achievement... not to recognize the most deserving among a single year's nominees!",Chicago
785,sb1990us,One word: wow!!!,10,17 June 2003,"When I originally saw the Broadway production of Chicago at the Shubert Theater last December, I had the mind set that the show was just released as a film.  Once I left the theater I immediatley wanted to see the screen adaptation.  The one thing that concerned me was how the performances would work into the film since the only way they work is really on a stage.  And let me tell you, it didn't disapoint.  Chicago was THE Best Picture of the year.  Its the story of a nightclub diva wannabe named Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) who shoots the man she is cheating on her husband with out of protection.  She is arrested and taken to jail where she meets her idol Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones).  Both are trying to beat eachother out for the headlines of all the newspapers and the attention of the their lawyer Billy Fynn (Richard Gere).  Its big, loud and entertaining and is a must see.  All the perfomances are great and Renee was robbed of an Oscar for her performance.  If you do anything this August, rent Chicago.",Chicago
786,chicagollama,"Good, but not great",9,19 August 2003,"I love the musical Chicago. I am obsessed with it and I was really excited when the film came out, and my verdict is, if you haven't seen the show, you'll love it, if you have seen the show, you'll like it but you may feel a bit cheated. They changed so much of it and a lot of it was in my opinion unnecessary.1. Mary Sunshine is actually a transvestite, however (s)he is treated like a woman until the court scene in ACT II when they reveal (shock horror) that it is a man. This is to show that a. all is not as it semms, and b. the show is supposed to poke fun at vaudville, which would have included tranvestites. 2. ""Cell Block Tango"" is supposed to precede ""When you're good to mama"". In the film they haven't done this. I'm not entirely sure why... 3. Several songs were just.. not there. These are- ""A little bit of good"", Mary Sunshine's solo song, ""I am my own best friend"", Velma and Roxie's unintentional duet, ""I know a girl"", Velma's song defining her feelings for Roxie, ""Me and My Baby"", Roxie's song celebrating her new found ""luck"" although some of the lib in the song is used as well as the music, ""When Velma takes the stand"", this is Velma trying to show Billy her ideas for when she makes it into the courtroom, although the film loosely touched this song when Velma tries to tell Billy what she might do, but it is extremely different to the upbeat song in the second act, and ""Class"" although they have put that as an extra on the dvd. 4.The script is completely alien to the script in the musical, with so much extra lib put in, and loads of the original removed or changed or even said by different characters. 5. The court scene is 99.9% different to the one in the musical, the only similarity is the verdict.I feel that Renee Zellywigger, Zellwuggum...her, she is a very good actress, but is completely wrong fo the part of Roxie. She is supposed to be tough and not a little skinny thing, although not pudgy either. I think Renee was slightly too...pasty to be Roxie, I don't know what but she was missing something...I think the main fault with the film is that they've stripped Chicago of its soul. It's supposed to be a funny, ironic, jazzy story. But i feel they tried to make it too sexy and eerie, which it just isn't really.So all in all, a very good film, but they tried a bit to hard. It's supposed to be very simple and a lot left to the imagination. Now THATS Chicago...and all that jazz.",Chicago

I completely enjoyed it, I only regret that I never saw it in the theaters because I am sure it would have been even better on the big screen. All of the actors were great and I thought they had alot of courage to use their own voices and danced as most of the actors had not done that before in any movies that I know of.",Chicago
788,jproyjr1,Exceeded my expectations,10,23 August 2003,"I must admit to being one of those people who knew all the words to all the songs and most of the libretto, meaning I was probably predisposed to being a little overly critical of anyone other than Fosse, Verdon and Rivera, but I gotta admit these guys got it right. They got the cynicism, the energy, the bravissimo, the sexiness, the comedy and the perfect POV. Not a single performer was on my must see list. I had no experience with the Director/Choreographer's work. I saw Danny Elfman, Taye Diggs and Colm Feore and thought ""What the..?"" They all won me over completely. I've been singing these great songs out loud in public and defending my heterosexuality occasionally since I bought the disc. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere all blew me completely away. The choreography was hot, hot, hot. Costumes, lighting, sound, everything served the source work wonderfully. I can understand why some who have not seen the musical might have questions, but to them I say, just suspend your disbelief. You did it with Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and entered their worlds. This is simply a new one for you.",Chicago
789,gblasek,Why did this win Best Picture?,4,4 October 2003,"I won't go so far as to say this movie was bad. It did have some good moments, but it was average at best, and certainly not worthy of Best Picture, especially considering the films it was up against. I would have to say that all of the other Best Picture nominees were better than this one.Renee Zellweger is probably the most over-rated actress in Hollywood, and she was not the appropriate choice for this role, since she obviously could not sing or dance - I'm sure she underwent some obscene amount of training just to bebarely competent at both. At least Catherine Zeta-Jones has had some stageexperience and could hold her own - even shine - in the singing and dancingdepartments. John C. Reilly was great, despite the fact that this was a pretty predictable role for him.The editing, and art direction really didn't live up to the hype either. It was competent, but I didn't see anything really that spectacular. I also felt like the editing, in many cases, was used to hide shortcomings in the stars' danceperformances (see above). The only reason I bring it up is because this isallegedly the Best Picture of 2002, and I would expect better.Even as a musical (and I do occasionally enjoy musicals) this film just left me cold. Some of the numbers were fun and executed well, but overall, it reallywasn't all that exciting. The gangster storyline is about the most tired cliche in American cinema, and the music was forgettable at best. This film felt like the big studio's attempt to cash in on the success of Moulin Rouge, which was by far a better, more original take on the movie musical (with superb art direction to boot).  Frankly I felt like Chicago was an over-hyped star vehicle that wasshoved down audiences' throats. I just don't see what all the fuss was about.4 out of 10",Chicago

The talent of both Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellwegger is just astonihing, as both have definelty proved to be, not just extremely talented actresses, but also skilled musical performers.

791,shopaholic,"Saucy, sexy, show stopping and incredible!",10,8 February 2005,"This film is amazing. It is saucy, sexy, electric, humorous, show stopping and the action never stops. It is a film that will keep you on the edge of your seat. You'll probably still be singing the songs and dancing around for days and weeks after watching it.The film follows two women, the stage performer Velma Kelly and Wannabe starlet Roxie Hart. Both women are jailed. Velma is jailed for killing her husband and sister after discovering their affair and Roxie for killing her lover when he used her. It follows their highs and lows in prison to get out and gain publicity and both use the help of top lawyer Billy Flynn to get there.There are many songs and show stopping numbers in it and the acting is incredible. There is great chemistry between the three main actresses/actor Richard Gere, Cathrine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zwelleger and they give a show stopping performance every second of the film. There are parts like the amazing and unbelievably incredible Cell Block Tango performed by the murderesses of the Cooke County Jail which is sexy, seductive and is so catchy I'm still singing it. There is also the hilariously comedic press conference rag with Roxie portrayed as a puppet, the fast paced tap dance that matches Billy Flynn's fast talking nature in the final courtroom scene and the fun and smooth 'When Your Good to Mama' by Mama Morton as well as numbers such as Razzle Dazzle, Funny Honey, All that Jazz, Roxie, Mister Cellophane and the list goes on.The film captures the switch from reality of the story to fantasy where everything is told through dance and singing. There are many witty comments and one-liners and humorous comments that will have you laughing and smiling. The action switches constantly and you never know what's going to come next.This film will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end and it is a film to remember. The directing by Rob Marshall is brilliant and he captures every scene perfectly. The costumes, songs, dances, all the stars including co-stars Queen Latifah as Matron 'mama' Morton and John.C.Reily as Amos Hart, the sets, choreography and the chemistry all contribute to the film to make it a spectacular and incredibly brilliant film that can be watched again and again and loved by all ages.",Chicago

794,hollyvolley,FANTASTIC! And all that jazz...,10,8 January 2005,"This is a truly truly GREAT film- and for people who like music and dancing- it's pure entertainment- The detractors here really need to stop taking themselves- and everything else- soooo seriously.How can anyone think that the whole film is intended to be anything but pure camp?- it is a SPOOF- and definitely NOT an attempt to ""show how corrupt things got in Chicago in the 20's and '30's""- There are hundreds of self-absorbed dramas about gangsters and crime that drive that kind of thing into the ground!!The musical numbers are performed FLAWLESSLY- and Catherine Zeta-Jones especially should look for more films that showcase her talents as a singer and dancer- CHUTZPAH! Zellweger puts a lot of life into a character that might fall flat performed by others- CHICAGO is not a character study- it is a musical comedy- and greatly entertaining From the get go- this film is PACKED with images and sounds that ran through my head for weeks after.The visual beauty is stunning- the lighting and use of color and movement have never been done any better anywhere else- CHICAGO captures the best of a Broadway performance, delivers it perfectly- and then takes it to the level that only a film could- moving us- and the characters around the scenes. Billy Flynn's manipulation of the press as a group of marionettes, as he simultaneously works Roxy as a great big dummy are brilliant- and couldn't be duplicated even on the stage- his courtroom antics are not realistic- they are hilarious parody. Queen Latifah's ""When You're Good To Mama"" is a classic piece of cinema- a mesmerizing performance that must eclipse anything she could do in the world of rap. The ragtime setting and music capture the era's sights and sounds better than most films made then, or since then- THE STING did much the same thing- although it was a different kind of film- (Did you notice the actress common to both?)This movie is always a jolt for me- a shot in the arm among life's everyday inane doldrums- I just bought the DVD today- and there's a great commentary and behind the scenes look at the making of it- I think this movie deserves all the accolades and awards it garnered- I wish a CHICAGO came down the road more often",Chicago

Worst choice for best picture ever by the academy.  Throughout the film I was genuinely bored to the point of tears. Should never have been made into a movie.  Should have kept it to stage only.5 out of 10. See Moulin Rouge instead.

I remember seeing KZJ in a series on British TV, and whilst she was always very attractive, Hollywood has made her beautiful, breathtaking in fact. She has been in the theatre in the UK for a few years and obviously has tremendous talent, Zwellneger left me open mouthed with a performance that deserved an award. Fosse was obviously a genius/",Chicago
797,fredf-455-62206,Differences with the play,6,24 October 2019,"Chicago started out as a real life story of two women who murdered men and got off. their stories was written by a reporter in a book, it became a silent film, then a sound film (Roxie Hart) and then a Broadway play. The Broadway play broke from the realism of the book and films to become something quite different both thematically and stylistically - a satire of corrupt society and the live for the moment life style that feeds it. This film and the play are thematically and stylistically similar, so it is relevant to compare them.The play was structured as a concept musical on the mold of Sondheim's Follies. A music numbers are (like Follies) mainly a pastiche of music from the 20's. There is a plot, but it is only an framework to hang satire of government and the people live only for the moment. Stylistically it is erotic and jazzy. This mainly comes from the jazz dance style that was invented by Bob Fosse, and has been imitated (usually badly) by just about everyone since The play moves very quickly and so the emphasis is on the style and the satire, not the plot. This is very effective, leaving the viewer with the impression that we live in a corrupt world that is supported by people who live only for the moment without thought of the consequences. This is emphasized by the song ""Nowadays"" which comes at the end of the play. ""It's good, isn't it? Grand, isn't it? Great, isn't it? Swell, isn't it? Fun, isn't it? Nowadays!""The film attempts to fill in the story, giving the characters motive and more personality. This weakens the over all effectiveness of the theme and causes the film to drag in some spots. It also makes it necessary to add even more plot to keep the interest up. For example, the scene of Velma coming in with the diary at the trial and Billy tap dancing to handle it is entertaining but it was not in the play and added to prevent the trial scene from falling flat.It also slows down the film by trying to add and explain too much. Let's compare opening scenes. Another revealing difference was the opening scene. In the movie there is a lot of set up about Velma getting to the theater after killing her sister and their lover. Velma's number is interrupted frequently to show Roxie, her boyfriend's excuses, Roxie imagining she is Velma on stage, Roxie and Boyfriend leaving , making love etc. All these interruptions tend to be a bit annoying because Zeta-Jones does a great job on the number and frankly I would have preferred to see it all. Then we see that the police arriving for Velma at the theater, Day's later, Fred roughs-up Roxie and says he's leaving Roxie shoots him, as she calls him an Son of a b. When he is dead she stands sobbing saying, ""Son of a b.""In the play, there is no lead up all. The orchestra starts up, Velma and the dancers come on stage and she starts singing ""All that Jazz."" While they are singing and dancing Roxie drags Fred on stage they are passionate with each other. The music continues but the singing stops between verses. Fred says, ""Listen, uh, yours husband ain't home, is he?"" Roxie shakes her head and VELMA says, ""No , her husband is not home,"" and sings the next few verses of ""All that Jazz"" while Roxie and Fred are passionate. Then a break in the singing, Fred walking away. Roxie says, ""So that's final, huh, Fred?"" Fred says, ""Yeah I'm afraid so, Roxie."" All the girl dancers call to him, ""Oh Fred."" Fred Turns back to Roxie. ""Yeah?"" Roxie: ""Nobody walks out on me."" shoots him
Fred, dyhing: ""Sweetheart""
Roxie: ""Don't 'sweetheart' me, you son of a b."" and shoots him two more times.
Fred falls and dies Roxie looks around and says
""Oh, I got to p."" and runs off
Velma sings (as if to comment on Roxie's state.
""No, I'm no one's wife
""But, oh I love my life
""And all that Jazz
""That Jazz""
The number endsIt is tight, economical and powerful - far more powerful than the movie. There is no explanation of Velma killing her sister - we find that out later in the
""Cell Block Tango."" All we know about Fred is that he was leaving Roxie - that is all we need to know. There is no dwelling on motives, character motivations etc. that is all extraneous. This is the Jazz Age. People were doing things without a lot of thinking. All of this is wrapped up in the ""All That Jazz"" number and it explains it all.At the end of the film when Roxie sings ""Nowadays"" so much explanation and added plot has passed that you wonder why she seems happy. You can't imagine her being spontaneous. The number seems puzzling and a bit out of place in the film.In the play ""Nowadays"" is clear. She is moving on and not dwelling on the past at all.To be fair, much of what is done in the play could not be done on film. Film demands more realistic settings, while a play can create a world with a few props and a bare stage. But some of it is Hollywood's own imagined limitations. Hollywood thinks that audiences want everything spelled out for them. Hollywood thinks that Fosse's risqué choreography would be poison for a mainstream film. So although the film was dedicated to Fosse, they did not use his breakthrough choreography.But the film has it's moments. A few of the lines that were added to the film were very good and I loved Zellweger and Zeta-Jones in these roles. They played them better than anyone I have seen on the stage. Gere, however, was not in the same class. Okay, he played smug well, but he was far too aloof, so he did not seem to be truly part of that lifestyle, and that detracted from the theme of the film. As a film remake of a great Broadway play it is better than most and I did enjoy it, but the play is better. (The play opened in 1975 and is still playing on Broadway today. The longest run in the history of Broadway.)I suppose my ideal Chicago would be on the stage with Renee and Catherine in the lead roles",Chicago

I felt like i was watching myself on that screen. This is one of the best movies that i've ever seen so far. I don't even remember how many times i watched it. The storyline, dances, cast etc. is really well thought out. You should definitely watch this movies, it's a must-see movie. And this movie is not like other musicals/dance movies.

801,peter-erskine,Chicago is a terrible film.,1,18 February 2005,"This is the only film that I have walked out of half way through in over forty years of cinema visits. I thought it was clichéd, derivative, shallow. It reminded me of Moulin Rouge which was also banal, with a deliberately contrived, cheap script. Chicago had singing and dancing at its core yet used two stars who were no good at either. All the characters were cardboard cutouts and unscrupulous and unpleasant into the bargain. I felt I was being manipulated by a typically empty Hollywood package. Compare and contrast with Mike Leigh's Topsy-Turvy, a wonderful, sensitive, colourful film full of pathos and character. Chicago was a terrible film, a product of dated, worn-out, hackneyed ideas.",Chicago
802,chris_mertins22,How hot is Renee Zellweger in this movie?,10,23 January 2005,I have seen nearly every movie of Renee Zellweger's and she is every time getting hotter. Especially in the Bachelor she looks magnificent. I mean seriously i just think she is the hottest. She is so hot it is not funny. i u don't agree u r probably a girl or some one really annoying so i mainly wanna here good remarks please. Since i am struggling to write ten lines i am going to ask everyone reading this to watch Cinderella Man when it comes out it is supposed to be really really good and it looks cool case it is about boxing. Also the Janis Joplin movie staring her is hopefully going to be really good and is going to be a musical i think.,Chicago
803,kacskoforever,hell of a boring film,1,5 January 2008,"i have already seen it few years ago. I watched it again today. I didn't remember that this was that awful. Music is nice, but sometimes too much. Everything in it is too much. I like only C. Zeta-Jones in it. Maybe because i think she's looking good. Rene dance good i admit, but she's ugly. They sing nice. But the only think I can tell about the movie: BORING!!! I don't know why but it is. And banal. The Moulin Rouge was way much better than that. I just cant understand why this movie won the Oscars... But Al Pacino didn't get Oscar for The Godfather either and that is the top movie today. Thats my opinion! I don't see why this movie was so successful... Do people know about the movie Cabaret? Chicago doesn't even have a message. Its just a fuss, delusion without a meaning. More people praise it the more i become indignant. This movie could be better!!! I don't know how.",Chicago
804,maxman_2,A horrible Film,3,4 May 2005,"When i woke up and turned on the radio station and heard That Chicago won best picture I was in shock. I thought it was a very over rated and should have not even been nominated for a Golden globe. Jones and Gere are horrible at being Supporting actors. While Zellwegger is just plain bad. This movie is not worth your money and is one of the worst musicals ever. I even think that Grease 2 was better then this. I don't think i will ever understand how this movie won the Oscar over ""The Hours and The Pianist""""And all that jazz.""The Greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist""",Chicago

If you need a nap please watch this because you will drool away at a musical with a bad story....Richard Gere is once again disappointing... The best character is queen latifah but her little performance can't carry this train wreck...Catherine Zeta Jones can dance but what is dancing without anything behind the actual movement. If you really need to see this movie, I would suggest you go rent it and save your money instead of buying it. Renée Zellweger looks like she lost about a hundred pounds for this movie and it makes her very unattractive. If you are a guy who is at all skeptical about a musical in the first place don't even go near this one. This is for all the hardcore musical lovers who just want to sing along to these horrible horrible songs.",Chicago
806,jones_hottie_7,good 1920's killing movie with all that jazz!,10,15 May 2005,"this movie is great if you like old time type movies. It keeps you interested. It seems long but if you give it time then you will be able to tell how great it really is. Renee Zellwigger and Catherine Zeta-Jones are a true team. They make the movie all the better.In my opinion all the supporting actors and actresses deserve nominations. This movie is out of the world and truly shows what a 1920's murder was like. No forensic files and no proof of anything. Just plain balls of steel. I rate this movie at a 5.0 with two thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I liked this movie so much because of what it is and who is in it. This is a musical and it has action and dancing. Also a lot of good actor and actresses, Queen Latifa, Renee Zellwigger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Richard Gere. This is one of the best movies!",Chicago

809,rtangey,Perfect introduction to musicals,10,18 June 2005,"I was with some friends on an eight hour road trip when they decided to play some music to relieve the boredom. They put the CHICAGO CD and politely asked me if I minded. Having no choice I said go ahead and for the next hour or so was pleasantly surprised. This type of music was certainly not what I would actively seek out(alternative,punk,metal etc..) Last week it was shown on cable here in Australia. Fell in love with it again and went out and got the DVD & CD. Not one bad song and transition between songs and dialogue was flawless. Richard Gere's performance was very delightfully surprising. Other cast members' roles were equally brilliant. Being a novice to this genre of film (and music!), I would've expected doubles to be used for the song and dance and the revelation that EVERYBODY did their own bits gave me an even greater appreciation and respect for the film.Will have to check out the other Fosse,Ebb and Kander material.",Chicago
810,whoami-04269,And All That Jazz,8,19 October 2015,"Directorial debut of Rob Marshall, instantly brought him worldwide fame, — adaptation of the famous Broadway musical by Bob Fosse and Fred: ""Chicago"", which, in turn, based on the play by Maureen Dallas Watkins. The incredible success of Marshall's at first a little surprised me, because nowadays, the genre of the musical enlisted in the ranks of the most unpopular and unprofitable. But what about Chicago, which was honored with numerous awards, including 6 ""Oscars"", including Best film, out of 13, and a Grammy award for the soundtrack? It should be noted that the tape is more than paid for itself in world hire, having collected a modest by today's standards 45-million budget of ""green"" more than 300 000 000$. Unprecedented success.Musicals — the creation of Hollywood, in the early part of the era they were popular and numerous. Bob Fosse is one of the leading Directors of musicals in the USA, on account of his Oscar-winning ""Cabaret"" with Liza Minelli and Michael York. Rob Marshall has taken the bold step of taking on a film adaptation of such a beloved and popular American musical. But after watching I sighed with relief — the first pancake is not always lumpy left. ""Chicago"" is a vivid, skillfully delivered and hardcore shows in the spirit of the 30-ies, atmosphere and spirit which Marshall managed to transfer almost 100%.Now, just about the most important thing in this movie — musical scenes. Without exception, all songs sounding here, incredible and good. A huge plus is that they are not inserted just so, and add and contribute to the development of the storyline. Simply awesome and amazing choreography, makes one involuntarily shudder and sometimes hold their breath. One of the most famous and popular scenes of ""Chicago"" — ""Prison tango"". Yeah, this room turned out! Will never be forgotten! Many people say that all the songs in the film should listen to the original, as the Russian dubbing incorrectly conveys their essence and distorts the plot. Will allow myself to disagree: Russian translation, of course, not literal, it was necessary to reach logical rhyming text, but the basic idea is passed correctly. Although in any case the voices Stotsky, Katz, D., Pierre-Marie Sokolova and do not go to any comparison with the original voices Zellweger, Zeta-Jones, Gere, Latifa, and S. Riley. And it's not the questioning the talent of our performers, on the contrary, they coped more than adequately, just the original performance is much more suited to the atmosphere of the film.The cast of ""Chicago"" is very inspiring. The main trio of the picture — Renee Zellweger (Roxie HART), Catherine Zeta-Jones (Velma Kelly) and Richard Gere (Billy Flynn) — play with dignity. More precisely, Zeta-Jones and Gere, but about Rene should say a few words. I categorically don't like how this actress plays in movies. For me, it is completely feigned and unconvincing. In ""Chicago"" anything good she did not show. On the contrary, she's the most annoying when watching, but the music scene with her participation like to rewind more quickly. Gere looks great in the role of adventurous lawyer Flynn, unusual for him role. But Catherine Zeta- Jones steals the show and all. Not only that, she is damn beautiful in this movie, a good singer, and performed all the movements and stunts herself, despite her pregnancy (and in fact her character Velma Kelly in the course of the film, a lot of smokes). In General, the ""Oscar"" given was more than deserved. Ftoroplastovye role not far behind. Queen Latifah — simply awesome came out of Matron ""Mama"" Morton. This is the only character whose Russian vocal voice in the person of Victoria Pierre-Marie liked as an original. John C. Reilly plays her husband-loser Roxie Amos, Billy Flynn which ironically calls Andy (was this broadcast in the 20-ies of the ""Amos and Andy"" and was the name of a Burger at ""Jack rabbit Slims"" ""pulp fiction"" Tarantino), and next to Zellweger looks almost the actor from God. Tay Diggs in the role of a black ""lead"" this show looks good too. Christine Baranski (also played in another popular musical ""Mamma Mia!"" Phyllida Lloyd) plays the journalist Mary sunshine, whose image is based on the Creator of the play ""Chicago"" by Maureen Dallas Watkins. Well, Dominic West Fred in brief the role of Kasli nothing particularly stood out. Also pleased with the participation in the film of the Russian actress Ekaterina Macanawai (""Uh Uh"" in ""Prison tango"").The technical side of the picture on top. Well, about music and so a lot has been said, but here the camera work in the person of Dion Beebe is simply pleasing to the eye! It is largely thanks to her musical scenes are perceived to be so vivid and bright.""Chicago"" is still one of the best musicals, visited me. It is worth seeing, as it is an example of what this genre is not yet completely forgotten and quite relevant today.",Chicago
811,mrsannamarting,Chicago!,8,7 November 2015,"Chicago is a comedic musical, which depicts a crime story set in the 1920's of a group of individuals whose lives are connected through a chorus girl whose desperation and rise to fame is focused on the fact that she has shot her lover. Renee Zellweger plays the chorus girl Roxie Hart who receives vast media attention as her case goes to trial with Chicago's slickest lawyer, Billy Flynn (played by Richard Gere). Tying it all together are stage performer Velma Kelly, (Catherine Zeta-Jones), Matron Mamma Morton (Queen Latifah) and Roxie's loyal and unfailingly committed husband, Amos Hart (John C. Reilly). Velma and Roxie have more commonalities than one would initially perceive as they outwit the public for their murders committed based as a result of elicit affairs. Together they begin to portray the overall alternative theme of the movie—that nothing lasts forever, particularly fame.Throughout the film there is a sense of outdoing one another when it comes to lead stage performer Velma, and initially meek Roxie Hart. But after Roxie hires the same lawyer, she begins to dazzle viewers and the town of Chicago with her stories and wit. As she becomes more and more of the center of town (and jail-house) conversation, Velma begins to envy the attention that she receives, as she is used to it being focused on her—and planned to use several of the used defenses in her own case. As the story unfolds the viewer begins to realize that the only intent Roxie Hart has is to be known. While she has a husband who loves her (regardless of the affair) she just wants to be loved by many, and known by all—thinking that she will be fulfilled in the lime light.The director does a great job utilizing music, angles and lighting to keep the viewers engaged in every song and dance perfectly executed in the film. Each scene dazzles the viewer with its swanky Chicago charm and balanced choreographed steps. While some musicals can be drawn out and boring—this film was one that was quick, engaging and light hearted, despite the murderous crime content.Overall, Roxie Hart is a lovable character that, as a viewer, you want to cheer on. You want her dreams of fame and stardom to come to fruition, and in one of the last scenes, as her court case comes to a close, and she is exiting the courthouse—you feel her pain and disappointment as the limelight shifts from her to the next woman who has shot her husband, and Roxie's 15 minutes of fame are over.",Chicago
812,stuart-287,Chicago is an excellent piece of film,9,18 September 2005,"Chicago tells us the story of Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger), a simple girl who dreams of being famous, just like her idol, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta Jones). In pursuit of this dream, Roxie begins an affair with Fred Casely (Dominic West), who promises her he has the right connections and can get her into showbiz. After a month of stringing Roxie along, Fred reveals he has no connections and dumps Roxie, which angers her so much she shoots him. Despite her long suffering husband Amos' (John C Reilly) best efforts to get her off, Roxie is arrested for the murder. She is then taken to Cook County Jail, only to find herself sharing space and a Lawyer, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere)with Velma Kelly. Billy manages to get Roxie the fame she always craved, thus taking Velma out of the spotlight. Roxie's fame is fleeting however, and when Billy gets her off the murder she thinks she is headed into a life of fame and fortune, only to discover the press have lost interest. After failing auditions she reluctantly agrees to form a double act with Velma, which brings them the real fame and fortune they both crave. Director Rob Marshall draws us into the world of 1920's Chicago from the very opening seconds of the film. The muted jazz trumpet and extreme close up of Roxie's eye precede a frenetic opening sequence taking us directly into a jazz club. Fast Jerky camera movements show us everything but the face of who we realise to be Velma Kelly. The music played by the band takes us right back to the era and give us an incredibly real experience of the club, whilst building our excitement. The dark lighting except for the glittering spotlights of the stage make us realise the contrast between front and back of house. A great impact is created when we first see Velma's face, dead centre of the frame and lit up in a spotlight with huge black sultry eyes. Finally, the quickening edits between Roxie and Velma's faces put us right inside Roxie's head as she imagines herself in Velmas place. This is an opening sequence you won't forget in a hurry, Being a musical, Chicago's forte is obviously its musical numbers, which are all born out of Roxie's showbiz focused imagination. This technique of cutting between real life and imagination works to great effect to show us the contrast between the real bleak world and the fabulous spectacle of the dream world, making the spectacle and choreography more intense. One musical number where this technique works superbly is the Cell Block Tango. Roxie has just arrived in prison, alone and terrified, when the dripping of a tap and the stamp of a warden's feet build up to become a beat. The Cell Block Tango begins, and we hear the tale of the 6 merry murderesses of the Cook County jail, and how they ended up in prison. The sharp monologues and witty lyrics make a brilliant accompaniment to the spectacular dance routine, and the dramatic red lighting and theme of a red scarf give the perfect suggestion of blood. No man is ever going to cross any of these women. Another point where the contrast between showbiz and reality makes a powerful statement is when Cook County Jail makes its first execution in 47 years. Catalin Helenski (Ekaterina Chtchelkanova) (a Hungarian inmate who speaks only 2 words of English - not guilty) performs her famous disappearing act, where the bleakness of the snowy day contrasts beautifully with the sheen of the theatre. In showbiz world, Catalin escapes by disappearing. In the real world she dies, and we hear the applause of the fictional audience as her coffin is wheeled past Roxie's window. The other aspect of the film which makes it a success is the performances. Renee Zellweger makes the perfect Roxie, with a much stronger voice than you'd expect from her, and an excellent dancing ability, as well as a strong acting performance. The only thing wrong with her is her figure.As she spends much of her musical number in skimpy costumes you can see the full horror of her skeletal frame, her bony knees jutting out from her skinny legs and completely flat chest. This is a far cry from her figure in Bridget Jone's Diary, and clashes horribly with Catherine Zeta Jones' fuller healthier figure. Catherine also gives a great performance fully deserving of her Oscar. She plays the diva role down to a tee, perhaps as she has so much practice in real life, and her dancing and singing is also good. Richard Gere also give a strong performance, maybe not in his singing, but he plays the never failing lawyer with the right amount of arrogance. Supporting performances are also good, especially from John C Reilly and Queen Latifah. Overall, Chicago is an excellent piece of film thoroughly deserving of its 6 Academy Awards. The musical numbers are never contrived as they seem in many musicals, and after seeing it on screen it is hard to imagine how they pull it off on stage. This is a film to enjoy over and over again, due to its fabulous music, decadent costumes and strong performances.",Chicago
813,fradgley-63481,Fantastic! What's not to like?,10,17 April 2017,"Winning Best Picture at the Oscars in 2002 is a massive achievement and when you watch the film, you can see why. The acting is great and they really set the tone for 1920/1930's jazz era. Charismatic Richard Gere (who plays lawyer Billy Flynn) has a tremendous voice and didn't realise how quite far his range can go. He nails two of the biggest songs on the track - Razzle Dazzle and They Both Reached For The Gun. The latter performed is quite humorous and really shows his ability to manipulate and control the press. I've been quite a fan of Catherine Zeta Jones from her very early days working alongside David Jason in Darling Buds of May. Her acting was fantastic and the dancing routines were well choreographed for her sort of movements. Cell Block Tango was grand and performed really well. John C Reilly is a great singer as well, it's outstanding how they've managed to collaborate these actors together to sing in great harmony. The story line is good, strong and doesn't dwindle. It's a story of romance, comedy, fame and fortune which is represented awesomely! Would recommend to anyone, including those who hate musicals!",Chicago

815,domoattack,Corruption in Prison,10,4 February 2018,"Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) is taken to prison on murder charges where she meets Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The two are represented by the same attorney, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), and both are captivated by being in the spotlight. A major theme throughout this film is corruption. Corruption of society is brought up when Fred Casely (Dominic West) lies to Roxie. It was wrong of him to lie, but it is also a highlight on just how low people will go to get what they want. Roxie was believing the lie just because she wanted to get into showbiz. 
The color contributes to the theme of corruption during the second song. Amos Hart (John C Reilly) was covering for Roxie, and when realizes what happened, he tells everything to the police. At this point, Roxie is bathed in a red light, representing corruption, contrasting with Amos who has blue, pure, light over him. 
The press conference really brought to light how corrupt everything was. The press were represented as puppets with Billy Flynn as the puppeteer. This symbolizes that he has full control of the press and they write whatever makes his clients look good. 
This theme can also be seen in The Shawshank Redemption, directed by Frank Darabont. Corruption takes place in the prison between bringing in contraband to illegal bookwork. This is true for Chicago as well, you notice that anything can be done for a pretty penny.",Chicago
816,christopher-160,Excellent,10,13 March 2006,The motion picture theatrical portrayal of this Broadway musical reproduces nearly all of the emotions and feelings of the stage set production as in that of the New York and Chicago based productions. Nothing can compare to live theater but this movie should be seen to be understood. The pure mix and feelings set by the use of camera angles and lighting really add to the complex nature of this film. Pay attention to how the camera is used to give perspective to viewer so that they feel as if they are part of the scene (as if you're in the audience or part of the movie). I'm not one who's normally really big on commentary but this is one of those films that I can watch again and again. /cbh,Chicago
