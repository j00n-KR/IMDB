0,Leofwine_draca,One for fans of mindless action,7,23 May 2016,"Making a sequel to 300 must have been a daunting prospect. After all, the story of the Battle of Thermopylae was a self-contained war film with a very definitive ending seemingly at odds with the idea of a sequel. However, the makers of 300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE have done a good job with this film, which offers more of the same while something different at the same time.300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE is a deeply flawed film with plenty of problems, but nonetheless I enjoyed it. The film is packed full of war action - with a distinctive naval slant this time around - filmed in the same highly stylised way as in the first film. Thus we get lots of CGI blood sprays, slow motion hits, and superhuman feats. I'm easily pleased when it comes to well directed action, and this film doesn't disappoint in that respect.Although the central characters lack the gravitas of Gerard Butler, Vincent Regan, and Michael Fassbender from the original film - and Sullivan Stapleton as the protagonist is seemingly devoid of charisma - this film does boast an excellent villainous performance from Eva Green. Green seems to be giving her all with her character in this one, relishing the opportunity to play a hard-bitten, ass-kicking female commander. She's by far the best character in the thing.Elsewhere, RISE OF AN EMPIRE has some prequel stuff showing the rise of the Persian god king Xerxes, some concurrent stuff (a CGI composite of Butler is brought back in the same way they brought Schwarzenegger back in TERMINATOR SALVATION) and sequel antics. Unfortunately the storyline is very predictable and Lena Headey's character shouldn't have been included at all. But there are some spectacular set-pieces here, particularly the fiery attack in the water, and as mindless action it works well.",300 - Rise of an Empire
1,SnoopyStyle,too long to make the sequel,6,30 July 2014,"Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) was the leader of the Athenian forces who killed King Darius during the battle of Marathon 10 years ago. His son Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) disobeys the final words of Darius to launch an all out war on the Greeks egged on by ruthless Persian general Artemisia (Eva Green) bent on revenge. While King Leonidas and his 300 are at Thermopylae, Themistocles has gathered a force of regular folks to take on the massive Persian navy.It's been 8 years since the first movie. The shock of originality is long gone. There has been many others since especially the Spartacus TV show. That is this movie's greatest deficit. It would have been a good sequel 6 years ago. This just feels a little worn out. A tired narration by Lena Headey at the start doesn't help. Sullivan Stapleton doesn't quite have the same big screen presence. The standout in this movie is Eva Green. She has a grand time playing the villain. Like 300 and everything about this franchise, everything is stylized. They look good but the fakeness does grind on me. This franchise is best left finished. Its time has come and gone.",300 - Rise of an Empire
2,Prismark10,Less than 300,4,5 August 2014,"This is a flawed sequel-prequel to 300 focusing on Themistocles the legendary leader of the Athenian forces who killed King Darius during the battle of Marathon. The King's son Xerxes swears revenge as he is transformed into a campy looking warrior king and launches total war on the Greeks. He is supported by a female Persian General of Greek origin, Artemisia (Eva Green) who wants revenge on the Greeks who killed her parents and raped her as a child.Themistocles has got together a band of farmers to train and take on the Persian army in some crafty sea battles.300 the sequel is all over the place in tone and consistency. It lacks the graphic novel look of the original. Its inconsistent, whereas the Spartans were born and trained fighters, here the farmers suddenly become victorious warriors as if the screenwriters have a grudge against Persians or modern day Iran!The Greeks might value freedom but raped and enslaved a little girl. The Persians might value autocratic rule but made a female Greek, a general.Even Lena Headey the narrator and the wife of Gerard Butler in the original is transformed into a tough warrior Queen. The violence is bloody and brutal but the film has a whiff of homo erotic campiness mixed with bland acting leaving only Eva Green to steal her scenes as Artemesia the ruthless fighter and temptress.",300 - Rise of an Empire
3,nogodnomasters,ECSTASY OF STEEL AND FLESH,7,2 October 2018,"There is nothing like epic historical fantasy to piss-off the Iranians once again. This story starts at Marathon where Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) kills King Darius (Igal Naor) wearing a costume stolen from Emperor Ming. Darius' son Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) goes on to become a ""god-king"" and getting a minor role, while looking like the incarnate of evil. Persia has Artemis I of Caria (a pale Eva Green) lead the navy against Greece where Themistocles is attempting to unite the Greek city states to defeat the invading Persians. Sparta wants to go its own way. The 300 Spartans we get to see laying on the ground dead, post battle as Xerxes proclaims victory and moves on to Athens. I guess that was my bad expecting to see the 300 do battle and that whole thing about the goat path because someone put ""300"" in the title of the film.This is the adult fantasy version of the story. There was plenty of slow motion blood splatter. They like the blood to land on the camera lens (or glass) and look suspended in the air for a while. The speeches given in the film were necessary for the production, but were completely boring. ""Freedom is her wisdom has chosen you to defend her.""There is also both male and female narration because not everyone knows butchered Greek History. This film takes liberties with the accounts of Plutarch, Herodotus, and Polyaenus. For instance, Artemis I of Caria was actually Queen of Halicarnassus and only commanded five ships. Her character is greatly multiplied in this film.Good popcorn film for adults. Nothing more.Parental Guide: 2 F-bombs. Night time distant rape. sex. nudity (Eva Green )",300 - Rise of an Empire
4,kosmasp,Something in between,6,5 August 2014,"Actually in between, before and after. That is time-line wise, if you were curious when this is playing. There are a few scenes from the original 300 in here. It never really achieves the heights of that movie though, which comes down a bit to our main actor. While Butler had the charisma to pull the role he had to play and be as macho as he had to be (or even more), we do paddle back a little (no pun intended).Still the movie is nicely done and the action will keep you occupied. Added highlight: a ""sensual"" scene (with nudity). Hopefully that won't spoil the movie for you (after you didn't care about all the blood and violence). But one has to admit, that it seems a bit tagged on. A weird scene whatever your opinion on it is, that can be exciting, disturbing, hot and annoying all at the same time.",300 - Rise of an Empire
5,classicsoncall,"""I would rather die a free man than a slave!""",7,5 February 2019,"Not quite a sequel to the original ""300"", and not quite a prequel either. I was kind of surprised actually that the story of ""300"" and the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. was embedded into the structure of this movie, which in it's way placed both stories within the same historical context. The thing is, if you saw ""300"", you're going to get pretty much a repeat of the same story here, at least from a stylistic viewpoint. The battle scenes are crimson and muddy with a huge emphasis on buckets of gore coming at you from all directions. The saving grace, odd to say, is the presence of a notorious villainess named Artemesia (Eva Green), the leading general of the Persian Army who brings the naval war to the Greeks, led by Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton), who does his best to unite the city-states of Greece to meet an implacable foe. The film should well appeal to action/adventure fans who go for the blood and guts, but one wouldn't be remiss after a while to feel that enough is enough. Considering the presence of God-King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) making his presence felt from time to time, one might feel cheated by not having him engage in ultimate battle against Themistokles himself.",300 - Rise of an Empire
6,jboothmillard,300: Rise of an Empire,8,12 March 2014,"The original film was fantastically bloody, based on the graphic novel Xerxes from Frank Miller (Sin City), many people wondered if this was a sequel or a prequel, it's really a bit of both, and I was really looking forward to seeing it. Basically the film opens with the origins of Xerxes (Love Actually's Rodrigo Santoro), son of King Darius (Igal Naor), who was killed General Themistocles (Animal Kingdom's Sullivan Stapleton) of Athens, and we also see the origins of Darius's naval commander Artemisia (Casino Royale's Eva Green). The story takes place during the events of the original film, where the 300 Spartans went to battle the Persian army, Themistocles is forced to make an alliance of Athens with Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) and Sparta as he leads as admiral the small amount of ships against the Persians, and there is some help from the surviving Dilios (David Wenham) along the way, but Xerxes still reigns supreme on land and sea. The 300 Spartans are of course defeated, but hope remains as the soldiers at sea do manage to survive the numerous attacks and eventually outnumber the opposing army, and the vicious Artemisia is finally overpowered by Themistocles, and she sees Xerxes order retreat before she dies, the end of the film sees the alliance continue as the next battle on land begins. Also starring Jack O'Connell as Calisto, Callan Mulvey as Scyllias, The Tudors' Hans Matheson as Aesyklos, Andrew Tiernan as hunchback Ephialtes and Andrew Pleavin as Daxos. Stapleton isn't as charismatic as Gerard Butler was but is good enough, the returns of Headey and Wenham are terrific, and Santoro is still booming as the Persian leader, but for me the best performance and who stole the show was Green who was such a savage and blood-thirty villain, he finest moment is beheading a man right in front of a crowd, kissing the severed kiss, and then tossing it away. The references back to and incorporating the original film are clever, it is interesting to see the flashbacks explaining more about previous events and characters, and I can see why critics compare to something like Game of Thrones, with the ambitious use of sex and violence, this film definitely seems slightly more high scale to the previous, with brilliant special effects, and the 3D element is a good selling point to see blood spewing and limbs severed, a fantastic follow up historical action adventure. Very good!",300 - Rise of an Empire
7,ma-cortes,"Exciting follow-up packed with impressive sea battles , groundbreaking combats and C.G. images",7,6 April 2015,"After its victory over Leonidas'(Gerard Butler) 300, the Persian Army under the command of Xerxes marches towards the major Greek city-states . The Democratic city of Athens, first on the path of Xerxes' army, bases its strength on its fleet, led by admiral Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) . Themistocles was an Athenian politician and general , he was one of a new breed of non-aristocratic politicians who rose to prominence in the early years of the Athenian democracy . Themistocles is forced to an unwilling alliance with the traditional rival of Athens, oligarchic Sparta whose might lies with its superior infantry troops. As Themistocles was in effective command of the Greek allied navy at the subsequent battles against Persians . The Persian army led by mortal-turned-god Xerxes and Artemisia (Eva Green) , revengeful commander of the Persian navy. But Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) still reigns supreme in numbers over sea and land . During the first Persian invasion of Greece, Greek general Themistokles leads the charge against invading Persian forces , as he fought at the Battle of Marathon , and was possibly one of the 10 Athenian Strategoi (generals) in that battle . In the years after Marathon, and in the run up to the second Persian invasion he became the most prominent politician and warrior in Athens along with Milciades . He continued to advocate a strong Athenian navy, and in 483 BC he persuaded the Athenians to build a fleet of 200 triremes ; these would prove crucial in the forthcoming conflict with Persia . During the second invasion, commanded the army in battle of Artemisium and Salamis. Due to subterfuge on the part of Themistocles, the Allies lured the Persian fleet into the Straits of Salamis, and the decisive Greek victory there was the turning point in the invasion, which ended the following year by the defeat of the Persians at the land Battle of Plataea .Big production that blends historical battles , cross-swords , feats and spectacular images by means of Computer Generator , including lots of blood and gore . The movie is based heavily on Frank Miller's comic book mini-series , also entitled ""Xerxes"" ; being entirety shot at the indoor green-screen sound stages of Nu Boyana studios in Bulgaria. Miller openly admits that he made many radical changes to the history and director admits to making further changes . The script was written at the same time as the novel and not after the novel was finished so ultimately the two are different. Filmmaker Munro states that he was more concerned with making a film which would appeal to a wider audience, and creating a thrilling and visually stunning action movie rather than a typical historical epic. Interesting script full of historic remarks and thoughtful phrases being partially based on the comic books . An Athenian derides about the Spartans as ""boy-lovers"" , it was, in fact, the Spartan army that was erroneously thought to encourage homosexual relationships among soldiers due to the fact that a Spartan male would live with his fellow soldiers till about 30 years old , a similar line was used by King Leonidas in 300 . The script demanded that most of the male cast spend the majority of their screen time bare-chested, as per Frank Miller's original graphic novel titled ¨Xerxes¨ . Therefore, in order to adequately present themselves as the most well-trained and marshaled fighting force of the time, the entire principal cast underwent a rigorous and varied training regime for several weeks prior to shooting . This compelling picture results to be a violent flick combining historic events , drama and breathtaking fights . The flick packs nice settings , characters with elaborate costumes and a seamless combination of practical and CGI effects , including lots of blood and gore . The unique look of the film was produced in post-production by using an effect nicknamed ""the crush"". The film was photographed almost entirely on a sound-stage , using blue-screen and green-screen backgrounds . The filmmakers used bluescreen 90% of the time, and green-screen for 10% , they chose blue because it better matched the lighting paradigm and because red garments look better when shot over blue . Every little scene has been given maximum detail, as gowns , environment and Production Design by Patrick Tatopoulos , adding too much C.G.I. backgrounds and lush frames showing overwhelming combats . Brilliant and glimmer cinematography by Simon Duggan, being ""done in Renaissance painting style"" . Vibrating and shaking musical score by Junkie XL . This acceptable sequel to Zack Snyder's 300 was professionally directed by Noam Munro, though has some flaws and gaps . Film producers originally pushed to direct this film with a PG-13 rating as the goal but director refused and ultimately the studio agreed to make an R-rated movie.",300 - Rise of an Empire
8,paul_haakonsen,"Action, fighting, blood and slow motion... Everything this movie needs...",7,5 June 2014,"""300: Rise of an Empire"" was a good continuation of the first ""300"" movie. And chances are that if you enjoyed the first movie, then you will also enjoy this movie.Storywise, then ""300: Rise of an Empire"" does tied well with the previous movie, and continues on in a smooth, continuous flow. However, I will say that the storyline sort of comes in second after the action sequences that fully dominate throughout the entire movie.That being said, don't get me wrong, because I am not saying that the overwhelming action sequences were a bad thing. Actually, far from it, to be honest. I enjoyed the fighting and the action sequences. And true to the first movie, there is a lot of slow motion camera going on, which I found to be nice. But there is a little too much CGI animated blood in the movie, which was nice at first, but as the movie progressed, it started to become a nuisance and too much.The acting in the movie was good, and it was Eva Green who played Artemisia who stole the spotlight and carried most of the movie. She was given a great character and did a great job in portraying that particular character. And she was really well cast for that role.""300: Rise of an Empire"" is a man's movie, through and through. Lots of fighting, lots of action, slow motion sequences, blood and testosterone. The movie doesn't really require much brain activity to keep up to speed, so just sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.I am rating ""300: Rise of an Empire"" a solid 7 out of 10 stars.",300 - Rise of an Empire
9,Quinoa1984,Oh Lord Yeah,7,28 April 2014,"No, still not a very *good* movie in the sense of it being awe-inspiring or inspirational - we're in a landscape that has inspiration, if not direct adaptation, of the works of Frank Miller after all - but as far as just being bone-crunching, Saturday matinée entertainment it does its job. And more importantly the hero and villain, Sullivan Stapleton and Eva Green, are cast just about right, especially Green as the kind of villain(ess) who has a compelling backstory and holds the screen with lots of confidence and bad-assery. Also, not having Snyder as director (though apparently he wrote and produced it and did a more than competent job) was wise, since this time Murro, while sticking to the 300 formula of slow-regular-slow motion shots, gets either tired or tries just for the good ol' 24fps in the last third or so of the film.It's certainly nothing super-smart, but I had fun.",300 - Rise of an Empire
10,Theo Robertson,Inferior To The Original But Only Slightly Inferior,7,1 April 2015,"I can't understand the massive difference in votes average between 300 and its sequel 300 RISE OF AN EMPIRE . On its release nine years ago 300 was in the IMDb Top 250 for a couple of months . Today in the spring of 2015 it still has an average of 7.8 . One year after its release RISE OF AN EMPIRE has an average of 6.3 indicating a painfully mediocre film . Don't get me wrong I don't want to overstate the case and say this is some masterwork that should have walked with the Oscar for best picture 2014 and while it might be slightly inferior to 300 it can be summed that if you absolutely loved 300 then at least you'll like RISE OF AN EMPIRE A couple of things I wasn't too keen were first of all the buckets of blood splashing around . If someone is stabbed or splashed then a fountain of blood must project from their dying body . This effect quickly outlives its welcome . I know some scenes from 300 had this but not the extensive overkill as seen here , Watching with an academic film critic head on I did think because the villain was female it might be an allusion to menstruation but this isn't really a sophisticated film produced for study in film class . I later found out that the film was shot in 3-D and that cinema audiences have a choice of watching on a 2-D screen or let themselves get mugged for a couple of extra dollars so maybe that's the reason for the low voteThe second is there is a bit of gloriously bad dialogue . Try this: ""Shut your c--k hole"" and ""You've come a long way to stroke your c--k in Sparta"" and ""You fight much harder than you f--k"" I know there was almost as equally bad dialogue in 300 involving insults but none of the characters felt the need to swear . There might be a train of thought of a self aware campness to RISE OF AN EMPIRE reflected in this dialogue but that's very debatable since once again it all comes down to bloody pop corn entertainment without any sophistication . One thing that is missing from this sequel is that while the first one featured nightmarish mutants/demons here the Persian army seems composed entirely of mortal humans . From an entirely personal IMDb reviewer perspective and this is entirely coincidental it seems that every single film I comment upon at this site must feature either Lena Headey or Jack O' Connell and here they inevitably feature in the same film . Not necessarily a criticism and the best performance of RISE OF AN EMPIRE of course belongs to Eva Green in a film that while not as good as 300 is only marginally inferior",300 - Rise of an Empire

The CGI has none of the subtlety of the first film; the script even more crass and the battle scenes interminably long - and, surprisingly, unimaginative.

13,zardoz-13,A Good Sequel!!!,8,10 March 2014,"The surprising thing about ""300: Rise of an Empire"" is that the Motion Picture Association of America gave it an R-rating. Like its heroic predecessor about the Battle of Thermopylae, this sanguinary, sadomasochistic sequel depicts death by sword, spear, arrow, and oil, with its combatants slashing, hacking, and gashing limbs, legs, necks, and noggins with pugnacious abandon. Despite its ritualistic, CGI-laden depiction of naval battles, this ""300"" ranks as the bloodiest adventure epic ever produced about warfare during Classical Antiquity. Indeed, I felt like I was watching something that deserved a more appropriate NC-17 rating rather than a benign R-rating. Occasionally, Hollywood augments their fare when they launch them into the home video market with scenes appealing to a less family-friendly demographic. Typically, they synthesize more blood, sex, and violence into the cinematic content because the studios want to attract an audience that embraces a rougher treatment. Undoubtedly, you've seen the unrated versions of these DVDs and Blu-Rays. Apparently, the ""300: Rise of an Empire"" producers decided to retain abundant the graphic violence in their theatrical cut rather than delay it for home video. This gratuitous violence may sicken the squeamish, while gore lovers will applaud the hematic, larger-than-life intensity. Like the original, ""300: Rise of an Empire"" relies on slow-motion, ballet-like, battle sequences that enable us to appreciate the gravity-defying maneuvers of the combatants as they fight to the death. Comparing it with ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""300: Rise of an Empire"" shows everything but soldiers tangled up in their own intestines. Interestingly enough, this Warner Brothers release imitates the studio's classic films ""Bonnie & Clyde"" (1967) and ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969) that were among the first to wallow in slow-motion violence with arterial blood sprays.""300: Rise of an Empire"" does double duty as both a sequel and a prequel. ""300"" helmer Zach Snyder and ""Act of Valor"" scenarist Kurt Johnstad adapted Frank Miller's unpublished graphic novel ""Xerxes."" Their screenplay covers historical action before and after the first film as well as during it. You could describe ""300: Rise of an Empire"" as the meanwhile back at the ranch movie. Although Snyder and Johnstad make mention of King Leonidas, they have only culled Gerard Butler's scenes from the original. Now, the battles are shown from the perspective of Athenian statesman Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton of ""Gangster Squad""), while Leonidas' widow chimes in with some narration. Sadly, Stapleton amounts to a rather bland, lackluster protagonist. He doesn't chew the scenery with the gusto that Gerard Butler did, but his exhortations sound like those of Leonidas. Stapleton doesn't shout dialogue at the top of his lungs like ""This is Sparta!"" Although the Australian born Stapleton has a penetrating Montgomery Cliff stare, his Themistokles never overshadows brave King Leonidas. Nevertheless, whatever ""Rise of an Empire"" lacks in a charismatic hero, Smart People"" director Noam Murro more than compensates for this shortcoming with the most extreme villainess. ""Casino Royale's"" Eva Green sets the bar for female villains just as ""300: Rise of an Empire"" creates a new standard for presenting violence in sword and sandal sagas. You'll still be talking about Green's dastardly dominatrix Artemisia long after you've forgotten about Stapleton's Themistokles. She doesn't cut anybody any slack and engages in some pretty audacious acts..Although King Leonidas and his 300 warriors come up in the conversation, ""300: Rise of an Empire"" involves Athenians more than Spartans. Ambitious Athenian General Themistokles wants all Greek city-states to unite against the imminent threat King Darius (Igal Naor of ""Green Zone"") of Persia poses with his massive military supremacy. As the action unfolds at the historic Battle of Marathon in 490 B.C., Themistokles and his men rout Darius and his enormous naval fleet. Our aggressive Athenian champion proves his mettle when he mortally wounds the Persian monarch with a single, well-aimed arrow. Darius' son Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro of ""The Last Stand"") reaches his father's side too late to save him. The Persians retreat as a consequence of Darius' arrow in the chest. Darius dies in his bed after his semi-adopted daughter Artemisia (Eva Green of ""Dark Shadows"") tears the arrow out of his torso without blinking. Afterward, she sends young Xerxes off into the desert on a journey of initiation to become a man. Later, Xerxes returns and resembles the giant with too much jewelry and mascara that he came to be, but he displays his considerable menace with his height and his deep baritone voice. While he dispatches emissaries to approach King Leonidas, Xerxes sends Artemisia and his fleet to contend with the Athenians. Hopelessly outnumbered, the Athenians rely on clever stratagems to blunt Artemisia's probing incursions. Initially, Themistokles repulses her fleet, but she retaliates with something that the Greeks aren't prepared for even as they witness it. Eventually, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey of ""Game of Thrones"") reappears and spearheads an assault on the Persians along with ""300"" survivor. Dilios (David Wenham). Credit goes to Murro for choreographing some dynamic, but aesthetic battle scenes with gallons of ersatz blood and dismembered body parts flying. The naval battles in ""300: Rise of an Empire"" are nothing short of spectacular whether they are technically accurate or otherwise. Literally, the Greeks are reminiscent of David in his battle against Goliath as they mobilize their much smaller fleet and turn the Persians' physical might against them. In other words, they rely on strategy forged in the crucible of their own cultural heritage as much as their geographic location. Artemisia's back story about her captivity in slavery and the tortures that she endured at the hands and other appendages of the Greeks make you sympathize momentarily for her. Indeed, Artemisia makes a memorable villain who overshadows Themistokles. The back story of Xerxes is just as interesting, and the filmmakers have done a good job of converting the six foot, two-and-a-half-inch tall Rodrigo Santoro into a 10-foot giant. Altogether, ""300: Rise of an Empire"" qualifies as a rabble-rousing, historical hellraiser!",300 - Rise of an Empire
14,grantss,Even worse than the first one,4,25 March 2015,"Even worse than the first one.The first 300 had potential. An historic, 5th century BC, event, told using modern-day graphics. Unfortunately, it ended up being a lot less about history and much more about supernatural/fairytale crap (monsters etc) and over-the-top repetitive violence, all in slow motion. (It's not that I dislike realistic violence, it was just that it was so repetitive and frequent it was boring).300: Rise of an Empire also starts with potential. Sets up some of the history of Athens and Persia, moves onto the background to the latest conflict, including the Battle of Thermopylae (covered in the original 300) and ends with the Battle of Salamis.Unfortunately, it quickly falls apart. Massive historical inaccuracies and licence from the beginning make the plot laughable. There's less fairytale monsters and similar crap this time round, though the whole Xerxes enters a cave as weak scrawny mortal, exits as a large, buff, bikey-gang-piercings-filled god is a facepalm moment.Graphics are great, as you would expect. However, once again the action scenes get very boring, very quickly. More of the overly- frequent, repetitive, over-the-top, slow-motion violence.Dialogue is good for a laugh. Unintentionally. So many ridiculous, empty grand speeches.Weak performance by Sullivan Stapleton in the lead role. Were no known actors available? Odd accent that seems to change scene by scene. I know he's Australian, but his accent sounded mostly South African.Eva Green is great in her role and is one of the reasons to watch the movie. Intense, and very beautiful.Here's hoping this is the end of the 300 series...",300 - Rise of an Empire
15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Dumb fun, emphasis on both words",7,7 March 2014,"Whilst fearing that the Oracle's dark prophecy will come to fruition, Greece is divided on what to do about the invasion. Athenian general Themistocles(Stapleton, more concerned with his men's lives than Butler's Leonidas, sadly also lacking the infectious quality to his enthusiasm for the fight and the infinitely quotable roared lines) takes matters into his own hands, choosing to face the enormous Persian fleet with his, minuscule in comparison, but also faster and more maneuverable. He also brings expert tactics - then again, so does his countryman Artemisia(Green, deliciously bloodthirsty and insane, stealing the movie entirely), who fights for the other side, to avenge a horrible wrong done to her decades ago(and their dynamic aids the otherwise blander characters(even the returning ones don't need to be here), messy stalling plot and insipid writing). Who will emerge victorious?Taking place before, during and some after, this is a... sequel...? to 300, that goes with ""bigger is better"", and largely fares well. One location? How about three. A single historically accurate tactic? Let's go with half a dozen. Hundreds against a million? Dozens against... thousands... OK, so not everything fits that. This suffers under trying to connect to and imitate its predecessor - when this has no specific values defended or cemented in spite of namedropping freedom, does not add to the overall story, and, let's be honest, partially on account of aforementioned, has no reason to exist(which is not to say you won't have a blast... while the 3D is negligible, this is something to watch in theaters). It does gain from not slavishly adapting a comic(by Frank Miller, no less, whose work very much uses that medium's strengths), opening it up to being conventional, and more exciting and gritty(yes, it's a current action film, so of course it is... at the same time, that does lead to battle scenes enjoying a more visceral effect).There is constant bloody disturbing violent content, some nudity and a little(if certainly vicious... no, you read that right) sexuality in this. I recommend this to anyone who can get into mindless, ego-stroking(...why are the Spartans still the ones made to be the biggest badasses?) male power fantasy nonsense. 7/10",300 - Rise of an Empire
16,neil-476,Sidequel with the same style as before and little substance,7,14 March 2014,"While Leonidas and his 299 fellow Spartans are holding off Xerxes' Persians at the battle of Thermopylae (as seen in 300), Athenian general Themistocles is taking on mad admiral/general/bitch Artemisia at the Battle of Salamis.Zack Snyder's 300 took a story which is inspiring enough that it had been filmed before, and put writer/artist Frank Miller's visceral comics adaptation on the screen, image for image. With loads of CGI blood and stop/start slow motion. It was visually striking, groundbreaking in terms of its use of CGI backgrounds, full of oiled sixpacks, and fairly hollow in terms of depth of characterisation. And it was successful, so we have more of the same, only at sea this time.I quite enjoyed it, but it is even more hollow than its predecessor. Gerard Butler's Scottish Spartan in 300 is replaced as protagonist by a completely forgettable Australian Athenian, so you don't have a strong character to root for. Eva Green chews the scenery nicely and gets 'em out for the boys. Assorted individuals from 300 make it back, including Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes - it is good to see him in flashback with hair and beard before he gets his fancy dress costume on.And, as before, if all the slow motion sequences were shown at normal speed, the film would be at least half an hour shorter.Snyder produced and co-wrote, and didn't direct this time, but his template was followed and the film is typical of his work - all style, no substance.",300 - Rise of an Empire
17,anaconda-40658,The Empire Never Rises.,3,20 May 2015,"300: Rise of an Empire (2014): Dir: Noam Norro / Cast: Sullivan Stapelton, Eva Green, Lena Headey, Rodrigo Santoro, Hans Matheson: Sequel to the hit 300 and continues with what appears to be glorifying violence. There is no story worth noting here. Rodrigo Santoro is cast as the God King and that character in itself is about as laughable as Ronald McDonald. The plot doesn't matter. It is Sullivan Stapelton representing his side and leading an army of sword swinging warriors vs the idiotic giant God King and his nasty bitch warrior of a sister, played by Eva Green. The special effects are exquisite at best but extremely graphic in his presentation of violence. We see limbs cut off and it becomes pointless and repetitious. Noam Norro fills in as director and filling in for Zack Snyder is no easy task. The only performance that is interesting is that of sexy Eva Green whose negotiations includes rough sex but for all that lust, huff and puff she cannot get him to agree. She's a nasty little vixen who can handle a sword and seduce her rivals and she steals every scene she is in. Stapelton is a great presence but his role is one dimensional. He leads the army and has a decent stand off with Green. The climax is one big battle of bloody mass that ends with a pathetic cliffhanger. We have Lena Headey leading another army to join the Stapelton army in kicking ass. Hans Matheson plays another warrior risking his ass for absolutely nothing so that some dimwit can be patted on the back for it. This is a visually well made parade of violence that is empty headed and leaves all intelligence on the battle field. Score: 3 ½ / 10",300 - Rise of an Empire

Even if he accomplishes his mission, Themistocles must still face Artemisia, the ruthless leader of the Persian armada........You'd think a film that has almost in its entirety a battle at sea would be at least distracting in a few parts, but in the advent of poor 3D gracing the cinema, and arguably Eva Greene's poorest year in cinema, Rise Of An Empire fails on almost every level.300 wasn't the best film to begin with, but it had wonderful visuals, and Gerard Butler was entirely convincing as King Leonidas, so it's shortcoming can be forgiven, because Snyder gave us a fun, camp movie.Here, it's like a boring pantomime featuring characters with names that sound like STI's and as much lopping off of limbs and blood flying at the screen for the best part of ninety minutes, and Greene playing the wicked with every now and again.And it's boring, and pointless, and slightly less enjoyable than waiting for a taxi in the pouring rain.But It gets an extra point for having the funniest love scene I've seen I a film since The Rookie.Rise Of An Empire?

Israeli director Nam Miller takes over the duties of Zack Synder who directed the initial 300 and in every way the result is better.Sullivan Stapleton ('Strike Back') takes the lead and handles it well. After its victory over Leonidas' 300 (Gerard Butler) , the Persian Army under the command of Xerxes (the very sadly underused fine actor Rodrigo Santoro) marches towards the major Greek city-states. The Democratic city of Athens, first on the path of Xerxes' army, bases its strength on its fleet, led by admiral Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton). Themistocles is forced to an unwilling alliance with the traditional rival of Athens, oligarchic Sparta whose might lies with its superior infantry troops. But Xerxes still reigns supreme in numbers over sea and land – primarily due to the shenanigans of Artemisia (Eva Green). Lena Headley remains onboard as Queen Gorgo of the Spartans, as does David Wenham as Dilios. The story is slight, the blood splashing across the CGI effects-ridden screen is less this time around, every man's pecs are buff (except for the skinny strangely cast Hans Matheson), there is as much sex as can be expected from this group of warriors, and there are a few standout performances, though brief. For lovers of graphic comic novels this is a version of history magnified and brushed with many heads loped off and blood and fires and navy battles. A lot of buff men fill the screen every moment and that seems to be the raison d'etre for the part two of this 300 series. Definitely better than the first and a good diversion – for a holiday weekend.",300 - Rise of an Empire

Themistocles uses political means of alliances,respect, love/deception, the ability of having his enemy fight on his terms, and uses his weakness as strengths. Sun Tzu would be proud of Themistocles' tactics against a much superior force. ""Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt."" Sun Tzu, The Art of War is Themistocles' template for the movie's main theme. The acting in front of a blue or green screen is okay but not an epic like Troy.

I like about one-half of this film and the other half I didn't.The story is a far cry from the first movie - it sucks, badly sucks. I really expected this follow-up to sorta pick up where the first film left off and not a half messed up prequel.What I did like was the battles and costuming... and that's about it. Most of the actors are okay but could not hold a candle to the first film. My beef with it is the story stinks for the most part.I'm rating it a 5 out of 10 because I half way liked it, and half way didn't.

24,KineticSeoul,Guilty pleasure,7,17 May 2014,"The first ""300"" movie was amazing because it really brought something new to cinema with it's action and visuals. Despite the upgrades when it comes the the CGI and combat scenes, it doesn't really bring anything new. That isn't to say it isn't a entertaining movie, this is a entertaining movie. And the combat scenes which takes place near or on the sea is really cool and entertaining to watch. It's just the story didn't really immerse myself into the situation or got me pumped up like the first ""300"" did. This isn't necessarily a prequel or a sequel to the original ""300"" but what is going down while the story of the first ""300"" is taking place with Leonidas. The flaw of this movie is that although it has a lot of action and blood, it's just not a stand out movie like the first ""300"". Themistocles is badass in this, but can't compare to Leonidas played by Gerard Butler who stood out and engraved the character into the audiences brain for quite sometime. This has more action, more blood and nudity, but it just isn't as compelling or immersive as the predecessor. It's still a very entertaining movie that is worth seeing in theaters.7.8/10",300 - Rise of an Empire
25,Hellmant,As far as most sequels go it's a triumph!,9,13 March 2014,"'300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Sequel/prequel to Zack Snyder's blockbuster 2007 comic book film adaptation (of Frank Miller's popular comic series of the same name) '300'. Snyder once again co-wrote the screenplay with Kurt Johnstad (who also co-wrote the original) but this time chose just to produce the movie and not direct (opting to direct 'MAN OF STEEL' instead). He handed over those duties to Noam Murro (who previously directed the 2008 comedy-drama flick 'SMART PEOPLE'). Actors Lena Headey, Rodrigo Santoro and David Wenham all return from the original film but not it's star Gerard Butler. Butler's character did die in the first movie but this installment takes place before, during and after the events of that tale. The story this time centers on the 'Battle of Salamis' and is based on an unreleased graphic novel called 'Xerxes' (once again written by Miller). It stars Sullivan Stapleton and Eva Green as it's two leads (and Green steals every scene she's in). While it's not quite as classic as the original I still absolutely loved it!A lot of the film's story is narrated by Queen Gorgo (Headey). She first tells her Spartan soldiers about how Xerxes (Santoro) became a 'God-King' and declared war on Greece. He was influenced heavily by the evil Artemisia (Green). Artemisia was King Darius's, Xerxes's father (Igal Naor), naval commander and his most deadly weapon. She leads the Persian troops into a sea battle against the General of Athens, Themistocles (Stapleton). Themistocles is also famous for being the man who killed King Darius. Their fight is epic and the action scenes are breathtaking; once again captured in the same beautiful comic to screen style as the original.I've read some negative criticism of the film (by movie critics) which complain this chapter is too cartoonish and cheesy. I don't think that's any more true than with the original though; it proudly revels in it's B movie gloriousness (just like Snyder's 2007 masterpiece does). Like I said it's not quite as memorable or enjoyable but it's pretty damn close. Green is mesmerizing as the film's main villain and is one of the most fascinating female antagonists to ever grace the screen, in my opinion (she's sure to be on my 'most desirable actress' list for 2014). Stapleton is not quite as good an action movie hero as Butler is (and the film does lack Butler's presence) but he's good enough. Murro is also not quite as good a director as Snyder (either) but he's good enough as well. I really enjoyed it, as far as most sequels go it's a triumph.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/UUizoy5DkRo",300 - Rise of an Empire
26,Buddy-51,A case of once too often to the well,3,8 October 2014,"""300: Rise of an Empire"" is less of a sequel to the 2007 original and more of a companion-piece, since much of what it chronicles overlaps, rather than follows, the events of that earlier film. The jumbled chronology leads to a great deal of confusion on the part of the viewer, helped not one whit by the fact that all the actors look pretty much the same in their Greek warrior attire, so that one is never quite sure who is fighting where or against whom. And, in all honesty, I'm not really sure it's worth the effort trying to figure it all out.As far as I can tell, the set-up goes something like this: the effete and cowardly Athenians, who are always going on and on about things like philosophy and democracy, turn to the bellicose Spartans for help in defeating the Persians led by Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), son of the late King Darius (Yigal Naor). Yet, although Xerxes has been transformed into a gold-plated demi-god, he's really just the puppet of the far more ruthless and conniving Artemisia (Eva Green), who French kisses decapitated heads and has dreams of bringing arrogant Greece to its knees once and for all for killing her family and turning her into a sex-slave, though she herself is of Greek extraction. The Athenian leader is (the almost unpronounceable) Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton), who killed King Darius with a very well-aimed arrow through the heart and was rewarded with command of the army in grateful recognition of that feat. Beyond this synopsis, you're on your own.In an attempt to visually replicate the as-yet unpublished Frank Miller graphic novel that is its source, the movie employs a mix of live action and computer-generated imagery that puts the film in a kind of never-never-land of legendary pseudo-history.This garish spectacle of stiff acting, gleaming pecs, passionate hate- sex, pop psychology, two-bit philosophizing and slow-motion bloodletting is indeed something to behold, but, frankly, you've seen it all before - only better - in the original film.",300 - Rise of an Empire

28,bowmanblue,Like a 'straight-to-DVD' film that was in the cinema,7,17 December 2014,"Sometimes when a film is a big hit and then it gets a sequel, the second offering gets sent straight to DVD – some of the stars don't return and it doesn't get the same budget as the first. '300: Rise of an Empire' feels like it should have gone straight to DVD. Even though it has a reasonably sized budget and some of the actors return, it just comes across as a 'lesser offering.' That doesn't mean it's bad, just not as original and focused as the first. It serves as a prequel, sequel and also set during '300.' The Spartans from the first film are now more in the background and it's about the Athenian navy, tasked with the job of stopping the Persians.The gore is all there again and, despite not being directed (only co-written) by Zack Synder, it retains his trademark 'slow motion' and speed-up type effects. Also, once again, it's primarily shot in front of a blue screen, meaning all the backgrounds are basically computer generated. However, this time round it seems to appear a little cheaper than the first.It has enough action to keep most fans of watching multiple people being severed in two by swords, but perhaps one of its main flaws is that the lead characters don't really seem that strong. I read online that the part of the main Athenian – Themistokles – was offered around to some 'better-known' male actors, but the producers decided to go with a lesser-known one, in order to (hopefully) give him his 'break-through' role. I just felt they misfired there and they needed someone with a little more screen presence.Also, the villain from the original – Xerxes – returns, yet, instead of being the unstoppable epitome of evil he was from the first film, he's more of a sidekick villain who spends a lot of his time being manipulated by someone else.Overall, it's not a bad film. Just know that it's probably not going to live up to the original. Just watch it for its action and look at it as a 'compendium piece' to the first.",300 - Rise of an Empire
29,ThomasDrufke,"Can be entertaining, but underwhelming.",7,16 March 2014,"The first 300 was loads of fun, and full of great action sequences and memorable quotes. I can say with honesty that the only thing really memorable from Rise of An Empire is Eva Green. Without this movie, it would have failed miserably. With that being said, there is lots to like within her scenes. One particular scene comes to mind, but I'm sure you will know what I mean once you have seen it. She played a great villain, and surprisingly Xerxes is barely in the movie. This movie can still be enjoyable for those of us who are fans of Frank Miller's style. He has done some of the greatest graphic novels of all time and I'm sure this one is a good read as well. I can also see where some people may not like this movie. The blood is crazier than the first movie and pretty much over the top. When Artemisia kisses a head already cut off of a man....(come on...Really?). Some of the dialogue can come off as cheesy if you haven't bought into the main character 'Themistocles'. I thought he was an okay character. Some redeeming qualities but we never get the true back story like we got with Leonidas. In fact, you can argue we learn more about the villains in this movie than we do about the actual heroes. Like I said, I didn't expect much from this movie so I was pleasantly surprised. The way the action sequences are shown to us is very impressive as usual, even without Zack Snyder at the helm. It is no where near as good as the first but it can be a good cable watch a few years down the line. No need to rush to the theaters unless you would like blood splashed all over your 3D glasses, which I'm sure enhances the experience(I saw it in 2D). 7.1/10",300 - Rise of an Empire
30,g-bodyl,"Not Bad, But.....",8,21 February 2015,"....300: Rise of the Empire does not quite live up to the first film. The film is brutal, bloody, and violent like the original 300, but it lacks the overall fine acting and story of the first film. That being said, this film was incredibly entertaining at times thanks to a memorable performance by Eva Green. The film, by far, has one of the most gruesome (and enjoyable) sex scenes in recent cinema history. This sequel is an action-packed spectacle that has a unique visual style and is mostly fun to watch despite its story or lack thereof. Noam Murro's film has a strange timeline as the film takes place before, during, and after the events of 300. The film is about how an Athenian general Themistocles tries to ally with Sparta in order to take down Artemisia and her Persian navy. As the acting goes, it's not terrible, but it lacks the chemistry of the first film and we can thank the departure of Gerard Butler as Leonidas. However, Sullivan Stapleton as our hero wasn't too shabby. Eva Green certainly turned in a delicious, eye-turning performance. To those who are fans of the original: Lena Headey does return as Queen Gorgo and Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes. Overall, 300: Rise of an Empire is a entertaining film that features strong visuals and lots of blood, which I enjoyed. The action scenes were executed quite well, but if anything hampered this movie, it is the narrative itself. The story needs some more work. The question we must ask ourselves is if this movie should have been made at all. Maybe not, but it was still a fun ride mostly. My Grade: B-",300 - Rise of an Empire

General Themistokles (Stapleton) is in charge of stopping the charge and his best hope is to get the Athenian army to help him, but the bad history between the two factions make the alliance difficult to set up. I have to start be saying that I wasn't a fan of the first one, really at all. I thought it looked neat and different but I am just not a fan of this type of genre. That said going into this one I wasn't that excited at all. Even with that expectation this was still a movie I just could not get into at all. The movie itself isn't sure what it wanted to be. It is at the same time a prequel, sequel and companion to the original. What I mean is the movie jumps around from taking place before King Leonidas' march to death, during the 300 fighting and after the death of the 300. While that may seem like a neat idea what the movie turned out to be is fight scene...remember this part from the first one.....fight scene....remember this part in the first one...fight scene....etc.... The style of the original was new a different and looked cool. This one relies too have on the slow down/speed up camera tricks that it becomes distracting and nauseating. The blood splatters are also too over the top that it almost becomes comical. Most sequels are made because they have something else to say or do with the characters, this has none of that. Even though it takes place before, during and after the 300 movie it almost felt like a boring paint-by- numbers remake more then anything. All this said though keep in mind I wasn't a fan of the original. Overall, if you liked the first one you will probably enjoy this one as well.

35,atlasmb,Rise of an Empire is adequate but uninspired,7,17 March 2014,"I went to see Rise of an Empire on an IMAX screen. I had no idea that this version was also 3-D. As I put on the glasses, I had misgivings, knowing that the 3-D effect tends to darken the images and the 300 style of photography is already rather dark. But I found that the action on screen was easy to see even in 3-D.If you saw the original 300 movie, then you pretty much know what to expect of this prequel/sequel--lots of swordplay accented by gore mixed with bombastic speeches. The primary difference between the two is that Rise of an Empire deals mainly with the sea battles of the Persian-Greek conflict.The other difference is that Rise gives us two female warriors--Eva Green and Lena Headey. Both fit nicely into the action and are strongly portrayed characters.The end leaves us with an obvious story line for the third installment. I hope they somehow recapture the magic of the first film by some innovative story lines.

36,ironhorse_iv,300: Rise of An Empire kinda seize their glory! It was alright film.,7,12 March 2014,"This is not Sparta, but close! Directed by Noam Murro, the film, 300: Rise of an Empire is about what the Athenians were doing during the events of the first movie through the eyes of Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton). The film was previously called ""Xerxes"", the title of the Frank Miller graphic novel on which the film is based, and later ""300: The Battle of Artemisia"", the title used during filming. Ultimately, the present title ""300: Rise of an Empire"" was used because the other two were deemed too exotic for American audiences. Calling 300: Rise of an Empire, a sequel to 300 could be a misinterpretation. Rise of an Empire's plot timeline occurs before, during and after the original movie's timeline. Plus, the film has little to do with the 300 Spartans physically, and more on what the 300 Spartans death represented. In the film, the 300 Spartans represented the rallying cry need for all the Greek city states to unite against the Persian threat. The movie makes it very clear to call back to the previous events of the previous film, 2006's 300 to the point that they kinda went overboard on it to the point, it felt like self-jerking or circle jerking. Director Murro makes his directorial film look like a carbon copy of that first film, rarely adding anything new besides the fact that the action now takes place in the oceans on ships. Athenians are now as buff six-pack & shirtless as Spartans which I find deeply unrealistic. The movie doesn't show anything of Athenians cultural besides they love democracy. None of the Athenians, including the main action Themistokles stand out. I can't remember any of the supporting characters that help Themistokles. Sullivan Stapleton is a poor man, Gerald Butler. He doesn't have the charisma, personality, and charm to him that can outshine Butler. He's pretty much living in the shadow of him, as the film tend to do, making King Leonidas's deeds great compare to his. If history serve me right, the Spartans were defeat at Thermopylae, while the Battle of Artemisium was standstill. Themistokles is so overlook as a master general here. He even fought in the Battle of Marathon. The film gives him no good dialogue to work with or story arch. Honestly, I know, little about the man besides his military career in the film. Another thing, why the Athenians don't stand out in the film is because the filmmakers kept on bringing back original characters from the first movie like Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), Dilios (David Wenham) and Ephialtes (Andrew Tiernan) to make up the star power lacking from the new cast. If anything, the movie makes the Persian seem more human than the first film. In my opinion, the best performance in the film is Eva Green as Artemisia. Not only is she really good at playing a menacing character. She had a story arch, but made us feel bad for her past, while also hating her for her present cruel actions. Yes, there were some over the top things she did that was pretty stupid, like kissing a headless prisoner, or having a short random sex scene with Themistokles that was a bit odd, but for the most part. I found her to be really interesting character that help the rise of Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). In fact I don't recall any female villain being this charismatic and badass, she literally stole the whole movie. Don't get me wrong, marketing as 300 is a good recognizable selling name, but the film has that same film style of over the top comic gorn (gore and porn) and slow motion mixed with fast motion action. So it kinda under looks what could had be a new film with new film concepts. In my opinion, some of the slow motion is really just bothersome to the eyes and got tired fast with its over-used. The movie made great use of the 3D by having blood, and sever limps fly at you, but it also kinda hard to see what's happening on screen, when most of the action scenes happen to be in stormy night weather. While the movie is not all historic accurate with all the error facts on what truly happen there, it still has that fantasy graphic novel concept of the past of the first film. I would do without all the Queen Gorgo's narration because the movie portrays the same situations in which she states out. Show don't tell. Plus, she didn't clearly didn't participate in any of those events, so some of the flashbacks in the film were pointless. I don't know why the film had to do a flashback of an earlier scene in the same film of Themistokles killing Xerxes's father when Artemisia heard of his name. The film was a bit too wordy for a film like this. Then there are the unrealistic action that quickly destroy any suspension of disbelief and ultimately ruin some of movie-going experience. The fake CGI really took me out as I found it funny how bloody it was, but the men fighting shirtless, rarely had a drop of blood on them. Another one is how a horse is able to run in fire, without burning up, jump into water, and jump out of it, onto another ship. God, if this film wasn't based on a comic, I would thought it was a bit cartoony. Still, the movie was watchable. The computer animation fake naval warfare was still pretty awesome. Plus, a lot of work went to the actor's body and fight scenes that I can't say, wasn't bad. Overall: For anyone looking for a sense of 300. It has it. For anybody looking for 2000's Gladiator type film, it's a Trojan horse.",300 - Rise of an Empire
37,The-Sarkologist,The historical inaccuracy drags this film down,4,12 March 2014,"I'm still not really sure of what to make of this movie. In a way I enjoyed it, but I guess being very familiar with the ancient story upon which this movie is based I simply have to use the word based in as lose a way as possible. Anyway, the film is not so much a sequel to 300, but rather it is based on events that were running concurrently with that movie. Where 300 dealt with the land battle at Thermopylae, this film deals with the sea battle, first at Euobea, and then at Salamis. Also where the hero in 300 is the Spartan general Leonidas, in this film the hero is the Athenian general Thermistocles.It seems that this is where the historical parallels seem to drift apart because the action in the film seemed to have as little to do with the historical events as possible. The reason that I say that is because the reason that the Persians lost Salamis was not because a heap of other Greek ships appeared at the last minute, but rather because the Persian ships could not manoeuvre in the narrow straights that was both Euboea and Salamis. Another thing was that the battle of Euboea was a draw, and not a Persian victory as the film suggested.What I did like about the film (and I still give it a low rating due to the lack of historical accuracy) were the fight scenes. They seemed to be choreographed really well, but my feeling was that that was pretty much the extent of the movie that I liked. While I was very impressed with the way 300 was done, it simply seems as if this film (and the comic upon which it was based, which is what I suspected was the case) was made to capitalise upon the popularity of the other. However, it would have been much better if they had stuck closer to history because in the end it would have made for a much better ending than simply having a bunch of Greek ships rock up and same the day.",300 - Rise of an Empire
38,jacobjohntaylor1,A sequel this is a lot better then the original,10,4 December 2015,6.3 is underrating this film. This a lot better then the original 300. The original 300 is crap. This had some new characters that I like. This movie had some very scary monster in it. The fist one had monster. But it did not have any good guys at all. This movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. It has a lot of action. A Greek general battles an evil empire for sake of democracy. Sullivan Stapleton is a great actor. The only reason people think the first one is better is because it was made first. I would like to think there is another reason. And I do not think people would want to admit that is the reason. See this movie. It is a great movie.,300 - Rise of an Empire
39,Reno-Rangan,This time it's the navy tested against the enemies.,8,27 June 2014,"This was most expected sequel by me. I loved the first installment for its awesome vfx. So I anticipated similar visual pack in this, especially in digital 3d version the expectation was a bit higher. Who's this director and how did he get this project, miraculously, he managed to handle this mega task with mostly the not so famous actors, probably except Eva Green. It's really a great achievement for a filmmaker like him like Peter Jackson did a decade ago for 'The Lord of the Rings'. It may change his future, hope he continues with the remarkable works further on.As I said I wanted a sequel to '300', but after seeing its ending I thought the title won't fit for the follow-up. It was cleverly written for 'Rise of an Empire'. In the first movie and this, the story had no much scope deliberately. Because the main intense was the stunts and visuals. In this part, OMG, it was one of the best digital 3Dised movie I ever saw. Some of the scenes, especially the sex scene was totally inappropriate. I never knew what was its purpose, maybe because to have a movie's one of the powerful dialogue that follow like this: You fight much harder than you f&%#.''There is only one thing to make sure of when the fighting starts. Don't get killed on the first day''The cast performances were good, in the end it was the graphics that ruled the movie. How amazingly created those scenes, sometimes it was mind blowing. I was just thinking what it would have done if the popular stars had in it. Might have been year's best, but I still consider it the upcoming Oscars strong contender in the visual effects category along with 'The Battle of the Five Armies'. If this won't get a place in the final list, that will be a greater insult for sure.This was not exactly a follow-up story, instead simultaneously happening one of the first. The story that happens other side of the country which meets in the middle and goes on with the originally intended. The vicious villain Xerxes played by a Brazilian actor had extended display of his role which briefs how he became the god-king. Without a second thought Eva Green is this movie's strength. Would have been an unimaginably worse without her, I guess. This movie is for graphic geeks like me and also who love comic strip mode movies. You should try it in digital 3D then the entertainment is guaranteed, but still would not be your favourite of the year if I am not wrong.7.5/10",300 - Rise of an Empire

The film is ultimately not as exciting or entertaining as its predecessor, but nevertheless still fascinating. Plot flaws galore, it doesn't quite made sense why Themistokles went to Artemisia's ship, as it seemed like a suicide mission, but the sex scene that subsequently followed was indeed one to behold!The film does become a bit repetitive and the slow motion overdone, but the eye candy more than compensates for this! Sullivan Stapleton makes a likable hero.",300 - Rise of an Empire
41,eddie_baggins,A lame homage to a much better original,4,6 March 2014,"While Zac Snyder's 2007 blood soaked, sun drenched, slomo ab fest 300 is in no way a narrative masterpiece there is little doubt about it's pure visceral entertainment value a fact highlighted by its huge box office booty and a legion of fans that to this day remember the splattering of Persian and Spartan blood fondly as when it first hit their senses like a swaying of a sharpened sword. With the subsequent release of this prequel/sequel many of these rabid fans were hoping for more of the same and while 300: Rise of an Empire does indeed provide much of the same in the stakes of blood, slomo abs and as much wheat grass 3-D effects as you can shake a loincloth at it just holds none of the abstract charm or wow factor that made it's much grander predecessor such a joy.The movie itself should be entitled 300: On a Boat with much of the action forfeiting the comfort of solid ground in favour of a procession of navy battles that really start to blur into one another and become nothing more than a bunch of battles that feel all to similar. The move to have the action take place on the high seas was clearly done to try and make the film seem more grand than it actually is and try to separate itself from what has come before but in saying this the film seems to take every opportunity to pay homage or remind us of what went on in 300 and all that does is remind the audience that they probably should of stayed home and watched the original instead. These naval battles do however have moments of visual beauty and individual scenes that give off the sense at some stage the film was on the right track but is consistently derailed thanks to a narrative that at no stage engages as 300 did in 2007. In his first Hollywood leading role Australian Sullivan Stapleton is given a sword, a cape and many grandstanding battle speeches but unfortunately he doesn't even come close to filling Gerard Butler's sandals. His role as the heroic Themistokles is so bland you almost wish the film was a silent movie with no dialogue resonating or getting that pre battle blood flowing in a way which improved vastly our time spent with Leonidas. Other actors are all merely sword and spear fodder with Eva Greens seriously tormented and twisted Artemisia making the biggest impression but to say her performance is anything more than a bit of fun would be a lie. It is a shame that relatively new director Noam Murro couldn't get more out of the human aspect as said before he does at times display a quality hand with certain visuals and moments of battle that make the film better than it perhaps even is. While 300 will continue to entertain and remain a very quality piece of throwaway visual entertainment Rise of an Empire will likely sink like a wrecked ship of war in a sea of other average follow ups. Possessing some nice visuals and spraying some pretty looking blood effects does not a good film make but we can be thankful of it reminding us that the original is a better film than many give it credit for. 2 boat horses out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",300 - Rise of an Empire
42,leonblackwood,Expected Better! 5/10,5,5 October 2014,"Review: This movie doesn't touch the first 300. I really missed the cockiness of Gerald Butler and his fellow Spartans and the banter between the characters. The director didn't give a deep insight into the characters so you don't really feel for the Greek army, when they are getting chopped into pieces. On the plus side, it does look fantastic and the blood and gore looked real, but the actors really let the film down. There are a couple of scenes which were a bit sketchy, like the horse running through flames and the exaggerated sex scene, but the the director really made use of the green screen. Personally I think that the film would have been a total let down if it wasn't for Eva Green, who played a brilliant baddie. Lena Headey also played her part well, like in the first 300, but all the the Greek army really let me down. Apart from that, the movie is full of butch action and abs, but after making so much money from the original, the director should have invested in some decent actors. Watchable!Round-Up: I liked the way that the director cleverly intertwined the last movie with this one and I'm glad that the whole look and attitude of Xerxes was explained in full, but he was hardly in the movie. It must have been extremely hard to create all of the water scenes so you can tell were most of the $110million went, but it still needed a couple of decent actors with some screen charisma. Judging by the money that the movie made, it's obvious that people loved the whole ""Sparta"" theme from the first movie but I didn't really get the same feeling from this movie. In all, my expectations were really high for this film and I do feel slightly let down with the outcome, but you can't fault it for the action scenes which were pretty impressive.Budget: $110million Worldwide Gross: $331millionI recommend this movie to people who were fans of the first 300 and are into there barbaric movies about the Greek fighting for freedom. 5/10",300 - Rise of an Empire

45,southdavid,Naval Gazing.,4,19 October 2020,"Having discovered a couple of weeks back, that the original ""300"" has lost most of it's appeal to me over the years, I wasn't super excited about revisiting its sequel - a film I didn't really enjoy when I saw it at the cinema. It's not gotten any better with perspective, and to say it cost around double the original, still manages to feel like a cheap knock off.Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) an Athenian General, attempts to unify Greece's various city states to meet the threat of a Persian invasion, led by Xerxes's (Rodrigo Santoro) most feared commander, Artemisla (Eva Green). With news of Leonidas, and his brave 300 Spartans making a stand against the land army, Themistokles uses all his cunning to battle an overwhelmingly large naval force and still rally support from across the country.The most interesting aspect of ""Rise of an Empire"" is that it serves as sequel, prequel and runs concurrently with the events of the original ""300"". Unfortunately, that's the only really interesting aspect. Sullivan Stapleton, whilst not awful, doesn't have Gerard Butler's charisma and though he has many more speeches, none of them are that interesting. His supporting soldiers too, come across like a budget version of the originals. Michael Fassbender replaced by Hans Matheson, Callan Mulvey or Jack O' Connell. It's not this films fault, and again, none of them are bad - but also true none of them have, so far, gone on to have a career like Fassbenders. Whilst there's a lot of praise for Green, and she is definitely the most dynamic and interesting part of the film - it's not like we haven't seen her play similar characters before.What kills the film though is that the battles, whilst just as tiringly relentless as in ""300"", don't have the variety or spectacular elements as its prequel did. Just lashings of dodgy CGI blood and ships crashing into each other.$100 Million somehow spent to make something that looks and feels like a low budget imitation.",300 - Rise of an Empire
46,Vartiainen,"Somewhat decent sequel, but lacks passion",4,10 August 2014,"Let's face it, the movie 300 was stupid. It was nothing more than one slow motion battle scene after another, where well-oiled hunks thrust spears into each other's guts and yelled all their lines through their teeth. Nothing more. And it kicked ass! Mainly because it was so self-aware of its own stupidity and silliness. You knew that, watching the film, but it also took itself mock seriously, treating the whole spectacle with style over anything else. It was a passionate film and it had enough energy to pull you into its insanity.And that's where its sequel, 300: Rise of an Empire, falters. It definitely tries to capture the feeling, machismo and passion of the original, but the novelty and the magic are gone, and it just merely looks silly trying. It's still a great deal of fun, if you're able to turn off your brain and just enjoy the gore, sweat, oil and blood, but it's not guaranteed you're able to do that.Furthermore, the actors are not as well suited for their roles. Gerard Butler brought a lot of presence into the original, and while Sullivan Stapleton's Themistocles is refreshingly different as a person and as a war leader, he's not able to carry the whole film on his shoulders. People have also praised Eva Green's Artemisia, but I honestly thought she was one of the worst offenders. She came across more pouty than menacing to me and I had hard time taking her seriously.If you liked 300 and are looking for more, this is not a bad film to pick up. It's not as great as the original, but it is decent enough and visually it's still very impressive and stylish. Kick back your feet, pop open a bottle and relax. You'll get your money's worth.",300 - Rise of an Empire

She was such an enjoyable bad ass character. She makes the good guy characters seem so bland.I thought this film was gonna take place after the events of the first 300(2007), but it really takes place in between the first one, the fight scenes are top notch like the first one, the effects are pretty incredible also. But the characters are pretty bland, I mean Gerard Butler had more life in the first one. Lena Hedley does do alright in her scenes.

48,freemantle_uk,All hail Artemisia!,7,17 March 2014,"Back in 2007 300 was a surprise hit, striking a cord with young men the world over, being known for one-liners, action and violence and help many of the people involved had a career boost, including director Zack Snyder. Now after seven years and the release date being postponed by seven months the sequel/prequel/side-story focusing on the Battle of Salamis.During the events of the original film and the Battle of Thermopylae, the Athenians, lead by Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) also plans to prepare for war, tackling the Persian navy south. Themistocles is a believer of Democracy and a united Greece and showed himself to be a tactical genius, killing King Darius during the Battle of Marathon.In Persia, Darius' naval commander Artemisia (Eva Green) manipulates his son and heir, Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) into becoming a God King and when he was away purged the palace of all his advisers and gets him to invade Greece. Artemisia is a ruthless, sadistic woman who wants revenge against the Greeks for killing her family and leaving her for dead. On the high seas both Themistocles and Artemisia equally match each other as Themistocles and Leonidas hold the line so Greece can unite.Commercial director Noam Murro took over the directing duties since Snyder has moved on to the DC Cinematic Universe. Murro does a solid job trying to replicate Snyder's style and visual approach, whilst shooting on a more darker colour pallet. The action was fluid for the most part and 300: Rise of an Empire will satisfy a blood lust as plenty of CGI blood spatters on the screen. This film is extremely gory, maybe a little too gory: yet the action is still enjoyable. Murro tries to copy Snyder's use of slow-motion, but he uses it so much that even Snyder would have been embarrassed.Eva Green was truly the highlight of the cast as she oozed charisma and sex appeal. She made a great female villain, being sexy and psychotic in equal measure as she acts out her revenge and showed she was perfectly capable at using a sword. Green was not only able to commanded a navy but also had a commanding presence on the screen. She would be perfect to play Boudica if Hollywood ever make a film about her.Stapleton was solid enough in the lead role, but he did not have the gusto that Gerald Butler brought to the Leonidas role and he did not have as good of speeches to work with. The supporting cast was not as memorial as the first film and the general sub-plots were heavily reliant on the story of the first film.One of the strongest aspects of 300: Rise of an Empire is the battle of wits between Themistocles and Artemisia: both are tactically astute and technically the Persian are much more of a threat and not just in physical number but also technical prowess. This was more than the battle of brute force that the Battle of Thermopylae was in the first film. 300: Rise of an Empire also expands the universe of 300, seeing more Greek states and showing some of Persia, giving the universe a bigger scope. Plus the music score was perfectly bombastic and entertaining.300: RIse of an Empire is a entertaining and fast paced continuation of the 300 series. It's not as fresh as the original film but serves as an expansion of the series and a more interesting approach at a sequel because it is a side-story. It is a fun violent romp.",300 - Rise of an Empire
49,stevendbeard,Great Prequel/Sequel,8,7 March 2014,"I saw ""300: Rise of an Empire"", starring Sullivan Stapleton-Strike Back_t.v., Gangster Squad; Eva Green-Dark Shadows_2012, Casino Royale_2006; Rodrigo Santoro-What to Expect When You're Expecting, Lost_t.v. and Lena Headey-The Purge, The Brothers Grimm.When I first heard about this movie, I was wondering if it was going to be a sequel or a prequel. Well, it's actually both. It starts by showing how Rodrigo-the 10 foot tall giant bad guy from the first movie-became who he became, the Persian god king-he started out as a normal sized man. It shows Rodrigo marching on Greece after his epic battle with the Spartan 300-and there are a few scenes with Gerard from the original movie spliced in but there is no new footage. Sullivan plays the leader of a Greek naval fleet that tries to unite Greece against the invading Persian forces and Eva is Rodrigo's commander of the military-she knows how to hold her own in a fight and she can defeat almost any man. Lena has a small role-as the widow of Gerard from the first movie-but she does get to participate in the sword fighting as well. Most-but not all- of the battles are on ships at sea and they are all bloody. I think this movie is even more violent and bloody than the original. During fights, you will see arms, legs and even heads removed from their owners, with gallons of spraying blood and it looks pretty realistic. There is also nudity. There is one sex scene that is almost like a battle-ripping clothes, hitting, slinging each other across the room-and later, the girl tells the guy that he fights better than he makes love-she did not use those words, but you catch the drift. I heard the song, War Pigs by Black Sabbath when the end credits started and they left it wide open for another sequel. I saw it in IMAX 3D and it looked great. It's rated ""R"" for bloody violence, language and sexual content- including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 42 minutes. I enjoyed this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",300 - Rise of an Empire

This talks about the other aspects of the Persian Invasion of Greece, the ones that involved less-buff, less interesting Greeks who weren't Spartans. You know, the Athenians who were all into the Democracy and stuff.There are some cameos by some of the characters from the original movie, but they are mostly phoning it in.I think the worst part of the movie was the way Artemisia was portrayed. Considering that she was an important female commander when women doing that sort of thing was unheard of,and what do the producers do? That's right. Write her as someone who pretty much thinks with her libido. ""I'll use Angry Sex to convince you to come to my side!"" No,really? They went there? ANd it was kind of predictable. When she invited him over to her ship, the only suspense I had was how graphic the sex would be. (Spoiler Alert- Not very.) The battle scenes, almost all rendered on someone's computer, are boring, because you don't care about the characters or their motivations. The whole movie is clearly aware that it's not as good as the one it is following.",300 - Rise of an Empire
51,alindsay-al,a great follow-up from a fantastic film,8,19 January 2015,"I am a big fan of the first 300 film and now I have seen the second film and even though it is not as good as the first film it is still great. The story is a prequel, midquel and a sequel to the first 300 film documenting the story of the Athenians led by General themistokles against the Persian army of xerxes led by artemisia. Now Gerard butler was great in the first film and the guy who plays themistokles does a really good job in the role. He is a great warrior, a good leader and he is more relatable to the audience. The supporting cast is okay with Eva green delivering the best performance in the film. She plays one of the most evil women in film in recent memory and her character is great and truly encapsulates the femme fatale. Lena headey reprises her role as the queen of Sparta and she does a good job but her role is pretty small in the film. The rest of the Athenians are just not that interesting and you will truly not care about any of them. The structure of the story is interesting and it truly fits into the idea of the first film, that one act of bravery against the Persians will lead into a United Greece against xerxes. The script isn't that great to be honest, Eva green has great dialogue and every line she delivers is chilling. But the Athenians just have wooden dialogue and feel like cheap ripoffs of the Spartans. The style of the 300 films is really unique and the cgi really works with the gore. The action is great and the violence really works for this film and I wouldn't have it any different way. Overall this film is great and definitely worth seeing.",300 - Rise of an Empire
52,estebangonzalez10,"A lesser story, but a more memorable villain",6,6 June 2014,"""Better we show them, we chose to die on our feet, rather than live on our knees!""I was a huge fan of Zach Snyder's 300 when it was first released, but was later disappointed by Sucker Punch as well as other recent adaptations, so I wasn't expecting much from this sequel considering the novelty of these violent graphic novel adaptations had warn off a bit. Sin City still ranks as my favorite, but I did really enjoy 300 and Watchmen as well. In 300: Rise of an Empire there are some great scenes and strong visuals, but nothing we haven't seen before. The violence is once again stylized but after a while it feels repetitive and I felt the pacing began to drag despite all the action scenes. The characters weren't as interesting as the Spartans in 300, but the villain is much better here. Eva Green's performance is was ultimately makes this film worth a watch and I think this is one of her best roles yet. She is perhaps the best developed character in this film and gives an inspiring performance which allows us to forgive the sense of empty stylized violent action scenes we are overloaded with in this sequel/prequel. The writing also could have used some of those memorable dialogues from the first film that many of us still haven't grown tired of quoting. This film doesn't live up to the original, but it is entertaining enough to give it a mild recommendation. In 300: Rise of an Empire we get an extension of the events that occurred in the original film which focused only on one of the Greek states: Sparta. This time we get a glimpse of what is going on with the other states and the film opens with a narration from Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) of the Battle of Marathon when the Persians invaded Greece for the first time. The Athenian general Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) manages to defeat the Persian king, Darius, by killing him from a distance with an arrow. Before he dies, he warns his son Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) that no human should ever attack Greece again. Darius's commanding naval officer, Artemisia (Eva Green), tells Xerxes that what his father really meant was that in order to defeat Greece he would need to become a god king. And that is how the legend of Xerxes actually begins. Ten years later Xerxes attacks Sparta (the events that took place in the first film), while Artemisia prepares her fleet to face the Athenians. The two brilliant naval officers, Artemisia and Themistocles, prepare their men for the bloody battle.Sullivan Stapleton is no Gerard Butler, but thankfully the film relies heavily on the villain and Eva Green excels in her role. There is one strange scene she shares with Stapleton that sort of comes out of nowhere and felt out of place. The film does drag by abusing too much on the stylized violence, but the production design does make the film interesting and fun to look at. Director, Noam Murro (who also directed the 2008 drama Smart People), didn't seem to have a firm hand in the direction and some of the scenes didn't feel right either. It still manages to be entertaining and fun for the most part, but one can't help and wonder about how empty it really is and how little we know about the actual characters. It doesn't matter though because we get cool enough visuals and slow motion action scenes to make it enjoyable enough. It is yet another example of style over substance, but if these graphic violent action scenes are your thing you might enjoy it.",300 - Rise of an Empire
53,Fluke_Skywalker,'Rises' to the occasion,7,8 March 2014,"I've been a vocal critic of the growing trend of hyper-stylized action and over-reliance on CGI in Hollywood films the last decade. So it may come as a bit of a surprise that I'm whole-heartedly recommending a film that is nothing but hyper-stylized action and CGI. I think the difference here is that the '300' films never try to integrate those things into a real world setting. These films are more like comic books in motion.In many ways, 'Rise of an Empire' surpasses the original '300' both technically and dramatically. Where it doesn't quite measure up is with its male lead, where the more than solid Sullivan Stapleton can't hope to match the tour de force charisma of Gerard Butler. But that's okay, because there's Eva Green. Sexy, vicious, scene stealing Eva Green. This may be a male dominated film, but it's Ms. Green who steals the show.If you liked '300', chances are you'll like 'Rise of an Empire'.

55,3xHCCH,Eva Green Saves This One!,7,6 March 2014,"The film ""300"" was a big hit when it hit the screens back in 2006. The film was directed by Zack Snyder, while Miller served as executive producer and consultant. In order to approximate the artwork of the graphic novel, the film used a special super-imposition chroma key technique. This anticipated sequel makes use of the same things that made the first film a hit to try to make this second film as big a success.Athenian general Themistocles shot an arrow in the battle of Marathon that angered the people of Persia. The Persian navy was led by a Greek woman named Artemisia, under the name of their man-god Emperor Xerxes. The two and their armadas clash in the Aegean Sea in multiple bloody and explosive battles for supremacy. One fights for pure love of country, while the other fights for sheer vengeance.Instead of the imposing Gerald Butler, we get a lesser actor, Sullivan Stapleton, as the central character Themistocles in this sequel. I thought he lacked charisma and conviction in his acting as the protagonist. There is that something lost or weak in his face that makes him less believable as the big hero. His lackluster screen presence and tentative performance almost ruined the film for me.Fortunately, I was very much impressed with the performance of the antagonist. Thanks to Eva Green, who delivers a sexy and bad-ass turn as Artemisia, I was not totally disappointed with the film. At first I thought it was only a big gimmick to have a female as the naval commander of Persia. However, as it turns out, Ms. Green would completely own this film. If not for her, I believe this film would tank big time. Rodrigo Santoro was again impressive as Persian King Xerxes, reprising his role from the first film. We see him evolve from a mere man to a man-god in an elaborate sequence of CG glory. Lena Headey also reprises her role as Queen Gorgo of Sparta. She was the one who tells this story, but will also get in on the military action later. David Wenham was the survivor Delios who narrated the first film, but in this sequel, his appearance was merely a cameo at best.The movie builds up on the first ""300"" film with a lot more Greeks (and their fabled abs) versus a lot more Persians. The first ""300"" was about the Battle of Thermopylae. This sequel is about the big naval Battle of Artemisia which happens at about the same time as the first battle, that is why there we can see this story weave in some events from the first film as well. The CG action here is a lot more cartoonishly gory, with blood splattering in all directions in generous amounts. This is like ""300"" all over again, but without the benefit of novelty, without the powerful presence of Gerald Butler, and without the directorial skills of Zack Snyder. This sequel by new director Noam Murro is certainly not better than the first film. So if you liked ""300"" as I did, you may still like this as well. If you didn't, then this film won't convert you. 7/10.",300 - Rise of an Empire
56,alansabljakovic-39044,First one was so much better,5,26 February 2019,"This could have been an extended version of 300 and not the whole movie. Cgi was pretty bad and Eva Green is only good as model. Yeah, se got part of history but it wasn't well told. It is below average for me.",300 - Rise of an Empire
57,TdSmth5,A weak sequel,6,13 July 2014,"10 years before the events of 300, Greek naval commander Themistocles injured the Persian ruler Darius. The Persian forces attacking Greece retreat. By Darius' side are his weak son Xerxes and an adopted warrior girl Artemisia. When Darius dies, Artemisia sends Xerxes out to the desert to become a man. He returns a god ready to form the greatest empire the world has ever seen and to take over Greece. We learn that Artemisia is Greek and as a girl lived a life of rape and abuse at the hands of Greeks until she was left for dead on a street and was adopted by a Persian and taught to fight. She rose in the ranks of the Persians until she became Darius' naval commander and dreamt of nothing but vengeance against the Greeks.Back in the days of 300, while Leonidas is fighting Xerxes, Themistocles ships are battling Artemisia's overwhelming naval force. But he does well forcing them twice to retreat and lick their wounds, and that without the aide of the Spartans. When Xerxes beats Leonidas and marches toward Athens, Themistocles again implores the Greeks to unite, including Queen Gorgo to offer her entire fleet. She rejects. So now, with Athens in ruins, Themistocles launches a last stand and confronts Artemisia.As far as sequels go, 300 II is your typical sequel--less compelling story, weaker cast, but yet it somehow cost considerably more than the first. Someone might want to audit these people and find out where all the money went. It retains the visuals of 300 but adds more color thankfully. It's also less cartoonish and adolescent. The voice-overs covering history are very interesting. But the rest of the script, the lines read by the actors, are fairly lame. For some reason we're stuck at sea for most of the movie and get not 1 or 2, but 3 sea battle, which is just tiring, complete with gallons of CGI blood being squirted in every which way.Unfortunately, Xerxes is a tertiary character here and Eva Green can't carry a movie, she does not make a good lead or a good lead villain. A terrible casting mistake. And she looks downright ghastly for most of the movie. When will the Hollywood dieting mania come to an end? Stapleton who is a likable guy (Strike Back has got to be among the best shows in television history) but he's also not ready to take on a lead role. But the weakest link is clearly the director, whoever he may be. I'm glad that Hollywood is becoming again the land of opportunity. But as America at large it's become a land of opportunity for foreigners and the locals are banished from partaking in success. And Hollywood sure is looking in every corner of the world for ""directors"" with near zero experience and handing them the director's chair of billion dollar franchises. Anyone who has free time will do as long as he's not American. Well, that's how you end up with a movie like 300 II.",300 - Rise of an Empire
58,peterp-450-298716,"An unnecessary sequel,prequel or whatever-quel !",5,18 June 2014,"""300"" which appeared in 2007 was a groundbreaking revelation. Not so much in terms of content, but in terms of the visualization of the heroic battles that 300 Greeks fought, in the battle of Thermopylae led by King Leonidas.The slow motion chopping spectacle with blood splattering all over the place,is still burned into my memory.A breathtaking movie.This movie isn't a prequel or sequel. It's an epic drama that encompasses the story of ""300"".Does it add value? Can it outpace ""300"" in terms of violence and bloodshed? Does the heroism increase in this film to a higher level? Are all your nerves strained to the limit when viewing this Greek tragedy? Bwah,not really. To be honest I was quite disappointed, annoyed and disinterested after a certain time.An easy duplicate of the original film in which the artifices and tricks are recycled. I'm convinced that the chair of history fanatics and historians will have some wet spots after seeing this movie.My chair was as dry as an old souvlaki.However it begins in a strong way with the surprise attack of the Greeks at the Battle of Marathon. A treat on upcoming Greek violence with bare torsos so you can admire swollen muscles and six-packs.Fierce brandishing sharp swords which causes gaping wounds in slow motion and limbs being amputated. Spears pierce chests and skulls are split. And this together with gushes of blood. But haven't we seen this kind of images already in ""300""? Yep ! So it can't outpace the original movie in terms of violence and bloodshed. In fact,you could feel the adrenaline increasing during the fight scenes in ""300"".The testosterone level was several dashes higher.It's in this battle at Marathon that commander Themistocles kills the Persian king Darius with a phenomenal well aimed shot. The son of Darius, Xerxes, gets after the death of his father the advice not to start a war against the Greeks, since only the gods can defeat them.Naval Commander Artemisia, sees a challenge in these words and sends Xerxes into the desert to return as a god after he has dipped in gold luminous water in some cave. That was the part with a bit of Greek mythology. Xerxes looked more like a member of the ""Village People"" afterwards and ended up playing only a secondary role.The lion's share of attention was claimed by Artemisia.Xerxes largest share was declaring war with the Greeks afterwards.Meanwhile Themistocles can convince the board of Athene to give him a fleet so that he can stop the Persians.He asks the arch-rival Sparta to assist him in this mission, but they refuse.After this, the battle focuses on the battle in the streets of Artemisium.The Battle of Thermopylae is of less importance in this film and is only shown with a few clips from the first movie. Ultimately,the focus in this film is on the cruel actions of Artemisia and the attempt of Themistocles to form an united Greece and thus to go to battle against the Persians.Sullivan Stapleton is not such an impressive figure as King Leonidas played by Gerard Butler.During the battle it's a formidable opponent and next to that he shows his talent as a charismatic orator.Butler was a fearsome leader who shouted his men into battle with snappy one-liners.Artemisia on the other hand is an intriguing character which was played in a proper manner by Eva Green.A spirited cruel captain who originally was Greek,but during her childhood witnessed the atrocities that were committed against her family by the Greeks themselves.She was taken as a slave, and left for dead.Then she was adopted by the Persians and teaching martial arts.She makes good use of this and shows no mercy.She hates the Greeks and the only thing important in her life is to kill as many as possible.The moment she beheads a Greek prisoner and gives it an intimate kiss,after which she throws it in the sea,is pretty impressive.In contrast, the amorous and erotic affair she has afterwards with Themistocles, which she uses to get him on the side of the Persians,was laughable and hilarious.It was more like a wrestling match.Just like the original movie ""300"",this one is a spectacle and you will be treated with some violent and bloody film clips.In ""300"" the fighting took place in a narrow pass.In this movie most battles take place at sea with a huge drifting fleet of the Persians,and a tiny flea from the Greeks. The Greece's fleet looked more like a squadron of floating cigar boxes. The battle scenes are again impressive and flashy.A forward-moving human killing machine that destroys every intersecting opponent. Gallons of blood flows again.The choreography is beautifully worked out during the fighting and slow-motion pictures match the original film.And that's precisely where the sticking point is.It's a film with entertainment from the top shelf, but it's actually an ordinary remake of the first film. But with the emphasis on the immense battle at sea. For me, no gain. There was only one thing that started to bother me after a while. There isn't a single scene in this whole movie, or something is floating around : sparks emanating from burning fires, dust particles that fly between sweaty bodies, small particles of shaft whirl through the image, also something like fireflies and drops of blood. At one point I was paying more attention to this than the actual movie. The battle with an awful lot of boats floating around wasn't very convincing. And it was also clear to see that they were computer images. And certainly when the horse came up. That really looked bad. And after a while I got sick and tired of the computerized streams of blood.All in all a pretty intense movie in which Eva Green sparkled and the screen turns red again. Still, I thought it was a mediocre sequel to a peerless original film.An unnecessary sequel in other words.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",300 - Rise of an Empire
59,Seraphion,"Lives Up To The ""300"" Word On Its Title",7,11 March 2014,"It's inevitable that when we watch this movie, or any other sequels, prequels, or remakes, we would track back to the original movie and more or less compare it to the current movie. Well, about eight years since the original Zack Snyder's ""300"" in 2006, now there is a movie to continue on the legacy of the movie, other than just the meme battle cry ""THIS IS SPARTAAA!!! In its marketing campaign, ""300: Rise of An Empire"" is said to be a prequel to the original ""300"". Yet in reality, the story encompass a prequel, a parallel story, and a sequel altogether. In the original ""300"", the story centers only on King Leonidas and his troops of 300 soldiers defending the Hot Gates from the Persian onslaught. Yet in this movie, we are presented the prequel part of how Emperor Xerxes originated into his state in ""300"", and also the parallel story when the lead character is preparing his troops while Leonidas' 300 were holding the line, and the longest part of the rest of the movie is the sequel part, from the demise of the Spartan 300 to the last battle.The story focus on Themistocles, an Athenian who actually killed Xerxes' father and gave him the drive to become the Xerxes in ""300"". While the Spartans hold their line at Thermopylae, Themistocles prepares his troops to be ready to counter the incoming onslaught. When Leonidas and his men finally fell, Themistocles' home state of Athens was laid to waste by the Persians. Yet he, as Leonidas did by stalling the invasion in the Hot Gates, managed to stall the Persian naval force to just in time when the united force of the whole Greece arrive to fend of against the invasion.The movie's descriptive characteristics still retain the look of the original Frank Miller's graphic novel of bare-chested male protagonists. The cinematography is also still trying to retain the original ""crush style"" of the original ""300"". Yet while in ""300"" the crush style did well in making the movie feels bloody by making the rest of the background coloring to be blackish and reddish, here the use of blue cape, to symbolize Themistocles as not of Spartan origin but an Athenian, demands a bit of adaptation. While in ""300"" we see the dark and grey coloration happen seldom, here it repeats more often.The dialogue is also affected greatly. It features less battle cries and rousing speeches and catchphrases. This means that there will no repetition of a line of dialogue of this movie getting into a meme like the original ""300"" did.The fight scenes is somewhat of mixed quality compared to the original ""300"". The camera angles are superbly great, especially on the ongoing, less cut fight scenes. The choreography is also great, showing the viewers great moves in doing counter kills, not just plainly hack and slash as in in the original movie. Yet in this movie, the fight scenes look more of a single soldier fighting an entire wave of army while his fellow troops are minding their own enemies, no cooperation in doing the kills, as we see in the original ""300"". This maybe is to focus more on the difference between the Spartan formation and the Athenian forces.But overall, the movie is great, and even with a different director, it can still live up to the ""300"" element in its title. For me, ""300: Rise of An Empire"" deserves a 7 out of 10 score a a ""go see this movie"" recommendation. It sure is worth your while.",300 - Rise of an Empire
60,RatedVforVinny,300: The rise and crumble.,5,27 November 2019,"Such a poor, damp squib of sequel, to the groundbreaking '300'. it looks the same but quickly becomes a pallid imitation (of the original). The female adversary is pretty lame and totally unconvincing in her battle action. Also you know halfway through she is going to be involved in a heavy sex scene (but not really complaining); although the first episode did not rely on such cheap thrills or assembly line script writing.

62,p-stepien,Crossing the line,2,12 June 2014,"A follow up to the spectacularly overblown pathos of ""300"", Zack Snyder and crew brings back the ""THIS IS...!!!"" with blood-spurting slow-mos extravaganza. This time with horses marauding from ship to ship, humans jumping 30 feet like they were half-grasshoppers, an overdose of testosterone that would make Charlize Theron grow a beard and countless dramatic declamations that seem to never end. In between the splattering and burly half-naked men running area in glee as arms, legs and heads fly, we are treated to an endless mix of the grandiloquent tirades, woodenly delivered by varying characters. Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) takes several shots at exalted speeches, struggling not to topple off of the many elevated podiums, thankfully however his loyal soldiers turn a deaf ear and all same cheer on their literately challenged leader. For whatever he lacks in enunciation and screen presence, he makes up for with a six pack, making love with the opposing female general (Artemisia played by Eva Green), lots of shouting and being the world record holder of spear-throwing (at some 300 feet).Other characters also take on the gauntlet and challenge Stapleton at overplaying their roles, as Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), widow-queen of Sparta amps it up with her own dose of pomposity, Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) goes medieval as a pinless Pinhead impersonator, Artemisia makes a prolonged death wish by wearing the audiences patience thin, while a couple of other characters challenge for screen time, but fail to resonate. The best actors in this movie are inherently those from Zack Snyder-directed ""300"", especially Peter Mensah, known best for being kicked down a well or David Wenham as the one-eyed Dilios. That said the stand-out actor in the sequel is Gered Butler as King Leonidas, who features in this sequel as scene excerpts are borrowed from the original. And it says a lot when the best acted scenes come from another movie...""Rise of an Empire"" coincides with the actions of ""300"", first running parallel, then followed by the decisive sea battle under Salamis, where the sea forces of Xerxes were wiped out in a concerted effort of Greek polis. Naturally, director Noam Murro decides to amp up the action as well as make the war as comical as possible. Inasmuch as Xerxes actually did have superior forces, the difference in soldiers and ships has Persian forces multiplied, while Greek forces divided. Add on the appallingly distasteful tirades about 'fighting for the freedom of the world' and forming Xerxes and the Persian empire into some devilish evil, and you receive a derisive portrayal of events past, which feel ill-suited not only to historical facts, but also common decency. Overall, much like in the original, this very lax attitude towards truth can be forgotten, even forgiven, given the overblown grandiose concept of storytelling. However, ""Rise of an Empire"" lacks the same powerful cast, especially given the forgettable Stapleton who is dwarfed by Butler's powerful portrayal, the storytelling swagger as well as the dramatic build-up, which makes the whole ludicrosity of ""300"" work. Instead, the sequel feels like a poor expansion on Snyder's work, based on a simplistic scheme of introduction, battle, short character focus, grandiose speech, battle, short character focus, grandiose speech (or two for good measure), battle, short character focus, grandiose tirades, ultimate battle (may have missed one or two speeches or battles in between).As much as graphically this is a riveting eye-catching spectacle, much like the original, it is a ultimately a tiring bore. Technically a joy to behold, but after the first few visual spectacles the form starts to wear thin and the lack of gravity or purposeful storytelling sinks in, exposing it for what it is: a truly appalling TV-grade movie.",300 - Rise of an Empire
63,Rob_Taylor,Less than 300 Reasons why you should avoid this movie.,4,1 April 2014,"1. It's so clearly a cash-in movie. Everything just screams ""People will come see it hoping its 300!"" It isn't. It's not even close to being that good.2. Awful CGI blood effects. It's everywhere and simultaneously nowhere. By that, I mean every sword slash generates volumes of it but it never actually splashes on anyone. The Greeks all look like they've just stepped out of the shower even after fighting for ten minutes. The blood doesn't stick because it isn't there! Not only does it not stick, but it just looks cartoonish and ridiculous with every gout. In one scene, Artemisia beheads a man, sending fake blood spraying everywhere. Not only does it not stick, but no one thought to direct the actors to duck or flinch from it. Additionally, looking at this scene again, the blood is always in the foreground, no matter where the actors are placed, even though it supposedly sprays out from the background. That's just shoddy work right there and something I'd expect of a SyFy channel ""original"" or an Asylum movie, not a big-budget film.3. Zack Snyder's crappy writing. Seriously, this man can make some good films, but only if someone takes the pen out of his hand. He can't write female characters, for instance, to save his life. Eva Green's character, for instance... We're told she witnessed her family being raped and murdered by Greeks as a child, and was then sold into sexual slavery herself. So what is the logical thing for such a character to do when she meets the Greek commander for the first time? He is her enemy, and a Greek to boot? Yes folks, that's right, she screws him! Not only is the characterisation woeful, but the scene is just laughably awful. It's clearly a ""How can we shoehorn a sex scene into this movie?"" moment.4. Speeches. So many speeches. I thought I was going to watch an action movie, not attend a political rally! Lena Headey has a speech that is repeated three times during the film and Leonidas-wannabee Themistocles makes at least two.5. Dumb-ass action nonsense. I get it. The Greeks are supposed to be uber-warriors. However, does that really mean they can leap off a cliff, thirty or forty feet down onto the deck of a ship and not only land without injury, but time it well enough to kill someone at the same time? Bullshit! Likewise, no amount of CGI and movie adrenaline will ever convince me that, no matter how good you are, or how well trained the animal, you can ride a horse through a burning ship. More bullshit!6. Slow motion. Oh God! If you excised all the slow motion sequences the movie probably would run a good thirty minutes shorter, which would be a blessing! Remember when bad movies were padded out with crappy dialogue and stock footage? Well, now it's slow motion sequences. There are soooo many.... If someone could get a copy and speed up all the slow motion bits to normal speed, I bet the action would actually be more impressive. But hey! Slow motion because... you might miss how bad the blood CGI is otherwise, I guess.7. Inexplicably out of place songs. Yes folks, as the credits start rolling on this semi-historical epic, War Pigs by Black Sabbath starts playing. I mean...WTF? Jesus, Zack! I know you want to make all your films into a pop video but this was just utterly dumb.8. Xerxes. You remember him. The all-powerful God-King of the Persians from 300? Guess what? His character is almost entirely emasculated by Eva Green's Artemisia character. From God-King to puppet-king in one fell swoop. Not that he's in the film much at all anyway but he comes across as a petulant child here.9. Dullness. Yes, even in an action movie featuring some admittedly good fight scenes (that's really all there is to this film), it is still tedious and dull. It's not a long film by any means, but it will feel much longer than it is. It's dull because you've seen it all before, and done better, in 300.10. My final reason... Don't watch this if you loved the first movie. Watching this film is like having a small child with a limited grasp of vocabulary describe 300 to you after hearing its parents talking about it.As you can imagine, I wasn't impressed with the movie. A cynical attempt to make money out of the goodwill the first film generated. This has to rate as one of the weakest sequels I've seen for a long time. It's just a nothing film, really. You don't care about any of the characters, or the events, within it. The blood effects are just terribly bad and the action has a number of utterly ridiculous moments in it.The only positive thing I can really say about it is that some of the fight sequences were well done. However, taken as a whole, watching it is just an exercise in endurance worthy of the Spartans themselves.SUMMARY: Awful cash in. Bad CGI. Bad character writing. Doesn't grab you at all. You'll be glad when it's over!",300 - Rise of an Empire
64,Matt_Layden,Simply doesn't need to exist.,6,7 August 2014,"What did we gain from this film? Any advancement in the story? Advancement in the war? Revenge from the initial 300 who died? The answer is unfortunately no for everything. 300: Rise of an Empire is a cash grab sequel, with less style than the original and more cartoon violence. I can only recommend this film if you are a huge fan of the original and want more of the same. This battle, which happens at the same time as Leonidas is commanding his 300, is fought on ships. The battle on the ships try to be creative, but seem to fail on that aspect and push into the absurd territory. The artificialness of it all only takes away from the excitement. The original film felt fresh and exciting. Zack Snyder behind the camera gave us some creative visual violence. This entry tries to imitate that and it doesn't match up. The blood, the kills, the set pieces, feel fake this time around. Snyder had a cast and stakes which made the film feel a bit more real, despite the stylized violence and green-screen. Rise of an Empire has non of this, save for a deliciously evil Eva Green as a vengeful psychotic warrior. The film even feels like a remake. It hits the same notes at the same moments. It literally ends on the same note. Why not try and advance the story further? Aside from some insight into the past of Xerxes and a sad story attached to Eva Green's character, we are given nothing to hold onto. The film is more interested in the blood and guts it splashes on the screen than anything else. It feels like a video game where the player keeps playing the same level over and over again. So unless you love the original, Rise of an Empire is easily avoidable. Even if you do see it, you'll most likely forget about it a day or two later. Save for one memorable scene involving Eva Green and her beautiful assets. There aren't many films these days with sex scenes that actual show the act. Sex scenes have been toned down recent years, close ups where we see nothing, cut aways before the act. Rise of an Empire isn't afraid to go a little adult.",300 - Rise of an Empire
65,brando647,It Tries Too Hard to Be the Original 300 and Fails; Too Dull,5,4 October 2014,"My first clue that the continuation of the 300 tale, RISE OF AN EMPIRE, was going to be lame was the release date shuffle it went through on its way to theaters. Zack Snyder, director of the original 300, passed on the movie (though he remained aboard as a producer/screenwriter) and the trailer never thrilled me. I skipped it in theaters and it's a good thing I did. I can't imagine paying theater prices to watch this bore-fest. It wants so hard to be just as fun as 300 and it falls far short. It comes from a graphic novel that Frank Miller pumped out immediately after the first film became a phenomenon, and it all feels like a meaningless cash grab. 300 should have been a stand-alone film, but RISE OF AN EMPIRE is so dull that it actually tainted my memory of the far superior original. The premise: while Leonidas and his 300 Spartans hold strong against the Persian forces at the Battle of Thermopylae, Athenian general Themistokles attempts to rally Greek into unification to combat the might of Xerxes. He leads a rag-tag band of citizens in naval warfare in the Battle of Artemisium, where they must use strategy and cunning against Xerxes' massive fleet and it's commander, Artemisia. A deadly woman with a thirst for revenge against the Greeks, Artemisia is a force to be reckoned with as one of Xerxes' most trusted advisors. Long story short: it's 300, except the capes are blue (instead of red) and the battles occur on water.I can understand why the filmmakers felt the need to continue the 300 narrative. I'm sure the Greco-Persian wars are ripe with material for some killer war movies. That's why I can't go so far as to claim this movie falls into the category of ""sequels that should've never happened"". My problem is that director Noam Murro tries to hard to be Zack Snyder. Well, sure, I have way more problems with RISE OF AN EMPIRE than that but that's my biggest gripe. Everything that made 300 what it was is overdone to the extreme here. Remember how 300 used slow motion/camera ramping to lend some extra brutality to the violence? Well, you'll get loads of slow motion here. More than you could ever want. Apparently, Murro believed slow motion shots equaled artistic quality. No, no it doesn't. It just slows down an already dull movie to a turtle's pace. Now, a reminder for those who somehow don't remember: 300 was an incredibly violent film. Loads of dismemberments and decapitations. Heads rolled and blood flowed. Well, Murro remembers that too but he wasn't too concerned with, you know, making it look good. The blood spatter in RISE OF AN EMPIRE is some horrible CG. Just globs of cheap computer gore flying in constant slow-motion. It joins KICK-ASS 2 as one of the worst CG blood offenders in recent film. If they'd had the money to make it look right, I wouldn't be complaining but this was just bad.While we're making comparisons, Themistokles is no Leonidas. Which is fine; he shouldn't be. As an Athenian, he is cultured and educated whereas Leonidas was head of a warrior culture. But Leonidas had gravitas and Themistokles is a dud. He fails to inspire confidence and the only emotions he seems capable of are anger and stoicism. It's not just Themistokles though. The entire cast fails to capture my interest. Xerxes, the one interesting character in the whole movie, gets limited screen time. We actually get a glimpse into his past to see his ascension to the throne following the death of his father (at Themistokles' hand in the Battle of Marathon) and then he's given a few scenes to lord over the battles from his throne. Artemisia is the film's true villain and Eva Green borders on camp with his psychotic nature. There are a few minor characters who's names I never bother to learn, particularly a father and son fighting alongside Themistokles to obvious results. Lena Heady returns as Queen Gorgo of Sparta, whom Themistokles tries to convince to join his army in holding off the Persians. I don't remember much about her role in 300 but I don't like it here. Everything about her feels fake, especially her rousing speech in the final act of the film. So again, everything 300 did right RISE OF AN EMPIRE tries and stumbles.The film has a few positive notes. I actually did like the naval warfare element. It added a new spin to the film that sets it apart from 300. I sort of like the film's cinematographic style. The whole movie is done in blue hues to contrast the dusty browns and reds of the 2006 movie. I think Xerxes is still an interesting figure (in the film anywayI know nothing about him historically) and wish we'd gotten the XERXES film we were originally promised as a continuation of 300. As a whole though, RISE OF AN EMPIRE is just a waste of potential. Instead of carving it's own path, it tries too hard to be the first 300 and it doesn't try very hard. It's not offensively bad. It just fails at the number one rule of action films: be exciting.",300 - Rise of an Empire
66,moviexclusive,More blood and more slo-mo though not as artistic - this 'side-sequel' unfolding alongside the original '300' is better for Eva Green's scene-chewing villainous turn,6,5 March 2014,"'300: Rise of an Empre' isn't a sequel in the strictest sense of the word; rather, seeing as how King Leonidas and his small but mighty band of Spartans all but perished under the sheer numbers of the Persian army led by Xerxes in the three-day Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C., this 'side-sequel' stands astride the events of the original film by taking place within the same concurrent period of time. Not to worry though - for those who can't quite recall what happened the last time round, there is enough backstory to make up for the seven-year wait in between the two instalments.Taking the place of Leonidas is the Greek general Themistocles (Australian actor Sullivan Stapleton), who in the extended prologue is seen shooting an arrow straight into the heart of the invading Persian King Darius (Igal Naor) in battle. King Darius happens to be the father of Xerxes, but more significantly, he also had a surrogate daughter in the Greek-born Artemisia (Eva Green). The young Artemisia had been sold into slavery after the massacre of her parents by invading Greeks, and was rescued on the brink of death by none other than King Darius himself.Returning to script and produce but not to direct is Zack Synder, who together with his co-screenwriter Kurt Johnstad, lay out some relatively heavy exposition in the first half hour drawn again from a graphic novel by Frank Miller. Though one may get the impression from the name of that novel 'Xerxes' that the emphasis should be on the Persian god-king, the more intriguing character here - as well as that given significantly more screen time - is that of Artemisia. Indeed, it is Artemisia whose motivation for revenge inspires the same of the grief-stricken Xerxes, the latter of whom then undergoes a transformation from human to god- like complete with gold-dipped skin, multiple piercings and his unmistakable glistening chrome dome.Turns out that Xerxes' battle with King Leonidas was just one front of the Persian invasion of Greece; and since that story had already been told, this 'side-sequel' as we had described it earlier paints the other front in battle, one that takes place at sea between the two navies. Again, the Persians triumph in numbers, so the Greeks led by Themistocles employ some clever tactical manoeuvres to outwit the first two charges of the Persians, which Artemisia delegates to her generals to lead in order to observe - and test - the formidability of her opponent.Taking over the directorial reins is the commercials ace Noam Murro, who stages the naval battles with plenty of visual flair. Each major sequence is different enough from the rest to offer real variety, and impresses not just with its sheer display of military might but also its detailing of Greco-Persian battle strategy - the last we have seen such an exciting combination of both was in John Woo's 'Red Cliff: Part Two'. Nonetheless, those hoping for a reprise of the blood-soaked violence in '300' need not worry; there is still plenty of beheadings, skewerings, and sword slashes - though we might add that there is perhaps a gratuitous display of arterial sprayings which could really be toned down a little.Much less successful however is Murro's attempt to recreate the stylistics of Synder's original. Try though he might of aping its predecessor's mesmeric, affected visual presentation, Murro's film ultimately looks less elegant, the use of slo-mo in particular coming off obligatory and even pretentious. Whereas Synder preferred artistic compositions, Murro here prefers to leave war looking grittier and messier, which stand sometimes in contrast to the beautifully rendered digital backgrounds inserted once again by CGI wizards. Not surprisingly then, it isn't the man-on-man clashes that prove most spectacular this time round, but the swooping overhead shots of Greek ships going up against their clearly more daunting Persian armada.While substituting Artemisia for Xerxes proves inspired, the same cannot be said of Themistocles for Leonidas. Not only does Themistocles come off bland compared to the macho-man heroics of Leonidas, Stapleton takes the role just too seriously, lacking in the charisma and self-awareness that Gerard Butler brought to his character. You're more likely then to be transfixed by Green, who portrays Artemisia's malevolence with scene- chewing glee. She knows exactly how to deliver each line of the intentionally stilted dialogue, adding just the right touch of vampiness to make them campily entertaining; nonetheless, it is very likely that one will remember the centrepiece sex scene between Themistocles and Artemisia where both take turns to prove themselves the 'man' in the 'f**king'.If it isn't yet clear enough, Green is a big reason why this long- gestating sequel doesn't come off unnecessary. Like we said at the beginning, '300' isn't the most straightforward movie to stage a sequel; and even though this hardly matches the poetic storytelling of the original, there are still plenty of scenes of glorious bloodletting if that is your thing. We prefer though the visual spectacle that the impressively staged naval standoffs offer, and of course the spectacle that is Green's scene-stealing turn as a warrior queen. A word of caution too - don't expect a neat ending, for the open-ended conclusion suggests that the filmmakers think there is still lots of potential in the Greeks' eventual vanquishing of the Persians at Plataea and Mycale to continue the mythology of '300'.",300 - Rise of an Empire

Okay, we have similarly terrible Green, Heady and some more to make us not even smile but scratch heads in disbelief. And yes, there are so many over the top battles involving ships. All too modern battles. I was waiting just for some napalm or laser gun to appear. And then, all those gross gushes of blood, endless slow motion scenes and idiotic dialogs. All that is here a lot.

68,quincytheodore,"While the spectacle is undeniably impressive, 300: Rise of an Empire is just a glorified war movie.",7,9 March 2014,"It lacks the unworldly mythologies of the first title, but its spectacular animation will still be entertaining enough. 300: Rise of an Empire is the prequel, event in between and also sequel of 300, this might be overreaching as it cumbersomely tries to tell wider scale background of the war. There are more characters, each with their own tale and the change into naval battle is a welcomed one, not to mention clever ways to divulge more effects, however they can't replace the charm of mystical charisma from the predecessor.Story revolves mainly on Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) and his ambivalence struggle against slightly insane Persian general, Artemisia (Eva Green). Stapleton is not exactly inadequate on the leader role. He showcases a decent performance as the weight of war slowly burdens him, but the brash hawkish lead from Gerard Butler is sorely missed. The movie utilizes almost the same merry band of warriors as 300, despite acknowledging the less superhuman original profession. They might be too similar, especially physique-wise, it feels like a shallow reenactment than legitimate replacement, and it's not about the blue cape instead of red.Eva Green is absurdly filled with anguish, almost excessively. It's very passionately awkward, but admittedly effective nonetheless as she oozes strength at times. King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) gets an exposition of his metamorphosis past, a ""before"" and ""after"" look as herbal steroid, magic spell and CG alter his appearance to that of a giant. This retains some of the magical vibe from previous title, although only a mere fragment of it.He does not possess the same on-screen threat as he did, currently he's not even the same level as his madly obsessive lady general. Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) serves as narrator, she partakes in only a handful of scenes as the focus shifts away from Sparta. Her voice has weight, although not as poignant as Dilios (David Wenham) in the first movie, who is now relegated into a flimsy support role.The trademark fight scenes are splendid, stylishly choreographed with elegant brute force. Maritime warfare presents more effects added into bloody skirmish, be it may water or fire, they are visually delightful. It moves very aggressively, slowing at just the right critical moments. In a sense, it almost resembles a game; I wouldn't be surprise if it has health meter and death count display. This mix of battle macabre and CGI stand tall in the peak of action genre, audience will most likely find no disappointment in this regard.Unfortunately, screenplays aren't constructed concisely enough; they don't continue momentum from plot to action smoothly, making some occasions feel dry. It offers some degree of political and social aspect, but not carrying the depth needed to stimulate the audience. While the spectacle is undeniably impressive, 300: Rise of an Empire is just a glorified war movie.",300 - Rise of an Empire

As for comradeship, nobility, honor, heroism, why bother when you can splatter more blood across the screen in 3D.The film claims courage and valor as its justification - you couldn't find any of these here with an electron microscope. Rather, truth be told, it takes a deliberate lascivious delight in extreme violence as titillation, and with it an utter and total moral vacuum and moral vacuousness.An appalling film that will garner fans for its OTT approach and Eva Green but deserves to be landfill.",300 - Rise of an Empire
71,OJT,CGI-decapitation of Greek history,5,7 March 2014,"Zack Snyder's original ""300"" was quite impressive when it came 8 years ago, which good effects and perhaps the best graphic novel put on the big screen ever.The eight years gone past since then has given us even better techniques and amazing real like CGI seen in films like ""Life of Pi"" and ""Kon-Tiki"". I was afraid the sequel of 300 wasn't able to understand why the first was so amazing, and I was right. The CGI isn't better, and the visuals move away from the graphic novel feel of the story. What's even worse is the blood splatter which is so heavily over driven that is looks like dry blood. Too much of a graphic novel, there. It even has the color of dry blood! When if also is falsifying so badly the story, that there almost isn't anything left, and the story sleek fails to deliver character building for more than two persons. I also despised the rough sex and the too slow motion in fight scenes. The film actually almost stalls so much you could go to the bathroom without missing the next blood spatter. The final negative thing is the use of Australian and British, even Scottish dialog. I'm sure the British empire wasn't involved in wars in old Greece, and that the soldiers at least looked Greek.So then, what's good? Well the story is mildly entertaining, when it doesn't bore you midways. An abrupt ending is OK. We stopped believing the story telling s long time ago. The rise of an empire isn't depicted at all. The actors are doing good, past the macho dialog and scenes. I would also say the the start is very good. It attached the story great to the first. So it's a bit entertaining, but still a great let down from the first, which will always be a classic.",300 - Rise of an Empire

73,Screen_Blitz,Not as bad as you might imagine,6,8 August 2015,"In this sequel to the 2006 epic hit, Themistokles (played by Sullivan Stapleton) is the new leader of the Greek army after King Leonidas's defeat by the Persian army. With the Persian army, now lead by Artemsia (played by Eva Green) and Xerses (played by Rodrigo Santoro), invading over seas, the Greek army must pick their swords back up and fend off against them. The film picks up immediately where the first film ended.This time around, Zack Snyder does not return as the director, but as the producer of the film. So Rise of An Empire continues the story from first movie. The story and the characters are not as exciting this time around. Sullivan Stapleton does great as Themistokles, but his performance is not as memorable as Gerard Butler's performance as Leonidas. Eva Green, who plays Artemsia, is who really impressed me. She brings such great energy to her character as she viciously fights off against the Greek soldiers. I wouldn't say that it was an Oscar worthy performance, but it was pretty impressive. The story on the other hand, wasn't as memorable and sometimes a little difficult to get into. It focuses more on the action rather than developing the actual story, and it made less comprehensible. The combat scenes, however, were not bad. The violence is much bloodier and more gruesome than the first movie, but has the same CGI blood effects and slow motion action that the first one was known for.300: Rise of An Empire may have not been as exciting as its predecessor, but it was still worth it.

However, when you watch 300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE, you will relive the days of female fortitude, when women were willing to wield, NOT yield.

75,Troy_Campbell,A bloody fun ride.,8,13 March 2014,"Rise of an Empire is one of those films where you get exactly what you want, no more and no less. Which means, if you loved Zack Snyder's Spartan-centric 300, as I wholeheartedly do, then this follow up will have you leaving the cinema with a smile from ear to ear. Set before, during and after the events of 300, we follow Greek general Themistokles (a gruff but likable Aussie Sullivan Stapleton) as he wages maritime war against the Persians; their navy led by the indefatigable and vengeful Artemsia (a seductive Eva Green). The plot integrates nicely with King Leonidas' tale and we get the chance to see some returning characters including Lena Headey's Spartan Queen and David Wenham's one-eyed warrior Dilios, as well as getting an origin story for self-proclaimed God and all-round douchebag Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). Simon Duggan's amazing CGI-augmented cinematography is, although primarily on a blue- grey palette instead of golden brown, reminiscent of what has come before in the series, whilst the adrenaline-pumping score by Junkie XL compliments the on screen heroics perfectly. Most importantly, director Noam Murro (Snyder wrote and produced) nails the stylised and meticulously choreographed action; the opening rain-drenched battle and the climactic naval showdown both worth the price of admission alone. The speed-up/slow-down aesthetic has been retained along with the cartoonish gore and it hits the spot for those needing a fix for blood-spilling, fist-pumping and over-the-top action beats. By no means flawless, and certainly not everybody's cup of tea, but Rise of an Empire is one bloody fun ride.",300 - Rise of an Empire

80,brchthethird,Mildly entertaining but excessive in-between-quel,5,14 November 2014,"300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE is a frustrating, but fitfully entertaining companion piece to 300. I say companion piece, because the events of this film take place before, during and after the events of 300. As such, this movie can't really stand on its own and suffers by comparison to the original, which was a much-better-told story. To put it another way, this movie is essentially the same underdog story as the first, only transplanted to the sea. A few characters from the previous film are carried over, and even those that aren't have analogues in this one. The plot revolves around Themistocles and Artemisia, who represent Athens and the Persian empire, respectively. Themistocles is a legendary warrior who reportedly killed Darius at the battle of Marathon, and Artemisia is a Greek woman who was rescued by the Persians and rose to command their navy. Their dynamic is what is supposed to drive the movie, and it largely fails to do so, with the exception of a hilarious sex scene which takes place midway through the film. These two try their best, but they are largely unable to make up for the absence of Gerard Butler here, creating a sort of charisma vacuum. Where the original was kind of tongue-in-cheek when it came to the jingoistic and ham-handed dialogue, this one takes it mostly seriously. Not only content to suck the joy out of the ridiculousness of seeing perfectly ripped men kill the mess out of each other, the early battle sequences are oppressive and borderline repulsive in the level of digital blood and gore on display, as if increasingly stylized violence could make up for the lack of investment in the story. Granted, the visuals are impressive, and an improvement over the original, but it just felt soulless and empty. There was also overuse of slow motion, and 10-15 minutes could have been shaved off if they'd shown most of the battle sequences at normal speed. The only sequence which I was truly interested in was the final one, and by then it was a little late to make me care in what was happening on screen. As far as acting is concerned, nobody really gave a bad performance, but nobody was really that great either. Eva Green was the standout, and did a good job of chewing the scenery, but she never really let loose until she meets face-to-face with Sullivan Stapleton's Themistocles. There was also some palpable energy with her performance in the final moments of the film. Returning from the original film are Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo, and Rodrigro Santoro as Xerxes. However, Lena Headey is relegated to being the ""Queen of Exposition"" and narrator for most of the running time, while Xerxes is largely absent due to his being occupied with the Spartans at Thermopylae. Still, they are each given a moment where they can shine. On a technical level, the film is excellent. There was an incredible level of detail, mostly augmented by CGI, but still beautiful to look at nonetheless. The battle sequences, this time involving ships, were also well-filmed and easy to follow. The only negative I can draw here is, again, the overuse of digital blood. There was a lot in the original 300, but there's fountains and geysers of it here, almost to the point of nausea. On the other side, a positive I can find was the score, which hit all the right beats and fit the movie quite well. I also liked the use of ""War Pigs"" in the closing credits, which was also used for one of the promotional trailers. Overall, the film more than a mite disappointing, given my affection for what preceded it. The story largely failed to be engaging, and often felt like a rehash, and it tried to compensate for that with even more outlandish and stylized violence, to the point where I felt like it glamorized it. Still, as visual spectacle, it was second to none. Would I recommend it? No. There simply isn't enough going on to warrant spending your money, and when it finally kicks into gear in the final act, it's a little too late.",300 - Rise of an Empire
81,Andy-296,"Sequel to 300 is surprisingly good, entertaining, exciting",10,6 March 2014,"The long awaited follow up to 2007's hit 300 is exciting, very entertaining. There is a new director (the little known Noam Murro from Israel), but the recharged, operatic style, with heavy use of digital imagery, that made the first movie famous is back again. It can be said that this is not technically a sequel, as both movies happen more or less simultaneous chronologically: the first movie took place in the Battle of Thermopylae (480 BC). The new one, after an introduction in the Battle of Marathon (490 BC), centers on the Battle of Salamis, in 480 BC, around the same time as Thermopylae. (Of course, I know you don't go to movies like this to learn about history).Sorting out from their defeat at Marathon, the new Persian emperor Xerxes decides to take revenge in the form of a large seaborne invasion of Greece. His main admiral is the incredibly sexy but brutal Artemisia, who is Greek born but was saved when she was a little girl by a Persian and has lived in the Persian court ever since, thirsting for revenge against her native land. The Greek side, on the other hand is commanded by the brave, honest Athenian Themistocles.As Themistocles, Australian actor Sullivan Stapleton is fine, though he lacks somewhat the charisma Gerard Butler showed playing Leonidas in the first film. But Eva Green as Artemisia is magnificent, magnetic, by far the most charismatic character of the film. Rodrigo Santoro is back as (a very fantastic) Xerxes. Lena Heady reappears briefly as Gorgo, Queen of Sparta. There are very fine action scenes involving naval battles, but the movie's best scene has Artemisia bringing Themistocles to her boat to ostensibly discuss peace, but it all ends up in a heated sexual rump.",300 - Rise of an Empire
82,fernandoschiavi,"Rise of an Empire impresses with the scope of the battles, but tire the audience with so much repetition and mainly by the many exaggerations",6,2 April 2021,"300 was a resounding critical and public success at the time of its release. Zach Snyder launched the efficient 300, an adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel that, even with its shallow script, worked mainly for its stylized look. Highlighting the violence of that universe and, of course, its origin in the 300: The Rise of the Empire, the gray and sepia photography highlighted the blood constantly present in the action, and even the slow motion was well used to highlight details of the efficient battle sequences. He pities that the sequence 300: The Rise of an Empire goes even less than that. Almost a decade later, Zack Snyder, co-writer and director of the previous film in the series, showed interest in the project, and was thinking about directing the new adaptation, but chose to direct The Man of Steel. Noam Murro then signed on as director, while Snyder was responsible for the script and production.Spreading the plot through the dilemmas of various minor characters in order to expand a loose story, The Rise of an Empire also features a lazy script that uses long off-screen narrations that explain details of the narrative and even the hero's feelings - and when the Queen Gorgo (Headey) describes Themistocles' reaction to the death of some comrades, the film borders on the ridiculous, since it would be reasonable to assume, without the need for explanations, that the hero would not have been particularly pleased with the loss. As if that were not enough, the dialogues of Snyder and Johnstad sound excessively pompous and / or artificial (""You appreciate the ecstasy of steel and meat ...""), becoming even worse due to the bureaucratic way in which they are recited by irregular cast.Technically efficient (even if, as already mentioned, limited to the style of the original), Murro takes advantage of the water-filled scenery of his battles and thus creates efficient sequences, such as the moment when Persian boats first appear to face the circle formed by the very smallest Greek vessels. The blood continues to be highlighted through slow motion, but here, it does not dye the canvas a bright red, as it is night - the night scene is well used in the initial sequence, when the blue cover of Themistocles is the only color in sight. More limiting, however, is the narrative structure of Rise of the Empire, also basically the same as the original: an army at a clear disadvantage (this time, not only due to the very low numbers, but also due to the null experience in battle of those men) has to defeat the powerful enemy. Depending on their honor, courage and intelligence - which the film does not care to develop -, they prove to be an equal opponent. It is not for nothing that the Spartans star in the climax of the film.While in 300, the Spartans funneled Persian troops into the Hot Gates, the Athenian fleet uses the geography of the Aegean to their advantage. This use, however, depends on Themistokles' bold strategies. In this respect, the continuation is a constant show of military creativity to the point that it is not limited to the hoplitic phalanx of 300. The importance of the Athenian general, therefore, would need to be emphasized through his charisma. The feature, however, leaves something to be desired by not offering a character as striking in his speeches as Leonidas. The highlight of Themistokles, therefore, is limited to the battlefield.The protagonist Sullivan Stapleton, as Themistokles, tries, but fails to reproduce the aura of hero and leader achieved by Gerard Butler, his predecessor. His speeches are not exciting and his stance is not impressive. There is no charisma in his work. But we can give you a discount. After all, his character is not a king who enjoys the complete loyalty of his subjects, but a general who has achieved political status through an already distant feat. Rodrigo Santoro is another one who disappears in the film. However, thanks to a contradictory choice of script. Deviating completely from its original intention, the script no longer explores all the complexity of Xerxes - causing Rodrigo Santoro to be concealed without mercy or mercy in the plot - but rather in what happens behind the scenes at the Battle of Thermopylae.At the same time that it hides Santoro and his Xerxes, the script gets it right by highlighting Eva Green, as Artemisia, as the main antagonist of the film. She is responsible for staying in the cinema until the end. Embodying all the characteristics of Babylonian feminine entities - manipulative, murderous and promiscuous, among other things - she serves as a crucial piece to the parables that the feature provides: the mysticism of the East against the reason of the West, the limitation of men before female power - something that could take on an even greater proportion if Lena Headey's character, Queen Gorgo, of Sparta, gained more space in the plot. Eva Green at least bypasses the unidimensionality of her character with her beauty and with the intelligent decision to create a performance that, even without big explosions, sounds sufficiently over for fun. After all, she is not every villain who has the opportunity to decapitate an enemy and then raise her head by the hair in order to kiss his mouth.The visual side of this sequel retains the whole soul of its predecessor. Director Noam Murro makes constant use of slow motion cameras, CGI, in addition to the various filters that guarantee aesthetics similar to the original comics. The ode to the spectacle of the first film remains, this time, at sea - and there is no shortage of the violence already exhibited in 300. The photography work of Simon Duggan, together with the editing work of David Brenner and Wyatt Smith, in the it delivers very well constructed and clear action scenes, instead of the usual confusion that is contemporary action films. Contrasting the blue covers of the Athenians with the red that marked the Spartans and the black / gold used by the Persians, the costumes create a beautiful contrast between these striking colors and the gray that dominates the digital scenarios. This, however, does not circumvent the lack of substance of the characters.The fact is that, even though it impresses with the scope of the battles (which this time occur much more at sea than on land), it does not take long for the film, excessively episodic, to tire us out by repetition and mainly by the many exaggerations that characterize them, since, believe me, they seem much more impossible (and out of a game) than those of the first 300. There are two major problems in the script: the insistence on a repetitive subplot and some moments when you underestimate the viewer. Unsatisfied with showing a subplot in which son and father fight in the same war in the first film (something probably coming from the original graphic novel), Snyder chooses to repeat the same type of choice, but this time he comes up with two actors (Callan Mulvey and Jack O 'Connell) that, in addition to having no physical resemblance or age that refers to the relationship of father and son, they bring absolutely no emotional chemistry.One of the moments when the film underestimates the viewer is when it chooses to show the scene of the death of Xerxes' father twice (and the second time this happens is unnecessary and abruptly cuts off a scene that could have some dramatic charge). If that weren't enough, the feature rewards us with a situation that is at the very least embarrassing: after seeing the death of his friend, Themistocles responds to his son that the last words on his deathbed will be said ""when the right time comes"", just to say them a few scenes later - in addition to being a nonsensical sequence, the ""revelation"" of his father's last words is not content to be empty of emotion, as demonstrated by O'Connell making no effort to improve the scene with his performance.The Rise of an Empire is a film that, at the same time, is very similar and distant from the first 300. In the visual and in the progression of the plot it works in the same way and directs the story to the same point. This new feature then works in the shadow of the original, without realizing that it could even be something more if it took advantage and lost some time developing its new situations and characters. The feature, at least, does not take itself very seriously, and it seems to recognize that it is the beautiful battle scenes that will keep the viewer attentive (because, after all, it is difficult to care about the other aspects, since not even the filmmakers themselves do it).), and get it right the moment they close the film, which is therefore an efficient pastime, but nothing more.",300 - Rise of an Empire
83,FilmMan47,Worth Watchable For Eva Green's Hilarious Performance,5,22 May 2014,"300:rise of empire 2014 is a sequel to the 300:2006 directed by Zack Snyder why he choose not to direct this & let Noam Murro take the directors chair is because of the story is weak we all know that 300 is based on comics of the same name but also includes heavily fictional elements of real historical events the makers already stated that its not accurate.The Plot:after the defeat of Leonidas and army of 300 the Persian army comes back to attack Greece & spartan's as Themistocles prepares for the battle king Xerxes unleashes a ruthless commander named Artemisia.I wont reveal the whole thing about Artemisia she was a very important & influential personality in history,these people have mocked it by including vulgarity,swearing words & there is also a sex scene of Eva Green out of nowhere i was shocked to see it, this film can be highly offensive to a lot of people however it does have some entertainment factor & it should not be taken seriously.The Cast:some new members come Gerard butler was missed here Lena heady role was short Sullivan Stapleton & Rodrigo Santoro but Eva Green is the real star & main villain here she is recently playing negative roles she also loves the characters ever since i saw her in Casino Royale 007 film.The dialogs given by Artimisia is so funny to hear lines you fight harder then you oh my god rest cant be said here it could have been a better film if it was handled with some seriousness it could have surpassed the predecessor but sadly its an average film worth watchable for Eva Green;s hilarious performance yes there is enough blood & fight scenes to get you hooked but its not enough.Overall 300:Rise Of An Empire 2014 is a film only for Eva Green fans nothing more my rating is 5/10.",300 - Rise of an Empire
84,joebloggscity,300 on the Sea!,6,29 March 2014,"Now the professional reviewers seemed to pan this before it had any chance. In some ways it happened to the prequel also. As a fan of the prequel I was willing to give this the benefit of the doubt. I'm happy I did but it's not a patch on the original.We have here a film that focuses on another clan of Greek fighters battling against Xerxes' men, except this time it's on warships, so it's really '300 on the Sea'. Some old faces but the opposing captains of our sides this time are the wonderful Eva Green and the less convincing Sullivan Stapleton.The film is wall to wall action and you'll be enthralled. It's even more violent than the first. The bad thing is that the dialogue is really poor and the story not as riveting, engrossing and rousing as the first. Say what you like but there's a lot of wonderful points in the first that is what has made it a cult favourite.If anything the flaws of this highlight just what was best in the old one. The lead ain't no patch on Gerald Butler and is outshone by Eva Green as the temptress Persian battle queen. In fairness to our new lead, he is purposely more human than the old King Leonidas, and is a great warrior without the Spartan attitude. Yet that misses out what was quite a strong point of the previous film.In many way its a paint by numbers sequel as such (although the timeframe of the film mostly parallels that of the first). If you enjoyed the first and and want more then you'll find it here. For everyone else, probably you won't miss much if you let this one pass by. For me as a fan of the original, it was fair enough but not in the same league as the first.",300 - Rise of an Empire
85,bryank-04844,"If you were a fan of the first movie, then you'll definitely enjoy this sequel, but if you didn't then you won't have a good time.",7,17 August 2015,"You would think that by the look of '300: Rise of an Empire', the sequel to the 2006 hit film '300', director Zack Snyder had returned to make this film. Well, you'd be wrong as Noam Murro directed this, making this film his first feature film. But don't worry, Snyder seemed to have a heavy hand and watchful eye over this film, as his handprints are all over this from his screenplay to the camera-work. It's all here again in this prequel, side story, and sequel that features a lot of the same characters from the original. '300' cost $65 million to make back in 2006 and was largely made in front of a green screen. That film grossed over $457 million dollars.While I doubt this sequel will do that well, I anticipate it making a solid dent in the box office during its run. Unfortunately, Frank Miller didn't have much to do with this sequel, but it was based on his unreleased book called 'Xerxes'. The film starts out right where the last one left off, with Leonidas (Gerard Butler) laying dead with his 300 Spartans, as Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) is marching forward with his giant army to destroy Greece.However, we get a prequel story of sorts about how this whole war got started, which sheds a little light on the Persian side of things. One might say that the Greeks were the ones to blame. But we see Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) lead his Athenian army to destroy a group of Persians looking to settle on land. Themistokles shoots his trusty arrow into King Darius, Xerxes' father. Xerxes, a plain man sees this and is completely devastated as the Persians retreat back to their home. You'd think that Xerxes would become the evil man he became because of this, but that's not the case, for there was someone behind the shadows who told him lies and filled his head with evil thoughts that caused him to take his journey and destroy the human side of himself and become the God-King we saw in '300'.That person is Artemisia (Eva Green, excellent), a young orphan girl who was found by someone very familiar, who Leonidas kicked into a bottomless black pit after he yelled 'This is Sparta!"" Artemisia was looked after and trained by this man and King Darius. When the King was killed, she vowed to kill every last Greek on the planet and told Xerxes to do the same, despite what the King said on his deathbed, which was essentially to keep the peace. Come to find out, Xerxes takes a backseat throughout this whole film, as he only serves as the face of Artemisia's movement, while Artemisia calls all the shots. If it wasn't for Artemisia, maybe Leonidas would still be alive and Xerxes would be a peaceful human being.Meanwhile, Themistokles heads to Sparta to unite all of Greek in a war against the Persians, but Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) informs him that her husband Leonidas and 300 of his men journeyed out to fight themselves, leaving Themistokles and his army of men, who aren't necessarily soldiers to fight thousands upon thousands of Persians on the rough Greek waters. So basically, this story takes place as Leonidas and his 300 men army are killing the Persians on land during part one.The best part of the film by far is Eva Green. Her Artemisia is quite amazing. She is such a tortured soul, but holds nothing back and shows no mercy to her enemies and even her own army. And in an epic sex scene between her and Themistokles, which is awkward, funny, and rough, you can't help but see her anger and betrayal in all of her body. She really is the ultimate badass, even if she is an evil badass. The fight scenes are very similar to the first film with tons of slow-motion mixed with real-time as each spear and knife makes contact with skin. This time though, no matter how deep the cut or decapitation, a gallon of red blood spews on the camera in 3D.Speaking of the 3D, this is some pretty spectacular 3D. It seems that they hired a giant team to create dust and sand in 3D throughout the film. There is so much depth, image wise, that it might be some of the best 3D put on film. For this being Murro's first feature film, it didn't seem like he had free reign to do what he wanted with it, because it seems like Snyder took over for a lot of the shoot. '300: Rise of an Empire' is a solid sequel that has everything you want in a '300' sequel from nudity to blood to epic fight sequences. If you were a fan of the first movie, then you'll definitely enjoy this sequel, but if you didn't then you won't have a good time.",300 - Rise of an Empire
86,petarmatic,I was very pleasantly surprised!,8,26 January 2015,"When I started to watch this film I never expected it to be so good. Everything surprised me pleasantly! Acting was excellent, plot was very interesting and visual and special effects were fantastic! I think the most memorable line from this film will be: I better die on my feet then live on my knees! It is interesting that several thousand years later it was the same line used by the journalists of Charlie Hebdo before they were killed by ISIL looneys. It is interesting that, just as then, today*s danger to the west is coming from the east. We also saw suicide bomber in this film. It is certain that past and present is mixing in this film.I strongly recommend that you see this film.",300 - Rise of an Empire
87,ersinkdotcom,Does a great job following up the original,8,24 June 2014,"Sometimes there are movies that escaped me along the way. A film that, for whatever reason, I never caught in the theater or on Blu-ray / DVD. One such ridiculous example of my oversight is Zack Snyder's adaptation of Frank Miller's ""300."" I've always wanted to see it and heard how great it was. The fact that it was based on a graphic novel by the same genius who wrote ""The Dark Knight Returns"" and ""Batman: Year One"" makes the whole situation more unacceptable. To make matters even worse for myself, I did the unthinkable. I watched ""300: Rise of an Empire"" before seeing the original.Some will gasp in utter disgust and immediately stop reading this review. Others will find my fresh eyes and impartial opinion of the sequel a breath of fresh air. I went into ""300: Rise of An Empire"" with nothing to compare it to or any preconceived notions of what it should be. All that being said, I found the movie to be an entertaining (if not completely accurate) telling of the Battle of Salamis.After his defeat of Leonidas at the Battle of Thermopylae, Persian god- king Xerxes marches forward toward the city-states of Greece. With Athens as the first stop on his path of destruction, the city's admiral Themistocles must lead his garrison of soldiers against Xerxes and his new vengeful ally, Persian naval commander Artemisia. Will his soldiers fight alone, or can Themistocles convince Leonidas's widow to send the Spartans into the fight again?Director Noam Murro brings every gory element you would expect from an R-rated sword-and-sandal epic to ""300: Rise of an Empire."" There are no quick slashes or splashes of blood to be found here. Every swing of a sword and puncturing of skin is slowed down to give viewers the optimum amount of time to take in all the bodily harm and decapitations.I will say that at times the narrative parts of ""300: Rise of an Empire"" seemed like minor segue ways to the different fight scenes put in front of us. However, Screenwriters Zack Snyder and Kurt Johnstad did do a good job of weaving the backstories of Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and Artemisia (Eva Green) into all the bloodshed and action. Santoro is as equally creepy in ""Rise of an Empire"" as he is in the first film. Green comes very close to stealing the show and making the ""manly"" Spartans and the Persian armies both look like sissy boys.""300: Rise of an Empire"" is rated R for strong sustained sequences of stylized bloody violence throughout, a sex scene, nudity, and some language. The sex scene is quite graphic and borders on sadomasochism. I found some of the bad language to be a little out of place for a period piece.I did watch the superior ""300"" the next night to see what I'd been missing all these years. ""300: Rise of an Empire"" does a great job following up the original. Director Murro and Cinematographer Simon Duggan do a great job mimicking what Zack Snyder and Larry Fong created. It definitely feels like a direct extension of ""300,"" which it should. This is the perfect example of imitation being the best form of flattery.",300 - Rise of an Empire
88,face-819-933726,Eva Green and a much deeper story make this add on to the original worth your time.,9,3 June 2014,"So this is not a prequel, or a sequel this is another branch of the original story of 300. A lot more details of the story are opened up, and you are introduced to a lot more Greeks, and Persians, and get a lot more of the Persian back story that was really lacking in the original movie. With the addition of Eva Green who is just amazing always, and all of the fan favorite characters are there even Dilios who starts with both eyes, and when you see him later he is as you remember him, though his bandage is a lot different in this movie, and that strangely stands out. Speaking of standing out though, this was mode to be 3D, and the little floating bits of dust, or ash, or blood, or even pollen are everywhere, and distracting as heck. In the real world if the air was that thick it would burn, so I just kept expecting everyone to burn up. The actual effect though gives all of the characters in the movie a more God like appearance, almost as though they are all living, and moving through time a bit faster than normal, and that gives the rest of the world a thicker slower look to it. If you liked 300, then you will like this just as much, and if you have not seen 300, you can jump in here, but they do not really cover the back story from the original movie except in little comments here, and there mentioning where other characters must be. Don't worry though the accursed Hunchback is still there, and just as realistic, and pitiful as ever. I Enjoyed this a lot in the end, good action, lots of blood, and amazing Green/Blue screen effects. The Motion comic for the final credits is beautiful, and I was really glad to see it at the end rather than the beginning as the last Bond film did which ruined the entire movie. So a big recommend as if it needs one, and I can promise you a good time if you can stand a little blood, and some naked folks or even if you are just an Eva Green fan, then this is your movie to Enjoy.",300 - Rise of an Empire
89,cardsrock,Quite lacking compared to its predecessor,5,27 June 2021,"300 was a wholly original style of film and felt very fresh when it came out. 8 years later, they decided to make a prequel? Sequel? I honestly don't know what this film is because of its convoluted timeline and it jumps around constantly. The slo-mo shots are amped up, as is the sex and sea battles. None for the better though as the story is pretty dull with an even duller lead character. Eva Green is game, but sadly most of the film around her is not.",300 - Rise of an Empire
90,Laakbaar,"Over the top, but not bad",7,11 April 2014,"This is not a bad movie, but it is an over-the-top movie. It's unabashedly epic in scope and melodramatic in feel. I don't play video games, but the movie felt like that.There is a lot of speechifying about freedom, democracy, patriotism, brotherhood, war, unity, revenge and death. Yes, it's all in there. In a strange way, the primary theme of this movie was masculinity. It's the kind of film you'd show in military movie theatres. The men are all cartoonishly hypermasculine steroidal bodybuilders, like some gay porn fantasy. (CGI, I suppose. Not a single one of them had tattoos.) This is a martial arts film. Men -- many men -- are slashed, stabbed or hacked in this film, always with a slow-motion splash of bright red blood. The Persians were dressed in dark colours, and after a while it seemed obvious the point of this video game was to kill as many of them as possible.The historical aspects are cranked up to the level of fantasy. I don't know how accurate any of it is. Not very, I suspect; but I also think it doesn't really matter.The language is strangely elevated in tone (""You shall speak of it no more"") and everyone speaks in non-American accents This movie glorified the Greek side. At times, I saw disturbing parallels to America. At times it seemed sort of racist.Given all that, I still sort of enjoyed the movie. One scene even moved me. It is indeed epic in scope. ""Rich with detail"" would be another accurate description. The grand naval battles were, well, spectacular.The 3D is effective. Some of the scenes are beautiful. Much of the movie is bathed in a hazy, dark golden luminosity, an effect I've not seen before.Eva Green is evilly fantastic. Sullivan Stapleton is nobly hot.In the end, I'm not sure what this movie really was. At times I thought it merited a 3; at other times a 9. It wasn't schlock or cheesy or campy, although you'd think it would fall easily into those categories. There was a time in my life when I may have been blown away by a film like this, but that time has passed.",300 - Rise of an Empire
91,dfa120374,Not A Bad Sequel To 300,6,18 January 2015,"The Persian Army, under the command of the God King Xerxes, has defeated Leonidas and his army of 300 and now is looking to crush the major states of Greece. Having beaten the Persians at the Battle of Marathon 10 years prior, Themistocles is to raise his forces once again to try and stop the might of the Persian Army, and this time he looks to Sparta to join forces and help crush the Persians.300: Rise of an Empire is not too bad of a sequel to the enjoyable 300, but it does lack a certain something that 300 had which was an interestingly told story. The story is there on this sequel, but it doesn't really seem to hold much interest like the 1st film did.One thing that Rise of an Empire did have much more of, though, was stunning visuals, fight scenes and gore. The slow motion elements were back as well, but I don't think this was used as good here as it was in 300, and sometimes I felt like it was actually over-done. The fight scenes were really well done, and it was all filmed on an epic scale with some truly amazing effects and visuals.The cast also done a decent job and while not having the same kind of presence that Gerard Butler had, Sullivan Stapleton still did a decent job as Themistocles, the Athenian politician and general. Eva Green was OK as Artemisia, but she didn't have that certain element to make the audience hate her like a really good ""baddie"" would have.Unfortunately, like I said, story wise it doesn't really grip you as well as the 1st film. It just felt like this hadn't been given nearly as much attention as the battle scenes & visuals. Rise of an Empire is still an enjoyable romp, however, and as long as you don't go into it expecting it to be 100% historically accurate then you should enjoy it as well.",300 - Rise of an Empire
92,RevRonster,A sequel to a film that really didn't need a sequel...,4,2 July 2014,"There's no point in playing coy here""300: Rise of an Empire"" was a sequel to a great graphic novel adaptation that, honestly, didn't really have to be made. In reality, no films HAVE to be made but ""Rise of an Empire"" is one of those special cases that, if the film was done right, we are happy the chance was taken and have allowed itself to try and justify its existence but, if the film was done wrong, all we think about is why it was even made in the first place.Whether you like the guy or hate him, Zack Snyder directed a wondrously stylized and outlandishly fictional account of the last stand of the Spartan 300 that was oddly gorgeous. The lighting, filters and camera angles use (not to mention the use of slo-motion) really created a world that was incredibly fantastic and fist-pumping-ly action packed. This time around, we get none of that.Sure, ""300: Rise of an Empire"" has some pretty satisfying action but it is only the kind of satisfying that exists when nothing better is around. Not to mention the film looks cheap as it lacks Sndyer's flair and beauty of the first film and the acting can't compete as it is very cheesy.This follow up doesn't have the same feel or have the adrenaline to it that the previous graphic novel adaptation had and, in the end, the film just came off looking like a cheap, Direct-to-DVD sequel that, honestly, didn't really need to exist in the first place. Granted, most sequels (if not all films, in general) don't have to actually exist but sometimes they end up making themselves look like even the director didn't care if the film existed or not and that's the biggest problem with ""Rise of an Empire.""

93,bbickley13-921-58664,"Action packed, but not really story packed.",8,7 March 2014,"I can't help, but to compare this movie to the similar movie that came out earlier this year, Pompeii. Pompeii did not have necessarily a better story, but the filmmakers did a better job at flushing it out in my opinion. Pompeii really suffered from the cheap CGI effects, which brought it down for me. Rise of an Empire is the opposite.I love the special effects and the CGI in this movie. Though Zack Snyder who directed the first 300, was only the producer of this one, his style of making a comic book come to life visually on the silver screen is all over this. It's one of the things I think we all loved about the first 300 (and Zack Snyder as a filmmaker) how he took Frank Miller's art work and brought it into motion almost like animation. Not as well as Robert Rodriguez did for Sin City, but that's because In a time when comic book movies are in, Snyder is a comic book artist in his own right. His film making on 300 was the difference between Frank Miller doing the artwork himself, or having Jim Lee or Alex Ross do it for him. The story of Rise of an empire is happening Simultaneously with the story in 300 . Both movies are about The Greeks battle with the Persian army, but while 300 is about King Leonidas leading 300 men against a Persian army that greatly out numbers them, Rise of the Empire is about Themistokles, a man attempting to unite Greece to face the much larger Person army. An event that happens at the same time as the event in 300, you can see this throughout the whole movie. the movie also gives an origin story to the Persian king saw in the first movie, and for me this is where the best part of the story begin and ends. After the birth of the God king the movie's plot seems to be too uninteresting it feels like they are trying to be as politically intriguing as House of Cards, but of course it's not. Like Pompeii this movie takes place in a time when sword to sword combat was bad ass and the movie gives you more than you can handle. Unlike Pompeii the visual effects on this flick are top notch, so making a Greek painting come alive as this movie attempts, succeeded greatly. In fact, the movie's greatest achievement is glorying amazing Greek battles, as if though director Noam Murro was a Italian renascence painter, or comic book artist, that latter being more true, considering the amount of over- exaggerated CGI blood spilled. Sometimes I wish there was more to it though. Eva Green as the bad guy, Artemisia was amazing,but I feel all the good guys you should cheer for are too lackluster. You could say the movie could have used a big name like Gerald Butler to play the hero, but on the flip side, I had no idea who Butler was when 300 came out and he was anything but forgettable as Leonidas. I'm a little bit bias about my feelings for Rise of an Empire, as I'm a huge comic book fan and I greatly enjoyed seeing this Graphic Novel move across an Imax screen in 3D. It's worth seeing just for that, but the problem is you have to get through a story that I lost interest in too early on.",300 - Rise of an Empire
94,Al_The_Strange,This is Athens!,8,18 March 2014,"The battle of Thermopylae was a glorious last stand, in which 300 Spartans and a small number of allies fended off an insurmountable enemy for three whole days. As significant as the battle was, it was just one small piece of the Greco-Persian Wars; while the battle raged on, General Themistocles led the Athenian navy against the Persians at the straits of Artemisium. The Persian fleet had the advantage with a whole vast number of bigger and better ships; just as the 300 Spartans had to face vast numbers of enemies for three whole days, so did 280 small Athenian vessels. The history nerd in me was always interested to see how the naval battles of Artemisium and Salamis would look on the big screen.300: Rise of an Empire simultaneously follows up on, precedes, and runs along side with the events of the film 300, using these naval battles as the focal point. In a way, the film is merely more of the same, using the same plot structure, character archetypes, and execution in a different set of battles. It is definitely a blast though: the battle scenes are as stylish and intense as ever. There are bucketloads of blood drenching the screen with nearly every swipe of the sword. There is massive mayhem when the ships collide and armies clash on the broken decks. The film still uses the same tone and style as its predecessor, providing a vividly mythic account of these historic events.The story elaborates on some of the things that were left hanging in the first film, such as showing how Xerxes became the ""god king,"" and what every kingdom's reaction is to Leonidas' death. The bulk of the story focuses on General Themistocles, who is never really given much depth or presence, and his nemesis Artemisia, who steals the show repeatedly thanks to her wickedly-invoking backstory and a wickedly-invoking performance by Eva Green. Really, Artemisia alone made the events captivating; without her, it would have been a much duller tale. The plot breezes through the battles and backstories before abruptly ending right at the climax of the Battle of Salamis; it's a bit jarring that there's no falling action before the credits, but there's still just enough closure to make the film satisfying.There are historical liberties, of course. Some of the exaggerations of the first film remain (people still don't wear body armor, choosing to show off their abs instead; Ephialtes is still a hunchback; Persians still have elephants and monsters in battle, and they also deploy an ironclad ship at one point). Many of the basic events are solid, but with a few discrepancies (both Xerxes and Darius were never at the Battle of Marathon; Artemisia was absent during the Battle of Salamis). However, some of the artistic choices that made the first 300 so imaginative are sorely missed in the sequel. There is nothing really new added to the lore that's already established. Since Frank Miller's graphic novel Xerxes is not yet published, I have no idea how the film compares to it.As expected, this film is loaded with numerous slow-motion shots and scenes with CGI backdrops. Just like the first movie, this one looks like a live-action graphic novel, and is generally interesting to watch. I think a lot of scenes look great. Editing is alright. Acting is okay; Sullivan Stapleton tries his best, but never quite matches the machismo and presence that Gerard Butler had in the first movie. Eva Green is effectively perfect as Artemisia. I enjoyed everybody else's performances too. Writing is not too bad. This production uses some slick-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects can be good in some scenes, bad in others, and most of the CGI blood doesn't look very convincing. I thought JXL's music score was a bit dry to listen to on its own, but when married with the movie, it was awesome.This film entwines itself with 300 pretty well, and provides enough blood-soaked action to appease fans. It's not without its faults, and the first film is still the best and most original. I still thought that Rise of an Empire totally rocked.4/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Good)",300 - Rise of an Empire
95,ArchonCinemaReviews,"the legend returns, but an epic? it is not",6,27 August 2014,"Audiences are given a second 300 film eight years after the sensational epic.Opening with a powerful and intense battle scene, 300: Rise of an Empire is set in the midst of a political war. Greek general of Athens, Themistokles, leads an army against Persian forces led by Xerxes, once mortal but now gilded god, and Artemisia, vengeful commander of the Persian navy.The story of Rise of an Empire is more convoluted than its predecessor, tracing its story before, during, and after the bloody battle at Thermopylae led by King Leonidas. We see Xerxes mortal and how he comes to be a god. We meet Artemisia, Greek, murderous commander for Persian Xerxes. We follow the path of Athenian Themistokles and his role against the rise of Persia at the helm of Artemisia.The film starts strongly but as it progresses the time frame for the story becomes increasingly longer and more complicated. At first Rise of an Empire feels like a prequel. The plot then marches forward, we discover the plot of 300: Rise of an Empire coexists with that of 300. The mesmerizing effect of an impossible battle and simplicity of a snapshot within a war surpasses to confusion and falters as an overly long onslaught in gore.Sullivan Stapleton is our leader Themistokles. He does not have the prowess nor the commanding nature that demands respect and power. Eva Green is his opposite of the film, Artemisia. Green plays Artemisia unforgivably barbarous, mercilessly inhumane and yet it does not feel like a perversion.Fans of the 2006 film will enjoy the legend's return. The directorial styling brings you back to the epic original set in Sparta while feeling authentic. Mammoth assaults and vicious deaths will satiate the need for carnage. Perhaps on its own Rise of an Empire would stand tall but against is magnificent predecessor it is not nearly as impressive.More film reviews of recent releases can be found at our website!",300 - Rise of an Empire

Watching a movie with the heroes of our history makes us proud and it is a very welcome positive reference to our country especially in the context of the last years.For all the 1/10 reviewers please relax, it is cinema, the great escape from reality.

99,p-jonsson,Watchable but far from great,6,26 July 2014,"This is one of these movies which will always have its detractors because it is not historically correct. There are certain movies in which you expect a certain amount of historical accuracy and there are certain movies where you do not. This is one of the latter. You must be out of your mind if you ever expected any great deal of historical accuracy from this movie (or any Hollywood production nowadays for that matter). Therefore it pains me to see the reviews that slams this movie with a one-star rating and moans about how it is screwing with the (their) history. I would certainly not call this a great movie but, as a movie, it is far from the one-star range.The movie is watchable, it is even somewhat enjoyable to watch but it is not really a great and epic movie. There are lots of action which is one of the good parts. Some of the scenery, especially the naval ones, are quite magnificent even though they are somewhat overdone in the usual Hollywood way. The bow waves make these heavy, wooden, oar-powered ships look like they are speeding ahead at 30 knots for instance.The action is of the rather gory and blood splattering type. Given all the slow motion scenes with copious amounts of blood slowly floating in the air I would assume this was more out of intention than out of ignorance although the ease by which these ancient swords chopped through bones and necks seemed rather unbelievable. I do not mind blood and gore in my movies but I have to say that the blood and gore in this movie seemed to have taken precedence over the rest of the creative process.The movie simply failed to inspire the awe that one would expect an epic movie of this type would do. Someone said that the movie played out a lot like a video game and to some extent that is true. I never really felt much for any of the characters when watching the movie. I found myself just waiting for the next action scene. The enjoyable part of this movie is really the action, the scenery and the effects, not the story or the characters.The movie is watchable, even enjoyable depending on your expectations but far from great.",300 - Rise of an Empire
100,xamtaro,Glory. Consider it seized once again.,8,6 March 2014,"Legendary's blood soaked, fantasy fetish fueled, graphic novel style retelling of the second Persian invasion of Greece returns. While the brave 300 Spartans faced down Xerxes legions at Thermopylae, a second and no less pivotal conflict was taking place. A massive naval campaign led by the vengeful, and no less crazy, Artemesia advances on Greek shores. Only a handful of Athenian ships, and the unconventional strategies of general Themistocles, stands in their way.Expanding on the story started in Zack Snyder's 300, 300 Rise of an Empire brings green screen slow motion carnage into the naval arena. Familiar themes are tackled here: of children losing their childhood in the heat of battle, of how one man's devotion to freedom and democracy helped rally a legion, and of how a small force can overcome any odds. Zack Snyder's screenplay peppers the script with a good dose of testosterone, manly howls of inspiration, and dash of innuendo, especially between rival generals Artemesia and Themistocles. Eva Green steals the show as the manipulative and sadistic Artemesia. Magnificent screen presence, deadly like a coiled viper yet sizzling hot against the cold blue ocean backdrop. Easily one of the more memorable and charismatic comic book villains since Dark Knight's Joker. Without conscience and fueled by burning passion, she is the perfect foil to Themistocles' stereotypical superhero image. Themistocles is a little like marvel's Captain America. He stands for justice, freedom and democracy. He had forsaken family and love for servitude to his country. His image of calm courage and steadfast control threatening to crumble under the weight of leadership; where every wrong move kills off someone's husband, father, or son. Their on screen chemistry is almost perfect despite being in actual physical proximity for 2 scenes. Some say that backstory kills off mystique; nobody wanted to know that Michael Meyers had a screwed up childhood before he became the masked Halloween killer. Love it or hate it, 300 Rise of an Empire delves into the tragic backstory of its villains. Xerxes' tale especially lends itself to the running theme of a son taking up his fallen father's mantle and surpassing his parent. Did we really need to know how a depressed prince became the God King of Persia? Why not? Our past shapes our future, as do our mistakes. Through Xerxes' invasion, Themistocles learns the hard way that mistakes of the past will bite you back one day. And bite hard.It is a pity that Zack Snyder merely penned the screenplay. His presence as a director is sorely missed. Director Noam Murro does his best to follow in the stylish speed tweaked vision of Snyder's. It is a good effort, but not as dynamic as his predecessor. Instead of the golden bronze and striking crimson, we have a dull blue and murky grey color palate. Where Snyder infused his battle scenes with a gruesome grace and flow, Murro's battles are messy, hectic and hastily edited. Slow motion ramping (alternating sped up and slowed down shots) originally used to zoom in on and emphasize iconic shots, are just slapped on seemingly at random.Despite the disappointing directing, this movie is a real joy to watch. The naval clashes evoke memories of historical classics like Ben Hur; wide in scope and epic in scale. It's cast chemistry and charisma provides the pivotal centerpiece in what could have been a forgettable and unnecessary sequel. This ain't Sparta. But this sure is almost as glorious.",300 - Rise of an Empire
101,room102,Why this movie is a FAIL,5,22 March 2014,"1. Extreme overuse of blood splatter.2. Extreme overuse of slow motion. Not every blow and not every blood splatter needs to be shown in slow motion.3. If you take all the movies in film history and count the number of something splattered on the camera, it won't reach the number of times this movie had blood splattered on the camera.4. Structure: 5 min of action, 15 min of talk and so on. Save that to history class, not to an action film.5. No creatures. The first movie had great imagination and the strange creatures were great.6. If you take out all the talks and put the movie in normal speed, you get 10-15 min of footage and that's not enough to make the movie good.7. The movie shouldn't have been ""300 at sea"". It should have expanded the story of Xerxes.8. Female heroine has no place in the world of ""300"".9. Constantly moving back and forth in time and serving both as a sequel and as a prequel is just wrong.10.

Yes, it has all of these problems and yes I had my fun time at the theater anyways. As much as it is filled with nonsense I genuinely felt tension at times, the performances from Eva Green and Sullivan Stapleton were good enough to make me forget at times the poor character development that stood behind them and make me forgive some scenes that in other ways could have been offensive to my intelligence. The battle sequences were all in all enjoyable, I really felt that the director wanted to make the best out of what he had. In the end yes it has a fair load of problems, especially in the storytelling department, but the movie manages to overrun them with the pure sense of thrill and fun it creates.

The thunderous themes and notes have been put in all the right places. Eva Green is enchanting.

106,kgprophet,More is More Succeeds at least this Time,6,12 March 2014,"This sequel wants to make it clear that it is wider in scope and deeper in slashing and blood spurts. The now familiar shots of a sword swishing through the air in super slo-mo are way too plentiful as to diminish the desired effect. What works though are the large battle scenes en masse, with well orchestrated sequences of effects, cinematography, fighting, and more effects. Yes, the green screening is obvious, and not quite as crisp as the first 300, but there are loud and punchy battles at sea that are relentless.Back is the tall Xerxes dude, and an additional villain who takes center stage, Artemisia. In place of Gerard Butler is Sullivan Stapleton, a relative unknown. Even though the film visits some of the same beats and utilises the graphic novel look as it's predecessor, it expands on the characters and gives them more screen time to ooze their evil ways, or to recruit allies.The 3D takes cues from Zack Snyder's Man of Steel by introducing floating crap in the air. You feel like you are in a stuffy barn all the time, but makes for fun depth of field effects. Same goes for the advances in 3D smoke effects, you travel through a haze with visceral scenery. Between a story that gives our characters extreme actions, and a budget to back up the battle fireworks, this follow-up held it's own.The first film still has much more originality, and still is the better of the two, but I didn't get bored, except for 1 out of every 4 super slo-mo slashes. But in general the larger scope of this sequel makes it a worthy successor.",300 - Rise of an Empire
107,tankace,Unnecessary sequel too many inaccuracies to accept it.,6,1 July 2016,"To start I know that 300 ,is by no means an accurate depiction of the real life event ,but one is a great action flick, two is based of a comic , three the comic pays tribute to the real stand of the battle and to the legend surrounding it, so the inaccuracies are forgiven for these reasons. But the sequel had no excuse for what so many fails to portrait the battle of Artemisium and Salamis, with the second is a naval battle, that I have study again and again since I was twelve!The naval engagement may look nice but the over use of cgi was apparent and it didn't convince me that the ships were really there. And the way the battles were fought was over the top and too upsurged in order to take it seriously. The previous film was also over the top ,but there you get that you talk about the Spartans, the original commando and expert to one liners ,so it made sense for them to behave and move like that. Athenians weren't that and so I can't except this interpretation.After words is Themistocles, they ruined him! He is showed as an buffed macho male with only one tactic ,forward, the real person was a strategics supreme who having only 180 ships blocked 1200! To add to that he is ,if not the only one, between people numbers in the fingers of one hand who turned the tide for the war. To the rest characters they are the same with the previous installment ,so nothing new here. The character who was the one I wasn't offended by her was Artemisia, played by Eva Green, who was indeed a great general and a tough peace of work.In short this is an average sequel ,which doesn't hold the candles to its predecessor. Despite that as adventure is entertaining and there are some great shoots and if you like I can understand that. What I won't accept is to tell that is a good interpretation of the Greeko- Persian War.",300 - Rise of an Empire
108,Puroo,"It's an unpopular opinion, I know",10,20 June 2021,"Honestly I have no idea why all the reviews here are so negative. It's so much like the previous movie, except without any character development. But hey, watching 300 for the character development is like watching porn for the acting. I just came to see the well choreographed fights and that's what I got. It's quite surprising I didn't even know this movie existed until I looked up 300 sequel, since I wasn't satisfied seeing such a tragic end (I took my time to understand that's how the story should have ended, but by then I already learnt about this movie).So 300: Rise of an Empire is from the point of view of the Athenians. I said in my 300 review that as a kid I'd have hated that movie because it showed red Spartans killing black Persian Immortals, but over here I might have reconsidered since blue was my favourite colour back then. The movie showed the atrocities that took place in Athens and the learning of Leonidas' sacrifice. These became the reasons why Athenians chose to pick arms against Xerxes too. Meanwhile Artemisia has parted ways with Xerxes and is now commanding her own army.In spite of this movie only being produced and not directed by Zack Snyder, his visual effects still remain intact. There is a scene where Themistocles rides a horse to fight the Persians. The camera stays on him for 2 minutes without a single cut. That scene was the reason why I got completely sold for this movie. Of course there was the slow motion sex scene and the Persians doing the atrocities, but that was at least visually appealing, even if it didn't contribute the plot in any manner. The action scenes was all I cared about. It was shot wonderfully. The ending was left open-ended, but it was pretty obvious what happened next.I had watched 300: Rise of an Empire like, 2 years ago. Back then I hadn't watched many movies. Probably this movie wasn't as great as I thought it was. I have watched many movies since then and have seen everyone say how bad this movie is over here (everyone I have met in real life who have watched this movie says they liked it). So I think I will rewatch it before I decide to change my opinion on it. Until then it will be a full-star movie for me.",300 - Rise of an Empire
109,shawneofthedead,"Not as effective overall as its predecessor, but compelling and worth a watch nonetheless - particularly where Eva Green's Artemisia is concerned.",7,5 March 2014,"In recent years, Gerard Butler has disappeared into a stream of forgettable, lacklustre movies - which is what's so surprising about how much he's missed in 300: Rise Of An Empire. It's not like he could come back, anyway, since his character met such a grisly, noble death in Zack Snyder's genre-defying, blood-guts-and-glory epic 300. And yet, this 'equal' - the narrative takes place before, during and after 300 - noticeably suffers without the brute-force charisma of his inspirational Spartan King Leonidas. Fortunately, Eva Green steps in and fills his shoes (sandals?) admirably well as the antagonist of the piece, even though the film meticulously constructed around her might not be entirely worthy of her efforts.While Leonidas and his 300 men do battle on land to hold off the invading forces of Persian god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), the Athenians are worried about the looming threat of war at sea. General Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) and his army of farmers and poets cannot be assured of help or reinforcements from the other Greek city-states. This failure to unite the disparate forces of Greece seems to hand certain victory to the enemy: the Persians possess a far superior naval fleet commandeered by the vengeful, ruthless Artemisia (Green) - who, for dark reasons of her own, will not rest until Greece is wiped from the face of the earth.The curious thing about 300: Rise Of An Empire is how it manages to be, in one fell swoop, better and worse than its predecessor. On the plus side, it has considerably more story-telling ambition, expanding the scope of its tale to encompass historical context that simply wasn't required in 300. This is mostly done well, although the exposition-heavy opening speech by stately Spartan Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) might prove more confusing than enlightening. When the film settles into its groove, however, it actually proves quite fascinating to piece together the twists and turns that led up to Leonidas' last stand against Xerxes, and to realise how this epic battle is but one small thread in the entire tapestry of war between Greece and Persia.But the film's Grecian protagonists are also considerably less compelling than Leonidas and his brave 300. Themistokles is a frustratingly colourless presence on his own, and his moments of purportedly heart-rending brotherhood with his lieutenants - played to great operatic effect in 300 - never amount to much. He brings young Calisto (Jack O'Connell) into the war, despite the objections from his buddy Scyllias (Callan Mulvey), who just happens to be Calisto's father. But the lessons learnt by father and son are rote rather than rousing. As a result, the film lacks the visceral emotional impact that would lend weight to its many scenes of frequent, over-the-top blood-letting. 300: Rise Of An Empire also shades, a few too many times, into unintentionally funny territory (""ROCKS!!!""), which derails the narrative and makes it harder for the film to find its metaphorical footing again.Fortunately, everything about the film improves by leaps and bounds each time Artemisia strides on screen (which, thankfully, happens quite a lot). The film may be based on Frank Miller's graphic novel Xerxes, but it should more rightfully take its name from this warrior who conducts the bloodshed and mayhem like she would an orchestra, with easy, ruthless determination. As Artemisia, Green radiates ice and coldness - she has the bearing and look of someone frozen in her rage - even as she boils with the earthy heat of vengeance. Stapleton, who looks beautiful but doesn't really manage to communicate the soul of his character, comes properly to life in his scenes with Green, particularly in a bruising encounter onboard her ""barge"" in which their bloodlust becomes something quite literal.Aesthetically, the film is often quite lovely to look at, although one can't help but wonder whether director Noam Murro might have gone a bit too far in trying to recapture the bold, unusual, heightened look that so defined 300. His many, many battles - all digitally created - are bathed in grim, highly-contrasted colours, arcs of blood black in the dying light. After a while, it becomes somewhat monotonous, even when ships clash and men tumble to their deaths on a regular basis.What 300 most lacks amidst its testosterone-fuelled blend of bravery and bravado is a stronger feminine presence. On that count, 300: Rise Of An Empire has a great deal more going for it. Artemisia remains fierce and powerful in her own right throughout the film, sparring with Themistokles in an equally-weighted battle of brains and brawn. Headey, too, has much more to do than she did in 300. It's somewhat sad, then, that their male counterparts can't quite hold up their bits of the film. Otherwise, this new installment in the 300 franchise might have found itself in the enviable position of outshining its predecessor. Instead, it's a rather compelling, if not entirely successful, attempt to look beyond the courage and sacrifice of Leonidas' intrepid 300.",300 - Rise of an Empire

117,ghost_dog86,300: Rise of an Empire: Zack Snyder is nothing special,5,16 March 2014,"If you've ever had an intense want or need to see a poorly choreographed sequence where a man and a woman engage in hand to hand combat while simultaneously having intercourse, then ""300: Rise of an Empire"" may be right up you alley. ""300: Rise of an Empire"" pretty much gives fans what they came to see: unrealistic violence, men with no shirts and all around graphic novel inspired visuals. But director Noam Murro (taking the ""300"" reigns from Zack Snyder) does throw in his own healthy dose of uninspired casting and a few misogynistic visuals (I genuinely feel awful for those women who were dragged to see this).Aside from violence which repeatedly slipped back and forth between cool violence and stupid violence, another annoyance stems from the fact that these films are predicated on the slow motion effect, an effect so prevalent and overbearing here that even when characters are simply standing around and chatting, there are floating embers (and dust particles during interiors) in the background, in a constant state of slow motion. There is also a term going around called ""speed ramping"", which is when a character on screen begins performing an action in slow motion, but gradually ""ramps"" up to normal speed in order to give more epic emphasis to the action. This is another overdone effect sprinkled indiscriminately throughout.That said, the story is actually pretty well constructed. At least it kept my interest. ""300: Rise of an Empire"", a storyline which interestingly enough occurs simultaneously with its predecessor but in a different location, follows Greek general Themistokles (I hope I spelt that right) as his small army goes head to head with the seemingly endless Persian army, lead by the bloodthirsty, fetish gear wearing Eva Green (yes, she goes topless, but it's not worth the 11 bucks) and that bald, tan guy with a super deep voice. But again, I don't feel that most people who go see a movie like this really care about the story. So, if you don't, you still have the unrelenting, bloody action sequences and buff guys running with swords in slow motion to look forward to (if that's your thing).Final Thought: At the end of the day the one fact which is not arguable is how the look and direction of ""300: Rise of an Empire"" is not dissimilar to Snyder's ""300"". In fact, aside from the absence of Gerard Butler, everything here looks and shares the same forced epic feel. Meaning, Zack Snyder's style is not hard to mimic and thus he (as a director) is not nearly as unique as ""Man of Steel"" and ""Sucker Punch"" apologists claim him to be.

119,Bruce722,Void of some of the charm of the first 300 but still a worthwhile viewing experience.,7,9 March 2014,"300: Rise of an Empire was a really good movie but it failed to deliver on the epicness of the first film. But I'll first touch on the positives. The visuals are really, REALLY cool. It seemed like the blood spurts weren't done quite as well as the first one but overall the visuals in this movie were fantastic. Whether it was Artemisia igniting the Greek Navy or Themistokles leading the Greek forces, the special effects and visuals were a definitely strength. The acting was also really good. Was it ""Oscar-worthy""? No but it's a different kind of movie. I thought the actors delivered their roles well, especially Eva Green, who I thought stole the movie. Her beauty is stunning, sure, but she did an incredible job with Artemisia. The plot also developed well and I thought they connected it to the first film really well. Instead of this being a sequel, though, it's essentially occurring at the same time as the first movie, just at a different location. That being said, that is also one of the elements that hurt the movie, in my humble opinion. The movie builds and builds and builds and then right when you think you're about to get the biggest battle of the film, it ends. That is just a part of what I consider the weakest area of the movie... there just isn't enough combat. The first movie was littered with epic fight sequences while this one focused more on the politics. I think they forgot why so many people loved the first one. It was different from the Troys and the Bravehearts and the Gladiators. It was in your face war and had a charm and joy to it. This movie, while good in its own right, lost a lot of that charm and joy and tried to take a more serious cinematic approach, ultimately missing its mark in the process.",300 - Rise of an Empire

121,niutta-enrico,300: how can anyone not like these images?,8,6 June 2014,"When the first '300' was released, in 2007, I thought that only Frank Miller's fans like me could like it. The movie was identical to the book (released in 1998) and I was afraid that it would be a colossal flop. I was wrong, it was a huge success, both among reviewers and at the Box Office. This second '300' (Rise of an Empire) comes without a book (Frank Miler hasn't finished it yet), has disappointed many people, raised much more criticism and earned less. IMDb rating itself fell from 7,8 to 6,7, which is significantly lower.I am surprised of both reactions: the Battle of Thermopylae is much more appealing than that of Salamis, is like the Alamo compared to Waterloo. Historical accuracy, moreover, seems roughly the same to me in both movies. Both are inspired to a graphic novel and what really counts in comics are images, the emotions that they bring. And in this respect the present film seemed astounding to me, just like the former one.",300 - Rise of an Empire
122,saytosandeep,MY REVIEW: Visually Stunning Blood Bath!!,7,20 March 2014,"300: Rise of an Empire. It's not a sequel, it's not prequel. Remember 300, where a brave Spartan leads 300 men to fight a big army. This 300 shows a parallel battle between a brave Athenian played occasionally good Sullivan Stapleton against the evil commander Artemisia played by terrific Eva Green. The movie scores in all technical parts like scorching visuals dipped in red sepia tone, haunting and thumping back ground score, neatly choreographed battle scenes which cover 75 % of the run-time and some intelligent use of 3D effects. But movie lacks a layered storyline and solid acting except by Eva Green who holds the movie together by her portrayal of ruthless, wicked and no barred evil commander. So if you were able to enjoy the overly done blood bath scenes of 300 then you won't find a problem enjoying Rise of an Empire as well. I am going with good 7 out of 10 for 300: Rise of an Empire. It's fun while it lasts.",300 - Rise of an Empire

Action wise its not great, its over the top but not in a good way. The plot is very terriable, it does't make sense and doesn't even make for high entertainment. I can't for the life of me figure out why the this other than of course the money.

124,achyutaghosh,old wine in old bottle,7,8 March 2014,"300: Rise of an Empire﻿ movie review- Old wine in old bottleHistorians say the 5th century Greco Persian wars had a seminal impact on the world. If the Greeks had not stood up to the might of the Achaemenid Empire﻿, maybe the East would have been ruling the West, there would have been no Alexander the Great﻿, and an united Europe would have but been a distant dream. The wars, spread over 50 years were marked by three landmark battles, which had a common theme- bravery in the face of insurmountable odds. The battle of Marathon which recorded the first victory the Greeks achieved against the superior forces of Persia. Second was the most famous rearguard action in the history of mankind- the battle of Thermopylae﻿ where 300 Spartans held off the entire Persian army. And the third was the twin naval battles of Artemisium﻿ and Salamis, where 300 Greek ships along with sheer luck and a bit of weather on their side, overpowered a 1200 ship strong Persian navy. If anything, the three battles together brought about the death of an empire, not the rise.""Seize your glory!""2006's 300﻿ was about Thermopylae. Based on Frank Miller﻿'s yet to be released graphic novel, 300: Rise of an Empire sweeps across all above three influential stories. While a number of old characters such as Lena Headley﻿ (Queen Gorgo), and Rodrigo Santoro﻿ (Xerxes), reprise their roles from 300, history takes a backseat here, as we are introduced to Themistocles, played by Sullivan Stapleton﻿, who is supposedly the common thread in all the three battles. While the actual Greek character was a politician, this dude here is apparently the one who felled the Persian king Darius at Marathon, and also responsible for letting Xerxes getting away first time round. He also seems to be the only one who dreams of an united Greece, and pitches this idea to the Spartans, but a bit too late for Leonidas and his men. he is also around to delivers the coupe de grace to the Persian navy at Salamis. While a lot of back story is given on how Xerxes acquired his god king status, Artemisia is the crucial new character introduced in this novel. Played with gleeful joy by Eva Green﻿, she is the accomplished Persian naval commander, portraying bloodthirsty and smoking hot at the same time.That director Noam Murro﻿ did not want to tamper with a successful formula is both good and bad. Good because considering the source, there is the usual hyperbole all around, ultra violent slow motion action cuts, supernatural monster elements, globules of 3D blood generously splotched all over the screen, and punchline spewing beefcakes, and romanticized notions about love, honor, freedom and beautiful deaths that will satiate the fan-boys. Bad, because this is like old wine in old bottle. Granted the overall action is better and less cartoonish than that in 300, the naval battles are beautifully pictured, and there is some attempt at a plot. But at an overall level, Murro does not even attempt to leave a mark, this is just Zack Snyder﻿ part deux. Most of the characters are wooden, and most so is the hero. He errs big time in casting Stapleton as the one man who strings it all together for the franchise. Straight off Strikeback, Stapleton is strictly TV material, lacks the charisma and gravitas to step into the shoes vacated by Gerard Butler﻿.Curiously then, history does repeat itself. Just as the 300 Spartans is what most people remember from the Greco-Persian wars even though Salamis was a more crucial encounter, so does Rise of an Empire struggle to emerge from the benchmarks set by 300. It is a slick, stylistic retelling of history that existing fans will enjoy but will struggle to relate to new audiences. 7/10 since i was a fan of the first!",300 - Rise of an Empire
125,abouhelier-r,300: Rise of an Empire Review,7,9 March 2014,"300: Rise of an Empire is not really a sequel of the actual 300 movie. It's most a sort of parallel event, happening while the movie is taking place. A Greek general Themistocles leads the charge against invading Persian forces led by mortal-turned-god Xerxes and Artemisia, vengeful commander of the Persian navy. I wasn't a huge fan of the first movie, but I found it visually groundbreaking. Queen Gorgo is telling the story this time around, it's an opportunity to revisit and reliving the character of this strong but not very known Queen in the 300 movie. She actually embodies the bridge between past and present events. There a few female characters again this time (obvious for an Action-Drama-War movie) but they're very strong, and most importantly very interesting characters. In fact warriors still fight for a Glorious death. My favourite character is Artemisia, starring Eva Green. She's not a one dimensional character, which could have been the danger here. Along the film we're able to discover her back story, which is quiet rare - to see where the characters come from, especially in those films. Moreover, Artemisia's back story kind of ad some humanity to her. Indeed, she was wounded mentally and physically, when she was a child her family got killed by Greeks. Now, we can understand why she's on a mission to revenge her family and killed Greeks boldly. On the other hand, the war hero: Themistocles, is a little bit boring. But he delivers good battle speeches and good action scenes though. The visual effects are stunning, epic, ambitious and still breathtaking. The slow-motion depicts battle scenes quiet like moving paintings on an even greater scale because of the main challenging components such as being on water or costumes. This ""sequel"" is done with just about as much skills as the first 300 movie. Finally, I was hold at the same feeling of the 300 movie but it shows a new angle which displays that the Greeks are doing their own thing (till Queen Gorgo and Sparta's navy come save them btw). Not so great hero but a very good female villain character.",300 - Rise of an Empire
126,Come-and-Review,Why this movie lacks of the quality of the first 300,4,19 April 2017,"I would like to start by saying that, despite the fact that I study at a school where we learn ancient Greek language and literature as a subject, my main complaints as for 300: Rise of an Empire are not the numerous historical inaccuracies that this movie has.The first 300 was one of those very interesting films which is adapted from a comic book. This allowed it to have a both visual and plot-wise guide in its original graphic novel. I loved 300, certainly not because of its gore, its nudity or anything of that, but because it attempted to bring to film the comic book as it was. And, if you ask me, it succeeded in bringing a visually wonderful story with well characterized characters. What my feeling was from seeing this film, was that those who worked on it didn't understand why 300 was so good. Intead of bringing a story written with Frank Miller's style, it had no clear plot, and definitely no ending. Next to this, R rated material such as gore, violence, nudity and profanity was brought to such an extent that the film had more in common with an exploitation movie than with the previous film. 300 had some R rated content, but as much as was needed for the film. I heard too many modern profanities and points of language which simply didn't fit the situation (300 had almost no language, on the other hand). Also, I've seen simply too many gory deaths and stabbings, throat slits, decapitations, mutilations and such, which weren't strictly required. Again, 300 had only that amount of this which was required for the plot.Next to this, there were almost no such iconic and visually appealing shots such as certain scenes of the previous film, and the imponency of Xerxes which was shown in 300 was undermined by the introduction of a new female villain who apparently doesn't have to obey to a god-king.While some of the combat was well shot, I think this film should have focused on one single battle, rather than showing a series of insignificant ones. This battle could have been the battle of Salamis, which, if portrayed more accurately (just as how 300 portrayed the battle at Thermopylae) could have provided a very intriguing situation that could have lasted half of the movie. Salamis was portrayed very untruthfully in this film.The abrupt ending was the worst thing. Whereas 300 provided a satisfying ending, Rise of an Empire has a more open one. Leaving an open ending the way this film does is simply meaningless.If you are to watch some sort of exploitation action film set in Greek era, you might not find these points as valid to downrate this film. 300, on the other hand, had next to some of those elements a higher quality, due to its closeness to the original Frank Miller Graphic Novel. Rise of an Empire was almost not based on Miller's Graphic Novel, but, in addition to that, didn't have much in common with its style as well, a style that would have granted it a higher artistic value as a film.",300 - Rise of an Empire
127,RogerBorg,"Messy, muddled, overblown and under-cast",4,21 February 2021,"Sullivan Stapleton (who, right?) is no Gerard Butler, that's for sure. The rest of the Greeks are also instantly forgettable no-names with limited acting ability.That leaves the film hanging off of Eva Green, who puts in a decent performance but is embarrassingly petite and un-muscular. Physics and physique apparently worked very differently in the ancient world, because Green looks like she's barely capable of lifting a sword, let along wielding it against an adult male. Same problem with Lena Headey: it's pure cringe to watch these tiny little women do action scenes.As to that action, it's over-done. Far, far too much slow-motion, blood effects that are more comical than comic, and for the Gods' sake, stop throwing away your shields. Less would have been more.The plot is unsure of itself, the pacing is erratic, the story isn't engaging, and Green's sex scene is distinctly uncomfortable. I doubt she's proud of doing it.There's just not that much to enjoy here.",300 - Rise of an Empire
128,chappywatched,Chappy Watched: 300/300: Rise Of An Empire,6,10 May 2016,"I could barely remember the first movie, so I had to rewatch it before watching the sequel.If you didn't know beforehand, these movies are just action, blood, violence, sex and nudity. If you expect anything more, don't watch these movies.Both these are movies that you can turn your brain off, just sit back and enjoy.I would have to say that I preferred 300: Rise Of An Empire better than the first movie. I was under the impression that it takes place after the first movie but learnt pretty early that it takes place the same time as the first, just centering on a different person/group.It does have a heavy use on the CGI but it is based on a comic book so action scenes and deaths are heavily exaggerated, which they bring to the screen.There is also a heavy use of the spray tan, make up for the fake abs and the oil to make the muscles glisten.Both movies have a pretty good cast but Eva Green steals the show for me; she does crazy really, really well and also has some pretty awesome costumes!Some decent films, if you don't go into them expecting too much and ones you can watch multiple times.",300 - Rise of an Empire
129,priyantha-bandara,Bloodier but certainly not better,5,8 June 2014,"While this being the second installment of the famous 300 (2006), it is clearly showing vast improvements to the production and the looks but degrades to the overall quality of storytelling. However, fans of 300 would definitely enjoy this as it has its own bloodily stylish way of being one of the brutal and reddish historical epics ever made. 300: Rise of an Empire is clearly larger in production value, action choreography and CG and trio itself can keep someone attracted for the full length of the film. However, all you get is battles upon battles and after sometime more battles. End of the day all is left are piled up dead bodies in the name of heroism and the true feeling is lost. The one true good thing and the brilliance remembered is the performance by Eva Green who portrays a shockingly lethal female villain which we seldom see.300: Rise of an Empire tells a story in parallel time line to its predecessor. And at times it touches the story of the 300 brave Spartans led by King Leonidas but mainly concentrates on the story of Themistocles a Greek general and a war hero. This movie is based on the war raged against Greece by Persian forces led by mortal-turned-god Xerxes and Artemisia his war commander. When the expertise of strategic Themistocles meets with the brutal and unforgiving Artemisia's army the battle upon seas becomes bloodier.Keeping the graphical properties which 300 is known for, 300: Rise of an Empire does a fabulous job at being gory right from the start. And no doubt the high speed action sequences chopped right in to super slow motion frames are a sight to witness. And the overwhelming amount of blood signifies the brutality of the war which at times can be obviously disturbing. But without these 300 will not be completed. And as mentioned earlier without them this movie could have being one boring looking expenditure. Yet I do not hold any grudge against 300: Rise of an Empire because it looks like it delivers what it supposed to. It would have being great if this installment also had a gripping and a truly heroic story like the one before but sadly the fans have to settle in for less than that. And since the third installment to 300 and sequence to 300: Rise of an Empire is already rumored let's hope we will see something better soon.",300 - Rise of an Empire
130,Spartan_1_1_7,A sequel that entertains and doesn't disappoint.,7,28 March 2014,"""Better we show them, we chose to die on our feet, rather than live on our knees!"" -Themistocles.The events in this movie occur parallel to 300. In this film, they showed the other side of war, the Naval battles (mostly), which Athens forces fought. The story is pretty much the same war one with different army and different battlefront. You do get to see some background of the war, which was cool. Themistocles is no Leonidas (Gerard Butler), that is pretty apparent BUT he was still good as the protagonist. The show stealer though is Artemisia (Eva green), who acts as the main Baddie in the film. She is sexy, cold and ruthless. This is something that the original 300 was lacking, a proper villain. The film looked great visually, having the same graphic novel stylish look that the original boasted but this time with more darkness and marine setting. Action scenes were cool with all the slow mo and gory moves, ship wrecking and naval battles. And the soundtrack was good. But it was all lacking when you compare it to 300. Action scenes kinda became repetitive. The end sequence was AMAZING though. 300 was about Spartans, they are the elite of the elite, the best and most bad ass soldiers ever, their honor and strength is unmatched. Rise of an empire showed Athenians, who still being pretty good soldiers, are no match for Spartans, and hence the movie lacked in overall feel as compared to 300. But it is still a good enough sequel that entertains and doesn't disappoint. A must watch for those who liked 300. 7.5/10",300 - Rise of an Empire
131,LiamBlackburn,Good but with unrealistic antagonist,7,30 March 2014,"Amazing cinematography, really good battle scenes. The movie was a little slow and redundant at times. The amount of blood-spurts and stabbings was a bit much for me. What I found irritating about htis movie though, was its portrayal of the ""female general"" of Persia. She is actually a Greek who was raped and enslaved and tortured by the Greeks a s a child. Then she somehow, becomes the most feared warrior in Persia? I don't buy that. This is just a social justice commentary by cultural-marxists. It may be also just a reflection of the over-feminized, politically-correct Western Film world. Seriously? The penultimate statement in the movie, is when The Female General, curses Xerxes by saying how "" he only has his safety because of her army's protection."" Lulz. This is the exact opposite of reality of war and the roles of males and females. It's actually the feminists of the West who have the freedom to disparage men and the value of men only because of the millions of male sacrifices of war and battle. So for the movie to be apexed by this line in the movie, it just reeks of political correctness.",300 - Rise of an Empire
132,Paynebyname,Wildly entertaining,9,8 March 2014,"I saw it last night and thought it was fantastic. When I came out of the cinema my heart was pounding from the jolt of pure movie entertainment.I loved the style, the score and the action scenes. I thought having enjoyed 300 and Spartacus that I'd be tired of the slo mo bits and the blood but far from it. There was invention in the moves and a real feel that Themistokles was a bad ass.Okay he wasn't Leonidas but then he wasn't meant to be. He was more reserved and had a quieter authority about than Butler but Spartans are different to Athenians and hence it was only right for him to be different.He held my attention and his final speech was great for motivating his men in his admission of error and asking for their support as free men. In a world of generic speeches, playing the humility card was refreshing and inspiring.The action scenes were just amazing and allowed you to strategically see the battlefields (or seas). Eva Green's character was great but I don't feel she 'stole' the movie. There has to be foils and opposites to characters so whereas as she was scene chewing, Themistokles brooded heroism.I really liked how it played out before, during and after the Thermopylae (sp) battle making this feel like another part of the tale rather than a sequel. The soundtrack for this so wonderfully complimented all of the actions scenes and I cannot wait to get it on disc. Currently listening to it on YouTube and it's still impressive.A fabulous, wildly entertaining film that I will have to see again at the cinema. I pray that it does well enough to lead to a final instalment that is as well put together as this film.",300 - Rise of an Empire
133,JPfanatic93,This is not Spartaaaaaa!,6,31 March 2014,"The visually unusual action-on-steroid 300 proved to be quite the box office success back in 2006. It took a while before the army of pixel pushing programmers got reassembled for a second shot. Hardly based on Frank Miller source material, this second installment could have been shot years ago, and probably for the better, since the visual style that characterizes these movies has been copied almost as often as the signature quote 'This is Sparta!' has been loudly uttered in fanboy circles. But what becomes quite clear upon watching Rise of an Empire, is that 'this' is not Sparta.Rise of an Empire serves as both a prequel and a sequel, and even has some of the newly depicted events take place simultaneously with its illustrious forebear. The result is an uncomfortable mix of separate story elements all cramped together in one movie that feels the need to both explain the motives behind the conquest of the antagonist, Xerxes, and explore the political intrigue between the Greek city-states. The movie flashes back to Xerxes' past as easily as it does to the outcome of the battle of Thermopylae, which makes for a chaotic feel that was lacking in 300, whose narrative structure proved more coherent. The movie starts with the history of how Xerxes became king after the death of his father and his rise to power afterwards. As soon as the movie is done demystifying the despot the title of the film makes little sense, as we're only ten minutes into the movie. It took that long for the 'empire' to 'rise'; the remaining 90 minutes will be spend on bringing it down.Xerxes is merely a supporting character, as the movie is based around the personal battle between Themistokles and Artemisia, the vengeful admiral of Xerxes' navy. Artemisia is a seductive and manipulative woman who pressured her king into going to war with Greece. As an abused former slave of Greek descent, she has some personal issues with the Greeks to conclude, which brings her head-on with the Athenian statesman. Eva Green portrays this strong woman with visible delight and ensures the enemy's side is not devoid of charisma, which would have played well off Gerard Butler's equally commanding Leonidas. Unfortunately, she has to make do with Stapleton's bland Themistokles instead, who proves to lack the gravitas one would expect from such a renowned politician. Equipped with largely the same ideological motivations as Leonidas, Themistokles keeps droning on about the magnificence of Greek freedom, which he deems so grand and noble it's worth risking every soldier's life to uphold it. Problem is, because of Artemisia's distressing background such lines are somewhat rendered moot, and Leonidas at least did a much catchier job at delivering them to inspire his troops. We'd be inclined to pick Artemisia's side, were it not for her routine of viciously dispatching her bumbling commanders.Rise of an Empire proves to be a telling case of 'girl power' over the political machinations of men. The film reintroduces the character of Queen Gorgo, who also serves as the film's narrator. It's not the endless quasi-poetic lines the script supplies her, it's her ability to stand up to Themistokles and voice her displeasure with his approach to fight ""his"" war, coupled with her own desire to right the wrong that was done to her, that make her more compelling to watch than her Athenian rival. Gorgo proves at least as tough a female presence as Artemisia and the two are almost kindred spirits. Unfortunately they do not grace the screen together but are limited to interacting with the boring Themistokles. Though narratively and emotionally this semi-sequel turns out to be a mixed bag, it's the action and visual flair characteristic of the 300 style that should make the film. In that regard the movie leaves little room for disappointment. However, because of 300's then-originality and the numerous copycats that followed it, there's little novelty here. If you expected muscled men beating their adversaries in bloody ways in extreme slow-motion shots, that's what you'll receive. Athenian muscles are not as outrageous as their Spartan counterparts, which is probably a good thing as it ought to cause less physical insecurity amongst the audience's male demographic (though the same may not be said of Artemisia's ample bosom dimensions for females). Since most of the movie revolves around naval battles, the movie differs in tone with its predecessor in that regard, trading in the earthy red colour pattern for a blue maritime quality. Epic shots of ships ramming into each other and the various tactics applied by both naval commanders serve the majority of the film's action sequences, but these start to feel tedious as the movie progresses. Battles on boats simply do not provide the same opportunity for colourful combat diversity as land battles do. Don't expect to see any monstrous men or rhinos fighting in Artemisia's war. Rise of an Empire is a fairly decent follow-up to its predecessor that proves devoid of surprise or inspiration and arrives a little late to the battlefield. It packs quite a punch in the female acting department, but its male stars and their motives are simply not as interesting to keep your attention from drifting on the waves of its maritime action scenes. Though it serves its bit of gory battle scenes, it stylistically can't stand up to its forefather and feels like little more than a compendium piece. It will definitely not rank as high on a popcultural level, absent absurdly cocky but highly quotable lines that proved 300's trademark. Truth is, Athenians are just less fun to go to battle with than those delightfully over-the-top-and-then-some Spartans and their constant flow of witty reprisals.",300 - Rise of an Empire
134,FilmMuscle,A Bloody Good Successor,6,10 March 2014,"My primary question and wonderment, going into the theater, was whether or not 300 (a film I honestly admired) even warranted a sequel with the way its story concluded- whether or not this was just another one of Hollywood's cheap cash-ins on a popular property. Thankfully, you're in for a pleasant surprise. Rise of an Empire spans a great length of time, displaying the events before those of its predecessor, during, and after. In that case, it possesses a far larger scope, even more threatening obstacles, and greater stakes. If you're of the elitist type that pompously labels any action films you see as ""dumb fun,"" this one might not impress you as much as it would an open-minded individual. What astonished me most about the film is that it's not just about endless amounts of gore and slow-mo action sequences. First of all, Eva Green- oh, Eva Green- is undoubtedly the stand-out in this one, portraying Artemisia, a ruthless commander of the Persian Army who's hell-bent on destroying the land of Greece—where she was born but stricken with horrifying memories of her family being slaughtered and herself being cast out in a despicable manner. She's just as beautiful as she is menacing, carrying an alluring manner about her. Judging from that aspect alone, Rise of an Empire's villain trumps the first's (since we barely got a taste of Xerxes's true power and diabolism in that one). With this chapter, the filmmakers actually managed to strike a fine balance, highlighting and capturing both sides of the story— Persia and Greece. Xerses's story is further fleshed out, and his origins are finally revealed—how exactly he came to be this ""god-like,"" tyrannical ruler of Persia. There's also a significant focus on Artemisia, which is likely why her formidability is so effectively depicted. See, this is the main issue with villains in blockbusters: there's just not enough time dedicated to their backstory and their activity throughout the narrative's occurrences. Their vileness requires emphasis and the proper spotlight while supplementary depth is applied to their character in the meantime. Focus on the more emotional side of them and then allow for a sufficient number of scenes to concentrate on their doings, specifically, whether they're demonstrating their sheer intimidating nature through torture and deceit or simply readying themselves for the battle against the hero. Anyway, in terms of appearance and technicality, Rise of an Empire perfectly recaptures the original's visual style and incredible production design, once again presenting us with the stylized gore galore that made the first installment so special. The wonderful choreography and spectacular set-pieces are worth the price of admission, alone. Moreover, these monumental battles are coupled with an epic score to adequately satisfy fans of sword-and-sandal cinema. With that being said, the movie's protagonist (Themistokles, played by Sullivan Stapleton) isn't even nearly as charismatic and memorable as Gerard Butler's Leonidas in the first film. He lacks any distinct qualities--to the point of being a generic, bland hero--to truly steal the show whereas the villain, Artemisia, absolutely steals every scene she's in, thanks to Eva Green's marvelous acting talent and the cleverness of the script. Now, this is a tricky flaw to call attention to: the film slightly suffers from some rather clichéd and predictable arcs/subplots that actually draw very noticeable parallels to the first one's. And then, we have Queen Gorgo (played by Lena Headey). I'm not sure how she suddenly knows how to fight so viciously, skillfully dodging and mutilating multiple enemies. Did she really have the time to train while the conflict worsened or—ah, well! All in all, 300: Rise of an Empire is remarkably effectual as a genre movie In other words, you're receiving exactly what you asked for. The movie accomplishes everything it promised, certainly deserving praise, especially during a dry period of cinema where the months lack quality experiences and are instead oversaturated with mediocre or downright awful pictures. Rise of an Empire will surely entertain you with some unique villains, intriguingly orchestrated action, and an engaging story. To top it all off, it also retains the jaw-dropping visuals, camera-work, and production value of its predecessor, surprisingly giving the forerunner a run for its money.",300 - Rise of an Empire

Which I found they did a little too much. Sometimes you just got to let the action unfold in real time. The acting isn't quite as good as the first and neither is the action.

And with the Persian armies still roaming by the end of the film there was still potential to continue the story. But as much as ""300: Rise of an Empire"" tries, it's unable to recapture the same style Zack Snyder used in the first film. Taking place partly before, partly during, and partly after the battle of ""300"", we follow the story Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) as he tries to hold off from the legions of Persian troops attacking from the seas through using his fleet of 50 warships to hold them back. The Persians are being led by Artemisia (Eva Green), the naval war lord who continues to hammer at him brutally and relentlessly. It's enough plot to justify the violence but at the same time it doesn't have the same spirit that made ""300"" so enjoyable. There the focus was on Leonidas and his 300 Spartans prevailing against the odds at every turn to fight for what they believe in. But here, the story never brings any real purpose to the battle beyond defeating the bad guys. It really is just mindless violence, with no real purpose. Whilst Sullivan Stapleton does look the role with the right muscular form to seem like the warrior he needs to be, he's still not able to live up to Gerard Butler's performance as Leonidas in the first film. Whilst he's decent at being the generic tough warrior performance, he can't quite live up to Butler's energetic, over the top delivery that made the line 'This is Sparta!' such an internet sensation. He doesn't even have any personality beyond being a generic action hero. However, this film does introduce a greater villain than its predecessor. Possibly to combat some of the misogynistic elements of the original graphic novel and first film, we get an introduction to Eva Green as the Femme Fatale of the film. Whilst she's not up there with the best femme fatales like Barbara Stanwyck in ""Double Indemnity"", she's still the most interesting character of the film, receiving a dark back-story where she was born Greek, but defected to the Persian armies after her family is murdered. Not only is she a deadly warrior, but also is incredibly smart and knows how to use her sexuality as a weapon.When it comes down to it the most important part of the film are its action sequences. And unfortunately this is really where the film falls short. Whilst it does try to copy the graphic novel look that Snyder went for the first film, it's far less successful here. The cool dark visuals used in the first film are replaced here with some weak murky visuals that end up looking less like a graphic novel and more like a video game.It's director Murro also lacks the same directorial vision that made the battle's in Snyder's 300 so memorable. Many of his shots stick in mind due to their detail and execution with shot's like pushing the Persians off the cliff really sticking in memory. But even after just watching Rise of an Empire, it's tough to remember a single shot because it's all the action just blends together. Because of lacking any real memorability, anyone would be better off re-watching the first 300 than watching this disappointment of a sequel.",300 - Rise of an Empire
137,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,You Fight Harder Than You F*ck,4,10 July 2014,"I watch a film to be entertained, so giving this particular film a negative review based on historical inaccuracies is absolutely pointless. I'm a fan of the original film, but I found this 'sequel' quite dull. Let me try and explain that.The first film was implausible, highly unlikely, but it satisfied my survival instincts. Take 300 super-fighting machines, give them a tactical advantage and watch them defend against wave upon wave of attacks, gradually getting picked off, slowly getting weaker, ultimately getting defeated. That sense of survival until the last man was non-existent in this film, as though the troop could wander back inland or call the aid of Sparta, or whoever, at any minute.The film is pleasing to the eye and has many shocking moments and tense scenes, but it completely confused me. In a nutshell - abstract Greek legend fights, f*cks and then fights some more the p*ssed off conniving little sister of Xerxes, the God-king, while he, the God-king carries on with his plan of romping around Greece conquering, burning and raping everything in sight anyway.I didn't care for the sideshow plot, this strange sea-battle of a film, using the original 300 to attract audiences. Yes, the gore, action, effects and overall cinematography were mostly excellent, but the acting was tired and the casting of Eva Green - no, no, no - ""I am not here as a witness"" left me wincing, although I'm giving this an extra star for her wonderful full-frontal tits. Lena Headey was equally dull-as-ditch in the acting department, and worst of all, she did not show her tits.Churlishness aside, the original is very entertaining, but this is NOT.",300 - Rise of an Empire

139,stermix501,slight inaccurate but quite enjoyable,8,19 March 2014,"Seeing many people focusing on the historical side, I had to write a review. Everybody tends to forget that this is only a movie spawn after the success of 300 comic book. 300 as well as its sequel, is based on real events, but certainly are far from being a documentary. Greeks were renown for their heavy armors. Armors (almost from head to toe) that meant both protection and honor for their owners. Thanks to these (superiors to the Persian equivalents), but also because of their battle-ruses and self-sacrifice and heroism in battles, they were able to defeat the much larger and arrogant Persian army. The movie makers had no intention to write a history book, but made a plot somehow linked to its predecessor and used same and more advanced production design. The main characters were well played. Themistocles was depicted successfully, although one of his main (real) lines during the strategy decisions (""hit me, but let me speak"" when trying to convince other generals about sea-fights) was unfortunately not used. Artemisia who in reality was nothing less than the daughter of king of Halicarnassus (and not some poor child who lost her family from Greek army), was given a tragic reason to exist and Eva Green was excellent as bad kick-ass changing incredible costumes. The depiction of the sea-battles was quite inventive, but a bit simplified. Nevertheless, the main idea that the battle of Salamis and Themistocles had united the Greeks was true and nicely depicted (despite the Spartans' ships inaccuracy). All in all, I believe it is a fair and certainly spectacular result, while it induces the viewer to further historical research. Food for thought/research in a gory movie? what else could we ask for?",300 - Rise of an Empire
140,gerry_barnaby,This is a prequel / sequel mixed film that is outstanding,10,7 March 2014,"To understand this film ""Greece"" is under attack of Xerxes of Persia (ca. 480 BC). While Leonidas of Sparta is fighting in Battle of Thermopylae (""300""), Themistokles of Athens (Sullivan Stapleton) is preparing a sea battle at Salamis (this movie). Basically the first act of the film is a prequel in a way explaining Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) past & the second act is the sequel as Themistokles played by Sullivan Stapleton takes on the sea battle with Eva Greens character Artemisia. Don't expect deep historic drama here as this is not a history film that some people seem to mistake this film for, history is the wrong genre this film is. This is a graphic-novel art splendor and a strong sequel of 300. Highly entertained with amazing graphic art scenery and a high Asian Martial Art feel fight scenes, this is what Hollywood should take note at on how to make a sequel because this was nothing short of perfect with more blood scene than the first film. From the start this film throw you straight in to the action with bloody scene as well as the back story of Xerxes which is brilliant done as it plays as a prequel/sequel type of film which is cleverly done.Sullivan Stapleton as Themistokles did very well as the hero of the film, he wasn't like Gerard butlers role with Leonidas but very close with a different battle style of fighting which was brilliant on screen.Lena Headey reprise her role as Queen Gorgo was once again shown as a graceful power lady with vengeance i her heart she really show's this well on screen for a believe character,special with the fighting scenes (really live's up to the quote Leonidas said in the first film to xerxes ""clear you don't know spartan woman we should of sent them out here, they are more of a warrior then the men you sent out today"").Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes becoming the God King of Persia was brilliant done to give him more character & showing just how he became the god king which was amazing.Eva Green as Admiral Artemisia now this role was perfect for her acting, this is why Eva Green is a fantastic actress & has a on screen presences of that woe factor, the way is plays this role, strong like in Kingdom of Heaven she did, but with a cold ruthless nasty almost demonic nature like she would scarfice anyone to get victory she plays this role with flawless ease, its why i rate her one of the top 10 actress's around. 300: Rise of an empire lives up to the hype, its a must to watch, never have a seen a better squeal to a film than this one, normal when you get a sequel they end up poorly done or badly written but this film should stand in Hollywood on how to make a fantastic sequel, brilliant acting, brilliant fight scene, bloodier than the first film with a back story.Just an outstanding film. Dislikes : My only complaint about this film is the certification this film got in the cinema, the violence level, rape scene's & strong sexual scene, extreme bloody content of this film is Very R-Rated & should of been an 18 cert.",300 - Rise of an Empire
141,liderc,"Falcon Studios does ""real"" movies now?",1,18 March 2014,"I didn't know Falcon Studios wants to ""get real"" now - and brings all their actors along, too ;o)! Forget about history. Forget about silly details like wearing armour when you want to show off with all your great, hairless (!) bodies. Forget about the historical background, anyway, when you can fill the movie with great fights at sea including men wearing strange masks (were they Gangsta Rappers?).Oh, yes, and forget about scriptwriting, too. Porno actors aren't used to talking, probably this is why the main actor (Demostecles?) sounds like an angry plumber all the time - he looks like that, too. His strategic analysis was fascinating: ""The Persians are coming from the North and the South!"" *That* surely means trouble, and those Persians must be really clever to accomplish that! But as Eva Green says: ""The battle skills of the Athenians are creative!"" Her character must feel very creative, too, sitting on her throne as if she was wearing a fake penis secretly.*But* Eva Green not only is unusual and strikingly beautiful, she seemed to be the only professional actor in the movie, obviously having the time of her life skillfully overacting to be the b*tchiest b*tch of the Wild Sea. And her eyes are haunting. Her ""King"", though, was quite handsome as a human, but as a ""God"" he looked (and acted) like a transvestite high on a mix of steroids and crack. (Crack smoking probably ruined his voice, too.) Demostecles had this very hot guy around all the time, with long black hair and beard, but the character didn't do much than stand around like posing for erotic fotos and looking at his surroundings as if he was in deep pain - maybe he was the philosopher of the crowd. I actually think the only thing the ""director"" did was to tell his actors how to stand there to look sexy and how to look into the camera to look good. Well, as a porno director, I guess this is your daily business. He just didn't get it right with the ""good"" Queen, boy, was she ugly, and the actress performed like a salesgirl frustrated with her life. But that character had the strange line (near the beginning of the movie):""You've come a long way to stroke your cock watching your soldiers train"" (or something like that). That was completely out of place and didn't make any sense, but I guess the Falcon executives wanted to have it in the movie. Actually none of the good guys seemed to have a sex life (they are probably to young for that?), since also the sex scene with Eva Green looked like a weird soft porno on fast forward. (I actually expected *her* to d*ggy Demistocles.) They never really got their clothes of, anyway. Probably made for teenagers, as was the whole movie, I guess.Forget about it.

As time has went on and I understand that this is basically set at the exact same time Leonidas and the 300 were battling the Persians the better it became. I really wish they would've finished this story with one more movie, but I really doubt it with the mixed reviews of this one.",300 - Rise of an Empire
143,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn! review,3,6 March 2014,"I think almost everyone can agree that a sequel to 300 is completely unnecessary. However, deeming something unnecessary doesn't certainly make it bad. In an ideal world, one may even argue that a sequel to 300 might be a very good movie: considering how the original had its fair share of flaws, the sequel could easily eliminate these flaws, while still focusing on what made the original enjoyable. The only problem with that argument is that we don't live in a ideal world (actually, we live in a world where a big chunk of sequels are made exclusively for profit, not for improvement of the first installment) and that 300: Rise of an Empire is just a horrible movie, which everyone should skip.Calling 300: Rise of an Empire a sequel to 300 could be a misinterpretation. Rise of an Empire's plot timeline occurs before, during and after the original movie's timeline. The movie is narrated by King Leonidas' wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), who tells the story of an Athenian hero called Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton). Themistokles killed Xerxes' father Darius (Igal Naor) during the Battle of Marathon. Ten years after that event Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) decided to revenge his father and destroy all of Greece. This time Themistokles must stop the giant Persian navy lead by Xerxes' second in command, the menacing Artemisia (Eva Green). Even after just glancing at the movie's synopsis, it's very obvious that 300: Rise of an Empire's title doesn't make much sense. There are much more than 300 warriors in the movie (none of them Spartan) fighting the Persian hordes, and no empire is rising during the movie. There are some talks about uniting the Greek city-states, but that's about it.I know Rise of an Empire wanted to be connected to the original movie in some way, but throwing a bunch of out of place references definitely isn't the best possible way of obtaining that. Even the Persian emissary, who was famously kicked in the bottomless pit in the original, makes a cameo appearance. But in Rise of an Empire not only does he have nothing against women speaking in front of men, but he even plays an important role in Artemisia's military career. And speaking of continuity errors – Queen Gorgo's narration doesn't make much sense since the movie portrays some situations in which she clearly didn't participate; and not only that, but there were also some flashbacks in the movie, which weren't her own! Continuity errors and plot holes similar to these two (there are much more) quickly destroy any suspension of disbelief and ultimately ruin the movie-going experience. I'm thoroughly aware that some people could label this plot hole criticism as simple nitpicking, but Rise of an Empire also fails in many other aspects, not only in delivering a coherent plot.Rise of an Empire has all the flaws the original one had, without any of its charm or virtues. The characters in Rise of an Empire are even less developed than they were in the original (believe it or not!) and the slow motion is as abused as ever. The man who replaced Zack Snyder in the director' chair, Noam Murro (who only directed one movie before this), struggles between ripping off Snyder's visual style and finding his own voice. The ultimate result of this painful struggle is a bland, boring and uninspiring movie, which does almost nothing spectacular. Some action sequences (especially the ones of naval battles) looked decent but everything fell apart when the fake CGI blood (which looked like something created in Microsoft paint) started spraying around. The two leads, Sullivan Stapleton and Eva Green, do their best to save this movie, but even their combined forces aren't enough to make Rise of an Empire a watchable movie. In the end, it's not the lack of coherent plot that made me hate Rise of an Empire, nor the awful special effects, nor the non-existent character development; what made me hate it is the possibility of another sequel.Rating: 3/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",300 - Rise of an Empire
144,caseymoviemania,"A surprisingly better-than-expected, if flawed follow-up to Zack Snyder's 300.",7,5 March 2014,"When Zack Snyder's 300 was screened back in 2006, the effects-heavy ancient epic was one-of-a-kind cinematic experience. It became such a beloved fan-favorite movie that many filmmakers tried to imitate the similar stylized technique (e.g. the super slow-motion, actors and props against computer-generated background, CGI blood-and-gore) with varying degree of success. Now, in this long-gestating sequel/side-quel, I originally never expected much from 300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE. After all, I thought the movie will be probably more of the same. However, upon finally watching the movie at the exclusive IMAX 3D sneak preview, I was surprised that the movie lives up beyond my low expectation.WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE tells the other side of the story where Greek general Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) leads his army against Artemisia (Eva Green) on a naval battle by the sea, while King Leonidas (Gerard Butler, only appeared in recycled footage from 300) and his Spartan warriors engaged in their ill-fated battle against King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and his Persian army on the land.THE GOOD STUFFPrior to 300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE, veteran Israeli commercials director-turned-feature filmmaker Noam Murro only has the 2008's dramedy, SMART PEOPLE to his credit. However, Murro manages to handle his first big budget studio production like a seasoned pro. Here, Murro proves to be an accomplished visual stylist like Zack Snyder himself (who only returned as one of the screenwriters and producers) after all. With the help of cinematographer Simon Duggan, Murro successfully recreates Snyder's stylized display of slow-motion violence and gore while his mix of fluid and gritty camera-work are put into good use. Thanks also to Murro's energetic direction, the action scenes -- especially the one involved the naval battle -- are electrifying. Other technical credits, including Junkie XL's throbbing score with a dash of sizzling Middle Eastern beat, are equally first-rate.Zack Snyder's and Kurt Johnstad's screenplay is effective, especially the way it juggles between the main premise surrounding the naval engagement and several flashbacks/backstories without making them heavy-handed.Cast-wise, Rodrigo Santoro is typically imposing as the ruthless King Xerxes while Lena Headey made adequate use of her limited screen time as Queen Gorgo. But it was Eva Green who steals the show with her wicked performance as Artemisia. In fact, it's simply refreshing to see a female actor commands the screen in this otherwise male-dominated movie.MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)The scene where Themistocles and his Greek army manage to outwit Artemisia and her crew by making their ships stumbled between the rocks, and another one where Artemisia stages a brilliant plan by creatively using oil to trap and blow up Themistocles' ships (you simply have to see it for yourself). Both of these well-staged strategies are particularly fascinating to watch for.MOST MEMORABLE QUOTEQueen Gorgo: You've come a long way to stroke your cock while real men train!THE BAD STUFFThe absence of Gerard Butler is sorely missed in 300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE (his character is supposed to be featured here in the original script, but forced to cut out because Butler declined to return). After all, his iconic role as the fearless Spartan leader King Leonidas is simply unforgettable. But all can be forgiven if a new leading role is engaging enough to carry the movie. Unfortunately, Australian actor Sullivan Stapleton isn't really the one. Although he has the impressive physique, Stapleton looks somewhat bland and noticeably lack of rugged charm and commanding presence that Butler previously displayed very well in 300.But the major flaw here is the anticlimactic finale that ends abruptly before the credit rolls. I mean, is it really necessary to make way for an open ending?FINAL WORDSFor those who are disappointed with the lackluster results of recent ancient epic failures (THE LEGEND OF THE HERCULES, POMPEII), 300: RISE OF AN EMPIRE proves that this particular genre can stand tall if done right.",300 - Rise of an Empire
145,vistheindian,A respectable addition to the 300 universe,7,8 March 2014,"Now I am a big fan of the original 300. I even read the comic before the original movie came out and loved how Zack Snyder brought every panel of the comic to life on the big screen. So going into 300: Rise of an Empire (RoaE) I was a bit skeptical especially because it was not directed by Zack Snyder. Instead we have Noam Murro in the director's seat, who's only notable feature film, Smart People, was mediocre at best. Also, he hasn't directed action! However, I have to say he has done a great job in keeping the tone and style consistent with the original 300. The cinematography from the battle sequences to the dramatic scenes were aesthetically beautifully done.I HAVE TO mention the performances of Sullivan Stapleton as Themistokles and Eva Green as Artemisia. To start Themistokles, his character was portrayed very well by Stapleton. He is a strong willed, honorable character willing to sacrifice anything for his people. While I don't think his performance was as memorable as Gerard Butler as Leonidas, Stapleton did a good job in making us, the audience, care about him and his struggles. The highlight of this movie by far has to be Eva Green's performance as Artemisia. She just owns every scene that she is in. Calling her profanities starting with the letters B and C, does not do justice to describe her character (no offense intended). You KNOW immediately never to cross or disappoint her. Eva Green did an incredible job, you as audience will love to hate her. After all, that is what we want from a great villain.So the negatives, well it mostly comes down to the story. It just isn't anything special, but most of us should be fully aware that story is not the point of the movie, it's more the action and characters that are the focus. However, I do find it interesting how they wove the story in with the original movie by showing the events that happened before, during, and after 300. But, I want to make it clear that you don't need to watch 300 to follow what's going on in 300: RoaE. Another weak point I have to say is that the character Xerxes was underutilized. Although we get to learn more about him and his past, he is not directly involved in any of the events of 300: RoaE. That is okay though, because the presence of Artemisia more than made up for it.All in all this was a respectable and enjoyable addition to the universe of 300. I'd recommend it to anyone who was fan of the original or just overall fans of well-choreographed, cinematic action. Enjoy!",300 - Rise of an Empire

147,The_moan_of_all_moans,Worst sequel ever?,2,9 March 2014,"As the credits began to roll, i sat for a moment, allowing it all to sink in. Had i just witnessed the most disappointing sequel ever? I had not felt this disheartened by a sequel since ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" Like ""The Matrix"", ""300"" for me was excellent; groundbreaking. Fresh and original. And then instead of leaving it as is, they decide to bring in the cash cow and milk it dry. I loved ""300""; the action was engrossing, the story was compelling, it was an instant classic. And i never wanted to hear the announcement of an unnecessary sequel. My gut churned when i heard it. But i never thought in my worst nightmares that it would be as bad as it was. The trailer baits you in, with what seemed a promising plot. And left intrigue. By the end of the film it is clear that it was nothing more than a cheap ruse.The film is all over the place. All this films does is take everything that made the first film great and urinate all over it. The slow motion kills are done to death....within the first 10 minutes. It contained more speeches than the Oscars. It was like a game of battleships (though i would replace the p with a more appropriate t). And between the over the top action sequences they would stand like Hercules and pose..constantly. Then there's the blood......In what can only be described as small versions of The Smoke from ""Lost"". Maybe done to cater to 3D, but from the very first kill it was so idiotic and made it look extremely cheap. Some of the scenes are atrociously acted. Was sometimes like they where reading their lines from a placard.The big problem with the film is that is so evident, from the announcement it was to be made, that it was going to try and ride the coat tails of the first film. Cling on for dear life to the actual 300, to the success of the first film. And it showed. It was like ""Bourne Legacy"" trying to stand on its own without Jason Bourne. If it was its own film it would be one of the worst films ever. But they have the ability to constantly reference Leonidas, even, in a sign of desperation, show Leonidas on several occasions. At one point Themistokles seeks him out. But instead talks to everyone else in Sparta apart from Leonidas. Pointless one would say. The film lacks the passion, the originality and the spirit from the first film. And yet again another moneymaker that chooses to replace those characteristics with an overexposure of mimicking and a soul-less display of film making.",300 - Rise of an Empire
148,TheNabOwnzz,Feminist garbage,1,20 July 2018,"The original 300 was admittedly not a movie worth mentioning, and thus my expectations were pretty low going in to see this sequel. However, that masculinity that was so admirable was gone from the sequel, and instead we get a kind of SJW motion picture in which the men are wimps and the females the 'tough guys', resulting in one of the most ridiculous feminist pieces of propaganda ever created.Ofcourse since the sequel is made in a more modern era of 'Toxic masculinity' and 'Strong female characters', the character or Artemisia ( Eva Green ) & the drastic character change of Queen Gorgo ( Lena Headey, who is also now seemingly superhuman in fighting abilities, which is something that is quite out of character for her after the original film ) were made purely to please the SJW crowd. That masculinity of the original is gone and instead every male character in the movie is a pawn that is being used by both women characters. The ridiculous shots of the sixpack abs are still there, but for some reason all these seemingly 'Manly men' are ridiculed and executed by Artemisia even though she stands a couple of feet below most of them in height, and barely weighs anything. Furthermore, her command with all the males blindly obeying her in genuine fear of her is utterly ridiculous. Why would these men fear this puny woman, it makes little sense. Eva Green is not really to blame for this, as it isn't her fault, but her role simply isn't written for a female. All the male characters are utterly useless, and this basically results in a disgusting anti-male garbage piece of feminism propaganda. Combine this with Gorgo who uses all of Sparta and its gullible and weak willed males to avenge her dead husband, and what we have here is a picture that confuses its genders in a ridiculous manner.Gerard Butler might have been miscast in the original, but there is no doubt that after witnessing Themistokles ( Sullivan Stapleton ) in the lead that this picture basically screams for his return. Stapleton has very little emotional range, and his character is a complete pushover. ( Take the 'rape' scene with Artemisia for example, what a ridiculous bunch of nonsensical women empowerment propaganda that was once again ) The 'manly' mannerisms of Leonidas are gone, and this picture sorely misses his presence, since Themistokles is barely even a presence. There is very little useful dialogue, and once again no sub text or a clear moral message, purely blind feminist entertainment. The action scenes are absolutely horrendously bad, as most of the blood coming from victims literally look even worse than in the original, with the blood looking like fake plastic with a red dye. Many of the action scenes seem like complete CGI, and not very good CGI either. The result is it looks like some kind of brainless videogame created in 1998. The grainy and colorless cinematography of the original returns, except since the sequel is mostly at sea, it is even darker than the original, which results in even few colors. The sea battles are filmed under overly artificial backdrops and lighting once again and never in these scenes do you get the idea that this world feels like it is real. Music is extremely out of place most of the time and doesn't fit in with the kind of picture this is supposed to be. Like in 300, the fighting scenes also focus solely on the main character in question, and never show what enemies are doing, because all that it is interested in is showing what a great bunch of moves the characters in question have ( Mainly Themistokles, who was a gigantic wimp, but somehow fights like a madman ). This means the fighting is only there for the sake of showing some fine choreography because we do not actually see what happens to most of the enemies ( Should take some notes from Seven Samurai (1954) on how to create MEANINGFUL fighting scenes, as every hit of the main character is followed by a cut of an enemy hitting the ground, instead of just focusing on useless choreography of a single character. )Ultimately 300: Rise of an Empire is once again a pointless movie, with nothing relevant to say, except to further shove feminism down the viewers throat, as if that wasn't happening enough already these days.",300 - Rise of an Empire

The idea was also simple, die for freedom no matter what, and there was a decidedly fascistic character to it which both repelled and attracted at the same time, all creating an over the top in your face experience which even ""Wolf of Wall Street"" cannot match.Another good thing about it was that it introduced a lot of people to an area of history which they probably didn't know about and hopefully pricked an interest in the subject. The rest of the Greco-Persian war was fascinating and full of incident and adventure, so there were plenty of places where the writers could go. The most obvious was of course the Battle of Salamis, which was happening at the exact same time on sea and led by the Athenians under Themistocles, and which helped turn the tide (eventually) in the Greeks favour. I confess as a lover of history that I was really looking forward to seeing Salamis get the '300' treatment, especially when Queen Artemisia appeared in the trailers played by Eva Green. Then we saw the film.It fits itself around ""300"" rather like ""Pulp Fiction"" or the ""Three Colours"" trilogy did with each of their separate but linked tales, featuring cameos and glimpsed moments. However a big problem is that the film is at once too historically accurate and ridiculously incorrect and off the mark! Too accurate in that it follows the events around the battle of Thermopylae and supposes a knowledge of them to an audience which probably doesn't have any, resulting in a timeline and chain of events which look confused and disjointed. Who is Themistocles? Why do Athens and Sparta hate each other so much? What was the dream of a united Greece? What was the race against time to stop Xerxes and what did it depend on? All are touched upon but never really explained, so the stakes, the motivations and the bigger picture are all lost. In their place they have put a rather hackneyed soap opera of personal revenge and lust where Themistocles kills King Darius with an arrow at Marathon but didn't finish off his vengeful son Xerxes (WTF?) Also Artemisia is no longer a Queen and willing ally of Xerxes but a former Greek captive whose family was slain and then gang raped until left for dead where she was saved by the very same Nubian messenger/general that Leonidas famously kicked down the pit (not such a bad guy after all here as depicted here..) who trained her up to be Darius's head general (WTF x2??) She then convinces Xerxes to fight the war and turns him into the golden giant we know and love through a quarter-assed ceremony of underwhelming proportions. Lording over the entire Persian navy single handily but sadly lacking a Persian cat to stroke, she is determined to get revenge on 'the Greeks' (never mind that no such idea existed outside of a circle of philosophers like Themistocles at this time) After countless reverses (which are historically accurate, including the circle of ships formation and the luring into the narrow rocks) she invites Themistocles over for a congress of the sexual kind, with Green replaying her famous 'Dark Shadows' moment almost beat for beat minus Barry White. This failed he goes to convince Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey again) to join the fight, which she only does at the last second because it's more dramatic that way. Sad to say that although we've watched some sparring and skirmishing, the actual epic battle of Salamis which Herotodus so brilliantly retold doesn't happen because before you can say ""Desolation of Smaug"" the film ENDS just as its &^%$& starting! Acting wise, Sullivan Stapleton is OK if bland as the hero. It's obvious he is meant to be the 'anti-Leonidas' to emphasise the Democratic- Fascistic divide, but here is just too weak and indecisive. The real Themistocles was a giant among men, not a hamster. Rodrigo Santoro appears both as the real historical Xerxes (looking very good) and then the mythological one (not so good) but he again is a presence in the background. Heady represents Spartan heroism in a dress and actually wields a sword this time. The rest is the Eva Green show starring Eva Green. She looks the part, exotic and athletic, but this Artemisia is a re-run of 'Dark Shadows"" Angela Bouchard, pantomime level villainy and hip swinging scenery chewing, and both are equally faithful to their original incarnations, but in the absence of any other star power or charisma here she runs away with the film and doesn't give it back. Junkie XL's score is also fantastic, dramatic and epic and stirring in a way the film itself rarely is.Part of a wider franchise being planned, this is probably just a curtain raiser to future episodes. It's not ""300"" and it's not meant to be. An entertaining 'peplum' in itself, it falls short only because of its illustrious and unique predecessor.PS – What happened to the galleys? The ships here look like Dutch canal barges with oars!! Nice to see the Hellespont bridge get a mention, but the oracle's prophecy, Xerxes uncle and his vision, the rest of Greece and Sparta's second king are alas absent.",300 - Rise of an Empire
151,StonedMagician,Above Average: 6.5,6,29 July 2019,"The first 300 is famous for being one of the most divisive films in history, polarizing critics with its sumptuous visuals, relentless violence, and dubious script. Now, the better part of a decade later, the series is back, and it hasn't changed much at all. If you enjoyed the original, you'll probably like this one. If not, steer clear. That said, I enjoyed Rise of an Empire more than its predecessor, for two main reasons. The first is that I didn't know how it would end. Even before 300 came out, people knew about Thermopylae and the futile last stand that happened there. It made it too difficult to invest in the characters, and essentially forced me to sit drumming my fingers until their inevitable death. This was, fortunately, not the case here. The second reason is Eva Green. Best known for her breakout role in 2006's Casino Royale, her performance in Rise of an Empire ranges from terrifyingly understated to unintentionally comic, and steals the spotlight at every opportunity. But even she cannot hold up this movie by herself, since the film, for all its merits, relies on little more than its visual effects and art direction.",300 - Rise of an Empire
152,YJLcool,"A film that neither satisfies or disappoints, a companion piece to 300",7,11 March 2014,"300: Rise of an Empire serves as a companion piece or a combination of 'prequel, midquel and sequel in one film' for 300. The film provides a cast of new characters, with Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) and Artemisia (Eva Green) as the new leads, as well as a brief back-story for Xerxes, the 'God-King' of Persia.The Battle of Thermopylae in 300 where King Leonidas and his Spartan warriors fight to their death against King Xerxes' Persian army happens when Themistocles, Greek general is leading his army against Artemisia, Persian Navy commander on a naval battle. The film further expands the 300 mythology, provides a deeper understanding of what really happened in its entirety.The film does a good job in capturing the over-the-top, yet distinctive, slow-motion style of the first film. The violent 'slo-mo' battle scenes looks spectacular, seemingly allows the audience to indulge themselves in the mayhem, but the technique is overused many times in recent films that it doesn't feel as exciting as before, which is 7 years ago. Furthermore, the special effects team seems to overdo the CGI blood squirt to the point that it feels artificial on screen.The male lead character in the film is rather 'weak'. The character of Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) is rather bland and lacks the iconic look or screen presence of King Leonidas (Gerard Butler). The loud cry by Gerard Butler's Leonidas: ""This is SPARTA!!!"" while delivering a kick to the Persian messenger to fall in a bottomless pit in 300 still remains the most iconic scene in the franchise. Although the Greek general managed to employ some clever battle strategies to outwit the Persians, but it's nothing we haven't seen before...Anyone who's interested in war battle strategies should watch Red Cliff (Part 1 & 2), which is based on the Battle of Red Cliffs from Records of the Three Kingdoms of China. On the other hand, Eva Green provided a superb performance and lasting impression as Artemisia, who dominates whenever she appears on screen. Overall, the film does not exceed expectation. It's just delivers exactly what's expected of it. The open ending suggests another sequel to conclude the mythology of '300'. Rating: 7/10Note: (For girls) The Greek men in this film are not as perfectly ripped and muscular as the Spartans in 300.",300 - Rise of an Empire
153,Tender-Flesh,"I'm coining the new term ""Concurquel""",8,7 March 2014,"I'm coining the new term ""Concurquel"" to describe this movie. It deftly weaves its narrative before, during, and after the events of the original 300 film. It's neither a true sequel nor a true prequel. I'd like to see more movies follow this pattern.Beginning the with rise of Xerxes and how he came to power, the film allows Xerxes to retain the original 300 as his movie, and Artemisia takes the reigns for this film. Eva Green is evil and exquisite as the ""former"" Greek, Artemisia, hell-bent on watching Athens burn after her family suffered at the hands of the Hoplites. Whereas 300 was a land battle with slight references to the navy, 300 ROAE is pretty much all naval fighting, but don't let that make you think there is no hand-to-hand. There's enough to spare. Heavy on CGI blood and slow motion, if you didn't like 300, you won't like ROAE.I found Sullivan Stapleton to much less charismatic than Gerard Butler, but he still carries the film well enough, though I keep thinking of Simon Pegg each time I see him.Absent from this film are the strange monsters and giants of the first film, except for a brief glimpse of some unusual sea life which could merely be part of a hallucination. I know the first film got some grief for including those types of creatures, so this leaves it up to you whether these sea baddies are real or not.I didn't find the 3D to be spectacular, so unless you just have to see things that are available in 3D, then 2D is acceptable.Stapleton and Green have plenty of chemistry and their meeting aboard the battle barge is memorable.I hope there will be a third movie if there is enough material, but I don't want to wait 5 years to get it. Everyone will have to get that CGI makeover and that's just not worth it.",300 - Rise of an Empire
154,georgecoffeynewyorker,Music score just wow,7,15 March 2014,"I enjoyed the movie emmensley. A bit too bloody for my liking, but what drew me back for a seconda time was the musical score. I just had to hear the drums. It was fantastic. I asked others of the gorup I was with, what did they think of the first movie: ""300"". They preferred the first one. So bottomline, Its best to see the first one, to get the connection. When I saw the movie the second time, with my friend, I began to connect the missing pieces. So the plot I can now safely give you all is very simple. Greece V Persia(Old name of Iran - I think). The actual sex scene, I feel could have been let out compeltly. No need for it at all for a movie let alone a war movie. I had the hots for the character(Of which I couldn't get the name). I IMDBed it to find it was Jack O' Connell who played him. As one of the movie reviewer puts it, There is a lot of ""testosterone"". Oh boy there was every truth to it.",300 - Rise of an Empire

156,JohnnyPHreak,"This ""side-quel"" delivers in spades",8,23 March 2014,"My first thoughts about a sequel to 300 were no. I'm always no to any sequel that doesn't have the lead actors, writer or director attached. I have now trusted Zack Snyder after he gave me the Superman movie I always wanted. When he and Frank Miller were announced as producers a little hope came back to me. But I'm more of a skeptic. I still had qualms about a sequel to one of my favorite cult classics in a while. I was wrong about this sequel. I was surprisingly dead wrong which makes me a happy film fanatic. The term thrown around with this film is ""side-quel"" , an accurate description of the plot. For the first the first hour this film takes places during the events of the first 300. And actually the story jumps forward, backward and all around. The main plot revolves around Xerxes moving his attack forward to to destroy his enemies with his main opposition being Greek general Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton). An early attack results in the death of a someone very close to Xerxes which develops into the evolution of who he becomes in 300. But let's forget that for now because that's not what this movie is. This movie is stolen by Eva Green's portrayal of Persian naval commander Artemisia. She is Xerxes' right hand and his assassin. She's vile, brutal, intelligent, vicious and tactical. Green chews the scenes like a champ. And I in my opinion when she's not on screen the film at moments drags. If I could make it fact that she has to be in every good action movie from now on I would. When this hits Blu-Ray/DVD she should become a villain icon. It almost seems effortless how villainous she is. It's a bit over the top at times but she doesn't fall of the cliff; just stands at the edge making you want more screen time for her. Sullivan Stampleton as Themistocles is the lead but then he isn't. His performance is subtle but strong. It's not like the rock star action hero turning performance that Gerard Butler put in as Leonidas. Thermistocles is smart, very tactical and handles everything that comes at him. He just is out shined by Eva Green. Which isn't all bad. When they are both on screen together it's great. And there is a sex scene that will make the infamous pool scene in Showgirls look tame. They have a final battle that is great an example of (finally) a well shot, American fight scene. The action is intense with director Noam Murro and his crew not editing the film to death. He also jacks Zack Synder's style to only positive results. The seas battles are cool in scope but it's the hand to hand battles is where the action excels. The scenes are brutal and excessively violent. The choreography brought me back to that of The Raid. Long extended shots where people are just battling to the death. And the blood is splattered all over the camera. This is the best example of CGI/FX blood I've seen in a film. If all CGI blood and gore looked like this I would have no issues with films utilizing it more. There are only two complaints I would lump on this second film in the series. Lena Headey is one of the few and the most important character to come back and she isn't given much screen time. Her story runs it course in the first film that is understandable. But a scene or two of her more would have pleased me. She is given a nice action set piece near the very end of the film. There is a father/son side story with Scyllias (Callan Mulvey) Thermistocles' third in command and his son Caslisto played by the gorgeous Jack O'Connell. Given two more dramatic scenes I would have bought and enjoyed their story more. When something happens in their story to change their dynamic it seems rushed and phony. Fans of the first film will enjoy all the nods and cameos. As a whole 300: Rise of an Empire this stands on it's own very well. With the ending leading to a possible third film which if it is anything like this ""side-quel"" I'll be happy. I was hoping that I enjoy this second film in the series half as much as I enjoy the first. It turns out that I enjoyed it much more than that. I can see myself come back to this film for years to come like I've done with the first film. That seems like an excellent compliment in my book.",300 - Rise of an Empire
157,sohansurag,Over-Ambitious yet Entertaining!,7,19 April 2014,"Zack Snyder's 2006 fantasy action film 300 set a milestone for how good a VFX-centric movie can get. It was nothing short of epic and its adherence to its source material, Frank Millers' 1998 graphic novel 300, was unsurpassable. Just like Sin City, each frame from the graphic novel was adapted to the movie flawlessly. In many ways 300, the movie, helped Snyder's footing in Hollywood as a visual director and along with Frank's story it was one of the best movies of the year. It has been 8 years since 300s release and the studios noticed that the franchise still had some juice left in it. Time to milk it dry!Enter 300 Rise of An Empire, a sort of side-quel for the masterpiece that was 300. Based on an unreleased graphic novel by Frank Miller, Rise of an Empire unfolds a story that happened parallely and beyond 300. It takes place in the same quasi-fantasy Greece that 300 brought to life, taking into account the events of 300 and the demise of King Leonidas. Its difficult to tag it a sequel as it touches upon everything from the origins of Xerxes to the death of Leonidas and events that happened in between. Drenched in a blue hue, as opposed to the original's golden hue, Rise of an Empire tells the story of Themistocles and his battle with the Persian forces, how his failed attempt at uniting the self- preservation-centric Spartan forces and leading on the battle himself with his small group of soldiers.Sullivan Stapleton ain't no Gerard Butler but he does a decent job. But the speeches and pep talks that he gave wouldn't even come close to its predecessors'. Having Leonidas pack that much wanted energy in 300 could be at blame for Stapleton's rather less charismatic role here. The imminent comparison cant be overlooked. A lusciously evil Eva Green plays Artemisia, the ruthless warrior and the Persian king's most trusted. There's one particular scene where she makes out with a severed head and if that ain't enough of her nefariousness, I don't know what else counts as EVIL. I felt she was the character the kept the narrative moving. Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes makes a comeback and his origins was one of the more novel sequences of the movie.300 Rise of an Empire does a solid job with its direction and narrative. Visually the movie was as arresting as the original. It makes for a great IMAX experience as I had missed 300 at the time of its release. But I don't know if it was the casting or the forced-sequel storyline, Rise of an Empire felt more like a TV movie albeit shot on ARRI and Panavision camera and allotted a generous budget for VFX. While the gratuitous blood and gore was retained, thanks to the Indian censor board, many scenes were mercilessly chopped off. These scenes were essentially, what would have made a 300 movie and to watch it without it, makes it kind of bland.Initially what felt like taking cues from Man of Steel, the score's thumps and drumrolls were instantly familiar. It was only after the credits rolled in, I realized that it was Junkie XL who composed it. I suppose the choice was obvious as this guy previously worked in God Of War series as well. Who else would fit best for a Greek epic? It was enjoyable as the the music felt intensely pumping along with the visuals.Directed by a lesser known Noam Murro, 300 Rise of an Empire is a well made movie, true to its predecessor but does it push the envelope? No! Instead it treads on the fine path that the original laid out. And it rather tries too hard to be so. Was it disappointing? Given that I went in with less hopes of being entertained, I was surprised at how much I liked it. I may forget 300 Rise of an Empire in a couple of days but that's where 300 had won.",300 - Rise of an Empire

However, surprisingly this movie delivers much of the same type of movie while not seeming repetitive. Unlike the original 300, in which Gerard Butler's King Leonidas was the standout performance, in this case it is definitely Eva Green's character. Apart from her, the next most impressive performances were Lena Heady and then Sullivan. Although I didn't see the first 300 in theatres, this definitely had the same highly stylized filming techniques which made for an excellent movie theatre experience. As long as you don't think too hard about the logic and just sit back and listen to rousing battle speeches and watch the cool fight scenes, it is impossible not to enjoy yourself.",300 - Rise of an Empire
159,stephenlovelette,Much Better than Anticipated,7,31 August 2014,"When it comes to expectation, Rotten Tomatoes established a new dynamic.Although I only made the realization days ago, I've been a long-time fan of Frank Miller adaptations, loving both Sin City (2005) and 300 (2006) in the theater.Since its early March release, 300: Rise of an Empire is certifiably rotten with a critic percentage in the low forties. So I skipped it.Despite a similar Tomato rating, I saw Sin City: A Dame to Kill For the day after it hit theaters and couldn't shake the disappointment/frustration for a few days.Fast forward to yesterday, when I realize Frank Miller's other sequel is available through Xfinity OnDemand via HD rental for $3.99. I'd totally forgotten it existed.Neither my time, nor money went to waste.300: Rise of an Empire is very good.The co-starring antagonist role, Artemisia, is played by Eva Green. Artemisia is vastly different from Ava Lord, her character from Sin City: AD2K4.She's more, ahem, sympathetic.Green's slightly less nude, as well, though I don't believe there's a correlation.Eva is top notch. Artemisia is easily 300 Part Deux's greatest redeeming quality, and I said the same thing about Ava Lord in the sequel to Sin City.Apparently Green is excellent in any badass female role written by Frank Miller.Let's hope we see more out of her in the future!The same goes for Lena Headey, one of my favorite actresses, who reprises a supporting role as Gorgo. Just like David Wenham as Dilios (Leonidas's one-eyed loyalist), she doesn't disappoint.Love that Lena Headey. She's a 'Grade A' thespian.One strong aspect of the story is how clearly it overlaps with that of its predecessor. The interaction with the timeline from 300 is never obscure to the viewer.Clarity has its downsides however. The director recycles bits of footage from the first movie, which always feels like a cop-out. He doesn't stop there, even reusing original footage introduced in the sequel.That's the one-two punch of fair criticism that overlaps with Sin City: AD2K4, wherein footage is also recycled.It's a near-certainty this film would be great had it been directed by Zack Snyder.The writing is very strong. The action takes place at sea and furthers the original narrative, while building the larger world of the story. It's good stuff!The battles are epic and beautifully rendered. The CGI's not perfect, especially when there's a horse on-ship, but it's easily ignored.The outro credits are fun, but there's no stinger after they start rolling.Overall, 300: Rise of an Empire isn't bad by any means.With strong performances from a solid (albeit lesser known) cast, I'd say it doesn't disappoint!To bring it back around: I think this reaction's noteworthy in contrast to the lingering sadness I felt about Sin City: AD2K4.Perhaps much-anticipated sequels received with critical disfavor are best left on the backburner until becoming available as a rental. That way, reality can set in, and expectations are appropriately leveled.By this logic, if Dumb & Dumbr To receives a R.T. percentage in the mid-forties, I should skip it and wait on the rental.Or otherwise expect severe disappointment, right?",300 - Rise of an Empire
160,andreascaloni,BLOODY FUN,7,22 February 2021,"300: Rise of an Empire is not a follow-up but a 'side-sequel'. Set before, during and after Sparta's last stand, this is the same war on another front, a maritime duel between Sullivan Stapleton's heroic Themistokles and Eva Green's psychotic Artemisia. This 'side-sequel' is an adrenaline blast of bloody fun. It is really entertaining but it doesn't improve the semplicity of the plot's first movie.

161,Maladjusted_1,'Meet the Spartans' might be the better film. I mean it.,3,19 May 2015,"In '300: Rise of an Empire', Sullivan Stapleton delivers a competent performance, but his Themistocles lacks the natural ferocity that defined Gerard Butler's Leonidas. Eva Green outperformed the protagonist, but her solid approach to her role just served to highlight how shallow and boring the character of Artemisia is. Queen Gorgo, the widow of Leonidas, was written in a way which more or less failed to justify the return of Lena Headey, one of the better performers in the film. Rodrigo Santoro's Xerxes was, like Artemisia, given a cringing backstory, and 'Rise of an Empire' managed to inflict far greater injuries on the character than King Leonidas ever could. The vast majority of the film felt like snippets from an 'Assassin's Creed' trailer, in which the focal characters hack and slash their way through droves of faceless enemies with finesse and valour. Sadly, that kind of thing works best with a games controller in hand; and the slow-motion, high- definition cuts and spear-thrusts become tedious to watch after the first battle. (And if you're watching 'Rise of an Empire' straight after '300' in some sort of masochistic marathon, the chances are you're already tired of it.) The ""drama"" was subpar and just served to demarcate the interminable series of fights, and one of the only upsides of 'Rise of an Empire' was seeing the return of the Gollum/John Malkovich hybrid. Overall, this was a very disappointing film, and I'd seriously consider nominating 'Meet the Spartans' as the official '300' sequel in place of this.",300 - Rise of an Empire

166,supatube,Vulgarity vs. Romance.,8,5 March 2014,"""300: Rise of an Empire"" will be no surprise in delivery other than it is possibly better than the first? There will, still, be fight scenes reminiscent of flawless dance moves, and the great choreography is what lends the film to being a great 'dance' movie (hello Step-Up 3hundred). The difference in approach comparatively between the two films would be the perverse nature of the second's delivery of the story at hand. The first had a far more romantic predisposition.The story is more or less the same - Persians are descending onto Greece and taking over. The epicenter for the second take on the Persian take over is Athens and its people. The men are not as perfectly ripped as the Spartans. The soldiers are made up of various sized men (but there's still a great amount of shiny muscle) and not nearly as romantic in appearance as the perfect Spartans.The sex scene is more sadomasochistic and less love making. The passion between ""King Leonidas"" and his queen in ""300"" is filled with affection and attachment whereas the scene in ""300: Rise of an Empire"" is riddled with force, power and control. The sexual tension in both scenes are similar in sexual tension but both portray a very different tone, one more romantic than the other.The lighting is impeccable and the story lent well to the way in which the 3D was utilized. Instead of aspects 'popping' out at you they seemed to go deep. The landscapes had so much depth that it was hard not to make the correlation between the depth ""300: Rise of an Empire"" was reaching to in terms of the Persian take over. As it was not the next installment of ""300"" but more insight into the original story, as the story goes deeper than Sparta and the army of 300. Eva Green is outrageously good and compelling to watch and to some degree is the ""Leonidas"" of ""Rise of an Empire"". Not to say that Sullivan Stapelton was overshadowed but his role was more meticulous and thought out, very much like the Queen in ""300"". The two pull the opposite sides of a war story firmly together. Not to mention how smoking hot both of them are.Like the first, ""Rise of an Empire"" is undoubtedly clothed in beauty, from the moonlighting to the muscled bodies, the supple breasts to the eloquent sprays of blood, the film is about an aesthetic which is part of the story. Is it masking a lack of story? definitely not, it is the story. ""300"" was ground breaking at the time of release, ""Rise of an Empire"" merely perfects that first step into a world of a different, and maybe more enigmatic, way of story telling. 7.5/10",300 - Rise of an Empire
167,TheMovieSnob247,Rise of an Empire is a visual treat but lacks the novelty and impact of the original.,6,24 June 2014,"After seeing the fairly lukewarm reception by critics and viewers alike, I wasn't terribly excited to see this. But I really enjoyed 300 (especially after subsequent viewings when I stopped comparing it to Gladiator), so I figured I'd take the plunge and hope for the best. While it's definitely flawed, I think the critics were a bit harsh on it. Rise of an Empire tells the story of the Greek General Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) and his men as they attempt to thwart the advance of Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and his Persian army on a new battlefront: the Sea. As the battle rages, Themistokles realizes that his resistance may be futile as the Persians can send wave after wave of attacks until they are defeated. To save Greece from the massive forces of Xerxes, he must convince Greece's rival states to unite before it's too late, but Xerxes's cunning commander Artemesia (Eva Green) will employ all her wiles to prevent this.So as it turns out, the events of Rise of an Empire actually takes place in parallel with that of 300, just on a different front of the battle. I didn't really realize this until about a quarter of the way into the movie. At first I was apprehensive, but it was done in a way that I found it added a bit of depth to the events of the original. I thought this was actually a fairly clever way of expanding on the original story while introducing a few new characters. I also really liked that there was a bit of an origin story of Xerxes and how he came to be. This to me was the most fascinating part of the movie as I haven't read Frank Miller's graphic novel and was fairly curious to know more about him. However, while I can remember several really strong story moments from 300, they weren't really that many stand out moments here (outside of a fairly inspiring pre-battle speech) and some of the dramatic moments feel a bit forced. So in that sense Rise of an Empire is no where near as impactful as the original. But it was interesting enough to keep me engaged as this was a mostly enjoyable two hours. There weren't any slow points or moments that dragged; the movie moved along briskly.The performances were mostly good. Eva Green (of Casino Royale fame) absolutely steals the show here. Her Artemesia is irresistible and is one of those kinds of villains that even though you have a feeling she won't win or that you shouldn't cheer for her, you end up doing it anyway because the performance is that good. She really excels at these almost femme fatale roles (as she did in Dark Shadows) and that's definitely the case here. Rodrigo Santoro (notably from Che and Rio) as Xerxes is once again, awesome! His egotistical and narcissistic Xerxes is just so brazen and smug, it's hard not to love! Whether it's the special effects that make him appear gigantic, the deepening of his voice or the fantastic makeup job that's necessary to create this character, I just find this character really impressive and he stands out on screen every time. If Zack Snyder were to make a Xerxes spin off, I'd definitely be on board!While Gerard's Butler's Leonidas commanded the screen and was memorable, Sullivan Stapleton (of Animal Kingdom and Gangster Squad) as Themistokles is mostly uninspiring and forgettable. Given that this is the lead character of the film, this was obviously disappointing. It might be unfair for me to compare the performances, but since this film is really an extension more than a sequel, a standout lead performance would go a long way in making the film shine on it's own. Ultimately, this is where Rise of an Empire fails for me. There's also plenty of bravado dialogue, but this was expected and not over the top; it does feel a bit toned down to be honest.Rise of an Empire also has all the visual flair of it's predecessor. It's very stylish with vibrant colours, beautiful blue screen scenery and top notch special effects. If you enjoyed 300, this will be right down your alley. As expected, there's a few great battle sequences that are worth the price of admission. However, there are also some moments that border on ridiculous; such as a horse riding on a boat that is on fire and jumping to another one. I mean, really? Not to mention a scene I can only describe as a bizarre sex fight. While the slow motion sword fights and splashes of blood felt fresh and new in 300, they feel a little stale and tiresome here as I didn't really see anything new or improved. It really just just kind of felt like the studio saying, ""hey, you loved that in 300, so here's some more!"". So as a result I would say this film doesn't really stand up well on it's own and thus not a great sequel. While I personally found it worthwhile, I can understand others questioning whether this movie was in fact really necessary.Even though I wasn't blown away, it's certainly not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I would say I got just about what I expected and was entertained. If you didn't like 300, then you can definitely pass on this as it's more of an expansion of the 300 story than it is a separate tale. However, if you liked the original I would say it's worth a watch, if only for the back story of Xerxes (which I found surprisingly compelling).Was my review not horrible? Great!

At one point, I decided that the theater was having problems with the film and almost left to speak with an employee, but then it was never there during the battle scenes, so it must have been SOMETHING, but it was soooooooo distracting.Not that there was much to concentrate on. Absolutely ridiculous and ultra violent, along with an--Spoiler ALERT--unpleasant sex scene. Another reviewer mentioned romance--no, there was none of that.I went for the special effects, the ship battles, of which there were several. Hundreds of men standing on a flat ship's deck, with no sides or rails, plummeting down the face of a wave of Poseidon proportions, and the men don't even sway a bit. Women engaging in sword fights in skirts (and the men in capes).And the blood. All over the place. If the word ""overkill"" ever applied to anything, this movie is it.

170,thomas-w15,Don't expect the original 300 and you will like this sequel,6,22 November 2014,"300: Rise of an Empire 6/10- Coming off of the widely successful 300, this new sequel attempts to do what the original 300 did but on a much bigger scale. Rise of an Empire may not achieve the same level of originality or high quality screen writing. Yet, with Eva Green stealing the show and a ton of hard-core sea battle sequences ingeniously crafted, the audience members cannot help but appreciate how rare an extremely epic film comes along. I will start with the slightly bad aspects of the film. This term may not be used to often anymore, but in certain scenes of this picture, it seemed a little too ""Hollywood."" Most avid movie-goers would agree that in certain scenes of Rise of an Empire, especially the beginning, it over uses slow motion effects in the battle scenes. And yes, to a certain extent slow mo can definitely make fight scenes undeniably better. Having said that, when slow mo is used repeatedly, the audience will start to stray away from how great the fight looks and start to think why the directors felt it be necessary to include this much of one particular special effect. This is not all this movie's fault do to the fact that since the widely successful original 300, a lot of films have exhausted the medieval blood-gore genre. It is not exactly fair to say that this sequel lacks originality, since after all it is a sequel. But, they should still bring something new to the table and should definitely be able to stand apart from the original. To be honest, this film would not done half as well if it was not for the monster box office success of the first film. As far as sequels go in terms of comparing it to the original, Rise of an Empire still offers something new has not been seen in a while and the plot is at the very least decent. Now we continue on the the epic part of the film, the battle scenes. Most all of the audience who saw Rise of an Empire has seen 300, and definitely remembered how badass it was. Rise of an Empire is just as badass but it moves off the battle field of Thermopylae and on to the more global setting of the Aegean Sea. The writers knew how to choreograph battles because some of the scenes in combat were just beautifully done. The design of all of the war ships is something to mention to because they were definitely modeled off of ancient Greek and Persian ships considering how real they all looked. Some moments of battle may be slightly hard to believe but once you get past that, the hard-core special effects of ships smashing into each other and Athenians battling six guys at once takes over leaving you in awe of them. All of these actors got into a great warrior mindset for their roles and definitely were able to give the audience the memory of the die hard King Leonidas and his Spartans. What really was beyond belief in this movie, aside from the combat sequences, was Eva Green. Eva Green, who plays Artemisia the commanding general of Xerxes naval fleet, was truly unbelievable. Many actresses have tried and failed for the failure of portraying the ""temptress"" of the movie. Eva Green would make up for them all. When she was in a scene, you could feel the emotion of her character, you could feel passion, vengeance, and war cries all swirling together. I feel confident saying this is one of the best female ""temptress"" antagonist roles I have seen in quite some time. I would also like to give credit to Sullivan Stapleton, who plays Themistocles of Athens the commanding general of the Greeks, and Rodrigo Santoro, who plays the god king Xerxes of Persia, for give above average performances that only a handful of actors could have done better. I recommend 300: Rise of an Empire to anyone who enjoys war movies that give you a deep feeling of inspiration walking out of the theater, regardless of whether you have seen the original 300 or not.

172,kofila,What is the point?,4,5 March 2014,"Now, I never intended to see this flick but I got free tickets so what's the harm, right? Well there is one...First of all - This film is as original as it gets. There is exactly zero parts of the film that are results of someones creative thinking. Well at least not of someone who worked on this movie...It is as boring as an action flick can get. You will experience about 8 motivational speeches to the troops. Which is about 7 more that I am willing to accept. There are exactly 7000 naked men running around in what appears to be the most unpleasant climate on earth. There is no interesting character - well maybe except Xerxes (who gets whopping 3 minutes of screen time and about 4 lines such as - ""I am your king!""... The story line is so not speaking to me in terms of why would they choose this event to make film about(?!) And on top of it the incredible CG... Barrels and barrels of blood so fake you just can't get your eyes of it. What was it anyway? Raspberry pudding? Perhaps... It had one special feature to it though - you couldn't actually see it once it hit solid surface.

173,liodavix,EVA GREEN,8,13 February 2019,"Loved it.Moreover, although many will say that I am crazy, I will say that I liked it more than the first part, and that is because, unlike the previous one, here the war is finally seen from the point of view of the Persians, (who were not as bad or cruel as they are painted in the first, just as the Greeks were not as noble or patriotic as they are painted in both films).The clichés however remain, but this time have made us feel more sympathy towards the other side, and the reason for that is mainly due to a fantastic, dark, mysterious, warlike and overwhelming Eva Green, what great success and surprise to see this actress playing the powerful Artemis.And it is that to see a woman, skipping all the ridiculous canons and norms imposed to the force to the women at that time and giving it to those those hyper-muscular macho is a real pleasure.I swear I ended up wishing that in the end she would end up beating the heavy and nasty Greeks, that I do not know about you, but that in the end all this roll of freedom and patriotism, (totally false, in the Persian army there were thousands of Greeks and Spartans exiled by their own cities and who fought for the tyrant, for the Greeks, of course, Persian), I ended up becoming unbearable.The film itself has seemed very entertaining, historically more faithful than the first, with an agile and direct rhythm that does not lead to boredom and with quite a few actors in place.
By the way, am I the only one who was saddened by the death of Artemis and the defeat of the Persians?I'm sorry, but I really can not stand the cockiness of the Spartans or the plasticized and modernized patriotism of the Athenians.",300 - Rise of an Empire

175,InMyHonestOpinion,A bloody mess in more ways than one,2,11 January 2015,"Some of my favourite films are history based especially based around the bible (don't get the wrong impression of me here people) Their big budgets, big actors, huge sets and old school Technicolor values just have a way of keeping me captivated. I personally believe some bible stories have made the best movies. Egyptian mythology is one of the ones I truly do love as well as Greek, and after seeing 300 which I gave 4 out of 5 BanShee Screams I was really looking forward to its follow up300 Rise of an Empire is the follow up to Frank Millers 300 which was written and directed by Jack Snyder, the follow up was again written by Jack Snyder but this time directed by Noam Murro an absolute nobody and doesn't it show. Imitation is the highest form of flattery so they say, but is that true? I guess it really all depends on the art form. Frank Miller is famous for his graphic novels and some of them have been brought to life quite well unfortunately 300 Rise of an Empire is nothing but a bloody mess; and I mean that quite literally. The screen is so filled with blood and body parts flying across the screen it actually becomes quite comical even though it is far from the intention I'm sure of all involved.Rise of an Empire takes place before, during and after 300 the first film, Xerxes still has his war planned and still wants to take over the Greeks, with his right hand woman Artemisia leading the attack this time by sea. Greek general Themistokles leads the Greek warriors this time to stop the invading army That there is the plot, nothing more and nothing less.This film is a joke from beginning to end and the not the kind of joke that makes you laugh but the kind of joke instead where you sit and shake your head; like you would at the dog that just shat on your new carpet. This is an action packed mess, there is so much happening on the screen with decapitations and dismembered bodies it's hard to concentrate on anything else especially the story or lack thereof. At the heart of it all there is an interesting story but unfortunately it is totally lost amongst everything else happening.The film is actually based on the Battle of Artemisium and the Battle of Salamis but it has been pointed out to be incorrect in places especially around those who died and how. Staring Sullivan Stapleton, (Animal Kingdom, the Secret Life of Us) Eva Green (Dark Shadows, Penny Dreadful) Lena Headey (The Mortal Instruments, 300) Rodrigo Santoro. (Lost, 300) Originally Jack Snyder was to direct this film again but his commitment to Man of Steel took precedence what a mistake that was. What I did enjoy though is the art style it is filmed in, the cartoonish style of cinematography definitely adds to the action but doesn't do enough to aid the story in anyway unfortunately.300 Rise of an Empire is a blood thirsty mockery of history, if you want something to just watch that is full of absolutely senseless violence then you may love this, just don't expect to take much away.

179,sedativchunk,"Blow away, AWESOME sequel!",9,8 March 2014,"I am a big fan of the original 300. It's probably in my list of my top 15 favorite movies of all time. The art style, action, and inspiration you feel when seeing those guys fight and rip their enemies to shreds is just awesome. With it's cliffhanger ending, I waited year after year for a sequel and thought it would never come. Finally in 2014, we got the official sequel ""300: Rise of an Empire"". I was a little worried about this film at first. How could they top the first one? More importantly, how can they do this movie without Gerard Butler, who was the quintessential Spartan leader? Well it turns out they did. And not only was this movie fantastic, but I almost feel as if I enjoyed it more than the original!From beginning to end, this movie tells historical stories like no other. Fantastic cinematics, camera work, audio, and CGI that is actually enjoyable and doesn't take away from the filming experience. Even the sex scene of this movie was epic. These movies are very powerful and there wasn't a dull moment in this movie. More so than the theatrics, this movie has GREAT cast. Eva Green played the evil Artemisia so incredibly well that she practically was this movie. She so perfectly played that bad guy in this film that it was unreal. She is probably the most convincing, twisted villain in a movie since Ricardo Montalban did Khan in Star Trek II in the 1980's. She was just THAT good in this film! We also get to see some familiar faces from the first film, too, which was rewarding.The only minor, little thing that makes it hard for me to give this film a perfect score is the following... although Sullivan Stapleton was great as Themistokles, his performance wasn't quiet on the same level as Gerard Butler's was in the original 300. From his muscular physique to his overall screen presence, I just didn't connect with this guy as much as I did with Gerard Butler. But he was still excellent in the film, and I don't blame him as much as the writers/director. They tried to cram a lot into this movie with telling Atermisia's side of the story, but it worked out well with her in the film. Although I normally complain that a movie is too long, though, this one I think could have been a bit longer to develop his character more, even by just another 5 or 10 minutes of film time. All in all, fantastic film. Eva Green's performance alone is worth seeing it over, she was a true villain in this movie. I recommend it whether you are a fan of the franchise or not. I took my 61 year old mother to see this for her birthday coming up and she also enjoyed it and typically doesn't like gory movies.",300 - Rise of an Empire
180,GSeditor,Eva Green steals the show and transforms this into a movie about Artemisia,7,5 March 2014,"Eva Green performs an iconic portrayal of a ferocious woman in a men's world in this sword&sandal epic. She manipulates, leads, seduces, overpowers, humiliates, butchers men throughout the movie with memorable zeal -and with dry wit. In a key scene, which is emblematic in the sense it sums up her character, she seduces the rival Greek commander into sex, but when he wants to have her from the behind, she overpowers him and rises to the top to consummate the sex. Scenes without her (thankfully, very sparse) really seem like filler material to pad out the movie's duration. ps: the downside of the movie is that, even though it is very gory, all the gore is via very fake-looking cgi.",300 - Rise of an Empire
181,DanielRobertRoss,Dumb but not fun,3,15 February 2016,"What a complete load. The historical inaccuracies in this film are so numerous, I just couldn't believe it. Yes the original 300 had some silly additions to the story, like Ephialtes being a deformed hunchback monster, the immortal warrior giant and so on. But the core of the story was actually not that far of from history. Xerxes invaded Greece and a coalition of Greek soldiers delayed him by making a final stand at Thermopylae. Frank Miller's graphic novel, very loosely based on Herodotus, was actually not that far off from history, or Hollywood history anyway. But 300: Rise of an Empire went far beyond the suspension of disbelief. I wasn't annoyed with the opening scene where Darius and his son Xerxes are present at the Battle of Marathon, you need to set up characters and motivations for why the later events happen, fine. But once the normal looking young Xerxes walks into the pool of magic CGI goo and emerges as a 7 foot giant, the movie lost me, that's the moment where the shark has been jumped. Why not just rename it ""Clash of the Titans"" and be done with it, and throw out all sense of historical accuracy. Persepolis was nowhere near that large, it looks like it spans miles and miles, but we know from archaeological digs that it was far more modest (Same goes for Oliver Stone's version of Babylon in 2004's rubbish Alexander film). But it doesn't end there. What's with the Persian indoor combat training scene near the beginning? The architecture looks closer to Chronicles of Riddick than Middle East 480 BC. And the ridiculously anachronistic warships in the film are laughable. They did not have anywhere near that level of technology for warships until the 1800s. Did anyone even do any research for this, whatsoever? And let's be frank, Sullivan Stapleton is no Gerard Butler, quite why Butler declined to be in the film is beyond me, given his bad choice of flops since the first film, I though he would have jumped at the chance, regardless of the probably small amount of screen time. Sure, I still would've hated the film, but Stapleton is a charisma-free vacuum. At least with Leonidas, there was a character that was fun, all Stapleton does is glower and grunt. The CGI blood looks fake, the rock music over the closing credits felt really out of place, Noam Murro has none of the style of Zack Snyder, basically the whole film is a mess. The only saving grace was Eva Green. Her sex scene was awesome, one star added...OK two stars added, one for each boob. What? the movie is shameless, so I can be too!",300 - Rise of an Empire
182,mr_iceman,If you really loved 300. Please don't ruin it with this one,4,10 June 2014,"I honestly would like to interview the people that rated this anything above 6.0/10 which led to the hyper-inflated general rating of 6.6/10.While watching this movie, I had to pause it several times and read over the Wikipedia synopsis to find out what the hell is going on.This movie was a sequel, prequel, (and Mequal?) in one, and the worst part is that they don't give you any indication on whether you are now watching the prequel part or the sequel.Example, information about how Artemisia came about was only established well into the movie.The protagonist tries hard to carry through the burning flame of Leonidas but fails miserably at every attempt, even the non-vocal ones.The worst part is the fight scenes; it seems as the actors skipped rehearsals for the chest wax jobs on a daily basis. Look closely and you can see the fighting scenes all very much in synch and choreographed so much that the offense and defense are anticipating each other's' moves.Furthermore, nothing seems real. Like Artemisia speaking softly to a group of 40 warriors in rough seas while they all listened carefully like a teacher reading out a book in a library. Where is the realism is this?

Eva Greene has a gift of playing Crazy and she doesn't disappoint. She has mastered the art and only gets better with each crazy chick she plays. Still couldn't save this. The movie made no sense. It was done in complete narration and voice over. The lead actor, who ever he was, was terrible. I guess they ran out of budget for a lead. The guy in the gold speedo was actually funny.

184,raj040492,Thumbs up but not both of them,7,13 March 2014,"Eight years and a spoof (Meet the Spartans) later, we have in our hands not a prequel or a sequel but a side quell.Noam Murro's ""300 Rise of an Empire"" is the story of how an Athenian General, Themistokles, launches a naval sabotage against the Persians causing distress much similar to what Leonidas does on land. This is perhaps the first time that I have come across a period movie based on naval warfare. As queen Gorgo puts it ""the war takes place on the tidal waves of the soldier's blood"".Athenian general Themistokles ends the Battle of Marathon with a single arrow and becomes a legend over night. Ten years later he gathers a navy against Persian invasion led by Artemisia (Eva Green) who is as ruthless as Xerxes is. In the meantime Leonidas marches to the hot gates with his brave 300 and wages his own battle. All hell breaks loose after the slaughter of Leonidas and his ""abs""tastic 300.""Seize the glory"" might seem catchy but the true undertone of the movie is ""vengeance"". Xerxes avenges his father, Artemisia avenges her family, and off course Queen Gorgo avenges Leonidas and the 300.Despite being a different take with a different lead cast, the movie has its similarities to 300(2006) thanks to Zack Snyder's effort behind the screenplay. If Leonidas' red cape was an indication to the bloodshed that follows, the Athenian's blue cape is an indication of the naval fight that lies ahead. No matter how well the two stories are connected the towering presence of Gerard Butler is deeply missed. Eva Green appears to have taken the major shouldering. The occasional flashbacks cause a somber effect in the screenplay (Artemisia's for example).The major credit goes to cg team that has made a nothing but green- background-studio-set into a thousand year old floating battlefield. Despite the gut wrenching, blood pilfering, bowel squeezing moments during the war, the movie lacks the substance that made 300 a special movie. Yes, this time too there is a father-son angle but that doesn't engage us as much as it did the last time. Perhaps it was the Spartan's death wish of a climax or the 300 times 6 abs or Zack Snyder at the helm or all of it together, it was missing this time around.By itself, ""Rise of Empire"" is a good Greek-naval-period movie, but as a sequel to the ""300"" it falls short of the expectations that it garnered. It's still a good piece of entertainment but some fans of ""300"", like me, will feel hollow when they exit the screen.",300 - Rise of an Empire

This horse was The Horse, that could fly through water and drift through fire.Characters are forgettable like the the story. But what is worse than all things summed together, is the fact that the villeins had a ton of opportunities to kill their enemies, but instead they just preferred to have a chat and some drinks together.Don't bother with this movie, you aren't missing anything.

188,smashthecontrolmachine,Definitely Doesn't Compare...,5,11 March 2014,This film is an insult to the original 300 in pretty much every facet. The action sequences seem over done and overly contrived. The sex scenes seem to have no necessity in proportion to the storyline. The story line is a disaster. The over narrating throughout is too distracting as well. I found myself craving the real fighting of the Spartans as opposed to this mismatched bunch of farm hands that was thrown together. Themistokles was terribly casted...Gerard Butler was masterful in comparison. Artemisia was also a huge miscast as she seemed to do too much overacting and to me she came across as quite disingenuous. The few highlights in the film were few and far between. I didn't see a great use of the 3D here either...in fact I saw none. In some scenes the 3D I felt ruined the scene if anything. I am nonetheless very disappointed. I truly hope if they make another Zack Snyder directs it not Noam Murro. I hope the Spartans are the centerpiece and a true inspiring heroic lead character is cast similar to a Gerard Butler. This film paled in comparison to the original and that saddens me. It wanted to be better but it failed in even coming close.,300 - Rise of an Empire

This movie put me to sleep, and normally I don't review movies that I didn't see at least 90% of the film (even critics use the bathroom), but I feel like this movie is a special exception because something should be said about how incredibly bored I was of what should have been a straight-to-video sequel.First off, you can't replace Gerard Butler with whoever the heck that was. Sullivan Stapleton? Then again, I keep telling everyone that Jai Courtney is a waste of space, and he keeps getting cast.. so who am I to judge? I think Sullivan Stapleton lacks any kind of charisma or star quality that Butler had, that caused him to be a breakout star. Stapleton can't possibly breakout. I couldn't pick him out of a crowd.Eva Green plays a bad ass so poorly written that she actually has to make out with a decapitated head in order to prove her badassery.Oh, and be ready for TONS of exposition. I think the first half of the movie is exposition. Just when you think they're over.. there's more.It felt like a cheap retread, and only created to make money, not to tell a story or offer a meaningful contribution to the 300 franchise. I've seen American Pie sequels I've liked better than this.

190,tiffanyyongwt,"300: Rise of An Empire is both prequel and sequel to ""300″",6,13 March 2014,"The first movie 300 had been a hit with the audience, and when this movie was announced, many people who looking forward to it. To be truthful, the first movie was all but a blur to me, I forgot all about the plot, and all I could remember is lots of strong half-naked guys with nice looking abs, loads of roaring and fighting, and they somehow all died in the end.So when this film was out, I was thinking how could the film possibly continue with all the 300 guys dead? Vengeance? Prequel? Surprisingly, 300: The Rise of An Empire is both prequel and sequel to ""300″. It is the story that happened along-side with the story of 300. I was surprised how this film showed more girl power this time round, with Artemesia as the navy head of the Persian, and even Queen Gorgo coming to join the battle, avenging for her husband. It felt like the Chinese version of Yang Male and Female Warriors.What I like about the film was the tactical battling between Themistocles and Artemesia. The fight between the mere farmers and the strong Persian troops were impressive. The flashbacks helped refresh the audience's memory about the Spartan's battle (And help me recognized the characters as the guys looked all the same to me), as well as provide a little back story for those who did not catch the first film. However, that were the only good points about the whole film. With so many slow-motion effect, I wondered (more than once) if they had to do that to extend the film as it was too short. Besides that, the sudden appearance of weird sea monsters left me feeling bizarre, how did those serpent-like monsters fit into the story? Was it to show off the 3D skills?Some people talked about the sex scene which drew the whole attention away from the battle.

191,xristoff93,Entertaining but historically false and a bit cringy,5,14 October 2016,"I saw this movie with high expectations.I found the original film a true masterpiece and being a fan of history and an admirer of Greece,this felt very wrong.If you don't know your history and only looking for some good action,you won't be disappointed.There are numerous battles,tons of blood and beautiful battle chorographies.A total brute bath!The problem is,that in comparison to the first one,it's lacking.Many historical facts were either false,changed or completely absent.Hollywoods presence was very intense.Heroes with perfect hair looking a bit....not manly at all,warriors with eyeliners,red clothes for the Atheneans.All these stuff,for someone who knows what to expect,were very disappointing.And to be honest I am tired of movies and directors disrespecting history in order to sell some tickets.How many faulty Greek movies must we suffer?I mean,the guys have history and mythology enough(and maybe the greatest on this Earth)to produce movies of top level,with many chances of high quality visual effects usage,until the end of time.Why not stick to that and make something brutal yet glorious? Something visually attractive,but mind appealing as well?Their stories need no change and additions.By doing that you only manage to spoil the goods,make unnecessary complications that end up only creating plot holes,lack of continuity and confusion.Besides that,many elements were unfitting.A very hollywoodish sex scene,many Eva Green and queen Gorgo wanna be epic moments that resulted in a lot of cringing..It was distasteful.And the sheer fact that the whole story enveloped around Gorgo and her pain of loss was a bit idiotic to say the least.We are talking about brutal times,with highly patriarchic societies.Women were respected in ancient Sparta a lot,that is true,but no way in Hades would you ever see a woman being the main face/voice in a war,let alone lead or participate in one.I get it,you have your tickets to sale.But by ruining such a marvelous first installment,with out of time feministic crap in order to appeal more to the female population,you only manage to let down your fans.Not because we are enemies of women or feminism nor because it is our personal preference,but because those choices and ideas are completely irrelevant to the story.Personally,I won't be coming back to see the next rumored film.I hope we will not get to suffer another Greek based movie massacre like Troy(Brad Pitt),Alexander(Colin Farrel),Hercules(Dwayne Jonhson),Immortals,Rath of the Titans etc.All those Hollywood nonsense diminish the value of ideals and characters behind those stories.Hopefully they will understand it one day.If I were able to rate it only as an action movie,I would probably give it a 6.5 out of 10.Now,with me being lenient,I am giving it a very generous 5/10.",300 - Rise of an Empire

But I spent most of the time during the films laughing...and I don't think they are intended to be comedies...You have grim faced manly men, of only perfect physique, doing battle wearing ""Speedos"", capes, and lots of leather ""straps"". The battle scenes are really just very carefully choreographed and sophisticated dance moves. Am I so obtuse that it is only now dawning on me....are the ""300"" films really just soft core gay pornography? That would explain a lot....if indeed that is the answer.Why does the sun never shine in Sparta? Why does the slightest knife wound splash a gallon of ""blood"" in every direction? Don't these people ever smile, have fun, or do anything besides strut around in their thongs and try to be more ""manly"" than the next guy? I understand that these films are not intended to represent any ""reality""...I get that. My question is what ARE they supposed to represent? I gave this movie a ""3""...because we had a bit of fun watching it. Laughing at the outfits...the strutting...the posturing. Macho, manly, masculine men living their lives in a manly way. And without getting too specific, some of the names in the movie were fun to mock in a childish way.But like I said, I don't think it was intended to be a comedy. So I guess I didn't ""get"" 300 at all. I wish someone who does would explain it to me....I guess I have to fall back on my ""gay porn"" theory.",300 - Rise of an Empire
193,oscarxp25,Fall of an Empire,4,30 March 2014,"Seven years ago, Zack Synder introduced us to a blood soaked, visually original, and violent world that was ""300"". Partnered with lead actor Gerard Butler it worked in a way that it proudly wore its manliness on its sleeve. Does the new film succeed in what the first film beautifully established? One of the problems, and there are many, is that the new director Noam Murro plays it both too safe and overkills the foundation of the series. A montage of slow motion shots with blood flying at the camera, which even gets tiresome in 3D, loses its novelty quite quickly. Even in the original film Synder was close to achieving this unfortunate feat with the technique but kept it a bay. Maybe because it was new and fresh that it didn't become too much. Murro just uses the technique over which results in the coolness of the effect being quickly lost.Zack Synder, the director of the first one, only has a writing credit this time. As stated he did get a bit trigger happy with the slow motion but the original film had many things going for it that made up for the constant slow downs. While ""Empire"" does start out strong with the story of the evil Xerxes and how he became the powerful leader that the 300 were out to destroy, it quickly falters to the effects. In this film, Themistocles, the hero of the story, and his men are out to fight the Persians like their Spartan brothers. Unlike their Spartan brothers, they aren't trained warriors, but regular men with a limited military knowledge and strength. This time, they are up against an evil, powerful, and combat advanced Artemisa. Artemisa's story is also quite interesting on how she becomes Xerxes right hand woman. I will save that for your own viewing since it is one of the few things that the film feels alive. It is also a saving grace that Artemisa is played by the fabulous Eva Green. She seems to be having a great time playing bad and it translates into the performance.The main problem is that Sullivan Stapleton, who portrays Themistocles, and his band of men are no where as interesting as Gerard Butler's Leonidas and his men in the original film. The writers try to make them interesting through brave acts of courage and monologues but nothing sticks. Remembering anything of these men is as hard as fighting for your life in a wave full of swords and arrows. The men pride themselves on being normal men. (They still have those wash board Abs though). For normal men, they sure do fight as well, if not better, than their Spartan brothers. There is no time in the film where you are worried about if these men can take care of themselves.""300: Rise of an Empire"" is nice to look at. The visuals have been improved in the seven years. Outside of the two villains the film's story and characters are incredibly flat. The only main hope for this franchise is that it looks like there will be another one that will conclude in a trilogy. Let's just hope it is more exciting and well made because this series deserves a kick ass finale instead of the half assed effort the middle one got.",300 - Rise of an Empire
194,Royalcourtier,Comedy rather than comic strip,2,16 March 2014,"It is probably undeniable that the standard of movies has declined over recent years. Whilst technical resources have become more advanced, originality, scripts, acting, plots and characters have declined in quality. Many directors no longer seem able to properly use the technical resources and massive funding given to them.300: Rise of an Empire is a good example of the worst type of modern film. Vast budget, over emphasis on CGI, weak script and characterisation, and bad acting. It was often hard to see what was happening in the murky darkness. Slow motion splattering of blood became tedious, as did the number of beheadings. It often looked as though the film was a cartoon, both visually and because of the ""plot"" and inane script.The film is set in ancient Greece. A time and place well-known to moviegoers. Yet this Greece bears no resemblance to the historical reality. 300 is not meant to be a docudrama, certainly, but it could not be more inaccurate if it tried. It was often hard to follow what was happening, and there were many unexplained or disconnected events.==Spoiler alert== Amongst the many anachronisms was the use of an ""oil tanker"" as a weapon. The ""personal guard"" suicide bombers swimming hundreds of yards underwater whilst carrying oil tank bombs was particularly absurd. The real Greeks fought in tight groups, wearing as much armour as they could afford. They were citizen-soldiers. These Greeks were described as farmers - though they came from a city - untrained, and fought largely without either armour or clothes. The real Sparta was known for its army. Yet this Sparta was a formidable naval power. The real battle of Thermopylae was between the Persians and a large Greek army. This one was fought by the 300 Spartans alone - Athens apparently did nothing to prevent being sacked. And two of the three main military leaders were woman, despite women having virtually no role in the real war. ====I suggest that the people who fund these massively expensive turkeys should consider whether they really want to make travesties with their money, or whether a film with a semblance of intelligence, logic, historical reality, cohesion and a good script might be better.",300 - Rise of an Empire

This piece of work pretty much sums up why C G I offerings are so bad, no proper script, ridiculous story, and a complete waste of my time. Watch Eva Green in Ridley Scotts kingdom of Heaven, and tear your hair out in frustration, because she is a class act, directed by a classless clown.

There was very little slow time, this movie draws you in, I was clapping when the Spartans ships showed up th help kick some Persian behind. Yes it was predictable, but it was still awesome.

And my favourite when the greek captain rides on his horse on an inflamed ship, into the ocean, back onto the enemy ship all while murdering his enemies along the way. Why not just make the house fly? Everyone is a caricature. Very little of it is of course grounded in reality.

198,donjeffries,"Horrific, Bloody, Politically Correct and Incomprehensible",1,7 February 2015,"There is so much not to like about this film. First of all, the nearly non-stop slow motion effects during the endless fighting scenes. Then there was the morbidly gratuitous glorification of blood, with streams of it spurting out from necks and bodies over and over again. Is it really believable that a woman in ancient Greece could control, dominate, and rule over an army of muscle-bound Spartan soldiers? Talk about a feminist fantasy! And the audience is given not one, but two fantastic female sword fighters. These waif-like, 100 lb. gals can take on multiple, larger trained male soldiers at once, and easily defeat them. In one particularly ridiculous scene, the primary female leader proves her worth by returning to her king with three heads in hand. The plot was so convoluted here, and so secondary to the bloody, slow-motion battle scenes, that it was impossible to tell who was fighting whom. And in a further gesture of political correctness, the ""Persians"" all had their faces camouflaged in some way, to hide their ethnic features. Can't have any Persians looking too Arabic, I guess. The original 300 movie was pretty good. This was about as bad a sequel as has ever been made. The director and screenwriters behind this mess should be embarrassed.",300 - Rise of an Empire
199,matic-boh1,An unnecessary sequel,5,10 June 2014,"Along with it being utterly ridiculous in its design and annoyingly historically inaccurate, 300: Rise of an Empire offers far too many unrealistic combat scenes and a distasteful excess of computer generated imagery, resulting in a highly disappointing sequel to its successful predecessor. As one inevitably compares it to the prequel 300, the film come across as far less captivating and exciting, mainly due to the less appealing nature of the leading character. The heavily exaggerated blood effects and unreasonable amounts of slow motion techniques continue to dominate the film, and although very stylistic, these features no longer have the same impact on the viewer as during the first installment. It is worth noting, however, that the storyline itself is well-executed as it cleverly overlaps with the prequel, while the audience is also offered an outstanding performance by Eva Green as the main antagonistic force, which somewhat elevates the film in its quality. But despite certain positive aspects, 300: Rise of an Empire is nonetheless far from reaching the standards of the first film, and can be perceived merely as an unnecessary expansion of its predecessor.",300 - Rise of an Empire

201,asha-albert,Greeks good. Persians bad. That's all you need to remember.,9,9 March 2014,"Yes I give this a 9/10. Because it is such an amazingly entertaining movie, and the two hours running time went by in a flash. When you feel that a movie ended too soon, that's when you know that the movie was a fun ride! So...the movie. Six-pack abs, decapitations, buckets of blood, manly dialogue, jaw-dropping battle scenes. Plus a mortal-turned-god and a kick-ass female commander - all of this add up to one heck of a entertainer. You will notice that I do not mention artistic merit as being a factor; that's because there is NONE. And for those of you who are complaining about the lack of historical accuracy...keep in mind, this movie is based on a comic book, not a history textbook.The lead actor Sullivan Stapleton, who plays Greek general Themistokles adds a bit more depth to his character than Gerard Butler did to his rendering of Leonidas. He has more dialogue and exposition, rather than just yelling and grunting. There may be yet potential for him in Hollywood.The lead actress, Eva Green, who plays Artemisia, has probably one of the fiercest action female roles I have ever seen. No wai-fu here. She portrays her character as one of utter cruelty, yet cold and calculating. Physically too, she is very believable as a woman commanding a fleet of 10,000 men.More than the actors, or the wafer-thin storyline, it is the incredible CGI that keeps you entranced. The battle scenes are probably the best I have seen - the sheer size and scope of the ships, together with the raw savagery of war, is enough to make you a believer! The battle scenes on land as well as on sea have been created with a keen eye for detail, and for maximum impact. Of course, the 3D doesn't hurt.I haven't mentioned the other actors since none really made an impact - not even the golden-hued Xerxes, played by Rodrigo Santoro. His awkward gait, odd voice, and lack of anything to really do in the movie, made him a real disappointment. Queen Gorgo, played by Lena Headey, also suffered from having nothing to do, other than saying ""no"" in various tones on various occasions.In summary, a fun movie to watch; it's not going to win any Oscars; and yes, there will be a sequel to this sidequel.",300 - Rise of an Empire

203,pete-murphy97,300 times worse than the first. But a respectable continuation.,7,16 March 2014,"'Blood, gore, war and more, all spurred by self righteous Greek law.'This is 300: Rise of an Empire, a film which was in many ways magnificent in scale on the front of Ancient naval conflicts, intense melee and inspirational speeches, but seemingly fell short at the hurdle of choreographing the anticipation that channeled the energy that this movie unequivocally possesses. Similarly to how the noble Spartans fought off the Persians in a choke point, channelling their brutal onslaught to a narrow passage, this film should have done exactly the same with it's choreography, but with the way they utilised the resources available, they pitched this battle on open terrain.I can understand that coming from a more open minded perspective, the directors perhaps intended for the film to be incessantly repetitive and excessive in the exhibition of combat, with the purpose of conveying a sense of military chaos, maybe suggesting that war is not coordinated as many may assume, and that the period was utterly infatuated with war and conflict. While this would be a blissfully pleasant excuse, I can't see much behind the reasoning when this is a film intended for entertainment, not necessarily historical accuracy.I'm going to confess I adored the superlatively visual stimulation that featured throughout this film, the special effects worked wonders in the heat of the battle. Themistokles is portrayed as a typically tactical, thoughtful and battle hardened Athenian. I was appreciative of how the Athenians were made to appear starkly contrasted to their Spartan brothers, and not some monotonous, cloned appendage to the Spartan horde.The story Xerxes and his father, King Darius of Persia was a pleasant foreword to the film. I felt it filled the void of intrigue surrounding Xerxes' origin but simultaneously evoked a certain mystique about his persona that we attained from the first film. The most initially negative alteration to Xerxes was probably his affiliation with Artemisia whom frankly made him appear meagre and timid, which seemed unusual given Xerxes was an apparent God King, he seemed much more dominant in the first film, but learning now that he was also being controlled and manipulated by Artemisia throughout certainly adds depth to his character, and lets us see the more juvenile, inferior side of the God King, while also giving emphasis to the unrepentant, commandeering nature of Artemisia.",300 - Rise of an Empire

206,mwburrows,Unintentional comedy.,2,11 March 2014,"The original 300 was a unique entry among historical epics. It's eye- catching visual style laid the seeds for its success. Strong set pieces and a fantasy take on ancient history helped make it a memorable war epic that we will revisit for years to come.So as with any film where money is involved there has to be a sequel, right? If you throw enough money at someone they'll eventually say yes to whatever you want. Snyder isn't directing this time but the screenplay was written by him and his presence is felt constantly throughout the film.Unfortunately, Rise of an Empire just sucks at everything, especially when compared side-by-side with its sibling. Terrible miscasts, stilted dialogue, and boring, predictable set pieces had me laughing at inappropriate moments. Eva Green...just no...she's meant to be a ""warrior princess"" tough girl, badass, but she's just not suited to the role. She got the job because she's a big name. She has the smirks and flirty smiles but that's about it. She had me cracking up at parts with the truly terrible lines she was forced to repeat, much like the rest of the cast, including the horrendously unqualified Sullivan Stapleton, who is not a leading man and should never be cast as one again after this debacle.I liked Sully in Animal Kingdom and other Aussie roles he has done before, which he is best suited to (Like Sam Worthington...who is likewise NOT a leading man, but Hollywood doesn't get the idea). He is most tolerable and believable when he is being himself and projecting his own personality on screen. Here, he is forced to adopt a ""English- speaking character in ancient period"" accent and recite some of the worst dialogue in recent history, even among historical epics. Many of his lines have suspiciously modern wording and he fails to deliver them with any real understanding of what he's actually saying. In fact this is one of my greatest pet peeves in cinema. Actors put on their best grimaces and wave their hands about without knowing what they're actually talking about, without any genuine passion, reciting the script word-for-word without any improvisation or interpretation. It reeks.Sully is not the only perpetrator here. Callan Mulvey continues in his success as a supporting actor in Hollywood, playing a nameless minor character who brings nothing of value or interest to the screen. He is, however, getting more screen time and starring in bigger and better films, which is good to see considering I remember him best from being in that domestic cop show ""Rush"", in which he was quite good. Career progression to one side, he absolutely annoyed me in Rise of Empire. Pointless role. The movie would truly be unchanged if he was simply removed from all scenes. Waste of money.There's a third Australian actor here too - David Wenham - who briefly reprises his role from the first film, only this time he was incredibly annoying. His accent was...what was it? It grated my ears just listening to him. Terrible acting, terrible dialogue to one side, surely you're saying ""You watch it for the action,"" but that's not true either. The slow-mo, smash-cut, extreme close-up, etc is all entirely predictable and repeated verbatim from the first film, lacking originality, imagination or flair. It's like they watched each set piece in 300 and then tried to copy it as closely as possible. I've seen it all before. Why try something new if you can't do anything different? The filters have changed from gold to grey, but everything else is the same. There's some additional 3d blood splatter. That's it really.The narrative itself happens side-by-side in sequence with the events of the original 300 and a large portion is told through lazy flashback or exposition. This left me confused as to what was going on at times - especially if you zone out or check your phone, as I was doing occasionally. Not to mention this just smacks of bad screen writing. On the odd occasion it works (the Usual Suspects), but you have to have actual talent for that. Snyder merely highlights his incompetence by storytelling this way. Much of the exposition was to illustrate the history of Greece and Sparta and to reiterate the events of the first film, the background of minor characters and other boring things that have no real importance to us. Again, bad screen writing. Not to mention the visual style of Rise of Empire is inherently flawed in that it is too confident in its technology. At times I was laughing out loud at the painfully obvious greenscreen backgrounds. There were some scenes with a visible distinction in lighting between the actor and the CGI background, or in fact, another actor standing across from them (CGI'd in). I could go on all day, but I won't. There are many other gripes I have with Rise of an Empire (lack of narrative arc, no rising and falling action, no suspense, no character arc, cookie-cutter characters lacking emotional depth, etc). If you haven't seen it already do yourself a favor and steer clear, as Rise of an Empire will spoil whatever fond memories of 300 that you might have.",300 - Rise of an Empire

208,mimosveta,Did Snyder plan to make this movie at the time of first one?,4,9 August 2014,"Cause if so, he should've done this one first. It's kinda nonsense to expect us, who enjoyed the first movie so much, to feel for and root for athenians, ""the philosophers, and boy lovers"" after all jokes spartans said about them in the first movie.Not that I think this movie was any good, unlike Gerard Butler, this lead had 0 charisma, choreography was not even remotely close to impressiveness of that of first movie, and they seem to be trying to hide how lame it is by enormous amounts of blood shielding us from clear view, it even lacks lines you can take out and quote, and it will not inspire you to hit the gym either. The only cool scene was when spartans finally join the battle at the end and there's that awesome fighting style where they just push forward and never turn back to finis who they missed, cause there's always another spartan to catch those enemies that wiggled trough before they even have chance to attack from the back. Even Gorgo refusing to send more spartans into fight at first, was like shovel in the face, cause spartans in the first movie were presented as true army nation, not a regular nation with an army.If his intention was to ruin the first movie, he did a decent job of it, but not good enough, nothing can diminish Gerard Butler's work. If his attention was to milk on the success of the first movie, he should've spent more time at the drawing board, more time casting decent lead, and more developing support cast (of which there's none here, and was so many in first movie). I know sequels are meant to suck, but this one is almost as if someone with lots of money and no imagination, liked the first movie and bought a completely new team to remake it, you can't even tell same people worked on it cause it feels as if it only tries to plagiarize the first movie, failing to ""plagiarize"" what made 1st movie so good, its creativity, its originality, and def its charm.Eva Green was cool tho, not that it's hard for her, she doesn't even have to act to achieve creepy, she just is",300 - Rise of an Empire
209,pablo2896,The sea turned red with CGI blood,7,15 March 2014,"My 300: Rise of an Empire review I just found out that the previous movie made by the filmmaker of this 300 sequel/prequel/parallelequel was a romantic comedy. He is such a badass.Speaking of badass, this movie's action sequences are even more badass than Noam Murro. He does an excellent job at making it look Zach Snyderish. The shots are chosen perfectly and remastered with sweet visual effects to make them look awesome. Like the previous 300 film the scenes are so stylistic they could come off as standalone pictures or paintings. Noam Murro is a talented man let me say that. Or Zach Snyder is a mind controlling wisp, that could be another option.The action sequences are beautifully done. They breed energy and they manage to get people hyped up about topless men fighting on boats while riding the waves. And the battles are put to the max by an actress named Eva Green. The villainous Artemisia feels like a threat and makes over acting cool again. Every scene she is in feels worth it. But the awesomeness meter is put to the test with the rest of the characters who wouldn't be able to hold the movie on their own. The actors try their best but the limitations clearly come from the script. The main hero is one of the victims. He does his best but the scenes he is in that include dialogue are too weak to keep our attention. Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes was another shining point in 300, and in this movie he is back with an origin story. I loved how they did it because they stuck true to telling it like a visual legend. Mystical and weird but cool.Another thing that caught my attention was the blood. I don't know why but there was something gooey about it that made it distractingly odd. I know it was made to put more style in the stylistic but they should have gone for something more from this world.And to end this review I am going to add that I like that they brought back some old faces from the original to please the fans and the ending left me wanting more and looking forward to something...? Cersei Lannister was cool to.This movie was worth the watch mainly because of the battle sequences which where unique and made everyone look like a badass and Eva Green's moments on screen. But the quiet moments with the heroes where mainly made of dull dialogue and encouraged yawning a little too much.I am giving 300: Rise of an Empire a 7 out of 10.",300 - Rise of an Empire
210,PadmeAgnes,Awesome graphic-novel art splendor,9,6 March 2014,"""Greece"" is under attack of Xerxes of Persia (ca. 480 BC). While Leonidas of Sparta is fighting in Battle of Thermopylae (""300""), Themistokles of Athens is preparing a sea battle at Salamis (this movie). Don't expect deep historic drama, wrong genre. This is graphic-novel art splendor and a strong sequel of 300. I was highly entertained and completely drawn into this world with amazing graphic art scenery and a high Asian Martial Art feel fight scenes. 3D is working during the sea battles but not really required. The introduction of Artemisia, Themistokles and Xerxes becoming the GodKing of Persia were cool but might be a bit confusing as it wasn't always obvious that these were flashbacks in the current story.Sullivan Stapleton as Themistokles did well, not Gerard Butler though. Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo was again a graceful power lady, GoTh made her even stronger in character. Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes is again hot, especially as his younger self. Eva Green as Navy Admiral Artemisia was one mean, bad lady, strong like in Kingdom of Heaven and occasionally I was more on her side than on the Greek's ... and her costumes are just ... fantastic!If I could rate half points, it would rate it 8,5 because 300 was in my opinion stronger, funnier and more dramatic but 9 rates are for films that I will see again ... and I will see this one again, mainly due to Artemisia, she was awesome.Ps If you don't like bloody scenes, it might be not your type of film",300 - Rise of an Empire

212,samgreer-694-680740,A sad disappointment,3,9 March 2014,"What a shameful exploitation of the name 300. This movie is a sad disappointment to the justice done in the original film. The writer, director, actors in the first movie all seemed to care about breathing life into a great historical story which happened to center around a great battle. Whatever liberties were taken for the sake of the first film were well thought out, appropriate, and in no way gratuitous. In other words the exact opposite of this train wreck. This prequel suffers from a total lack of character building, script, (there is no story) and if you take out the TOTALLY gratuitous (nearly x rated) sex scene between protagonist and antagonist you're left with 80 minutes of fighting. My only conclusion is those responsible for this film assume you saw the first 300, and got all the story and character development you needed from that movie and now want to see more CG effects and fight scenes. The deaths were not touching, the relationships were totally superficial and lacking ANY depth of emotion, and the motivational speeches fell well short of not only the first 300, but pale in comparison to Braveheart or even Elizabeth Swann's battle speech in Pirates of the Carribbean 3. To sum it up this movie didn't come close to evoking any emotion in me and I don't think it had any intention of doing so. I think it's intention was to grab my $20. Which it did. Mission accomplished.",300 - Rise of an Empire

The love scene was misplaced and not adding to the story at all and the sense of greatness of the Persian empire and the impact it has on the Greek world non-existing.What bugged me most is that almost the entire story is about naval battle, leaving you with constant questions like ""when are they coming out of the water?"" and ""where are those bloody Spartans!?""In the end, the movie is certainly entertaining, but you do feel like you missed out on something that could have been far better.",300 - Rise of an Empire

This is really unfair as a zero or negative number would more accurately describe my feelings for this horrendous piece of trash.This movie should be a good discussion starting point on why IMDb needs to implement a scoring system which goes to -10. Movies like 300 Rise of An Empire, Sacry Movie 5 and Haunted House 2 really beg for negative marks.Everything in that movie is bad and predictable. It's almost like they hired a child to write the story (which according to some IMDb reviewers does not even reflect what truly happened). The main actress was a pain to watch and listen to. The action scenes wreaked of 3D and not the good type of 3D. Everything dragged on and on and on, making me scream ""When will this garbage end!""

219,bkbirge,Some engaging moments but ultimately focus grouped schlock,4,17 April 2014,"Xerxes, what happened to you man? You were a god but in this you are a milquetoast. You were such a great villain in the first movie like some giant flaming transvestite serial killing wizard out of Harry Potter's most embarrassing wet dream. But in this they turned you into some little dude that gets openly mocked by his general! The Xerxes of the first movie would have killed everyone within earshot and then used their ears to cushion the soles of his sandals.More six packs, more oiled muscles, double the tough talking ladies compared to the first one (2!).This video game level takes place on ocean world. That's about how the movie hits and just as memorable as seeing the umpteenth stylized trope played out. It comes across as pure exploitation pandering to the 20-something male crowd, at least as the suits that control the money imagine them to be. Basically they said ""we must have MOARRRRR!!!"" but forgot to include story or character development in that statement.Sure there are a few nice fighting scenes, the look of the movie retains some of the cool effects from the first one. It just feels soul-less candy that is completely unfilling and rots your teeth. And it's not the good candy, it's the candy that's been on the shelves a little too long and you only eat it because you hope the next bite will be better than the last.Digital blood in buckets, scowly faced yet perfectly manicured 3 day shadow beards, skinny as heck warrior woman that we are supposed to believe can kick ass let alone walk against a strong wind.

224,themightyservo,Too Sympathetic A Villain,5,9 December 2014,"The problem with 300:Rise of an Empire straight up is that the villainess's story is too sympathetic.When her backstory is explained, it's far too easy to empathize with her, and at that point the protagonists' struggle doesn't seem as engaging.She may be harsh, but there's reason for much of it; and it made me lose interest in both the ostensible heroes and the movie.To give a parallel, it would be as if Kirk knew the Ceti Alpha system was unstable and knew he was dooming Khan's people. Khan's rage would be rather justified, and even Kirk's appeal to peace, while good for the innocents caught between the two fighting leaders, would ring hollow for the audience. Khan would be a much more rational madman, and Kirk might still be a hero, but one who'd done something wrong, and thus one that many in the audience would have difficulty siding with.300:RoaE suffers from roughly the same kind of thing.It's not really ""bad"" per se, but the issues with the main conflict mean it's difficult to get invested in the film. Without getting invested in the story, it turns into 300: Waterworld, with fights on boats, intricate character design, stylized shading, and a lot of ramping. It's pretty, but falls flat because there's less reason to care.Maybe there's a part in the director's cut that fixes Eva Green's character's interaction with the heroes and explains why we the audience are supposed to care about her loss and their victory, but from the viewing I had of it, I found her much more appealing as a heroine who'd been wronged than as a villain.",300 - Rise of an Empire
225,armin-durakovic,All in all an average mainstream fantasy/action,6,10 July 2014,"Well, this movie has so little in common with historical facts that I hardly forced myself to watch it. After few hopeless attempts to put my reason to the side and watch this movie impulsively as a mainstream fantasy/action, I finally made it and was not that disappointed, as I thought I would be. First of all, I am upset that they present Persian warriors like half- crippled bogeymen as that was the fact in the first movie. As I watched much of documentary movies that review decisive battles, I can say that most of the battle tactics shown in the movie were pure fantasy like the most of the movie. That's probably why it is a Fantasy movie. I didn't expected a better movie, because I watched the first movie and it is, as expected, very similar to it. The story is also above all reality with very poor dialogues (except few fight quotes and tries to sound poetic). Emotions that were presented from the queen of Sparta, which mourns her fallen king, and the father/son warriors that fight together, were not that impressive, so it is no use to mention it in detail. The only things that drive this movie are: Action-loaded, brutal and bloody fight scenes, CGI and special effects, stunts and somewhat the costumes and the computer generated scenery. All in all an average mainstream fantasy/action.",300 - Rise of an Empire
226,dramafreak42,Decently Done But Unnecessary,6,2 October 2014,"First off, I want to be clear that I'm doing this review without factoring in historical accuracy or potential political content. I understand that both of these issues have riled many reviewers, and justifiably so in some instances. However I'm tackling this strictly on its own merits and its relationship to the first film, which I consider myself to be a fan of (again, still understanding that many people take offense to it and I don't dispute their grounds for doing so.) With that out of the way, let's do this.The very notion of a sequel to ""300"" is a bit of a head-scratcher. Not only did the first film end with nearly every character dead, but it felt like a very complete story. There was nothing about the way that it ended that begged for a continuation. But if this was going to happen, this is a decent final result. It could have easily been a pale imitation of the first film, but instead it stands on its own feet, albeit not as firmly as the original.The film takes place over a more extended time line and the events of ""300"" actually take place within its runtime. So that means it functions as a prequel, sequel and sidequel to the first film. The decision to focus on the naval combat was a wise one, and it enables the film to use the same stylized action as ""300"" but still bring something new to the table. The action scenes are as intense as before, though CGI blood was badly overused. I'll grant it's been a while since I've seen the first one, but I don't remember the blood looking this fake or being spilled in such buckets.This film does an interesting job of putting the Spartan focused ""300"" into the greater context of Greece. It's interesting that the film was actually willing to somewhat undercut the importance of the events of the previous movie. The death of the 300 Spartans is symbolically very important, but it's actual tactical relevance brought down quite a bit. It doesn't feel like the film is backstabbing the first one so much as giving the big picture, which offers a new perspective. It's an interesting approach.Things fall down a little bit in the lead department. Sullivan Stapleton as the Greek hero Themistocles just doesn't have the gung ho charisma of Gerard Butler in the first film. Granted the character isn't meant to be the same type of leader, but it does feel like there's a void left that he doesn't properly fill. That might not have been such an issue if it wasn't for the best thing about the movie: Eva Green.To put it simply, Eva Green as the naval commander of the Persian forces completely walks away with this movie. She brings the kind of over the top but infinitely watchable performance that the first film had in abundance, but the rest of the cast isn't able to bring this time around. She is vicious, mesmerizing and sexy in a way that really is iconic. Her portrayal of Artemesia deserves to become a staple of ""kick-ass women in film"" lists. Her performance is able to turn what should have been a completely gratuitous sex scene into something truly fascinating: sex as combat. It really has to be seen to be believed.But in an odd way, how good Green is damages the film, because nobody else is able to get up to her level. Lena Hedley does decent work returning as Queen Gorgo, but she's there more as a link to the previous film than anything else. It kind of feels the same with Rodrigo Santoro returning as Xerxes: he's just there because he kind of has to be. Really this feels like Green's movie, everybody else is just along for the ride.If fans of the first film can go in understanding that it just can't be as fresh the second time around will likely come away having enjoyed the film. However it's not quite as rousing as the original, so newcomers are more likely to ask ""what's the big deal?"" and not see the appeal. If everybody else had been able to bring it as hard as Green did, this would have stood up to and possibly even rivaled the original. As it stands though it manages to not embarrass itself but is definitely an overall step down from the first film.",300 - Rise of an Empire
227,jukangliwayway,300: Rise of an Empire crumbles to dust even before managing to actually rise,2,4 July 2014,"Wait, haven't I seen this before? Oh yeah that has Gerard Butler in it and this one has ships and a forgettable protagonist as flat as a cardboard that not even Eva Green bouncing up and down his man pole could spark some life in him.It's not for the lack of trying, because it's evident from the gazillion gallons of blood used in this movie that they truly wanted to make a good film. Too bad that Zack Snyder did all of that in 300. It's nice to see some familiar characters with the addition of Eva Green (though I'm not entirely sold with her character, it's just that she's the only memorable one), because without them, it's like watching shirtless amateur actors with acting worthy of a TV movie. The whole duration of the film I was wondering how the hell did Noam Murro bag this gig and if he really thought that all the non-stop blood-spurting & Eva Green's boobs will ensure positive critical & box office reception? It earned more than 300 million dollars so I guess it worked. LOL.Oh and by the by, I could suspend my disbelief with almost everything, but I just couldn't force myself to believe that horse will gallop so valiantly in that ship, plank to plank, and run through fire, and jump into the water. Unless he is a Spartan.Snyder's 300, despite my ""meh"" attitude towards his green screen visuals, is still a solid action-pumped entertainment mainly because of Gerard Butler (and good ol' Fassie!). Now, without Snyder behind the camera and Butler on the screen shouting crazy yet awesome stuff like ""Tonight we dine in hell!!"", 300: Rise of an Empire crumbles to dust even before managing to actually rise. I was at least expecting some sort of ""THIS. IS. SPARTA!"", what I get is a half-hearted lame speech about democracy from Mr. Cardboard Man (gosh I don't even know his name). Typical of Hollywood, this is just another cheap attempt to cash in on a successful movie, bungling its simple formula, and inadvertently killing (hopefully for eternity) this franchise.My Rating: 1.5/5READ MORE OF MY REVIEWS AT: http://strangereview.blogspot.com/#sthash.k9wDSUgJ.dpuf",300 - Rise of an Empire

The lead female was probably the best actor in the whole movie. I am giving it a 2/10 and the first one a 6/10.

229,Sahl_95,The Movie Lives on its Feet,9,6 March 2014,"300: Rise of an Empire was a little different from what I initially expected. Assumed it was a sequel. However, it is more of a companion movie - a different view point of the events in 300 and the events after and some events before.I found the story to be entertaining. The Persians are still attacking Greece, but this time we watch from the view point of Athenian Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) while the events of 300 unfold elsewhere. The backstory of some old and some new characters were interesting to watch. The events which take place after 300 were awesome and led to some great battle scenes.And whilst 300 had plenty of fantastic battle scenes, Rise has some equally fantastic naval battle scenes. Ships wrecks, beheadings, one on ones, and battles were all awesome and entertaining. Watching Themistocles engage in naval tactics was quite fun to watch. The one on one (or multiple) combats were a bit better than the original. I found them rougher and just more fun to watch. Eva green as Artemisia was amazing. She was terrifying at times and great fun to watch. However, I did find a few scenes felt out of place and unnecessary. In saying that, the confrontations Themistocles and Artemisia more than made up for it. The ending of the movie was satisfying and to repeat myself, so was the final battle scenes. They were incredibly fun to watch. A very entertaining movie, especially since I was lucky to be able to watch them back to back on the big screen.",300 - Rise of an Empire

I love slow motion but only when it really makes a point-not for half the movie. And all that blood was very dramatized in a bad way. I did not care for unnecessary boobs in the beginning and the sex scene. Artemisia was thrusting more than the main guy and it made me uncomfortable because the guy behind me creeped me out. Also, I think it lost effect when Eva had her boobs out. It shows too much. I think it would be more affective and sexier (and I'm straight) if they didn't have girls show boobs. But I loved Artemisia! She was such a great bad girl to love! She led the boys! She was so badass and so were her outfits!

Think about it by giving it 1/10 you are saying it is one of the worst movie ever??? At worse this has to be average or above even out of this genre let alone within it.Story wise it is not exactly a sequel to the 1st 300 movie even thought it was made after it, it is in fact a fictionalized retelling of the Battle of Salamis and takes place before, during, and after the events of the 1st film.I'm not a fan of this genre but i was entertained by the original 300 movie i was also entertained by this movie too, yes the 1st had the originality about it and the freshness, of course it did, it was the 1st. This series of movies will probably be a trilogy and as with all trilogies the 2nd is usually the least entertaining only serving us with more of the 1st and/or developing characters from the 1st then following it up with the thrilling climax in the 3rd movie.Having watched many movies i knew what to expect from this and got exactly what i expected. What made the 1st 300 movie was how visually stunning it was and this continued to be stunning, maybe even more so with the challenge of the big action scenes on water. There is plenty of battles, interesting characters, slow motion scenes, blood, action, a load of bare chested men with 6 packs (If you like that sort of thing) and the gorgeous (and for a little while topless) Eva Green.

235,gopal4320-840-668506,A good movie gone bad,2,27 March 2014,"I sort of enjoyed the first two-thirds of 300 but the historical inaccuracies and bad story telling ate away at my ability to suspend disbelief. Themistocles, an able soldier, a man of formidable intellect, and a visionary single-handedly saved modern Western Civilization making him one of the most important figures in Western history. Had the Greeks lost the sea battle represented in this movie we would live in a very different world because Greece laid much of the foundation of our civilization. The Greeks twice defeated the greatest empire of the day in David vs Goliath contests. However the representation takes such liberties while telling a nonsensical story that I gave up on the movie. For instance Themistocles lured the Persians into a trap that ultimately led to the destruction of their fleet. This is not in the movie and I think would have been an interesting plot point. Themistocles was not trying to unite Greece into a single nation. Such a concept did not exist in Greece a country of independent city-states that had difficulty in getting along with one another much less outsiders. The Greek warships were superior to the Persian's and probably the best all round warship of the day. So with a brilliant strategy the Greeks, using a navy the third of the size of Persia's, destroyed a sixth of the Persian fleet. The Persians finally fled with the still outnumbered Greeks hot on their tail. That Sparta was reluctant to join Athens and other city-states in an effort to militarily resist Persia is true but ultimately they did as shown in the first ""300"" movie. After this battle the Persian war of revenge and conquest fell under its own weight. Unable to properly supply their army the Persians could not support their heretofore successful conquest of Greece. Had the movie had a coherent plot I would have forgiven the historical liberties just as I did in the first ""300"" but the story was badly told. It was colorful but hard to take. All in all ""300"" is disappointment for me.",300 - Rise of an Empire

238,gumperman,A good companion story to the first 300,7,15 March 2014,"Although I was never a huge fan of the first film (I did enjoy it, but I found it kind of forgettable) and from seeing the trailers for this film, was never that interested, I decided to give it a shot and see what it would be like. Plus I like Eva Green. This is what I thought; I liked the fact that it was a story that took place at the same time as the first film, so that was good enough to keep me entertained for most of it, but then there were parts that were poorly acted by the main star, Sullivan Stapleton. This film didn't have the greatest written dialogue, but I feel that the delivery was off and made one scene in particular kind of too cheesy for me. The other actors in comparison, made it work and believable. I was able to look past this small annoyance however and was able to enjoy the film for what I felt the director and writers were trying to convey. Plus Eva Green is in it and it shows her boobs. So if for no other reason, see this film for that. :)",300 - Rise of an Empire

240,vikram-ry123,A Storm Review : 300: Rise of an Empire (2014),8,18 March 2014,"Yesterday evening I went to Inox J.P. Nagar, Central Mall, Bangalore to watch 300: Rise of an Empire. I wanted to experience the show in theater. Finally my dream fulfilled quite accidentally. Yesterday 17th of March, it was Holi festival in India. As usual, I left my office at 7:00 P.M. at the evening and reached to the movie hall just before five minutes of the show.300 : Rise of an Empire is the continuation of the previous film 300, based on the Persian- Greco war. Legendary Spartan King Leonidas and his 300 soldiers into battle against the invading Persian army during the Battle of Thermopylae. According to legend, their valor and sacrifice inspired all of Greece to unite against the Persian foe, leading to the origins of democracy.Rise of an Empire, is circulated on two major characters, Artemisia I of of Caria and Themistocles of Athens. The film shows Artemisia, a Greek country girl was captured and grown up with ravish torture by Greek navy. Anyways she managed to escape and found by a noble Persian warrior. She learned how to fight in battlefield, and proved her generosity as a Persian woman navy commander. She wanted a revenge against her past hellish life experience with the Greek army. She led at the naval battle of Artemisium and the naval battle of Salamis.During the battle of Salamis, she died fighting one and one against Themistocles.On the other side Themistocles of Athens, who is a politician and visionary to build united Greeks. Queen Gorgo was leading Sparta after her husband King Leonidas's glorious death at the Battle of Thermopylae. Nobel by birth, Themistocles managed to convince Queen Gorgo to continue the battle against Xerxes I of Persia, who declared himself the God king. At the naval Battle of Salamis, Themistocles with his leadership ability, united the Greeks. Followed by his command and the Greeks managed to defeat the Persians.The graphic was highly extraordinary. Slow motion, 3D affects, navy battle scenes at the middle of the sea, and the legendary history emerged new heights in the history of the motion picture. I am not gonna rate the film based on the story and characters, as I think its a highly creative work.",300 - Rise of an Empire
241,puma31219,"Will 300 become another ""Matrix"" trilogy?",6,17 March 2014,"Seeing this movie and comparing it with the first film, put me in mind of the Matrix trilogy. In both cases, the first film was ground breaking and influenced every following film of it's genre. And in both cases, the second film did match up to the first one at all. And though it has not been made known whether or not the franchise will go in the direction of a trilogy, this film certainly makes it seem that it may fall victim to the ""trilogy"" formula that has been the ruin of many a good film. My expectations for this film were not at all what I saw in theaters.The ending to the first film left me very satisfied. It was clear that Greece would eventually defeat the Persians and that the Spartans held the bulk of that muscle. 300 did not need a follow-up film, but it did leave room for other stories. I thought that the second film would chronicle the end of the Greek-Persian war, from the Spartan perspective. I hadn't considered the story being told from the aspect of other Greek City-States that were involved in the conflict. This story of this film lacked focus and the overall quality of the final product paled in comparison to the first 300. The beginning of the film centering on the Athenians was a nice surprise. I figured it would be nice to see how the Persian invasion affected other Greeks and with Themistocles as the center, it was a nice touch. But the opening sequence went south when too much time was spent on Xerxes' origins. Normally, putting a face to an enemy that a main character would face on the battlefield can be interesting if not necessary to see. However, it just did not work with Xerxes. The whole sequence beginning after we see a young Xerxes watch his father die, felt unnecessary and somewhat excessive. It seemed like a failed attempt to include the original story line for the film, which was originally only supposed to be about Xerxes. And I personally wouldn't have wanted to see that film. Not since the popularity of the first film centered on the Spartans and their way of life. This sequence also made me realize the presence of the somewhat anachronistic title.""300: Rise of an Empire."" This film is about the rise of the Persian Empire? Then why is an Athenian Admiral the main character? Seems like more remnants of the original storyline trying to stay with the altered movie script. The casting for the film could have been better. While returning actors for established characters do not need to be reviewed, newer characters do. The character Artemisia was portrayed by French beauty Eva Green. And while Green's performance was not bad, it was not at all memorable. Green's approach to the role came off as an attempt at being sinister, rather than owning the role of a complex character. She was very mono-tone and unfortunately became boring. Even in the sex scene (which itself was also boring and predictable) she did not command attention without the camera panning to her breasts. Though the casting director wrote the role specifically for her, I think that there are a handful of other actresses who could have done a much better job with the role. Actresses such as Rhona Mitra or Diane Kruger would have put forth much better performances. I have loved Eva Green since Casino Royale but this was not her best work. The character Aesyklos, portrayed by Hans Matheson was also a very forgettable character. Not necessarily because of Matheson's acting, but because his character's impact and presence in the life of the main character was too similar to his role in ""Clash of the Titans."" In both films, he plays a right hand man to a Greek hero. Yet somehow regardless of one story being fact, the other being fiction, and the two story lines taking place decades apart he had virtually the same characteristics of the previous role. (As well as the same haircut) Another aspect of the first film that was the icing on the cake was the narration. The combination of good writing and the voicing of David Wenham made for a good show. His voice was perfect and maintained the audience's attention while he spoke and even stole the show while he was on screen standing opposite major other major characters. His voice was sorely missed in this film as was his presence on screen. And while it was lovely to hear Lena Headey tell a tale and even more lovely to see her wield a sword, she did not make the most intriguing story teller. Visually, this film did not introduce anything new that stood out. The scenery was somewhat repetitive and though the new aspect of battle taking place at sea was a change of pace, it was not overly captivating. A nice color scheme was the bright Blue cloaks that the Athenians donned. It was in perfect contrast to the Spartans, fitting of their role as Seamen and subtly reminded us who the heroes of this film were. (Although considering the ending, that title seems to fall again to the Spartans.) The musical score also did not stand out and did not raise the excitement level for scenes that should have been heart-pumpers. Themistocles was very well cast and Sullivan Stapleton did very well with the part. He had some charisma about him that pretty much carried the film considering that the stage that was set for him was not very sturdy. Overall, the film needed much polishing before it should have been released and this ""finished product"" leaves room for another film. And though trilogies are not always the best formula, I think one final film is all that can be afforded with this particular story line. If such does happen, hopefully 300 will not follow the path of the ""Spider-Man"", ""X-Men"" and ""The Matrix"" trilogies.",300 - Rise of an Empire
242,AverxgeJoe,The unnecessary sequel,3,17 December 2014,"300 was a passable movie. It didn't need a sequel however. 300 Rise of an Empire begins right were 300 left off. King Leonidas and his 300 warriors are slain in the battle of Thermopylae, by the hand of Xerxes' army. This movie features an Athenian general Themistokles who joins the battle against the Persians. The plot in this movie is as simple as it was in the previous one. A handful of warriors must beat a much larger force. This movie also features a new villain. Artemisia, the commander of Xerxes' fleet. The movie takes place on the sea for the most part. And the battles are fought on deck of ships.Queen Gorgo is still here from the last movie. She is once again played by Lena Headey. Her acting was mediocre as was the acting of the rest of the main cast. None of them made a great impression. Sullivan Stapleton occasionally delivered some good stuff, but overall it was still mediocre at best. Xerxes still has his annoying hoarse voice from the first movie.Even though the performance weren't that good they still sadly are the best part of this movie. Rest of the movie was really bland. This movie is the director Noam Murro's second feature film and he clearly hasn't mastered the tricks of a good director. The coordination of the battle scenes (especially the ones taking place on the sea) is bad. You can barely understand what is going on. The plot often contradicts itself and so do the characters. A character wants something, but then his motives illogically turn around on the course of the same scene. The plot is also illogical at times. The battle tactics are weird and lead to nothing, but forced and pointless drama between the characters.This movie is so full of visual effects and CGI and it shows. It's not realistic and it looks bad when every single shot and landscape is CGI. Another bad thing about the effects is the constant use of blood splatter. This wouldn't be a bad thing if the effects were good, but the blood splatter seemingly come out of nowhere and are laughably bad. This movie's budget was double than 300's. Yet the visual effects look two times worse. The filmmakers must have been incompetent or very lazy, trusting the fact that the fame of the first would make a lot of money in the box office, no matter what they do with the movie. And yes it worked. The movie did well in the box office.300 was directed by Zack Snyder. He is known for using a lot of slow motion in his films. 300 was full of slow motion. Too much for my taste and probably for many others too. Rise of an Empire is very faithful for this part of the first movie. There is random slow motion parts in each fight scene. And it makes them not only look bad, but also boring.",300 - Rise of an Empire
243,Mankindfails,Disappointing in many ways but watchable.,7,17 May 2014,"What I really liked about the first movie was that it had a unique feeling never seen before or since. It was like if someone would tell this legendary epic tale around a fire like in old times and while the story was told you had the surreal images like if they came out of the mind of a young lad imagining all this in his head.This epic effect is completely gone in this one... You never get that feeling no even for a minute. This one is more like the show Spartacus. Of course it was a deception for me but it could still have been a really good movie despite that. They kept the look, the colours, the exaggerated fighting moves, a bit of the mythical stuff and such. At least it still looks like the first one.The big problems are the poor choice of actors and the fact that the story is pretty lame, unimpressive, boring and banal.The main actor isn't bad but he's not special in any ways and he really doesn't look Greek, most Greeks don't look Greek, in fact the more they have an important role the less they look Greek. Greeks are not Americans... For example this guy called Hans Matheson... Look him up on IMDb ... He looks like a young British RedCoat or something... Certainly not a Greek soldier...Anyways... I gave it 7 because being related to the first one still makes it a watchable movie but it sure was a deeply flawed failed sequel.",300 - Rise of an Empire
244,jgutierrez81,Pretty decent (COMIC BOOK!) movie,7,23 March 2014,"this is one of those movies that was designed to be entertaining. this is not an Oscar winner, you won't see the critics rating this as amazing, but younger viewers and lovers of action or these ""epic"" stories will definitely enjoy themselves. i usually try not to be to harsh with movies like these mostly to be fair to the type or style of the movie. it's important to be fair in my view because these movies were designed to be fun action filled movies not Oscar winners. in the case of this movie...first off its not based on historical facts...its actually based off the Frank Miller comic book the 300 and its yet to be released sequel Xerxes, which itself is ""inspire"" by the real battle of Thermopylae (Hot gates) in which 300 Spartans and 1500 Thespians and Thebans died defending said hot gates. in the case of this movie, the comic book story (Xerxes) is inspired by the battle of Artemisium and Salamis...again ""inspired by""...and the movie itself is based off said comic book. so lets get to the review. as far as what i think...i liked this movie a lot, it lacked the feeling of anticipation and thrill i felt with the first time i watched the 300, but this was mostly because, i already saw the 300; so i already had a pretty good idea of what to expect. the story revolves around Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) who is an Athenian General who commands the Athenian naval fleets and attempts with no avail to get the help of the Spartans and create a unified Greek front against the Persian army. there are also several side stories such as the rise of Xerxes from a prince son of king Darius to the god king Xerxes. another important side story is that of Artemisia(Eva Green), a Greek girl whom after having lived a horrible childhood took arms against the Greeks in the name of Xerxes and the Persian empire as his General. many have said that there is a romantic subplot between Artemisia and Themistocles in to the movie...i say there was sex, rough sex, and yes there was an attraction but a romance is taken it to far. the story itself is actually pretty well told with several layer and subplots, the motivations of the characters were pretty solid. Themistocles feels responsible for the rise of Xerxes being that he killed Darius, his father which caused the rise of Xerxes god king. Artemesia is full of rage and willing to do anything to destroy Greece which she blames for her rough upbringings. Xerxes wants to prove that Greece can be defeated despite his fathers warning which he sees (do to manipulation) as a challenge given to him by his dying father. and Queen Gorgo, still morning Leonidas's death has to decide whether or not to go to battle and risk losing everything or doing nothing. as far as Action is concerned...bloody, relentless, and over the top...just how i like it...as far as special effects...amazing, it is a 300 movie after all. so why does everyone seem to hate or at least dislike this movie? a couple of reasons...many feel that the special effects were cartoony...which i can understand since the movies ambiance is based off the comic book ambiance. another point is that most people, i think, were expecting something different; but what gave the 300 that special place in everyones heart was that the film at that point was unique...and now its no longer unique so it loses that freshness that the original movie had. the original 300 also had a deepness that this movie lacked...the love that Leonides had with his wife was heartbreaking specially in the end of the movie and of course there was the death of the 300...who can forget that. in the end, this movie was pretty decent and a good stand alone movie in its own right. was it better than the 300, i would argue it lacked the depth that the 300 had but because it was different, not because it was a bad movie. in the end you should watch it yourself and make up your own mind. but understand...this is not the 300..and take it as it is...an cool comic book action movie.",300 - Rise of an Empire
245,CasualView,Heavenly hundred: Rise of Russia,4,11 March 2014,"It's mystery for me how Zack Snyder did it. Probably I'll never understand, unless he tells himself.First part of ""300"" has been released on the peak of tensions between Western world and Iran and caused much controversy. I even remember one egghead on TV said ""it's worst moment to release this movie now"". Yeah, and now on brink of war between Ukraine in Russia Zack, like, waves his burning lighter near the fuse AGAIN. Second part released with background of 300 Spartans (or 104 people on Euromaidan) dead in the previous part of the ""movie"" and fear of what many believe is Russian ""aggression"" under supervision of Xerxes (played by Mr.Putin) and Artemisia (played by Ms.Matviyenko)One more coincidence like this and I will believe that Zack is the prophet.I have never seen more historical lies in single movie than in ""300"". And I never got more historical truth because I watched it.I never imagined from my school history lessons that right to the East, parallel to slavery and madness of internal wars between ancient Greek cities where slaves were hunted like animals and philosophers publicly poisoned for ""blasphemy"", nearby existed tolerant Persian Empire, where slavery was forbidden and people could practice any religion they wish to. Would life be much better if Xerxes succeed and Alexander the Great never plunged onto his fruitless murder ride to the East?Overwhelmingly attractive hypocrisy of ""300"" and it's sequel did more than any political propaganda could ever do.Watching ""Rise of an Empire"" and comparison of this movie with ongoing real events in the world causes trembling feeling inside that geniuses like Zack do exist.

The film is a prequel into a sequel, which I liked, it explained a lot of things. The film isn't short on blood & guts, which I think you would expect after 300, & the slo-mo fighting scenes are back.I liked Eva Green in Casino Royale & Jack O'Connell in various other ventures so I was happy to see them 2 added to the bill. I hadn't seen Sullivan Stapleton in anything else but I thought he made a pretty badass hero, like Butler in 300.I am very happy that I went to see this film, & it looks like there may be an opening for a third installment, exciting!",300 - Rise of an Empire

Sullivan Stapleton gives a firm and good performance, but is without doubt no Gerard Butler, although you really cannot compare the two roles (also in history Athens and Sparta were two very different city-states. Without wanting to give away too much information, 300 rise of a nation is must-see that is a fair successor of the original movie and explains a lot of story lines.

I'm not even going to get into the 100 inaccurate historical facts the makers try to normalise in this horrendous CGI bullock. Rather grabbing the untruth about the Eastern AND Western social and traditional values in the antiques. We all know that in the ancients there were no female soldiers, warriors or even any sort of high ranked army personalities. It's a proven fact, simple. Trying to introduce two women as the generals (or whatever you'd like to call them) is simply pathetic. If you want to give roles to women in your movies, act appropriate. In the modern time women are at every possible high ranks in the army or whatever, but in the antiques, it was simply not just the case.

249,Pavan_Daggupati,Style and Belligerence,6,7 March 2014,"Rise of an Empire shows the Battle of Artemisium where Athens general Themistocles(Sullivan Stapleton) fights with Persian naval commander Artemisia(Eva Green). On the parallel side to this, the Battle of Thermoplyae happens between King Leonidas of Sparta and King Xerxes of Persia which we've seen in the earlier part 300. Rise of an Empire also shows Xerxes past and the events after 300 in parallel with the naval war. All the graphic violence in the earlier part appears in this one too. Perhaps thats the reason why we flock to theaters. But this installment lacks the 'Act of Valor' of Leonidas and his troops that made 300 a smashing hit. The cult fan base of 300 will be satisfied enough and the people who like graphic violence can give this a shot but for others its just a good looking video game.Sullivan Stapleton was OK but the film lacks Gerard Butler's presence. Eva Green stole the show as Persian naval commander and she was the highlight of the film. Lena Headey didn't had enough screen time but she did a good job.Noam Murro honestly imitated the style of first film but Zack Synder would've done a better job. Murro delivered a stylish one but the script didn't allowed him to elevate the film even then it was a mediocre attempt.Cinematography was good but most of the shots had lens flare which distracts our eyes but its the CGI that stands tall out of the whole film. Original Score was good at times but mostly we hear the loud noise. Editing was crisp. Just when i thought all this was UN-necessary, they've given a cliffhanger at the ending. May be a 'Return of the King' vibe for a third part? We have to wait for that. For now fans will eventually see this one because ain't bad but ain't that good either for others to run to theaters.",300 - Rise of an Empire
250,Mtoomb,Don't Believe the Haters,8,27 March 2014,"Listen, I'll keep it brief... 300:Rise is a worthy sequel to one of the most overrated pieces of pulp trash out there. We don't have enough navy battle movies, and this one boasts some kick-ass ship-to-ship action. Yes there is so much CGI blood you could fill ten Red Weddings, but so what? Everyone heaps praise onto the first movie, but beyond looking cool as hell, 300 was soooo cheesy and took itself SO seriously, you can't help but giggle through the whole thing. It's basically soft-core. So 300:Rise is exactly what you would expect in a sequel... Slow motion, monologues, epic cinematography, and sweet ass special effects. If you're expecting Rome or Game of Thrones you're watching the wrong movie. But come on, Eva Green alone is worth the price of admission. Then again I'd probably pay $8.50 to see her drink a Coke for an hour and a half... But that's because the woman is gorgeous. And that's the thing about this movie. It's gorgeous. All flash, little substance, even less history... But what the hell man? You paid to see the sequel to 300. What exactly were your expectations? Mine were met and exceeded. If you're a die hard 300 fan, this movie is probably not or you. Which is weird... Because it takes itself less seriously and still manages to kick ass.

251,GodofGSXR1977,Rise of the 300's B-Team,3,7 March 2014,"1. The back story of the villains in this film is more interesting than the story of the 2-dimensional leads in it. 2. The cartoon blood was distracting. I half expected to see some ACME Anvils land on some Persian dude's head. 3. The slow motion to fast motion gimmick was old 5 years ago, and if we want to see 300 style action sequences, we will watch 300. Beautiful imagery, but I'd rather see paintings of it rather than 2 hours of slow- mo. 4.Under explained stakes and characters. I still have no idea why anyone was fighting and what they were fighting over really. And furthermore I felt more sad for the lead villain who was raped repeatedly as a slave child rather than the leading men who think it's cool to have sex with the enemy. And the other heroes from 300 are a culture of people who not only beat children but discard BABIES if they are not born perfectly. These are our heroes? The Persians at least didn't mention that in their back story. 5. This film is almost all exposition. Nearly 80% of the dialogue is either Braveheart style speeches to 10,000 soldiers who somehow can hear one man without a microphone, or two over-acting characters speaking in inconsistent British accents to remind the audience of what's going on and what they're going to do. 6. If you can't get Gerard Butler to perform ANY speaking lines in the film, just cut him out completely. It was laughable how many times they did the ""OH, Your favorite character, GERARD BUTLER, JUST left..you JUST missed him..so here is stock photos from the last movie of him...and oh his wife and this guy were in the last movie...and you know them...so they will speak on his behalf"" 7. King Leonidas' wife is just as skilled as any Spartan on the battlefield and leads them from the front lines? OK. 8. If Hollywood is going to only make remakes, reboots, and adaptations of earlier works, they should at very least think a bit more on the script before pooping it out. There is no substance in this film, no real story, no stakes, and worst of all, no serious supporting actor. 9. On a positive note, the extras in this film are HILARIOUS. Comedy gold. 10. I cannot take this movie seriously, and I am their target audience. Worth a DVD rental for some fun, but even in 3D it gets old.Try again Hollywood cash-cow Inc.",300 - Rise of an Empire

It was more of action sequence and lesser of story. The biggest dismay was Themistocles failed to impress as Leonidas had sent shivers down spine. The Persian's terror""fest"" army of immortals was almost absent. But there were some spectacular scenes which will leave your jaws open and heads swim. For a change, it's very good attempt for the very new director Noam Murro. The second of the in line sequels, it leaves the audiences still hungry for next.

253,jason_leo,Rated good by part time movie watchers. Nothing on the original. Lacking in so many ways,3,9 March 2014,As a movie it is OK but as a sequel to 300 it is insulting at best. As soon as the movie begins the first thing you notice is its in full colour and within a few minutes you realise that a lot of it has been shot around the basis of 3d. I'm not a massive fan of 3d however i don't mind it when it fits to the film whereas the film fits to the 3d here instead. Gone is the slow motion beauty although it is attempted it seriously falls flat. If that is not enough the huge army of Persia is gone and instead the film is pretty much boat based which is dull at best. The whole movie is contained in the trailer. The whole get from a to b in a special way at the end was about as unbelievable as it gets. The title is fully misleading as Spartans hardly appear at all except for about two minutes and despite attempting to explain why a god-king becomes a god-king there is no empire included in this movie save for the few boats.If you enjoy action movies for something to watch this is OK it passes the time. If however you find the original 300 stands apart for the visuals and the fight scenes then do not waste your time you will be disappointed. It is annoying to me that they used the 300 name which made me want to watch it as it really was a average film at best,300 - Rise of an Empire

255,emp2687,Insult to intelligence,2,7 August 2015,"This movie is plainly horrible. Not only it defiles history but it denies laws of physics, chemistry and even biology. Let me try to list a few things that come to mind: A man jumps of a cliff, lands on his feet, doesn't break his legs. Doesn't even twist an ankle. Wearing armor in battle is somehow bad, man must be muscular and mostly naked. Even though the men are mostly naked, few have a tan... hmm... A man enters a ""magical"" pool and emerges a giant twice the size and for some reason wearing a lot of gold. Oil which normally is a slow burning substance, has ability to explode with the force of TNT. Persians have mastered building ironclads, 2000 years before ironclads were invented. There is enough Persian ships to put them side by side, forming a bridge across a sea. That's about 50 miles. If each ship is 20 yards wide, it would take about 4000 ships. A force of 200 ships was considered a huge fleet and the greatest naval battle of that time that is featured in the movie had less than 700 ships combined.

I am not a big fan of the first 300, but I have to say that I enjoyed the stunning visuals Snyder brought to screen and the good quality acting in the first movie.I have to say that there was almost nothing good about 300: Rise of an Empire, directed by Noam Murro the viewer is left uncomfortable with the ugly colour balance and soft focus, the colour balance was just terrible, most of the movie was dark (almost black and white) and the sky was glowing throughout the film, which was very distracting and very uncomfortable, obviously blood was a big factor in the film, but with this colour balance it just seemed unnecessary. The soft focus was another problem, I found it very hard to sit through one and a half hours of soft focus, it really made me feel uncomfortable. I can't say that the fight scenes were bad, but they just did not live up to my expectations, unlike it's predecessor the slow motion was used at the wrong times and the fight scenes just seemed messy, just like the camera movements that made me feel like I was watching a family movie.The movie didn't really have a plot, seriously, it felt like I was watching a long wrestling match, the writers did not make it clear on what's happening, I was wondering is this a sequel? prequel? Is it a spin off? Apparently it was all of them , yes, it was a sequel prequel spin off of 300, where although we get great back stories they are completely ignored in the film (Xerxes's back story was interesting, but what was the point?) Other than that there was nothing good about the plot, it was filled with cliché's like the very predictable father dying cliché. Other than Eva Green's acting, which saved the film, every other acting was terrible, Sullivan Stapleton is no Gerard Butler, he was just unconvincing as a leader, and I wish we saw more of Xerxes, he is a great character.Overall, 300: Rise of An Empire is bad, it does not live up to it's predecessor, and it's overrated, it just seemed like a cheap parody of 300.",300 - Rise of an Empire
257,findingdevotion,300 - reloaded,3,10 March 2014,"I'm not a fan of 300 but I am a fan of Frank Miller's graphic novels, which is the main reason why I chose to watch these movies.Unlike other Frank Miller adaptations, 300 and its current sequel offer absolutely nothing to the viewer except 6-packs and gore. Sin City and even Wolverine depicted worlds, enclosed in their own rules.Rise of an Empire draws upon history and manages to make a fool of itself. While anyone can agree that accuracy or factuality isn't and shouldn't be the purpose of a movie, the degree to which contemporary popular culture references and stereotypes find a place in something that should be connected to Ancient Greece is more than laughable: it just doesn't make sense.Rise of an Empire is an evolution from the 6-pack sausage fest that was the original 300: they now bring into focus a pair of female strong characters who bear the name of historical heroes which are way more interesting than the bland, 2-dimensional creatures they portray in the movie.Even worse, there's absolutely no reason for this movie to also be called '300'. The first time around it was a reference to the number of Spartans on the field of battle. Here it has no place at all. Replace '300' with anything else and it might make slightly more sense: 'Two Women: Rise of an Empire', 'Gorgo: Rise of an Empire', 'How Come a Tiny City Managed to Produce 100 times more ships than the rest of the city states in the area despite having a culture of war on land: Rise of an Empire'.On the other hand the visual effects are quite amazing, although not groundbreaking, which is why I decided to give it a 3 instead of -1.

258,kmylwnas,Sunk like those ships,4,30 March 2014,"I do not really know where to start here. I wanted to like this movie, and I enjoyed parts of watching it, definitely did not want to leave the theater, but left me a bad flavor in the mouth. I will not tire you all with the true story inconsistencies, as it is obviously a fiction story. However the first movie was 90% accurate to the known story, and was awesome, while this one was 90% fiction and sucked! Should have sticked to the true awesome story again.First of all, except Eva Green who did a tremendous job, and of course Xerxes who we already knew, I think we had lots of miscasts here. First of all the actor who played Themistocles did a good acting job, but failed to built the proper physique. I know Athenians were not that built as Spartans by choice, which makes sense, since Spartans were training for war since children, but he looks untrained in many scenes and with fake abs. Still, he did a solid work, but failed also to make his character (and thus the rest of the Athenians) likable. I mean, I kinda hoped Eva Green would totally kick their ass in the end, and I am Greek! I even knew how the story ended, but I preferred the bad-ass Artemisia than those Greeks. For the miscasts, the father-son side-story had no real emotion or chemistry. Wealready seen similar story on the 1st movie. The part of queen Gorgo was lame too. I mean, you could not cast Gerard Butler, I understand that, and I truly believe a small appearance would actually help the story evolve and uprise the movie. But why go all the way and give Gorgo such a major part in the story (not to mention that Spartans in reality had a laughable navy)? She actually killed a few Persian warriors in a few secs. What the hell?? Oh! And she miraculously turned to a fully black-haired queen, probably to not confuse the character with the Game Of Thrones one, and be likable instead! That was awkward to say the least. By the way, the final scene with the horse was utter bullshit to say the least.The direction was also bad in parts, with the constant slow-motion scenes and poor editing. Did not mind the blood though. I also could not find the extreme nudity that everyone was talking about. I only saw Eva Greens tities (which were awesome!) and another pair at the beginning of the movie, and that was it. What are you people crying out about??They will probably make another sequel which I am pretty sure it will be even worse.",300 - Rise of an Empire
259,nourytourangeaualexandre,Good but original is really better,6,25 July 2021,"300 Rise of Empire movie is probably a good movie but has some flaws. In the title one can think that the film returns to the origin of the battle think again! The film takes place at the same time as the suicide battle of Leonidas (Gérard Butler) but at sea and against an even more powerful army. Certain passages leave me perplexed ... yes of course one can face a lot of enemies with an excellent strategy but to have a marine confrontation 50 Greek ships against 300,000 Persians is a bit too much. The fights intensify which gives that electrifying side but the special effects of average quality make the experience a little disappointing. Several unrelated sex scenes like the one (spoiler alert) where Themistokles and Artemisa meet on his boats to negotiate. Negotiation which will culminate in a steamy sex scene that I really did not understand. Well, Eva Green and Sullivan Stapleton are probably the only characters that have been worked well by the writers. 6 stars and nothing more.",300 - Rise of an Empire

The action/fighting scenes were amazing but as good as they were it made for many unbelievable moments. Not as good a 300 due to the lackluster acting. A lot of battle scenes and blood to satisfy the typical action movie lover. Beyond that there is not much to gain from this follow up to the superior original,300 - Rise of an Empire

Also its a 300 movie, you know what you are going to get. I think its fair to say this movie passes the time but it is what it is. It may be wrong to expect them to do a better job on bringing an interesting moment of history to life. The Athenian Navy knocking hell out of the Persian Navy is as cool as the original 300 Spartans story but this time there are bigger elements of the Sparticus TV series creeping in. More sex more lurid eye candy and while I'm not going to complain about Eva Green getting her kit off it just feels formulaic and added just to keep the 13 year old boys happy. It's all a bit fanboyish. The original movie 300 had a statement to make. it was about standing your ground against overwhelming odds and yelling a proud defiant ""Rarwoo! Rarwoo! Rarwoo! and uniting a country by your sacrifice. Think the Alamo. Think The Magnificent Seven or the Wild Bunch. Rise of an Empire never makes you wanna quote lines in the way that Gerrad Butler did in the original. Eva is very cool and great eye candy and the Athenian hero is also cool and charismatic but the movie misses its target and we have that TV series Sparticus. Thats not all bad, but to be brutally honest this sequel fails equal its predecessor. If you are stuck in door with time to kill then knock yourself out but please don't do another one.I'll wait for someone to do a movie about Sir Francis Drake taking on the Spanish Armada, that could prove to be the movie 300: Rise of an Empire should have aspired to be.",300 - Rise of an Empire
262,tyse1,For glory's sake....War!,7,9 March 2014,"The words spoken in the trailer by King Xerxes perched precariously atop his Health and Safety test-failed balcony provide the perfect plot summary for this action-packed sequel. Adopting an 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' approach, this second installment in the 300 franchise chooses to throw what story line there was from the first film completely out the window, and focus entirely on the things that its target audience are really interested in: blood, boobs and stylized gore. Did i mention there was blood?Not that this is all bad though. Going into the movie it must be said that I wasn't expecting much in terms of a deep and engaging flick, but was more there for the big screen experience of 3D guts being splattered against the camera lens, essentially what the trailer was implying. And I got exactly what it said on the tin. Don't bother trying to analyse this film on too many levels as its technically a pretty awful film. But if insane stylized wars are your scene then you're in for a treat. I can honestly say that there wasn't really a dull moment in this film, and with character testosterone levels set to maximum (both visually and mentally), the wars themselves (of which I believe there are about five in total? - so many I lost count) proved almost better than part one.In conclusion, if you're a fan of clever, inventive and well-acted films, then this may not be your cup of tea. On the other hand, if you're a Zack Snyder fan who wasn't a fan of the first 300 because there wasn't enough ground and pound, then bring popcorn and soda, fasten your seat belt and enjoy the ride.",300 - Rise of an Empire
263,Reverie5,"Enjoyed it, especially Eva's performance",7,14 March 2014,"If Artemisia ruled instead of Xerxes, I'd be cheering her on. Her character really had that frighteningly powerful leadership quality, something that was missing from Themistocles. Sullivan Stapleton did great as Themistocles. I like his work in Strike Back the TV series. He was somewhat inspiring, but couldn't compare to Leonidas who made me want join him and make it 301. The movie overall was entertaining and enjoyed the naval combat, which is a bit refreshing compared to all the massive land battles in LotR. Did not like the dark murkiness of the whole picture, even the blood was muddy. Sure it was mostly evening battles, but I got tired of seeing only blue and black. Did not like the overuse of slow-motion in the beginning, which felt like 30 solid minutes of complete slow-motion footage. I don't mind the whole story and how it's not historically accurate. If I wanted a history lesson, I'd read a book or watch the History Channel. spoiler? ahead) What I really don't understand is why Queen Gorgo needed coaxing to send aid. I may have to watch 300 again, but I thought she wanted to send all of Sparta's troops to wage war against Xerxes. Or was it just to help Leonidas, and when Leonidas lost, she thought it was useless to send troops to defend Sparta? Or she only wanted to use her warriors to defend only Sparta and instead of the entirety of Greece?",300 - Rise of an Empire

Its all well connected, has strong characters', good action and plot. This movies sequel was a disaster. How can someone rate it 7?? I guess IMDb is flooded with teens who are either playing PS4 or chatting on their facebook accounts while writing reviews. To anyone with just a little intelligence this movie deserves a 3, and that being generous. It feels like you're reading 8 different comic books. The movie is made of eight 15 minute stories that are badly connected to each other. Don't get me wrong. I like movies that mix a little history with fantasy, but they went way over the edge. Made a complete artificial plot with loose ends everywhere. You don't know where one scene ends and another one begins. Tried to copy the first one in every detail, and failed miserably. Actually, its the firs movie, but ON WATER.

In the sequel of the 300 movie, I believe the makers of the movie spend so much time on making the movie with 3D and visual effects. In the beginning of the movie when Spartan attack the soldiers on the beach, they are slaughtering the soldiers and massive amount of blood fly around and you will notice the Spartan swords are not even bloody.As the movie goes on, and the story teller talks about how Xerxes get possessed by evil power and so on, it seems once again the makers of the movie tried to insult the history of Great Persia and Persian kings. Maybe a bit studying history doesn't hurt and at least would help the makers of the movie to get a better understanding of Persian Empire.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerxes_I_of_PersiaAlso, in the beginning of the movie in a short scene shows that Persian soldiers are trying to rape a Greek woman, which sounds ironic as during the ruling of Xerxes and his descendants the Human Rights had a very high value as even women had a higher pay comparing to men and they get rewarded from the king when they deliver a new baby.

Yes they made an effort showing unrealistic props, backdrops and--partly--visual effects but its not close to the original. The challenge of the battle at hand is nothing like the original ; the sense of impending doom is gone. The leaders clearly lack the charm of the original and the pleas to the soldiers fall short on the audience.Here's better-suited titles: * Greece fuelling revenge * How Sparta came to trust * Half-kneeling after all * Spartans rescuing GreeceNothing about 300 in those titles.

270,prabhat_kataria,Reasons why you'll forget this movie 10 minutes after viewing it.,1,7 March 2014,"I'll be honest here. I wasn't a big fan of 300. The script was pretty basic but what worked was the production values, the action, casting and .. the dialogues. That it what made it the moderate entertainer that it was.Now comes the sorry sequel. Here you'll find a short list of things that make this movie un-watchable --The story- Its like 300 all over again, minus the intensity and masculinity. Its terrible. There is no innovation , clearly the writer and director were short of any inspiration that could make the story adequately satisfying on any level. There was a kind of side story involving a father and son which was probably the worst part of this distasteful movie. By the end , i didn't care what happened to anybody as long as it happened quickly .0/10The dialogues- So amateur, so freaking juvenile. Probably due to absence of script, the actors (oh the wretched actors!, will come to that later) were made to improvise and blurt whatever seems to be right-ish.Example-Warrior: There will be death and destruction!Themistocles: Yes... (long pause) Themistocles: There will be.And not to forget ,SEIZE THE GLORY!!. 0/10The casting- The actors ,all of them, even Queen Cercei, were just going through the motions. The lead guy was seriously miscast. He tried to pull a Butler, but failed...epically. Eva Green tried to do what she could with what she had, but she never had enough. Her scenes became monotonous after a while. The side actors could easily have been crew members who were given roles just to get on with this crap-fest. The only strong character , i.e Xerxes was given about 6 minutes of screen time. Its almost as if Zack 'The Hack' Snyder wanted this movie to fail, and fail it did. 2/10 (only for Rodrigo Santoro)The production- Now this is what made the original...well mediocre. I honestly believed that the movie will stand out in this department. Now heres what i observed. Although made on a budget of 100 million, the effects were god-darn terrible. At times it felt like i was watching a TV show. Spartacus has 20 times better production value than this mess of a movie. The battle scenes felt like the opposite of epic. Has this director ever shot any action scene before, let alone a battle! I think not. I've seen better choreographed fights in Monty Python and the Holy Grail and i believed that about sums it up. 00/10The direction- Probably a first timer, a clueless director just trying to follow a blind man's footsteps. I am not saying that a good director might have been able to pull it off, but this guy just added insult to injury. 0/10.The climax - Don't care. Just Frickin end it and i'll be off. 0/10And the absolute worst part-- There's gonna be another one. When people will forget how bad this was , Mr Snyder will lay another crap on us. YAY!!Don't watch it. Please. Or if you're so darn inclined to punish yourself, i'd suggest you go easy on yourself and just watch 2 back to back recent Adam Sandler Movies.",300 - Rise of an Empire

The girl, cant remember that ancient name, was also nothing great. I was expecting a little more action but dialogues just kept running. Xerxes would have been real fun to watch in a fight.Also, Could be better if some technology advancement was shown in terms of weapons and some new fighting techniques.Overall just a flick you would like to see only based on the good work behind the 1st part.

272,HerbsReviews,Ancient Greece Has No Limits,8,1 April 2014,"""Better we show them, we chose to die on our feet, rather than live on our knees!""""300: Rise of an Empire"" will be no surprise in delivery other than it is possibly better than the first? There will, still, be fight scenes reminiscent of flawless dance moves, and the great choreography is what lends the film to being a great 'dance' movie (hello Step-Up 3hundred). The difference in approach comparatively between the two films would be the perverse nature of the second's delivery of the story at hand. The first had a far more romantic predisposition.A pretty obvious notion is that no other film does better with the long continuous shots of action with the occasional slow motions. This is a wonderful style to marvel on, for those who like these kind of things (I do!). This is the main reason I came to watch this, yet it is not the only thing that impressed me. But before moving on, I want to further claim that I seriously enjoyed these style of shots and frankly, all...ALL of the action sequences. They are just marvelous and glorious to watch and from minute one, I was attached and just smiling on every fight sequence.Still on the matter of action sequences, they are better in visual quality & dynamics of the setting, although I suspect the reason may be the budget and resource constraint on the first film. If Snyder had this the last time, it would be as good as this. Fortunately, Rise of an Empire, even in the hands of new director Noam Murro, didn't mess it up and brilliantly improves upon it. And though the quality of visuals were not perfect (such as the blood effects), the style is just so gratifying to watch. One last thing, the soundtrack is genuinely amazing, and is unbelievably fitting for the scenes. Even before the action begins, my heart pumps up, and during the fight itself, the soundtrack did good to enhance the suspense of the action. Words are not enough to explain it...you have to listen to it first hand.As Themistocles, Australian actor Sullivan Stapleton is fine, though he lacks somewhat the charisma Gerard Butler showed playing Leonidas in the first film. But Eva Green as Artemisia is magnificent, magnetic, by far the most charismatic character of the film. Rodrigo Santoro is back as (a very fantastic) Xerxes. Lena Heady reappears briefly as Gorgo, Queen of Sparta. There are very fine action scenes involving naval battles, but the movie's best scene has Artemisia bringing Themistocles to her boat to ostensibly discuss peace, but it all ends up in a heated sexual rump.Like the first, ""Rise of an Empire"" is undoubtedly clothed in beauty, from the moonlighting to the muscled bodies, the supple breasts to the eloquent sprays of blood, the film is about an aesthetic which is part of the story. Is it masking a lack of story? definitely not, it is the story.""300"" was ground breaking at the time of release, ""Rise of an Empire"" merely perfects that first step into a world of a different, and maybe more enigmatic, way of story telling. For these reasons 300:Rise of an Empire gets a 8.5/10.",300 - Rise of an Empire
273,divingsofla,Unnecessary politically correct,2,6 July 2014,"I am wondering why do they have to stick women in power into very single movie and show these days ? this is a movie about war and Sparta , there were no women commanding armies at the time .

Do you see a guy leading the cast of Sex and the City ? no , right ? so why do we have to see women generals in Sparta, women commandoes kicking asses all over the place in later war movies ?

It is just out of place that is all just like of you see a move based in Wyoming or MOntana , you don't expect to see a bunch of latino guys talking in Spanish and playing soccer, right ? or if there is a show about nurses , you won't expect an all male cast, right ? there is some things that make it real or not, that's all I am saying..",300 - Rise of an Empire
274,TyRawrrnosaurus,"Lacks the Integrity of the Original, but that Eva Green Though",5,7 March 2014,"After seven long years, the commercially praised 300 finally receives its prequel/coincidequel/sequel with 300: Rise of an Empire. In an attempt to reignite life back into fans with an all new cast of characters to rain chaos down on Xerxes and his Persian army, Rise of an Empire sadly does not come close to bringing the same caliber of excitement 300 had. Check out the full spoiler-free review of the film after the break.Taking into consideration that the naval Battle of Artemisium between Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) and Artemisia (Eva Green) coincides with the Battle of Thermopylae – the tale of 300 and King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) – 300: Rise of an Empire is pretty historically accurate. But of course we need to add Frank Miller's razzle dazzle, colorful characters and monsters, thousands of buckets of CGI blood, and as much violence and sex as possible – and then add more violence on top of that. Rise of an Empire also tells the story before Thermopylae and the 300 Spartans as well as the aftermath thereof.For a story that takes place before, during, and after the events of its predecessor, 300: Rise of an Empire has a tall order to fill. And for being less than two hours, the film feels excruciatingly longer than what the time line of the narrative suggests it would be. In fact, 300 is 13 minutes longer and takes place over a shorter period of time than Rise of an Empire. What makes this movie such a monster to endure is the disconnect between uninteresting character developments sans Artemisia and the abundance of ultra violence and mayhem.Rise of an Empire works out of the same mold 300 did whereas it stylizes violence in the most visually compelling way while incorporating as many slow motion shots as possible. If it was their ultimate goal to match the vision of Zack Snyder, but with darker tones shot in 3D, then the filmmakers have succeeded on all fronts. Moviegoers looking for that same effect won't be disappointed by any means. Surprisingly the 3D isn't that terrible either. The worst offender of the cinematography is the random, extreme close ups of the action and our inability to follow the scene clearly. Composer Junkie XL does a decent job at matching the heavy metal sounds of Tyler Bate's original score from 300, so much so that it feels familiar in tone yet he is able to make it his own.However, beyond the aesthetics, Rise of an Empire fails to create a sense of satisfaction or accomplishment through all of the cut limbs, slit throats, and bloodbaths that worked so well in 300. The stakes of Themistokles and his Athenian warriors are not conveyed as well personally as those of the Spartans. The theme of freedom throughout Greece is hammered home repeatedly by the many lackluster speeches spoken by Themistokles. Unfortunately, Stapleton lacks a certain level of confidence, swagger, and charisma that Butler had; and being physically fit only covers half of the role. It's as if he just tried to mirror Butler's Leonidas without trying to make the character his own.And equipped with nipple shields, no help is given by his comrades played by Hans Matheson, Jack O'Connell, and Callan Mulvey, who have less character and personality than a head of cabbage. Unlike the Spartans, we do not get enough facts to support these men in war other than the fact that their homes are being threatened. The Athenians are all able to leave the battle whenever they would like because they are free Greeks and that message hasn't been said enough, but they choose to stand by Themistokles' side with little or no reasoning because YOLO, practically. Every Athenian death doesn't really amount to much unlike the Spartans who fought to make Greece realize their stupidity.But luckily for us, 300: Rise of an Empire has Eva Green, whom without this film would be as lifeless as Kristen Stewarts' eyes. Green's portrayal of Artemisia lights the screen on fire with so much energy, raw passion, and enthusiasm; she may be the only one who understands they're in a 300 movie. Artemisia is so ruthless, cunning, sexy, and absolutely terrifying that she easily joins the ranks of some of the most feared villains in the history of cinema. Whether she uses her tactical prowess to dominate out on the high seas or in the bedroom, the power Artemisia possesses is unmatched by anyone else. Eva Green makes me believe in a world where more strong, female villains in Hollywood need to be realized.Despite having a much larger scale and an increased budget, director Noam Murro was defeated by a lukewarm screenplay written by Zack Snyerand Kurt Jonstad, which he himself should be to blame as well as a director for not improving on the material he is given. Rise of the Empire also doesn't work too well as a standalone film, as it often brings up many references and characters from 300 to remind us of a better time at the movies. Murro has a decent eye for action, but pays too much attention to Artemisia's development than anyone else, making the survival of the Athenians 300: Rise of an Empire hard to care for without truly understanding them.",300 - Rise of an Empire
275,psypeterson,Bloody Fun,9,1 April 2014,"The Good: Great cinematography, fine acting from the two leads, excellent battle scenes, and wonderfully overly-dramatic dialogue. Also; it is cartoonishly violent.The Bad: Not much character development for anyone save the two leads and two or three secondary characters. The bits with the narration tend to go on overlong (show, don't tell; you're a movie, remember?). Also; it is cartoonishly violent (some people probably don't like this, even though I'm not one of them).The Standout: Eva Green. Her character takes the cake, and pretty much makes the whole film. Her character arc is well realized, and her deviation from the norm in most situations almost always caught me off- guard. There were several scenes which began as cliché as one can get, and then Eva's characterization (and the writing, can't forget to credit that) take things in a whole other direction than I was expecting. It's refreshing to see a strong female character who isn't just a clone of a traditionally male trope but with boobs.All in all, highly recommended if high-violence hack & slash movies are your bag.",300 - Rise of an Empire

In a way, he was correct. Its lush visuals and frenetic action sequences were something we've never seen before on film. It went on to become a huge success (grossing almost five hundred million dollars worldwide) so evidently, a sequel was inevitable. Seven years later we finally get that sequel and while it might not be as good as 300, it provides its fair share of thrills and visually spectacular moments. 300: Rise of an Empire is not only a sequel, but also a prequel and a companion piece to 300. The beginning takes place ten years before 300 where we see Persia's first attempt at invading Greece. Persia is defeated when General Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) of Athens takes out King Darius. During that time we see Darius's son Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) ascend to the throne. It is here where we witness how Xerxes transforms into the man we see in 300. Fast forward ten years later and Persia once again invades Greece. This is when the movie mirrors 300; it takes place during the events in 300, but in a different location. While King Leonidas and his army are away battling Xerxes, Themistocles and his army are taking care of the rest of the Persians at sea commanded by Artemisia (Eva Green). Most of the movie takes place here as we see battle after battle until Themistocles hears word that King Leonidas and his army have been defeated. The last act of the film attempts to tell what happens after 300, when Leonidas and his army have fallen.One of the best things about 300 was Gerard Butler and his larger than life performance as Leonidas. Initially, they planned for him to come back, but he didn't want to reprise his role. He is sorely missed here and the void left by his absence is never really filled although, Eva Green comes awfully close. She by far has the most interesting character and easily gives the best performance, but despite a tragic backstory, she's a villain, which makes it hard to sympathizer with her character. Instead, we get Stapleton to take Butler's place and while his performance is fine, his character Themistocles is no Leonidas. Most people will probably be seeing this for its visuals and epic battle sequences. In that case, this film will not disappoint. Visually, this movie is just as impressive as its predecessor. It's only in-between the battles that this movies falters. Not a lot of what Themistocles has to say is interesting and his speeches aren't nearly as memorable as Leonidas' pep talks. Suffice to say, you won't be seeing any internet memes or hear people quoting this movie as much at the first film. Thankfully, these scenes are short and it doesn't take long before the movie cuts to another battle. Having seen this film in 3D, my advice would be to skip it. It's not so much how the filmmakers use it (they use it to great effect); it's the way it looks that's the problem. Since this is an already dark film with its muted colors and that fact that almost every battle (and most of this movie for that matter) either takes place at night or on a gloomy day, the 3D makes these scenes even darker. On more than one occasion I took off the glasses for a couple of minutes because it was so much brighter and I could see what was going on better. I would still advise you to see it in IMAX if you can, but the 3D nearly ruined some of the action sequences for me. See it in 3D at your own risk, yes the globs of blood hurling at you are pretty cool, but it's not as fun when you can't see what's going on. The best thing than can be said about this film is that it's never boring. It moves at a nice pace from battle to battle, but those looking for the same experience the first film gave them will be disappointed. With the exception of Eva Green, the performances aren't as good this time around, the big speeches are boring, and if you thought there was less substance in the first film, there's even less here. That's not why people want to see these films though; they want to see men with chiseled bodies and bulging biceps slicing their way through the enemy and winning the battle. The film delivers in that regard, and based on the way this ended, it's clear that if this makes enough money at the box office (which it probably will), we'll be seeing another one of these in the near future.",300 - Rise of an Empire
277,irigoni,SO SO Average and what the movie makers failed to understand.,5,17 November 2015,"It goes like this...the first movie was ""Prepare for glory"", the second was ""Prepare to be humiliated"". The second movie lacked the epic element of the first movie. The first movie had clear sides, you could sympathize with your heroes who were truly EPIC. They even died beautifully without ever to kneel, without to make you feel the need to pity them even for a second. That was what made the first movie amazing...It had HEROES!!! The second movie had nothing like that, 2 sides battling, OK but nothing more than this...in some points you even pitied the Greeks. They didn't even need a script to make the movie epic...they could have followed history itself and the movie would have been amazing but they leveled it down...I have to say again, the first movie was loved because it was epic, heroic....and thats exactly the element that was missing from the second movie...and so they turned it to an average, not very interesting ""war"" movie.",300 - Rise of an Empire

279,sayakboral-1,I sat through this one; the mediocre performances let me down; not a patch on the original 300,1,7 March 2014,"This sequel of an all-time favorite cult classic seriously disappoints: considering they had so much good going for them, they really blew the chance. For one, the plot is based on a historical episode ""Battle of Salamis"" which in fact, had a bigger role to play in securing Greek victory over Persians than the ""Battle of Thermopylae"" depicted in the original 300. You might like this movie ONLY and ONLY if you have not seen the original 300. And why call this one ""300"" anyway? The Battle of Salamis was not fought by 300 Greeks but at least 10000-- the title itself is misleading. And as you watch the events unfold before you, the inconsistencies start adding up and if you have an above average IQ, it WILL eventually kill your interest.The sequence of events wasn't lengthy but within the first 10 minutes, the plot became clichéd and boring. I slept through the remaining movie except for 1 or 2 scenes. One might be forgiven for pinning the blame on Frank Miller's, he was unable to make the comic sequel (on which this movie is based) as interesting as the original 300 which managed to grab your attention within the first 10 minutes itself. As time went on, the drama was rapidly unfolding before you and combined with an all-powering action, you knew that it would certainly head for a brilliant climax - the last stand of Leonidas and his men was EPIC of magnificent proportions. Now you can't change the events of history but it was certainly possible to make 300: The Rise of Empire more interesting. You have to use a different formula. The character of Xerxes was totally wasted on this one; I was done with him after the original 300 and in no mood to watch him again as this wasn't his episode!! In fact, Xerxes didn't participate at all in the Battle of Salamis and left it to his generals why devote so much screen time to him including over 10 minutes of background on how and why he became a God-King. Totally pointless.Another historical inaccuracy: Darius I of Persia didn't die from an arrow wound in the Battle of Marathon but 3 years later peacefully in his bed. You can certainly take a few liberties when documenting history in a cinema but not so much that it distorts the original events. Another inaccurate idea was the premise that Artemesia saw her family massacred before her eyes, got sold into slavery and was discarded to perish before being picked up by a kind Persian emissary. That's not correct as wikipedia suggests she was a Queen in her own right. Factually speaking, many Greeks were satrapies of Persians and were entirely devoted to Xerxes. The background of Artemesia has been filled with wild imaginatons and takes away the story's credibility.The acting was tolerable at best and second rate at worst. None of the characters seem to be speakng their dialogs with any sense of conviction except for one scene where Themistokles blurts out ""we choose to die on our feet, rather than live on our knees!"" -- I liked that one, the only dialog inspiring enough in a movie filled with bad writing. Only a bad writer can write something so unoriginal as:1. XERXES"" Today we will dance across the backs of dead Greeks (yawn) 2. ARTEMESIA: I will attack the Greeks with my entire navy! (No points for that, genius) 3. QUEEN GORGO: Leonidas is dead THEMISTOCLES: Then avenge him (Wow, that was sooo original!!) 4. XERXES: Nothing will stop the march of my empire! (Enough already, I need my aspirin now)Not a single dialog in this pathetic sequel comes close to the immortal line ""THIS IS SPARTA"". Gerard Butler kicked ass as Leonidas none was disagree with that statement...whatever the actor was who played Themistocles, he seriously sucks. A truly forgettable performance.As for Eva Green playing Artemeisa, to be fair, she acted well but the script let her down. Her dialogs were cheesy and totally lacked depth. Oh, they didn't forget to add a sex scene, but it was so corny and must have been played out a million times in C-grade porn movies...less said about it the better.Was there anything redeemable about this movie? Hmm...difficult to answer but let us say 5 years down the line when you check on your DVD collection and come across a copy of the original 300, you will still want to see it again...I saw the original 300 probably 50 times and it's still as fresh. As for this pathetic sequel, it will soon be forgotten in the annals of history - the rubbish bin of bad movie-making.Methinks the movie-makers of current generation have become a LAZY LOT...they lack the craft and ingenuity required in telling a good story. Now that would be an unfair statement, THE WOLF OF WALL STREET holds its own in this entire season of mediocre and over-hyped movies - another piece of drivel being Dallas Buyer's Club.

280,wayne-robb,should have left it alone,6,10 June 2014,"don't get me wrong rise of an empire is watchable and the story's not that bad! the lead actors not bad either and an impressive eva green. the problem is its not as well made the fight scenes with the cgi are laughable, the whole feel and visuals of the movie do not compare to the first 300 shame really as i was looking forward to it! its almost as its the b-movie! although this is my personal opinion i think the 300 original fans will agree that this film is just by no means as good as the first. i give it a 6 purely because it is watchable. enjoy, (but you probably won't). hopefully there is a lesson to be learnt here!,if the sequel is not done by the original director then it wont be like the first in which you enjoyed so much because of the style,camera angles,dialogue etc!. 300 rise of an empire like 102 Dalmatians should never have been made.",300 - Rise of an Empire
281,pierce-declase,I expected more but good,6,8 March 2014,"I thought this movie was entertaining especially how everything is put into the ongoing story line. Its interesting to see how its happening, specially in this part of 300 its more of the Persians. So you see both sides of the story. But i did expect more, at the end i could feel everyone in the cinema feeling disappointed, not like they hated the movie but felt that there had to be more, it was a short movie but still just felt let down compared to the first one. The action in it was awesome, gruesome, violence and good pace. You enjoy it. It really does do well in this part and if not better than the first movie. Though you do miss those 300 Spartans. The characters are good, you do not get the same feel you did from the first movie but still does it well. You really get into more of Artemisia the main villain in this story, you get her back story, her rise to power and through out the movie you see why she is feared by others. Still you did expect more from her. Themistokles i think does well as the main hero of this story but you would not say he was awesome or epic. You really do not get much of a back story of him. So do not get me wrong this movie is a good movie, you will enjoy it if you enjoyed the first one. But if you loved the first one then you will feel a little bit let down. It just feels short and you feel like you were left expecting more. After it you will see why.",300 - Rise of an Empire

Yes, the previous movie had a better hero, BUT the new movie has something that the previous one lacked: a violent, bloody and delicious female villain.Yes, Eva Green ( should be called Eva Gore, after seeing this movie ) is perfect. Her character Artemisia gets developed well enough to make you care about her. She has charisma, she puts enemies in their places, she is deadly.The battles are really well done, even though most of them happened in the water. If you played God of War, you'll notice by the end of the movie, that there are angles really similar to the game. Themistokles fights enemies while Artemisia watches everything. The camera doesn't cut away and it focus on the characters. It's violent, bloody, fast and straight to the point. If you're expecting more than that, then this is not the movie for you.The weak point is the ending, but then again, I'm surprised with a sequel that manages to be cool even after being released 8 years after the original.

284,doomas10,hyper stylized gory epic,7,7 March 2014,"Well that was unexpected. Capitalizing in the huge fame and legacy that the first film generated, ""300: rise of an empire"" seemed to be the most unnecessary sequel of all time. Based on the yet still unpublished Frank Miller comic, ROAE certainly lacked Zack Snyder behind the camera and the charismatic turn of Gerald Butler in the now iconic role of Leonidas. After 8 years, it is kinda weird that the sequel appears now, in a film era where the then novel green screen and uber slo mo effects are now typical, mediocre and standardized in hyperstylistic Hollywood action sequences. So.....how does this one fare?Well, it is actually pretty good. Loosely based on the battle of Salamis where Xerxes' navy was pwned by the small (remaining) Greek fleet, ""Rise of an empire"" offers plenty of the jaw dropping candy and action that made the first film so memorable. Only it just cranks them up to 11. Noam Murro (a director with the credentials of the romantic comedy ""Smart People"" and some commercials) does not inspire actual confidence before watching a sword and sandal Greek epic. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised to see money shot after money shot delivered with epic zooms and astonishing camera work. Murro definitely brought his Snyder notebook on this one and it feels more of an expansion of a style rather than pure imitation. ""Rise of an empire"" has astonishing visuals, and simply it is a feast for the eyes. Each shot has a poetic beauty (a night on a rocky beach with a huge moon) and even the most violent and gory scenes carry with them enough magnificence ready to enchant you. It is like watching a hyper realistic movie canvas becoming alive in front of you. Assisted by gorgeous cinematography by Simon Duggan, Murro stages his set pieces in fantastical locations combined with a witty production design from Patrick Tatopoulos (Independence Day, Godzilla, Underworld, Silent Hill). It is style over substance but man what style!Now, let's be honest, we are not here for the context of the film neither to see if it is accurately depict the historical events that shape pretty much the fate of then ancient Greece. As a Greek I take no offence on that. I am here to see action fantasy cinema and nothing more than that. If there is a good depiction in the films is the heroic deeds of Athenians that tried to fight off a huge navy with inventive ways (and smaller ships). Everything else (non character wise), is pure fiction Instead we get bloody, gorgeous action with eye popping visuals in 3D. Obviously, the characters are literally one dimensional with any backstory added in matter of seconds and there is not a moral ambiguity regarding their actions (and consequences). Murro moves from a set piece to a set piece with only a handful speeches giving us a break from the displayed massacre. Carnage you want, carnage you get. I lost count of the bodies that went flying, chopped, burned, etc more than once. If war is your thing, then rest assured you will not be disappointed. Especially, when it is presented in such poetic fashion. Surely though that does not mean that everyone is going to like this. those annoyed with Snyder's style and visuals will find little to love here. Those of use who embraced (and there are many) oh dear, you are for a treat. The cast is rather interesting with Lena Headey doing a good job as Queen Gorgo. Sullivan Stapleton is by no means Gerald Butler but surprisingly he brings some gravitas into the film and it was wise to have him as a smaller built hero than Leonidas who relies more on his brains rather his warrior skills to defeat his opponents. Rodrigo Santoro (by far the most intriguing visually character) still suffers from limited screen time with zero development (no the start does not count) or any special skills since he became a god king. So the whole film relies on Eva Green's shoulders as the poisonous Artemisia, commander of the Persian navy. She chews the scenery and it is almost impossible to take your eyes of her, first because she is gorgeous to look upon and secondly because she is the only one to have a bit of psychological synthesis for her role. Green seems to be having a blast and is one of the probably the best female villains on the big screen in the last decade (along with Faora). So this is ""300: rise of an empire"". It is a great film? No. However, it is one of the best looking movies of all time and for that it is required to be seen in the cinema in immersive 3D and IMAX! There are tones of great and swift action, epic money shots and fantastic cinematography. No point really if you miss that on the big screen! Sometimes style is all you need baby! It is like watching a huge building being demolished. It does not last for long, is shallow, but the spectacle of the moment is fascinating to witness.+ stunning visuals + 3D is actually a character on its own + Eva Green, great villain and performance + excellent action + Stapleton is adequate but ... - but he is no Gerald Butler - one dimensional characters - story does not really go anywhere7/10",300 - Rise of an Empire
285,ccponds,300...without the Spartans,6,3 September 2014,"Despite being based off of Frank Miller's graphic novel more than real life events, the original ""300"" film was, in my opinion, actually a rather decent film. I enjoyed it; I did not love it, but I did enjoy it a lot. I was, however, hoping that it would go down in history as an awesome, standalone, action film. So when I heard that a sequel was going to hit theaters my first thought was, ""oh no"" Because of this, I did not go to see it in theaters and decided to wait until it came out on DVD and Blu-Ray. And boy, am I glad I did. The biggest reason why this film did not impress me was the fact that the story was just not focused at all. The film introduces the audience to Themistocles, Athens' ""greatest hero,"" and tells his story before, during, and after the battle of Thermopylae (the events of ""300), but in a very choppy manner. This is coupled with all the origins stories we are given for the Persian antagonists, and in the end the audience is treated to a story that is just a sloppy mess. We are constantly being reminded of the awesome events taking place on land (the battle of Leonidas and his Spartans), yet we are stuck watching this uninspiring battle on the sea that does not have as much weight as the first films battle. It is obvious that the writers attempted giving Themistocles inspiring speeches that would raise the testosterone levels of everyone in the audience, but all I could think was ""Leonidas did it better."" It also does not help that after a point in the movie, it is clear that some of the Athenians following Themistocles are considering deserting him. And on top of this, he even tells them ""Yeah! If you guys want to leave, you're free to go; I won't stop you!"" It is kind of hard for me to get behind a leader that does not give me a lot of reason to follow him or her, let alone hold together his followers. Despite having nearly as much action as the first film, ""300: Rise of an Empire"" just does not drag you in. The visuals should have been better, yet I actually thought the first film did a better job in terms of CGI and the up close combat shots. (The following is only me being really picky). The other thing that drove me nuts was the fact that, according to history, Sparta was the war like state of Greece, and Athens was the state of the scholars. Because of this, I found it very hard to believe these men of knowledge were as ripped and skilled in combat as they were. All in all, this movie is one I could write about negatively for quite some time, but that would be unfair, as this film does have its enjoyable moments. There are times when I was caught up in the action, and there were moments where I felt some attachment to the characters, but I was never really rooting for any main character in the film. In fact, the character I thought was the best in the film was Queen Gorgo, wife of the late Kind Leonidas. Unfortunately, she was only in a few minutes of the film, and this was mostly done through exposition narration, similar to the way David Wenham did in the original ""300."" Was this movie the worst I've seen all year? No, but it was not great by any means. This film struck me as nothing more than a cash grab; a place holder for the inevitable third part of this apparent series. Even the title was dumb. The title has nothing to do with anything in the movie other the last four minutes, and the inclusion of the word ""300"" was simply the worm on the hook for would-be movie goers. The real title of the film should have been ""300: The Vengeance of Persia."" So much of the film is dedicated to learning about Persian characters that anything revolving around Greece made for a misleading title. My overall rating for this film is a 6.25/10. This film did not get me overly excited, I actually was quite bored at times, and the characters just do not do a whole lot in this film other than swing swords, shout, and kill. Maybe I am being a little too hard on this film, but the first film managed to tell a decent story underneath all the action. ""300: Rise of an Empire"" is all style and no substance. Watch this film if you just want to see a lot of blood, boobs, and battles.",300 - Rise of an Empire

After watching, my initial thoughts were totally contradicted, not only because of the stunning performance of Eva Green, but the development and pace of the story was upbeat and breathtaking. Even though there was no 'edge of your seat' moments, the stylised violence, some-what comedic love scenes and the unpredictability of the end out done the first film. Commenting on what I briefly said before, Eva Green not only made me despise powerful people of that time, but I felt sort of sympathy for her character based on her loyalty to her country no matter what deep feelings she suppresses into her early damaged soul (even though she has no problem with manipulation- as seen in a few of her other films)I would definitely recommend this film for any Spartacus lovers, or anyone who likes to watch an original, stylised movie that makes you think back to the original- whilst adding to the knowledge of that era.

Tons of action, beautifully filmed, wonderful effects. I like action, sex & blood does not bother me but I need a strong story. This was much weaker & without Eva Green it would have been a flop. She can deliver the strong powerful role that is usually left to the men. The scenery was eye catching & visually stimulating but the dialogue & plot left me feeling robbed. I'm sure another one is in the works & I hope they focus on story just as much as they focused on bodies, blood & fighting.

289,nickan2000,Kill bill meets 300,5,5 June 2014,"Well its hard to explain, they did a decent job to with the story to connect but I think the biggest problem was casting. Sullivan Stapleton tried his best not to be a Gerard butler and he did succeed in being very non threatening and the planner, but I was just to plan. Eva Green did the best she could, may be for some people the best in the film, but it was very predictable and got boring mid way through the movie. Rest of the characters were a very bad continuation of the first part. But I think the worst part was the over doing of the violence and the blood, it looked like the kill bill final blood spray scene. With the action there were a lot of resemblance to the original. 300 was good because it was new different and vibrant this one on the other hand is a bit over doing of everything. Xerxes was scary in the first one, in this one he is very gay looking(sorry I am not a homophobe but that is the best description that I can come up with). The dialogues had there moment but a lot of the time they lack conviction. Still I do assume that this is better than what I expected from a director with more than less to show for. One thing for sure we don't want another Zack Snyder, who started of very good and then sold into the big epic movie with dumb down ending(I guess he was out of options). In my opinion 5 out of 10 for good connection to the sequel while trying to keep Leonidas and Themistocles very different characters.",300 - Rise of an Empire

291,swf64,More than comical.,7,6 June 2014,"Rise of an empire is a dramatic, and for the most part, fictitious telling of the Persians second invasion of Greece. We may never know exactly how the Greek city states defeated the mighty Persian empire, but we can safely say this movie fails to cover the basics of the conflict. The movie covers a broader story than the first 300 movie, including the stand at Thermopylae, and it has all of the flaws, and strengths, of the first movie. I can only Imagine that the people giving the movie such low marks have some agenda, or reason, for their reaction. If you're looking for a smash mouth, hero based tale, with a sprinkling of history, It's as good as you're likely to get.

292,xmichaelraine,Seriously??,3,20 March 2014,"Not exactly how I wanted my first review to go. Believe it or not, I went into this with high hopes, and REALLY wanting to enjoy it. Not only did I not enjoy it, 20 minutes into the film I was looking at my watch wondering when it would end. The huge difference in IMDb vs. Rotten Tomatoes ratings, this film has drawn a line in the sand. Either you think it's good, or you think it's trash. I am in the latter group. What makes the film so bad? It almost felt like it was a spoof on the original. The fun campy element vanished. Instead, we're left with a story that's all over the place, terribly noticeable blue screen, repetitive cliché' action sequences, and actors YELLING THE MOST REDUNDANT DIALOGUE POSSIBLE. And seeing it in IMAX 3D I'll say this; if I can see the blue screen outline around actors beard....I'm sorry, but you didn't try hard enough.The movie isn't a sequel, or prequel. It's time line falls in between the original '300'. Starting out with what felt like 25 minutes of narration, over top of SUPER slow-mo battle montage; we learn that in the Spartans defeat, the Greek army lead by ""Themistocles""(Sullivan Stapleton) is ready to charge against the nearing Persian navy. The Persian navy being led by the man-turned-god ""Xerses""(Rodrigo Santoro), and super bitch ""Artemesia""(Eva Green). We get back stories on both of these foes, Green's character being the more interesting, but that's not singing much praise. The movie then unfolds like this: Battle-Incoherent Dialogue-Battle-Incoherent Dialogue-Battle-Sex Scene-Dialogue-Battle- Credits. I promise you, what you see on screen feels just as repetitive as reading the nonsense above. I may need to revisit the original '300' to see how it holds up and if I remember actually enjoying it, but from what I recall at the moment I did in fact enjoy it a lot. I mean, it definitely felt silly. However that was half the fun. The other half of the fun was the inventive new style of action sequences. We had seen slow motion, and we had seen blue/green screen used in films, but I can't remember a film that executed it with such style. How could this follow up fall so short? apparently the film is based on new source material from Frank Miller titled ""Xerses"", which follows his source material for the original film. Only problem is....it's not even finished. How do you write a screenplay for source material that is still in the works? My guess is you say, ""Oh it's fine we'll just bring 70% of the scenes to the audience in incredibly, INCREDIBLY slow motion to give it length. We won't have any of the characters from the original that were enjoyable, instead we'll bring in sub par actors to cheese it up a bit. And let's make sure the visual effects, especially the blood look straight out of a very violent video game."" At least that's what it seems like happened here. I will say, if there is one positive to draw from the film, it's Eva Green. I sympathize for her here. She's trying so very hard to bring credibility to this film. Her performance is enjoyable in brief moments, but then it's just frustrating. It's frustrating because you can tell that she is so far above the rest of this cast. A film focusing on her, that was 25 minutes shorter maybe would have sufficed better for me. Her character is the most interesting by a mile. Save your money on this one. Wait for it to show up on Netflix in 9 months. It's unfortunate because I love Frank Miller, and I feel like this film really wasted good source material. How can we know though? After all, the freaking source material isn't even finished! Unnecessary, uninteresting, and completely unsatisfying. It's something we've seen many times before, and done much better for that matter. Michael Raine",300 - Rise of an Empire
293,nightshadow101,Plenty of action but doesn't live up to the charm from the first one,7,23 March 2014,"After several years since the first 300, we are finally rewarded with the long awaited sequel only to be disappointed with its depiction in the end.300: Rise of the Empire tells the story of Greek general Themistokles who attempts to unite all of Greece by leading the charge that could change the course of war. It puts him against a massive force of the Persian army led by the mortal-turned-god Xerxes and his naval commander Artemesia.In the start of the film we are presented with Queen Gorgo telling her men about the Battle of Marathon. From there Lena Headey's character can only be heard narrating the story as the film continues to move forward while she only has few scenes.. Back track and we are seen with nice action sequences, the slow motion effect, the 3D that is done right, and the special effects of the battle.Noam Murro tries to tell the story starting with before, during and after the events of 300 but unfortunately he has left me as a viewer scratching my head as to what moment in time are we in during the course of the film.Despite the slow motion action sequences, the film started to get pale. It begins with the introduction of new characters. Some of them weren't given enough quality time to be developed so therefore I didn't care for them if they lived or died. Even a few returning characters irritated me, particularly Xerxes who thinks he's so tough rambling on about how he is a god king yet the only tough thing he did was he slapped Artesmesia then goes back to sit on his throne. Pathetic! The CGI in this film was a bit over the top. The blood seen when people were killed looked so cheesy it looked like it came straight out of a video game! In fact it felt like I was watching a video game and not a movie during the 2 hour run. Next, the light in the background in the sky. In the first film it shone through the skies and the actors faces with the right balance and tone, but in here it was a bit too distracting and it couldn't really find its place properly.Lastly, the aggressive sex scene. This didn't really serve no purpose to the actual story. But like everything else in the industry ""sex sells!""In general, the film isn't disastrously bad but unfortunately it left an uneasy feeling in my stomach that just didn't sink right. It didn't live to the charm the first one had and that was something about its sequel I was afraid off.As was said in the film, ""Seize your glory!"" only this film didn't obtain so much victory in my heart.",300 - Rise of an Empire
294,rickyricardomokwena,Rise of a Disappointment.....,1,27 May 2014,"This is the film that would take the first spot in the list of the top ten worst sequels of all time.It is very substandard when matched with its predecessor.The trailer baits you in, with what seemed a promising plot but is not great by any stretch of the imagination.It lacks the triumphant entry and iconic characters of the first 300.300 was famed by the Spartans and their fighting skills (the phalanx)which is what we don't get to see in this sequel.The film gives us no portrayal of Athens, democracy, weird prophecies,gods and other elements that made the fist one a success.The characters were all misplaced such as King Leonidas' wife Queen Gorgo 'played by Lena Headey' who just happens to be as skilled as any Spartan on the battlefield and leads them from the front lines(terrible)When did she become a warrior?.The character of Artemesia 'played by Eva Green' was so unnaturally forced into 300's universe just to have that ""unrealistic strong female main character"" which is overrated despite her good performance.The sex scene was unnecessary and obscene,which shows lack of creativity as to how would a leading man find it cool to have sex with the enemy.The rape scenes were more like torture porn(awful).The transfiguration of Xerxes lacked significance and he is portrayed as a coward not the god king the audience got introduced to.Leonidas 'played by Gerard Butler' keeps appearing in CGI and this is what really kills the movie.Despite being a king of a great nation such as Sparta,here he is portrayed with no dialogue as a violent savage who by no means does not speak or greet his guests and has only time for beating his soldiers to a pulp. So then how could he be married to such a lovely wife and be a great king? The cartoon blood is like water which the audience will find too distracting.There is too much of the slow motion mania which was a style originating from 'The Matrix' but worked well in the first 300.It died out years ago and here it is used as if we are still in 2004.There is too much violence and it doesn't quite build up on you and it causes a mix up with no lasting impression.This movie will disappoint audiences worldwide because after so many years given to build a good script it came off far from what is expected.Terrible!!!!",300 - Rise of an Empire

296,bigdmia,A Eurocentric Fantasy (Spoiler Alert),1,12 July 2014,"I am aware this is a fantasy war-film based on a graphic novel, which bases its storyline by fictionalising actual historical events. Therefore, to expect a historical accurate film would be moronic.However, the film-makers had the opportunity to use their artistic licence to create a ""digestible"" fantasy. Instead the film-makers decided to insult the intelligence of their audience by blatantly distorting historical facts that can not be twisted. Here is my point.The nations depicted as the City-State of Sparta and the Persian Empire were actual geographical locations that still exist today as Greece and Iran, both being rich in history and culture. Similarly, nations of Germany and Russia during the second world war fought ferocious battles in eastern Europe which resulted in great losses to both sides but a moral and tactical defeat to the Germans whom after that faced eventual defeat after the allied forces landing on D-Day.Then let us suppose someone made a film based on a graphic novel that fictionalised the second world war, but depicting the Germans as heroes and defenders of race, equality, freedom and justice who single-handedly defeat both the Russians and the Allied forces, and actually win. Portraying Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt as cowards, yet Adolph Hitler as a compassionate brave hero-leader --- wouldn't that be a travesty on history, even for the sake of a fantasy?Some of the blatant distortions of historical facts that makes it a laughable fantasy --- Darius was not killed as depicted, as neither Xerxes nor Darius were present at the Battle of Marathon. Artemisia in reality argued against sailing into the straits and survived the Persian Wars. The Spartan navy contributed a mere 16 warships to the Greek fleet of 400 warships in the ending battle scene, and not a huge army.300: Rise of an Empire has proved to be a shameless ""Eurocentric"" fantasy.Portraying Persians as unconcerned for the loss of their slaves or soldiers lives, yet making the Greeks the defenders of their country, freedom and democracy. The fact that slavery was widely and essentially practised in those eras; apparently the Greeks don't have any slaves to abuse --- very absurd. This fantasy was trying to make gods out of the Greeks and monsters out of the Persians.",300 - Rise of an Empire
297,gerry-636-868677,Well I thought it was OK . Well done Eva Green,7,23 February 2015,"Eva Green was great I thought. Over the top villain meets still actor. I think more could have been made though of the fact that she was a Greek by birth who effectively was a traitor. Very little was made of the inner turmoil that may have caused as she slaughtered her countrymen. If I could have a fantasy cast it would be Russell Crowe at his best as Thermistocles. I'm afraid the chosen actor just did not have the depth and presence to represent what must have been an incredible leader. I agree that the simplicity of 300 was absent here, but it did have some of the spectacle so I don't really think, bearing in mind it is a sequel, that it deserves such a roasting.

300,BumBumy,The reason why ..,8,24 March 2014,"..this movie those not get a 10 out of 10 from me ( and an Oscar from...you know who ) is because the performance, from the lead character Themistocles played by Sullivan Stapleton was average-good. Not bad, not outstanding, just average-good.Imagine what this movie would look like, if the lead character had a ""badass-like"", a more ""mad and full of blood thirst"" attitude and was played by another actor with such .. ""skills"". Don't get me wrong , Stapleton , as I said, has played his role average to good, but compared to Artemisia ( Eva Green ) character, he kinda fall more to average performance, rather then a good one.The only excellent scene which Stapleton played, was the sex scene while Artemisia had a brilliant performance the whole movie. I think Clive Owen would have fit better as the lead role. I can see him being a badass and have the mad attitude of Gerard Butler but in the same time his unique acting skills.Having saying that , 300 Rise of an Empire has taken the 300 series, few steps forward, since this time, beside the fighting scenes , we had a bit of a plot/story , more then the previous movie.So I recommend this movie to any 300 fans, and also to the ones who love action/fictional/fantasy like movies.PS: As a side thought ( OK OK, fantasy/impossible wish :) ) , I would love to see Leonidas character teaming up with the...

Eva Green was the only watchable character in this movie, she was good as usual but i'm sure she now regrets being in it. Glad I didn't watch it in the cinema, it would've been such a waste of time and money.Some scenes were plain stupid like gallons of blood pouring out every time someone was slashed or stabbed. Maybe someone thought that would make it the most violent and grotesque movie ever..The transformation of Xerxes was so unconvincing, it's basically one guy takes a dip in a pool and another one comes out, yes really. There was another father and son story running alongside just like in the first one, for no good reason.

302,quicksticks,A visual feast,7,10 March 2014,"I LIKE my films just the way I like my women — with a personality just as sexy as the way she looks. 300: Rise of an Empire is a girl I would date, but wouldn't take home to my parents as the film doesn't quite live up its predecessor, Zack Snyder's 300. Back in 2006, the testosterone-injected 300 was a massive early summer triumph, winning the hearts of the audience and box office and spawning a mild case of cult following. Based on the graphic novel of the same name by Frank Miller, 300 was shot entirely on a green screen and gave new height to visual effects in Hollywood. 300: Rise of an Empire acts as both a prequel and sequel to its bigger brother as the events in the second film take place before, during and after the events of King Leonidas's fight against the Persians during the battle of Thermopylae with just ""300"" Spartan warriors. The plot revolves around Greek general Themistocles (played by Aussie actor Sullivan Stapleton) who leads an Athenian army against the gigantic invading Persian navy with the backing of their God King Xerxes. The Persian force is led by Artemisia — played by the bewitching French beauty Eva Green — who acts the chief villain throughout the film, making Xerxes take back seat as the central protagonist. Green delivers an over-the-top performance and at first I thought her character was written by a 30-year-old living in his parents' outside room, but when her back story is revealed we see her motivation for being such a damaged anti-hero. Green isn't the world's best actress and she isn't going to be nominated for any awards, but she does a reasonable job of playing a female lead in a big budget action film, and she still remains my best Bond girl ever. Gerard Butler's sandals were big shoes to fill and Stapleton — with his Aussie accent showing up now and again — also surprised me with bold acting ability in his first lead role in a major production. Lena Headey, chiefly known for her role as the character you love to hate in Game of Thrones, Cersei Lannister, plays Queen Gorgo and provides the narration for the film. Unfortunately, she has little screen time which is a shame as Headey is not only an excellent actress but is possibly one of the most striking beauties in Hollywood. 300: Rise of an Empire isn't profound, nor is it going to gather the same cult following the first 300 captured. It is there for just pure entertainment. It is incredible in its visual aspects with a strong emphasis on the extreme slow motion fight scenes, but lacks any depth in the dialogue. All of the fight scenes take place on the rough and unforgiving ocean, and just like that, the film comes in waves from exciting to average. There are some really powerful scenes with warriors slicing and dicing their enemies into next Sunday, but then the film often degrades with a really lazy method of storytelling. 300: Rise of an Empire isn't a period piece and has little or no historic accuracy, but the film is a good two-hour escape from the seriousness of Blade Runner dominating the TV.",300 - Rise of an Empire
303,Carlosmave,An amazing film that offers incredible performances and epic battle scenes!,10,17 May 2014,"""300: Rise of an Empire"" is a war film that narrates the story of Themistokles, an Athenian general, who along with his forces must stop the invading Persian forces led by Artemisia and Xerxes during the Battle of Salamis.The movie is directed by Noam Murro and stars Sullivan Stapleton, Eva Green, Lena Headey, Rodrigo Santoro, Hans Matheson, Callan Mulvey and Jack O' Connell. It is based on the unreleased graphic novel ""Xerxes"" by Frank Miller. The events of the film happen before, during and after the first ""300"" movie. This time, the battlefield moves to the sea, which gives opportunity for extraordinary naval battles to take place.Sullivan Stapleton is excellent as Themistokles. The Athenian general ferociously fights in the battlefield to defend his homeland and its people and also designs strategies that will allow the Greeks to defeat the Persians. Stapleton is able to display the fearlessness, bravery and intelligence that define his character. Eva Green is magnificent as Artemisia, the vengeful commander of the Persian navy. Artemisia's actions are motivated by the hate she feels towards Greece and its people for what was done to her and her family in the past, and so she unleashes her wrath on everyone who gets in her path to make Greece burn. Green is able to display in an incredible way the cold, ruthless and relentless nature of Artemisia, her performance makes her stand out in a movie that prominently features men. Rodrigo Santoro is great as Xerxes, the God-King. Since the movie's opening shot, Santoro shows the character's rage and his determination to conquer all of Greece. The three characters are well developed, through flashbacks we can see their backstories and the events that defined them, how they became who they are now.Another part of the movie that needs to be highlighted is the action, the battle scenes. Each of the battle scenes was brilliantly choreographed and well-executed. The battles were bloody, gory and brutal, the way they had to be done to represent how battles were in those times, in close contact with swords clashing and blood spilling. The visual style the movie uses helps in making the battles look even more epic.All this elements make ""300: Rise of an Empire"" an amazing film, a movie that offers incredible performances and epic battle scenes that combine to present a great story.",300 - Rise of an Empire
304,xenoraiser,"Wants To Be a Prime Rib, Feels Like a Pork Tenderloin",5,7 March 2014,"There's an early scene in 300 (released exactly eight years ago this Sunday) where Leonidas shows Daxos, an allied Arcadian, just what his men excel in (combat). He comically wraps this up with a single line: ""I brought more soldiers than you did."" It's easier to feel the quote in a stronger light with the release of 300: Rise of an Empire; this sequel/prequel mesh has less length, viciousness and entertainment than its easily re-watchable predecessor. Taking focus away from Sparta, Rise of an Empire casts Sullivan Stapleton as Athenian Themistocles. His tale begins before the events of 300, but quickly catches up to when Leonidas and his Spartans ultimately fell. Along with Themistocles' backstory, a certain antagonist is treated to some extra details. Meanwhile, Eva Green comes to play her part as the truly twisted Artemisia, clearly intended as a scene-stealer. The first place to start with Rise of an Empire is its lead. Themistocles himself is a fair enough character, showing more of an everyday vibe than Leonidas. However, Stapleton isn't up to provide a compelling performance. There's simply no sense of command or outright authority. A bit more can be afforded to Eva Green, clearly delighting in a sense of smug power. What most people will care about, however, is the action. Thanks to its over-the-top style and unabashed battle sequences, 300 set a new expectation for what audiences could call a fun, blood-ridden time. Conversely, Rise of an Empire feels more like a trail of stained footprints leading to a half-eaten corpse. Most of the film's spectacle comes from the heavily shaded CGI and filters, making much of the action feel like it was taken right out of pre- rendered video game cutscenes. When blade meets skin, blood comes and goes with the viewer's interest. It probably says a lot when the best part of the movie is an over-the-top sex scene. Throughout the entire runtime, Rise of an Empire feels like it's going to provide something bigger, something grander. By the time this moment finally begins pouring out, we're greeted with the end credits. Much like the attempts at creating great and memorable action scenes, payoff was clearly of little concern to the director and screenwriters.

305,emmanuel-mg-87,"So many different Opinions of ""302""",7,25 August 2014,"A solid 8 movie, just giving a 9 for make some balance in the reviews.There are so many low ratings ""reviews"" of this movie, complaining about ""lack"" of novelty or historical accuracy. About that I'll like to say your life has lack of novelty!. No, really those both things are in a very good balance in all the movie, Novel enough to cause uncertainty, but not so much as to be a disaster historically speaking.I Know that the movie it's a good movie, and I'm not saying I like or love or hate the movie, it's just a good movie. Still it has some big issues, like 3 big issues. The biggest 1st. problem of this movie and the fact of why the dislikes of a lot of people it's the time or was the time. It's been so long since the first 300 and that create a feel that this first movie was unique then they come and announce a pre-sequel and the feeling changes because you expect something as great as the first time, or at least as you remember how the movie make you feel back then. The 2nd. Big issue with the movie is the name, you have to name it ""300 Rise of an Empire"", now you know it's a sequel or some of the first 300, perhaps if you call the movie like in some moment was rumored ""Battle for Artemisia"" without the famous numeric name. And the 3rd. problem of this, as in any movie, it's that now every single one has the opportunity to manifest their own confusion and ignorance throw the letters of the key until reach a place like this (IMDB), for some reasons all that people believes that his opinion its important just because, but if we get realistic, not everyone its capable to do a objective review, just for the simple reason they do not know themselves. (i can't do a complete or proper review because my native its not English)ABOUT THE MOVIE, if you know about history, the first thing you should always remember it's that history it's never going to be 100% accurate, and with the pass of time the story will always change until the real facts gets lost. So as any movie based on real events, or historical moments, or actual facts O wait 300 ""2"" never said to be based on historical events, it's more like inspired, and its actually accurate enough to the historical facts, with that the point of view in the movie is not impossible to believe. I've been reading/watching (on the past), so many books/documentaries about various historical big moments, and if you want to get as close as the real story was, there are so many places for you to search, do not try to judge the accuracy on the historical story of a movie, which one it's not his goal.spoiler - If there was a scene that i would never understand the ""why to do that"" its the arrival of Queen Gorgo near the end of the movie, and all that involves this particular scene of her ""fighting"". - spoiler-ENDResumed in some points 300 ""2"" was: - A good action movie -Really near to the real story (historical) - Not to real enough that you think you're watching a documentary - Takes the historical blanks to fill them with a honor, liberty, drama plot, and sex, and blooooddd scenes. - Good actors/ actresses (Eva Green) -Good FX CGI sequences. -A sequel-prequel-sequel as it should be. - An opportunity to remember how good the character of Leonidas (and his 300) was - A living reminder that the first movie was so long ago that you feel old and full of regret, and you put a low rating because of it (Among other things). - My English is far from good (really far).",300 - Rise of an Empire

A lot of them were done with CGI which didn't look real. The main character, Themistocles, just wasn't as badass as Leonidas. I didn't care much for him. If I dare say it, there is too much plot.

311,Samhuinn,Unnecessary and uninspired,5,2 April 2014,"300: Rise of an empire (Murro, 2014) can be seen as a companion film to 2007's 300 (Snyder), as the events take place before, during and after the battle of Thermopylae between 300 Spartans and the Persian army. Threatened by King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), Athenian general Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) attempts to unite the Greek city states as one nation whilst battling the fleet of Artemisia (Eva Green), the Persian naval commander.That a sequel eventually was made, is disappointing more than surprising. With a majority of the principal actors of 300 not returning for Rise of an empire, secondary characters are explored in further depth and new character are introduced. In the former category, the origins of Xerxes are a fitting example. As the son of the murdered king of Persia, the young boy swore vengeance against the Greek and descended into the madness and power of his familiar godlike state. This evolution succeeds in exploring the humanity of Xerxes, yet it was his utter lack of compassion that made him a formidable and ruthless opponent. In showing the manipulation and politics that were instrumental in his rise to power, the 'God King' is reduced to insignificance.Taking his place as the main villain is Artemisia, his late father's second in command. As a young girl, her parents were killed by a band of Greeks, which held her captive and sexually abused her for years. Taken in by a Persian missionary, she was trained as a fighter and soon rose to prominence in the Persian army. Albeit her origin story is unoriginal, her insanity and blood lust are believable.Her foe is Themistocles, the protagonist. Successfully portrayed by Sullivan Stapleton as an intelligent and compassionate leader of his men, a sense of drama and importance is brought to the battle scenes. This, however, cannot be said about the political subplot. Themistocles's endeavors of uniting Greece as a nation are both too reminiscent of the political subplot in 300 and less coherently executed. Meant to showcase the birth of Western democracy, the film never is able to rise above squabbling old men and contrived dialogue. The finale, when the Spartan fleet comes to the aid of the faltering Athenians, is even brought about by little more than a Spartan thirst for vengeance, showing implicitly the downfalls of the very democracy the film promotes.More than a film about politics, Rise of an empire of course is first and foremost an action film. Whilst the creative team could've been praised for transporting the war from the desert in 300 to the ocean, this shift does not result in significantly different warfare. The differences in commanding a fleet of ships as opposed to an army of men could've resulted in an interesting spin, yet the ships quickly are demoted to mere plateaus for the warriors to fight on. The action is still highly stylized and impressively filmed, it does not innovate. On the contrary, 300 saw more variations on the theme than ever are shown in Rise of an empire.This leads to an important issue. In 300, the waves of enemies increased exponentially, as the might of the Spartans was fully revealed. This premise was believable. In Rise of an empire, the strength of the Athenians is never quite explained. Shown initially as fighters capable of Spartan feats of skill, the warriors comment on several occasions on their daily professions as poets and painters. This is not explained, and made even more opaque in the scenes where the Persians with ease murder countless Greeks. This confusion can be attributed to the exposition of the plot. Whereas in 300 the first half hour of screen time was reserved for explaining the characters, the first half hour of Rise of an empire is used to bring those unfamiliar with its predecessor up to speed. As a result, the characters are severely underdeveloped.(AREA 555 on Wordpress)",300 - Rise of an Empire

They butcher history, some times the use of slow motion could be very irritating, and there were many super obvious 3d shots in the film. However the thing that annoyed me the most was the lack of continuity with the first film. For example spartan beliefs about death and war seem to change in this film for the sole purpose of advancing the plot. I would elaborate but any more might be construed as a spoiler. That being said the movie did have several action set pieces that were entertaining and I did have fun watching this movie. I recommend that you check it out at least once.

You will have none, obvious the script was made in some 15 min break-time on same table of a McDonald's... Characters ? well, they really invest on the female (and only...) Artemisia, they invest so hard until they fall on absurd and ridiculous... Some sentences also help on this fall... The bad big Xerxes now hide all the movie in a corner, we learn next to zero about the ""rising empire"", and cartoons images take a strong piece of the whole movie, (no more ""new ideas"" from the creators ?... ). Almost all the movie only regard the naval confrontation, and that will be all about... Let one thinking what was the purpose of this movie, since they lead us to nowhere..If you go to the theaters hoping on a true sequel of 300, better keep your money on pockets: its just a loose of time.

314,edwardanthony9,Glorious style of visuals & fight sequences makes for an enjoyable action flick...,7,6 March 2014,"Gloriously employing Zack Snyder's style of slow-fast continuous shots, as well as taking the scale and dynamics to the next level, this is a worthy sequel to the awesome 300. It has pretty much the same weaknesses and strengths of its predecessor, but improves on what made the first film a success.A pretty obvious notion is that no other film does better with the long continuous shots of action with the occasional slow motions. This is a wonderful style to marvel on, for those who like these kind of things (I do!). This is the main reason I came to watch this, yet it is not the only thing that impressed me. But before moving on, I want to further claim that I seriously enjoyed these style of shots and frankly, all...ALL of the action sequences. They are just marvellous and glorious to watch and from minute one, I was attached and just smiling on every fight sequence.Still on the matter of action sequences, they are better in visual quality & dynamics of the setting, although I suspect the reason may be the budget and resource constraint on the first film. If Snyder had this the last time, it would be as good as this. Fortunately, Rise of an Empire, even in the hands of new director Noam Murro, didn't mess it up and brilliantly improves upon it. And though the quality of visuals were not perfect (such as the blood effects), the style is just so gratifying to watch. One last thing, the soundtrack is genuinely amazing, and is unbelievably fitting for the scenes. Even before the action begins, my heart pumps up, and during the fight itself, the soundtrack did good to enhance the suspense of the action. Words are not enough to explain it...you have to listen to it first hand.Actions aside, the plot was overall a straightforward one, except for those which relates to the original 300, which I was quite impressed of. Despite the lack of drama & humour, and the limited emotional range of the characters, some of the characters were great. I was initially skeptical of the main character, and though he may not have outdone Gerard Butler's Leonidas, Themistokles is still quite the likable action hero. And while I had a great feeling about the villain, Eva Green's Artemisia really stole the show on every scene she was in. As further praise, if the producers do intend to make another sequel, they will need one hell of villain to top off Artemisia.Overall, this is a very very entertaining movie, if what you're looking for is fun, action, and visuals. They did extremely well in these aspects, and make it such a wonderful film for a great time in the movies.VERDICT:Good: Excellent style, Improved visuals, Highly entertaining fight sequences, Brilliant soundtrack, Amazing charactersBad: Lack of drama & humour, Less compelling plotSCORE: 7.0(blockbusted9.blogspot.com)",300 - Rise of an Empire
315,sheance114,"300: Rise of an Empire is again visually stunning, wickedly entertaining.",7,24 March 2014,"The bar is set high for sequel films especially onto the successful ones because everyone is expecting more from it. And in times like these; sequels or franchises are a trend. One can be seen from Marvel which gave the success on not only creating sequels but creating an entire universe as a whole.Sequels or prequels tend to give excitement to people especially upon hearing from its public announcement, and when Warner Bros. decided to impart that information last year, I was excited.The first film, 300, was visually entertaining, taking a whole new level of filmmaking. Although, the movie Sin City has the same kind of visual approach about filming in green screen and emphasis on the blood splatting; Zack Snyder took it up the notch. The whole film felt like a High Dynamic Range (HDR) shot that Digital Camera's give, and the slow- motion capture says it all.The storyline tells the 2nd war between the Greeks and Persians, and how did that came to be by iterating the account of the 1st Greco-Persian War by Lionidas' wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), making the movie a prequel-sequel alike.It narrates how the God-King Xerxes wanted his vengeance from the Greeks because of Themistocles' (Sullivan Stapleton) honest mistake upon demising his father and having the gut that Xerxes would one day be a threat, but ignoring that intuition of his.Also, the Persian Naval commander Artemisia's (Eva Green) story of her original Grecian roots showed how ruthless Greeks were to her and her family that made her lustful for revenge.The StoryThe movie is based on an unpublished novel by Frank Miller, who also did the original 300, that depicts the epic war story of the 1st and 2nd Greco-Persian war. The story of the 2nd movie is interrelated to the original 300 and a proceeding account reaching to an end.300: Rise of an Empire's story is much crispier than the original. There are more battles than the first, and it was interesting, seeing rivals strategize to win.The depth of the emotion was already set from the first movie (thanks to it), and now a threat is far more revealing and invigorating.I love the fact that my eyes and ears were totally onto the movie, making me keen to every details there are, and having the feeling that you don't want to miss something, most especially the mot juste which is a 300 trademark, (e.g. 'THIS IS SPARTA!') that creates more tension in the film, and this time it's 'SEIZE YOUR GLORY'.ScreenplayThe best thing about 300 movies is that the graphics are very well defined and the scenes are captivating. The slow-motion takes place and it's a numerous positive things to it. Although I sense that I guess if you'll add all the slow-motion scenes, it kind of adds to the time frame of the movie which makes it reasonably long. But, it's proprietary and needed for the justification of the film though.Besides the long slow-motion scenes are the muscles and abs which are the proprietary of all.Just kidding.OVERALL300: Rise of an Empire is the sequel that is properly well executed. The sequel, 300: Rise of an Empire is again visually stunning, wickedly entertaining.300: Rise of an Empire is an American film, sequel to 300, directed by Noam Murro, produced by Zack Snyder (Man of Steel, 300) and starred by Sullivan Stapleton, Eva Green, and Lena Headey.

316,Antoneo-Johnson,Rise of which empire?,6,31 March 2014,"300 Rise of an Empire bares little resemblance to historical facts and its not clear which empire is rising. as before the movie is fast paced with lots of blood, mutilated limbs and some nudity just to breakup all that chopping off of limbs. Some of the relationships are very questionable and did not make a lot of sense.The outcome of some of the fighting scene were predictable, which left you wondering how the Persians ever won any battles and created their vast army. Some role were reprise even those that had died during the first 300 movie but this was done as part of a flashback to give weight to current characters.Its always nice to watch Eva Green and Lena Headey with Stapleton from Strike Back not doing a bad job.

It has just about every 80s action movie cliché you could have; cheesy one- liners, evil overlords bird-posing on cliffs in front of their armies, banging the femme-fatale, the whole ordeal.The fights are almost as blatantly choreographed as the fights in Star Wars. Watching this movie is not like watching a war, it's like watching a bloody dance routine. They top off the cheesiness when Themistocles decides to ride a horse through a pile of ships.The acting was horrid. The only admirable performance was from Lena Headey, while watching all other actors was like watching high school theatre.It gets to the point where even I'm embarrassed about this movie, and I'm not even the director of it.",300 - Rise of an Empire

I m Greek and obviously historical accuracy is not something i am looking for in American movies about Greek history. But in this movie it becomes downright INSULTING! Let's see, where should i start? Spartans, ruled by a WOMAN??? Lol, laughable. An Athenian general DATING the enemy, taking a break from the fight? RIDICULOUS.. Some woman LEADING the Persian army?????? CRETINOUS.... I don't think i should continue.. This movie contains the most ridiculously stupid scene i have ever seen IN MY LIFE. It is in the movie's ending, where the Spartans supposedly come to the rescue of the Athenians. What do we see there? A woman(!) leading(!) the Spartan Army IN BATTLE (lol) and she goes first(!) hacking and slashing through the (unresponsive) enemy warriors (LOL), without EVEN wearing some armor(!), she just came in her pajamas with a sword (lol w t f). Whoever thought of that unbelievably ridiculous stupid scene, truly earned my pity..PS: despite the stupidity, i think i see a pattern here, perhaps the 1st 300 movie was to appeal (and cash-in) on the male crowd, so why not try to cash in on the female crowd with the sequel as well, the creators probably thought?

Now don't get my wrong I liked the first one but *Insert your choice for best film ever here * it ain't. As soon as I heard about this one I kinda knew what you'd get, similar to the first film but missing a few things that made the original more enjoyable. The main lead, for example. In this was OK, but just kinda there. The dialogue in the original had some great lines but nothing special here. There's some kind of plot trying to get out but doesn't quite manage to do so here, the battles drown it out. Though I said earlier I knew what I was getting, what this film does do well, is the villain. Interesting back story and motivation (shame the hero didn't get one) with some good acting by Eva Green. I didn't bother going to see this in cinema, I just wanted till it was on blu-Ray and waited till it dropped in price to boot so I felt like I got my money's worth.

321,littlewritingmachine,Film Authority on 300: Rise of An Empire,7,5 March 2014,"FILM AUTHORITY REVIEWS 300: Rise of an EmpireA rare sequel that matches up to the original film, 300: Rise of an Empire is a brisk romp through the history books, filtered through the comic book imagination of Frank Miller and the bloody cinematic CGI heavy vision of Zack Snyder. Interestingly, the events depicted in Noah Munro's film wrap around the battle seen in the first film; the Spartans are seen heading off the Hot Gates 20 minutes in, and news of their sacrifice is received around the hour mark. The focus is wider, and begins with the birth of Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). Popping out of the pool at 12 feet tall, the mortal turned god is mainly a peripheral figure as the Greeks, led by Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) ramp up for a sea-battle with the Persians. The Persian forces are under the control of Artemesia (Eva Green), whose backstory is fully explained through a graphic scene in which she watches her family raped and murdered. Trained as a warrior, she's a worthy adversary for Themistokles, and they even get it on romantically, although the sex is anything but gentle. With Snyder co-writing and producing, 300: Rise of an Empire is very much more of the same in terms of bare-chested speeches and heavy bouts of narration, but the epic sea battles are freshly presented, and the spectacle is huge throughout. Green and Stapleton both fill out their roles with venom, and gouts of gore spray over decks, extras and the camera lens; the promise of a 'tide of blood' is delivered on, including a choice decapitation. 300; Rise of an Empire is a rattling good watch for those who enjoyed the first film. With plenty of plot-lines left hanging, there's plenty of scope for the franchise to continue after this solid, impressively handled entry. The Film Authority",300 - Rise of an Empire
322,addanilov1,Worse than 1st one,7,9 March 2014,"I just came back home from cinema and I have ambiguous feelings.Film ""300"" was very good and memorable: Inspiring battle of 300 Spartans that based on true story was really interesting to watch. Also Leonidas is character whom you will be worried about. ""300"" has its own style – interesting narrative style, excellent camera work, slow motion. It was really good action movie that will make you think that Spartans made quite a feat and it really happened.In last 5 years there is a trend in Hollywood – make a sequel to any successful movie. And when sequel of ""300"" was announced, I wasn't surprised and added this movie to watch list. I hoped that it would be at least not much worse that the first part.And while I was watching Rise of an Empire I really enjoyed what was happening on the screen – the same narrative style, slow motion, same actors, even Zack Snyder took part in creation of second part. But yet something was lacking. This movie is not based on true story, it can't inspire someone – it became just cool entertaining movie with stunning action scenes. And also new main character is not even close to Leonidas – speeches of Themistokles do not cause any emotions, do not cause tingling in the skin. Happening on the screen does not make you worry about the characters and will not cause any thoughts other than ""How cool he flunked this Persian!""So because of that I was pretty depressed about it. Visual effects and technical side of the film are on the highest level, but the picture is empty. You can just watch it one time and then never remember about it. If you want to just relax and have fun with friends – this is movie which you are looking for. But if you want to see something that will make your brain a little bit to think – I don't recommend you to watch it.So my verdict is:7/10",300 - Rise of an Empire

It's quite simple but it works. I love Zack Snyder's direction, so 300 was perfect to let the barbarian side of our personality take control.So is the sequel works as good as the first ?Yes ! 300 Rise of an Empire is impressive, we have the spectacle that we expected. For me there is no disappointment. It is in line of the first. Of course it is a different director but it does not spoil the fun ! The battles are very well directed. We perfectly notice the fact that it is based upon a graphic novel. It is epic. The blood is done with CGI, OK, it is weird but I think it is still in the idea of staying in line of the graphic novel.I was a barbarian, a Greek, a Persian, an Athenian during the movie. We find like in the first movie the pleasure to watch huge battles with shields, swords, bows... This is catharsis.The actors are quite good, OK, I admit, they just have to say ""AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH !!!"". I am kidding, they also do very intense speech which are awesome !I liked 300 Rise of an Empire !

They were present at Thermopylaie, but they had nothing to do with the battle of Salamis. So the title is off. Salamis was a naval battle commanded by the Athenians and their general Themistocles. In this movie, Themistocles (and everyone else apparently) has ninja powers. Xerxes, the noble Persian emperor is apparently a freak of nature who carries his freak-show with him and he has a woman to command his fleet... The dialogs are worse than an 80's Hong-Kong karate b-movie and there is unnecessary nudity all over. The visual style, while something fresh on the original movie, it is not effective now and sometimes it even becomes annoying.This movie is an insult to everyone because not only of it's content and how much history was twisted, but because it is just a poor movie.",300 - Rise of an Empire

I think this is completely unjustified. This is entertainment and must be treated as such. HIstory aside, there's more than one element of pure fantasy in this movie, so one hardly expects the historical portrayal to be completely factual.The storyline is average, the visual effects and action sequences are without doubt state-of-the-art. I generally hate never ending, mindless action sequences but the ones in this flick were quite watchable, there were even a few brilliant moments. The best part of the movie for me were the characters, I find the Persians far more interesting - Xerses and Artemisia (Eva Green) are both fascinating. And my biggest gripe with this film is that these fascinating personalities didn't really have much to do. Sadly, the 300 franchise thrives mostly on action sequences and plot lines stay on the back-burner, I think that's where the opportunity of making brilliant sequel was lost and the viewer was left with a decent but forgettable action flick. It'd be remiss of me not to give the gorgeous Eva Green a standalone mention, she looks amazing throughout and more than badass to fit her part. Her presence alone was worth the price of admission.",300 - Rise of an Empire

So please, read at least some reviews before you decide to watch it!This was a really boring day and I've watched just about every crappy movie you could possible imagine. To have an objective view of this foul creation I deliberately decided NOT to refresh my memories with the original 300 in order to judge this movie for what it is and not for what it could or should have been.Brief overview of the plot: A long-long time ago Persian king Darius I decides to invade Athens. While his forces exceeded those of Greeks, his invasion was stopped at the bay by a young and brave simple soldier Themistocles(who was 45 at the time and was actually general and an Athenian politician). Somehow he managed to shoot king Darius in the heart from half a mile during the storm, who later died in his bed telling his(only?) son Xerxes that he should not invade Greeks ever again. Xerxes, seduced by words of vengeance from Artemisia, decides to get high on mushrooms or whatever and go into the desert to seek enlightenment. There he finds a hermit cave with a magical pool, which transforms him from Prince of Persia into a giant Paris Hilton on testosterone, HGH and creatine. He pronounces himself a god-king and starts his victorious conquest.Slash-slash-slash-blood-slash-blood-whoosh-whoosh-slash- lotsofslowmo-blood-slash-blood The second half of the movie is all talk, 99% of which does not stick to the brain, which gets me straight to the last part: Arthemisia gets bitch-slapped by Xerxes, while Xerxes gets bitched-up by Arthemisia.Slash-slash-slash-blood-slash-blood-whoosh-whoosh-slash- lotsofslowmo-blood-slash-blood-...

The story is completely lost, the actors are about as interesting as cardboard cutouts and there's absolutely no discernible emotion in the whole film. It honestly amazed me that the actors all come across as if they've never read their lines before the moment they deliver them - even the big names.I watched this on my PC screen (as I do with all films), and I was more involved in (and concerned by) the battle going on in a game of Total War: Rome 2 I was playing, than I was with anyone in the film!All in all, the film serves a purpose as a training video for cinematographers, but is otherwise resoundingly empty.

329,Stevie-AL,Weak but not bad,6,7 June 2014,"Many people seem to not understand this so first let's get things straight. This movie (and its predecessor) is based on a comic book, its a fictional story inspired by real events. If you're expecting to see something historically accurate you're going to be disappointed, misinformed and even offended by it. Thus criticizing it for its portrayal of events is irrelevant. This doesn't save it from being a good or a bad movie, but it needed to be said.So now back to the movie. There are two good things about it, one is the visual side. Some of the sequences in the beginning were spectacular, one could argue that some effects look cheap or fake but personally I think that's in the style of this movie, overall it looks fantastic. The main problem is that the locations are always under clouds and at sea, most of the scenes are too dark and gloomy, and it starts to get really boring after a while. The other good thing is Eva Green. She was the highlight of the movie for me. She was really irresistible. But of course this is just a matter of taste. Her acting was fine.The script was really terrible, its without a doubt the worst part of this movie, and I must say that its sad to know that the same person who made the first one a good movie, is responsible for making the second bad. Not only that he backed away from directing it, but he also contributed to make it worse. Also I think that the actor who plays the main character was a very bad choice for the role.Everything else was pretty much average, the action scenes and their choreography were fine, the movie had a lot of violent scenes but in a cartonish way, I didn't find them disturbing at all. The story wasn't bad, it occurs in parallel with the original 300 movie, and that makes it possible for many characters to return for a cameo but still it feels like they didn't take it too seriously. In a few words its all style and not much substance. I thought it was watchable and entertaining enough to earn a 6. I don't think its as good as the first one, but it makes a good sequel.

It is not even close to 300(1) or the Gerard Butler. Eva Green must be in complete delusion while accepting the movie, a talent which is hugely wasted. The power of villain-ism is completely lost which is heavily required for this kind of movies. Xerces looked like he has no control or power after 300(1).

In other words, this is a great popcorn flick. Nothing more. Within that universe, the female warrior reigns supreme. Eva Green must be seen and beheld as possibly the greatest female villain ever: Artemisia. She owns the movie and is deadly believable in her role. Her evil energy and slicing sword overshadow anyone else in a scene with her. She makes love the way she makes war, and has made a deep impression on other reviewers who basically despise 'Rise Of An Empire' for its many sins.Lena Headey, Sparta's queen Gorgo, narrates the storyline and shows regal gravity.

OK, the Greek-Persian war doesn't have any other stories as good as the Hot Gates, but they do as much as can be expected with the story of Artemisia vs. Themistocles at Salamis. No, there's not more than an ounce of real history in it. The real antagonists were not much like their on screen counterparts. Big deal. It doesn't take long until you realise that this is a fantasy (of sorts, the really magical elements are all told in flashback and so could just be 'story'). It may also be an allegory about modern warfare and politics but frankly the main evidence for that is some innovative use of Persian fire, which I think is meant in a 'plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose' way, so I'd probably not think too long on it. The film is brash, explosive, occasionally crazy (let me just say: the horse). It's also frequently very exciting. OK, Sullivan Stapleton is no Gerard Butler but on the strength of this film he deserves to escape TV and see more movie roles. Lena Headey is decent but underused. Far and away the best actor in the film is Eva Green who's scenery chewing turn as Artemisia gives us a villain half the audience are probably rooting for.

Laughingly it is even exclaimed that potters and artists can happily carve trough hordes of trained soldiers.Certain elements should be gravely disturbing for the educated viewer, such as the sudden appearance of an ironclad, 2340 years before its actual conception. Another example is that a horse with rider is really not able to jump out of the water on to a slippery trireme and otherwise prance around from one rolling deck to another. It distracts from the naval tactics and weather conditions that won the Greeks the battle in history.In all it is an entertaining film in the same (now less) original style of 300. It however fails to produce a similar lasting impression.",300 - Rise of an Empire
338,eamonnshadokarafferty,300: Rise of an Empire,4,14 April 2014,"Well this is a bit of a timeline to get through story wise, but bear with me. The first ten-fifteen minutes is going back before the events of 300 as we are placed into the Battle of Marathon, where King Darius leads his Persian army into Greece. Athenian General Themistocles (say that fast a few times) leads an army to meet them at shore and he sees a window of opportunity to take out King Darius, which he does, with a long shot of an arrow from a bow he picks up. Here is also where we witness Xerxes is there and is the son go Darius, runs to his fathers aid but is too late. Gorgo (returning Lena Headey) narrates that Themistocles knew in his heart that he made a mistake not to kill Xerxes there and then.We then get another ten minutes of how Xerxes becomes the God King that we were introduced to in 300 as we are introduced to commanding officer for Darius, Artemisia, who uses Darius's final words to Xerxes to corrupt him further by claiming they were a challenge and has him wondering off into a desert wearing gold chains until he enters a cave and goes into a pool of gold liquid to become the God King that we know. Then Artemisia kills off anyone connected to Xerxes, of the man that he used to be and then so begins the Persians coming to invade Greece for the second time.From then on we see the connections of the first film and Rise of an Empire intertwine throughout the rest of the film.until the last twenty minutes.Okay while the film is not bad, it's not good either. Sullivan Stapleton in the lead role is no Gerard Butler and what I mean by that is I just don't get a commanding presence from him and just didn't feel like he was a character that you would follow into battle with. Same could be said though on his men that there was no general character that stood out in comparison to King Leonidas and his army. The obvious standout and only good point I can recall was Eva Green's performance as Artemisia, that and the fact that she was an interesting character with a backstory for us to follow so we can see why she is as cold and hard as she is and also how she is also such a badass. For a film with so many flaws, Eva was not one of them and is the only saving grace this film has for my viewing pleasure.But if you came for blood spilling and swords swinging, there's plenty here and more. Too much if you ask me. Here in the sequel they decide to up the ante with twice as many action sequels on twice the scale yet you don't feel much about compared to the first film, because at least with the first film, you got to briefly learn of the characters before they went to battle with Xerxes, yet you're instantly thrown into battle with Themistocles in the backstory, see him later just saying we need to fight, then battles ensue. The only one that has a bit of depth to his character and what he goes through in the film is Jack O'Connell's character Calisto but nothing special. Nice to see Dilios make a brief cameo though.Not really a bad sequel as it's a story trying to be told through the before, during and after of the first 300, but still it's a followup that wasn't really necessary and overall the film's existence is unnecessary bar the exception of Eva Green being a total badass in it. Not as bad as I thought it was going to be but still a major letdown in comparison to the original, this feels more like Spartacus TV Show than a 300 follow up.",300 - Rise of an Empire
339,nibha1281,Boring apart from the last action sequence!,6,16 February 2017,This is one of the worst sequels ever. 300 was an iconic movie which set a landmark for upcoming action movies. I haven't seen action sequences as good as 300 in any other movie till now. This movie couldn't deliver after creating so much hype after its predecessor. I appreciate performance of Eva Green as Artemisia in this movie. This movie is all about her.We do not get to see much of Xerxes or Dilios as expected. Themistokles is no match for Leonidus. Story is weak as well compared to 300. None of the character seems impressive. Went to theater to watch an action flick but had to wait for more than an hour of boring politics s**t to finally get some good action sequences. The last scene with Lena Headey is superb! This movie is easily avoidable. I see this movie just as a boring build up for maybe something interesting that is yet to come. Hope the next one will not disappoint!,300 - Rise of an Empire

Cue slow motions, speeds ups, and a lack of artistic talent and you have yourself the long awaited sequel of 300.A good give away that a movie really sucks is when the directors try to disguise the poor writing and plot with over using movie effects.Throw in a cheap, vulgar sex scene and you have yourself something that will attract viewers who merit a film on level of gore and breasts.This sequel butchered what it was to be a 300 movie fan.Unforgivable",300 - Rise of an Empire
341,manofsnowballs,Amazing graphically orgasmic action movie!,9,20 March 2014,"The movie starts out 10 years before the original 300 with an awesome battle scene between the Athenians led by Themistokles and the Persians, in which Themistokles kills the Persian king in front of the Persian Prince. Artemisia, the Persian kings most trusted general manipulates the prince(now king) into believing that he is Xerxes ""The God King"" and that he must conquer the Greeks. Xerxes sends his navy, commanded by Artemisia to squash the ragtag bunch of ship that Themistokles has assembled between the city states of Greece, while he takes his army to battle the Spartans at the Hot Gates.The movie focuses on naval strategy between Artemisia and Themistokles, and the mind games played between the two of them, including a sex/fight scene. The movie has excellent CGI during the battle scenes, transitioning from very fast to slow motion seamlessly. There's also plenty of 3D blood spatter to really let the audience in on the violence of war. The only downside to the movie is how quickly the plot moves along. The movie is 102 minutes and 80 of minutes are fighting. If they had made the movie longer to better develop the plot then I believe that it would have just as good as the original, however with the quick storyline it isn't quite as good. Overall this is a very good movie that any action movie fan would really enjoy. The action is incredible and worth seeing in the theater to become immersed in the intensity of the stylistic battle scenes and action sequences.Written by Zack Snyder and Directed by a relatively new face, Noam Murro. This movie definitely deserves its R Rating. With a budget of 100 Million and an anticipated first weekend of making over 45 Million this movie will easily be in a comfortable profit zone for a potential sequel to make the 300 movies into an epic Trilogy.Till next time, more movies, less work.Matt Lamer Guest THOUGHTS OF A MOVIE ADDICT",300 - Rise of an Empire
342,hem-available-89,300 Rise of an empire - Trial for the rise of a sequel.,7,17 March 2014,"300 Rise of an Empire - A screen blotted in duskiness and gore with full 1 and half hours action. The movie presents double the barbarian ways of slaughter and kills weighing against the First part in the series. Series, for the label, can be termed as a shear piece of intelligence rather than seeing it as a pre-planned plot. The movie has been twined with the first part very intelligently sparing the final scene where the spectator leaves the theatre confused whether David Wenham playing the role of 'Dillios' is in the battle field with 10000 Spartans ready to face the Persion Army or in the Naval fleet standing alongside Lena Headey, Queen Gorgo. Apart from that the plot is perfect with small flaws of course here and there. The story unveils the flash from the past how Xerxes became the God King, cleansed and furbished with Voodoo, wearing only little dress for either a God or a King though. The movie also introduces Artemisia, the naval commander and mother of evil plots. Eva Green who plays the role of Artemisia has played an exceptional part in the movie providing an exquisite style for the movie. Her negative looks and attitude are perfect for her role and adds to the impression on her character in the movie. The Movie Director with the support of a brilliant script has made sure that people who go to watch the movie in-order to see the Spartan ways of killing and fighting will never be missing anything. Themistocles who plays the role of the King and Supreme commander of the Greek army has been portrayed as a brilliant commander in the fleet and land. To be frank he does nothing else rather than some two three tricks to try to tumble the Persian ships. Other than that Athenisia does the trick by repeatedly saying that Themistocles is intelligent. I really wonder why. He also is seen trying to sacrifice, part of his brilliance I suppose, his fellow mates and army to stir up the Spartans into a war forging alliance with them. The movie, as regards the graphics and cinematography, is too good. And it has certainly succeeded in turning out to be a spine-chiller in many ways. The story is about the Greeks trying to forge an alliance with the Spartans. Spartans are sparse in the movie. But the waiting and longing for 300 part three will definitely be on the rise as the ending of the second movie is in such a fashion where the spectators are left bereft of the hi-fi flair and fighting skills of the Spartans and that too even after they see them launching an attack after a long wait– the attack is to come in the next part. The movie is not advisable for those who hate seeing beheading and fresh body parts getting lacerated and ripped. But for others who wish to see hundred percent action and style in the best graphical way possible, the movie is worth buying ticket for. The movie in a nut shell is an attempt to elongate the history of 300 Spartans to multiple sequential movie parts. The plot and cinematography is excellent provided you watch it in 3D. It's definitely the best movie in English language running in theaters at present. Just go for watching people getting killed, nonstop action and finally to increase your yearning for the next part to get released. And as for Themistocles, though a bit less strongly built than the Spartan Leonidas but better compared with Dillios, he can be expected to give a cracker in the next part leading the united Greece with Spartans alongside them. Flaws are there, but in terms of entertainment and dialogues, none will be disappointed.",300 - Rise of an Empire
343,bougheyfamily,Hard Work,4,22 April 2014,"I really wanted to like this movie, as I loved ""300"" even if it was ridiculous and comic book honed. The original, was well...original - not since Richard Egan and his merry band of eloquent doomed heroes donned their sandals back in 1962 The 300 Spartans has the story of Thermopylae been retold, and almost seemed lost, until Gerald Butler and Zack Snyder resurrected it in blood soaked glory.This movie is a sort of ""While the 300 were at the hot gates, this was going on elsewhere"" kind of narrative, obviously no Butler this time, or though he does appear in a few scenes from the original, spliced into this one. Enter this time Sullivan Stapleton as Themistocles, a fine (in a seemingly endless line)of Aussie actors, who up until now has done most of his work in TV series and movies, most recently as Sgt. Damien Scott in Strike Back Episode 1 The other main character is former Bond girl and now embittered ex Greek Persian naval commander Eva Green as Artemis or Artemesia whichever way you want to say it, leading Xerxes navy to finish the Greeks, after Xerxes troops finally kill the 300 and march inland.As you would expect it's testosterone ramped, highly stylized gory action pretty much from the get go, but ultimately falls pretty flat in my humble opinion. We have Lena Headey as Butlers widow, now Queen of Sparta with a sour face most of the movie, and the inclusion of a few of the original cast, but that can't save it either.The Athenians under Themistocles are no Spartans, a loose affiliation of farmers, poets and architects, but they do all however seemed to have had time to spent weeks in the gym honing amazing physiques, and admirable fighting skills. Outnumbered heavily, the virtually bulletproof Themistocles gives more than a few awesome speeches to rally his troops in the face of insurmountable odds, there's plenty of ""Better to die on your feet, than live on your knees"" inspiration, but he's not the only one getting in on the action. I lost count (and interest) after a while as it seemed everyone got on a soap box and gave a do or die address during the movie. The special effects I felt were poor, the blood splatter and gore is even more ridiculous than last time, and the Persians are of course treated like canon fodder most of the time.I could go on, about historical inaccuracy, a ludicrous portrayal of Xerxes and the Persian army in general, or just little things like Artemis being able to back lip Xerxes without being strung up like a prize turkey, the list would be pretty long!If you want something to try and make more sense of the original movie, or give you a flavor of what else was happening at the time, the voice over narrative does a pretty good job. Unfortunately, one really has to put their brain in neutral to sit through this without laughing too much.",300 - Rise of an Empire
344,brethart_the1,300 - Rise of Empire: Lived up to the hype and its prequel.,8,8 March 2014,"To start with its not a sequel or prequel. The events taking place in the movie takes place at the same time when King Leonadius and his spartans (300) go on war with persians. Greek general Themistokles had defeated Daxos (Father of Xerxes) and now Xerxes is on a vengeance to destroy Greece with AThens and Sparta. Themistokles is more modernized leader here and plays war strategically, whereas Arthemisia(Eva green) plays the devilish persian who knows war can be won by any means ie., by betrayal, by sex, by vengeance. Entire story-line rolls around Artemisia and Themistokles as they both are on blood-run for each-other. Action sequences are beautifully shot and brilliantly executed. CGI is great with complete blood bath, where blood falling right on the screen which is kinda heavy dose. Story and screenplay is very powerful this time which creates a good line-up. Performance wise Eva Green as Artemisia is show-stellar who creates an evil aura worth applauding. Sullivan as the HERO Themistokles is decent but in some scenes he couldn't bring the anger the right emotions for the situation required. Zack synder has again given a good flick worth keeping in collection. Though movie might not be as great as 300 but it lives up-to its hype and makes it a good watch.Highly recommended if you are 300 fan.",300 - Rise of an Empire
345,jedimaster_yoda,No More Spartans and Not Bad At All,7,6 March 2014,"I have just seen this movie and I think it was OK. It is basically 300 with ships instead of Spartans. The script isn't complicated, the acting is good (very good when it comes to Eva Green) and the action (almost) never stops. As expected, the best thing about the movie are the special effects. I don't like 3D at all, but this time I didn't find it annoying. The one thing I did find annoying was the fact that there was way too much fake blood (Spartacus style). However, there are some things this movie lacks, compared to its predecessor.First of all, there isn't a charismatic, godlike, main character. Sullivan Stapleton is OK, but nowhere near Gerard Butler (and I don't mean his acting, but his overall screen presence). Like I said before, Eva Green is great and I'm glad the writers focused quite a lot on the villain (she even has a Hollywoodish background story). Secondly, I thing Rise of an Empire doesn't have its own ""personality"" at all. It ""burrows"" way too many things from 300. I know it is a sequel to a movie that had a lot of style and a huge ""cool factor"", but maybe they should have have tried to add some other things (at least some other cool quotes). Or maybe I just want too much.Overall, compared to other big budget movies that I've seen recently, Rise of an Empire was good. If you want a nice feel-good movie for the week-end than this should be your choice.A decent 7/10...",300 - Rise of an Empire
346,rpforsey,Boring,2,1 June 2016,"I was looking for something to watch and thought I would give this a go. I wasn't a fan of the first 300 film, so my expectations were low, but not that low.Can't really think of a good thing to say about this film. The violence was gratuitous, (and so was the sex scene). The cgi blood was laughable and there was so much of it, but none of it ever seemed to touch the fighters who stayed remarkably clean.No historical accuracy at all, so it was all just silly. In the end it was just on in the background while I looked on IMDb at other reviews and Wikipedia to find out the real story!",300 - Rise of an Empire
347,Bittu906,Mixed bag of entertainment and disappointments.,7,5 June 2014,"Intro: So Leonidas is dead and now his wife Queen Gorgo decides to avenge him. Meanwhile in the Greek city Athens, admiral Themistocles decides to brace all his fleet for attacking Persian navy, commanded by the fierce lady Artemisia. (Prequel mode: That's because Themistocles has angered the ENTIRE Persia to a great extent and he knows that now they are going to attack his city.)The film kicks off good with an immediate fight between the armies of Athens and the Persians. The special effects and the fights are as good as the previous one. No complains with CGIs and the cinematography. They keep you entertained and satisfied.After a good win, Themistocles thinks its necessary that all of the Greece is united to defeat all of the Persians and thus starts the main storyline. The film takes you in a short prequel mode to explain the rise of Xerxes to God King status.One special addition to this film is the naval commander of Xerxes Artemisia played extremely well by Eva Green. She injects leadership and brutality appropriately in her character. She's a significant part of the movie. Her story is too explained in a short flashback.The film is watchable for the fight scenes between the navies of Athens and Persia, which are brilliantly shot, no efforts spared in the CGIs. Themistocles uses good strategies using his short number of ships and gives a tough fight to Artemisia's huge navy.The main thing amiss is the Spartans, who were the crux of the earlier film. Viewers don't get to see the Spartans in action for a very long time, so that may kind of disappoint people who had started to idolize them after seeing the first one. I don't know anything about the history/mythology of Greece so I can't comment on the authenticity or correctness of storyline and characters.So in a nutshell: Story - 6/10 Special Effects - 10/10 Cast - 6/10 Expectations fulfillment - 6/10Overall this film is mainly about Athens, Themistocles and Artemisia. Xerxes and the Spartans are given a backseat. The ending however subtly indicate a third movie. The film does not live to our expectations but is certainly a good watch.",300 - Rise of an Empire
348,zohrabi64,This movie is an insult to any Persian,1,13 March 2014,"I'm a Persian, I watched the movie last night and I think it was really unjust to our history, and it's not making it OK by simply saying that it was made upon a comic book, there are many points which I couldn't close my eyes on and this is why I'm writing this. if you don't care about the accuracy of historical events you will probably enjoy the movie and in that case you don't need to read this review just move on to the next. But if you are aware of the conflicts between the east and west, the history of Greko- Persian wars and relationships etc you will suffer thorough the movie and here is why: 1- The history is twisted in the movie and very one sided 2- The movie makers present Persians as terrorists since they use suicide bombers to win the battle which is a shame, how could they relate something that accrued just in the recent history to a great nation like Persia!. 3- The Persian king Xerxes, is presented as a cowered, Darius, father of Xerxes was killed by Themistokles, a Greek general, and before his last breathes he tells Xerxes that ""do not repeat my mistake, only gods can defeat Greeks""! while Darius never left Persia to attend this war and he was not killed by Themistokles and until this day, Iranians are visiting his tomb and paying him respect. 4- The customs for Iranian soldiers and the king himself are simply Arabic customs, the general who trained Artemisia is a black person, with my respect to Arabs and every other racial group, I'm I the only one who notices this movie and feels deeply sorry for the racist movie makers?! Is it hard to tell Persians and Arabs and Blacks apart? It's just sick man who are these wild, not civilized people with long beards in this movie? With a simple look at the statues of Persepolis you can find out how Persians looked like. 6- Muhammad Dandamayev a Russian historian, mentions in his famous book ""A political history of the Achaemenid empire""; that after the Spartans killed the Persians messengers they realized what a big mistake they did and sent two soldiers to Persia so they can be killed instead of the Persian messengers and Xerxes tells them ""I would be like a nation that violated the internationally known values and performed a disrespecting act of cowardliness"" apparently this scene was shown as a remarkable thing to do in the movie 7- Last and most important point is in the movie, the Persians did not care about the slaves and the soldiers who were killed but the Greeks were defending not only their country but the freedom and democracy and apparently they don't have any slaves working for them, while slavery was widely spread at that time and it wasn't like the recent slavery of African people, the color did not matter and the Greeks were using them to build their citadels like Acropolis, surprisingly the Persians were paying workers to build Persepolis! the reason I remember this one in particular is that it was discovered just recently, archaeologists found some payment receipts made of rocks if I'm not mistaken belonged to workers who participated in building Persepolis from different nations. Democracy does not have the same meaning as the democracy we know nowadays, it's funny how this movie reflects the American perspective toward Middle-east.",300 - Rise of an Empire
349,denim_janu143,To Far from Average,8,30 March 2014,"When the trailers released on the Internet, I think that this movie is one to be watch in 3 D. As movie released, only thing to watch about is 3 d effect. This movie is going parallel with previous one. But this movie is far from 300. The main reason why this movie falls is first the director is not more experienced and ZACK is not directing the movie. The dialogs are too boring and war scenes are not too good compared to last one. The 3 d effects are too useless. The only and only one reason to watch this movie is EVA GREEN. She is the real performer of the movie. All and All I want to give this movie as 6 out of ten but I give 8. The 2 star is for EVA GREEN. Besides her there is nothing in the movie. Don't waste the money for this one",300 - Rise of an Empire
350,jooms321,An Awful Movie in many different ways,3,14 April 2014,"This movie disgusted me enough to recover my password and express how bitterly disappointing this movie is.First of all this movie is entirely about sex and violence and nothing else and I am okay with that. I like movies with sex and violence, but it was all so poorly done in this one.The blood looked as lame and cartoony as they could make it and was used so prodigiously that it lost its effect. Secondly the surrounding violence was so forced that it was laughable and again couldn't be taken seriously. For example a guy gets his head crushed by a horse's hoof and you see it coming and you know it's just to see the guys head get crushed (boring).The sex scenes and nudity in the movie were also completely forced, but probably the best part. For example there is a scene where the Persian and Greek naval leaders (a woman and a man) negotiate using rough sex by taking turns being rapey with each other. Also all the boob shots in the movie were of women having their clothes torn off by enemy warriors. Way to make rape look hot through the use of CG and models and thanks for being utterly ridiculous (sarcasm).My main qualm with the movie is that even though it has monsters and gods so you know it is a fantasy story it can still give you a false perception of history.The Persian Empire and The Greek States both had slaves in different capacities, but neither used them to man the oars of their major galleys and triremes. The boats were too important to be left to the slaves and whipping the rowers doesn't help. Having that many people rowing at the same time efficiently was pretty technical.Also the reason Sparta had so many warriors is because they had so many people who were basically slaves that had to be kept in line.There was a female Greek leader (can't remember her name) who lived within the Persian Empire who went to war along with a lot of other Greeks. The Greeks made up a sizable component of the Persian navy. The woman leader was basically caught between a rock and hard place in a battle where the Persian fleet got routed or destroyed and managed to get away and she wasn't a witch although I am sure she was called worse.Athens was indeed a democracy of sorts where everyone got a say in the larger issues, but because the population often acted as an uneducated and undisciplined mob Athens still did some horrible things to their allies and their own leaders (like executions and pillaging cities).In the movie there was a lot of talk about freedom and democracy versus servitude and enslavement to the point where I almost felt as if I was watching not so subliminal propaganda for the western world, this teaches nothing. It was not that black and white. If you want to talk about Athens and the Greek city states the real lesson is often seen as being that democracy can only thrive in a society of well educated and informed people who can make proper rational decisions.This movie had so little to do with reality in general I am rather disturbed by the fact that they did place it in a historical setting as if to blur the line between what is real and what is not.Why not make a Conan the Barbarian movie, or just make some hero and nation up if you want a movie about sex and violence? If you want to see a good violent movie I suggest ""Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky"" it has people using their own intestines to strangle their enemies, nails going through eyes, and tendons being tied back together to finish a fight in a setting and context that suits that kind of silliness.Despite being needlessly offensive to both Greeks, Iranians, and modern society in general I still give 300: Rise of an Empire 3/10 stars for being a porn with some pornographic content in it.",300 - Rise of an Empire

The story is based on Frank's Miller graphic novel not the actual historical events, so the fantasy costumes, decors and creatures are forgivable. But there are a lot historical inaccurate that you don't have to be a professor to notice for example Darius was not killed with an arrow at the Battle of Marathon. And Sparta doesn't have ships it is not a coastal City. In the movie Themistocles went twice to Sparta to ask for their ships, this is like Lincoln to go to Kanzas and ask for their ships for the Civil war. The dialog not only is cheesy but in the most parts doesn't make sense. Slow motion kills with digital CGI blood might be good idea if used once or twice in a culminating battle but when used in every single action scene it's just boring. In all the movie they are keep saying how fierce the Xerxs army is but is very hard to take it seriously when it get killed by the dozen",300 - Rise of an Empire

357,bludhunt,'300:Rise of an Empire' looked amateur considering that fact that some of the TV productions are done with more venom and precision.,3,9 March 2014,"War epics and action films in general got a shock treatment and a new face when King Leonidas and his brave 300 took the field in 2006. Sleek action scenes, bloody violence and some hard bodied warriors were painting the hot gates of Sparta with the blood of the invincible Persian army of Xerxes. One can go on for hours, talking about the magnanimous scale of the film, just to underline the fact how its sequel fell short on many levels. Technically the film is the second instalment than a sequel, as the story is now told from a simultaneous angle on the same time-line as the first.When you are trying to add more to a classic, make sure that you at least match the levels, if not out do it. '300, Rise of an Empire' felt like a TV movie when compared to its cult predecessor. First thing they got wrong is the casting. The actor who was chosen to carry forward the legacy of Gerard Butler's King Leonidas, should have been a huge name or at least a charismatic natural with deep strong voice. Sullivan Stapleton was simply no match for that. Eva Green tried her best to bring fear into Artemisia, but at no point did she look like killing Themistokles. One character who managed to outperform from the first part was Lena Headey, who took Queen Gorgo to bigger heights than seen in '300'. We knew she was manipulative, but her will power and slick skills with her husband's sword was a surprise and a good one at that. The chill and thrills from the action scenes was the most impressive element in the original '300', every action scene was fresh, bloody and brutal. Its successor could only provide those thrills in a few scenes, which can actually be counted using your fingers. Its Failure, plain and simple. ""We will rather die on our feet than live on our knees"". When Themistokles said this line, I added one to the count of good and memorable dialogues in the film and then I stopped counting. That was it. But I can think of a thousand lines from '300' which was well written and powerful. The simple line, ""This is Sparta"" when King Leonidas kicks the Persian messenger to the death well still gives me goose bumps. Do you want to relive that moment again? I know that we can watch that scene over and over again.In short, '300:Rise of an Empire' looked amateur considering that fact that some of the TV productions are done with more venom and precision. I thought of a 4/10, but there is nothing that is new in the film, so I am going with a lousy 3/10. Watch it for the constructive criticism, but not for the thrills.",300 - Rise of an Empire
358,silntassasin,A disappointing sequel,3,8 March 2014,"The sequel to the surprise action flick 300. When the first 300 was announced I had little hope for it, and it proved me wrong turning out to be a surprise hit that year. This was what I had imagined the first one too be like. An uninspired average movie with buckets of blood and wooden characters. Yes I'm sorry fans of the original but this movie is pretty damn average. First there was the acting. It was average to say the least other then Eva Green as the villain. Then there was the script. Wait was there a script? Or did they just get 5 year old kids to repeatedly video the same fight scenes over and over again? I mean seriously how many times do I want too see the same damn fight scene! Then there was the blood. While the first movie used the blood to their advantage, using it as a arty substance, this movie however does the opposite with over top blood being used way too much and way too heavily. The fight scenes were basically speed up slow down sword thrust speed up slow down head removal speed up slow down arm removal and that's it. That's literally almost the whole movie summed up. Some action junkies may enjoy this but to me it was an uninspired, over the top gore fest, that I for one would not want to watch again.",300 - Rise of an Empire
359,sheilah-953-788608,lots of fun to watch,8,20 March 2014,"thoroughly enjoyed this movie, even though I heard many reviews and friends saying how much they didn't like it.For anyone who has seen the first 300 movie, the style and cinematography is the same. Fast action movie, filled with focused slow motion moments to emphasize how cool the fight scenes are.The acting was also very well done, and this movie certainly has a lot more ""acting"" than the first. Eva Green was absolutely phenomenal in her role, and by the end of the movie I wasn't sure if I was cheering for the hero any more, or if I wanted Eva Green's character to win.The script was also very well done, but I expected as much since I found the soliloquy's of the first movie impressive and were used to set the mood of the movie. This movie did the exact same thing.The graphics were great, a feel of surrealism mixed with reality.One thing I did like about this movie is that it stepped back and didn't have any of the ""fantasy"" elements of the first one. What I mean by this is that this first movie had some of the enemies with what could only be seen as fantastical powers. This movie had none of that, and even though I love fantasy movies, I like the 300 movies to focus more on people.I watched the movie in 3D, and I am not quite sure what the necessity was in making in 3D. There were no moments of ""it looks so cool/so much more real because it is popping out at me"". Looking back, I would have been just as content watching this in 2D. However, I saw it in the theatre, and 3D there is not as good as 3D on my home TV, so I want to watch it again on that instead.Overall, I think this is an excellent movie, and that you should most definitely go watch it.",300 - Rise of an Empire

Director Noam Murro's follow up to Zack Snyders 2006 striking adaptation of Frank Millers graphic novel, fails its own hype and falls flat. Sullivan Stapleton as Greek leader in charge, Themistocles, uncomfortably juggles between long winded inspirer, and self loathing hero, so much so that our attentions are turned toward the alluring Eva Green. As Artemisia, a Greek turn-coat leading the Persian navy of Xerxes, she sizzles with the fire of revenge having had a torrid history at the hands of her own kinsfolk. Even Xerxes himself, is painted as a not-so-bad dude. It's a conflicted mess of a film that abandons the simplistic scruples of its pen and ink origins. This is not Sparta.",300 - Rise of an Empire

365,billfernhill,300 - Fall of a Franchise,2,27 September 2014,"After the fantastic ride that was 300, I was a bit excited to hear about this sequel.....HOWEVER, ""disappointed"" is the kindest word I can use to describe this disaster. While the acting is a tad wooden, one can see why this is so as the movie progresses. Eva Green, like David Wenham, spends her time exuding a ""WTF have I done!?"" sense of ""contractual obligation"" all the way through this car crash. In fact, all the actors could be forgiven for doing just this because the blame for the entire fiasco lays firmly at the feet of the director. The ludicrous buckets of blood that seem to gush at the slightest scratch, the relentless ultra-slow-mo and the improbability of the battles just makes this whole thing utterly laughable.Don't get me wrong, I LOVE a good B, C, D, E OR EVEN F-grade film, but this is just a disaster. It's as though some spoilt, pimply, greasy 17 year old who has an obsession with X-box gore-games, and whose only cinematic experience is watching late-night commercial telly, has been given a $100 million by his mum, no supervision and THIS abomination was what he came up with.Don't.

366,ciubotaruoa,A proof of how good was the first one,1,10 March 2014,"First of all, I voted 1 not because there isn't 0, but because this movies had some innovative visual elements.I cannot tell much about the screenplay, just that it is so bad that at some point I stopped following it. If you had a strong impression about Xerxes, well, this movie shows you a daddy-issues guy that becomes a God and get pretty much womanized by this minion, 40 kilos, killing machine. He is pretty much pictured as an idiot with huge army and empire that gets mocked by one of his many commanders. Exactly here is the difference from the first movie! No one expects to be historically accurate, hyperbolize everything is you wish, but do not change the little we know.If in 300 we saw one of the most intense sex scene ever on screen, in this one, it looks like a kinky dream of someone that never had sex nor watched some porn.Why does Temistocle's men jump 50 meters (and not die) on Persian ships to die fighting bigger army instead of... throwing some rocks or fire on them???Bad choice for Temistocle and other characters. I understand the ""politically-correct"" idea, but Greeks were not blonde with blue eyes! Anyway, in all important dialogs this guy has no mimic... it's like he is constantly amazed.The Visual Effects are same great effects that we know, but with a small touch: a lot of particles that create a more in-depth 3D experience.There are many other problems, flaws, stupid things in this movie, but I will remind just one more: Are we, humans, some balloons filled-up with Ketchup? At least this is what I understood from this movie.The conclusion is this: I regret the money spent on the ticket and the 2 hours of my life that are totally lost!",300 - Rise of an Empire
367,sreepulari,Earth shattering hardcore action,9,8 March 2014,When i heard the news about 300 coming with a second part i thought they are going to humiliate the first one. But i was proved wrong.Rise of an empire gives story behind the epic war. Themistokles kills the Persian king Darius in front of his son Xerxes and Xerves took his vengeance on Greece. Themistokles trying to unite Greece but queen of Sparta denies her approval. Eva Green steals the show and established Artemisia as a powerful character. The fight between Artemisia and Themistokles is much accompanied by such a powerful climax.The hardcore visual treat combined with awesome background music and dialogue presentation gives us goosebumps. we can feel the heat in our bloods. Its been such a big time since such a movie with so much heat has been released. I just loved it. Don't believe in dumb reviews.see for yourself if you want some entrainment,300 - Rise of an Empire
368,alexander-agathos,I liked it. Elements of true history and fiction,7,16 July 2014,I really liked this movie. OK a lot of blood but I could cope with it. The movie was designed to be entertaining. I can understand why some parts are not historically correct. For the Persians who complain a lot I think that the movie actually tried to give Xerxes a god like look and also relieved him from taking the responsibility of the battle in Salamina and gave it to Artemisia. It was actually Artemisia who warned Xerxes not to attack the Greeks in Salamina and not the other way round.Anyway this movie can make people search for what truly happened in history. Its one of the greatest moments in history the battle in Salamina. Had it not been things would be different the civilization of the whole Western civilization would not be the same as Wikipedia correctly says at least the Greek version.,300 - Rise of an Empire
369,jitu935,Wow,7,9 March 2014,"First of all this is not a sequel or prequel of 300, most of the events take place along with the battle of Thermopylae of 300, so its basically in the same time frame. the story begins with the Battle of Marathon and concludes with the Battle of Salamis. In this installment we get to see why and how Xerxes becomes the god king; how Artemesia, his naval commander leads the naval force against the Athenians and its consequences. Like its predecessors there is enough graphic violence, blood and gore. The 3D effects have been well utilized and the slow motion sequences added the extra oomph. Great movie to watch but the only thing that was missing was the uniqueness. Movies like Jurassic park, Matrix n 300 were all ground breaking movies in different manner and there immense success was the outcome of portraying something new and unique which were quite not archived by there sequels. I would love to give it 7/10",300 - Rise of an Empire
370,TheIneffable,"A capable, but lackluster, action flick.",5,10 March 2014,"((This review via: http://thinmanmoviereviews.wordpress.com/2014/03/10/300-rise-of-an- empire/))When word of a follow-up to 2006′s ""300″ first arose, I expected something small; a low-budget direct-to-DVD sequel set up to capitalize on the original's success. As casting news began to arrive, attaching a select few original cast members to the shoot as well as some welcome new faces, it became clear that ""300: Rise of an Empire"" was intended to be a proper theatrical release on par with its predecessor. Unfortunately, the mixed bag that's been delivered indicates that a smaller follow-up (or none at all) might have been the better course of action.""Rise of an Empire"" does not break the mold, by any means. From the opening frame and its accompanying voice over narration, it's clear that writer/producer Zack Snyder (""300″, ""Man of Steel"") and director Noam Murro want to play upon familiarity of form and presentation to more easily acclimate viewers to the action that lies ahead while also firmly setting this tale into the same series of battles as Thermopylae. To their credit, this works as intended but eventually it hampers the film. Much like 2011′s ""The Thing"" (another tie-in film playing on a well known original), which ended up simply being an almost point-for-point rehash of John Carpenter's original, ""Rise of an Empire"" keeps the successful aesthetics of its source material but never musters up the courage to branch out on its own. The central conflict – the battle of Battle of Salamis – plays out almost exactly like a naval version of the battle of Thermopylae as an outnumbered force of Greek defenders attempt to hold back the overwhelming Persian navy which conveniently attacks one wave at a time rather than all together. While this worked for 2006′s ""300″, as Gerard Butler's Leonidas bottlenecked the Persian army in a mountain pass, one wonders why the Persian navy in ""Rise of an Empire"" can't simply send some of their hundreds of ships sailing around the smaller force to land on the Greek shores.Fortunately this never crosses the minds of the Persian commanders on screen, resulting in no shortage of brutal, bloody carnage as attack after attack is shattered by the Greek defenses. Action is the strong point of ""Rise of an Empire"" and, not surprisingly, it delivers. Graphic slow motion kills still make their presence felt but they are somewhat less numerous this time around, which gives everything a more visceral feel even as nearly every wound is computer generated. Where the first ""300″'s use of slow motion often made combat feel like a museum piece – something to be studied and examined in every minute detail – the more conservative approach this time around should help to draw viewers further into the battles as they seem more rapid, vibrant and alive.If only ""vibrant"" and ""alive"" were terms that could be applied to the characters of ""Rise of an Empire"". With Lena Headey (""Game of Thrones"") returning, and the addition of Sullivan Stapleton (""Strike Back"") and Eva Green (""Casino Royale""), the cast certainly has the acting chops to carry the film, but they're given very little to do besides battle endlessly and make grandiose speeches about vengeance and honor. Stapleton again proves that he's a capable action star and the always- alluring Eva Green carries just the right amount of menace as the film's central antagonist, but any meager attempts at character development provided by the script are either awkward missteps or are simply glossed over amid the continuous clashing of swords and shields.In the end, ""300: Rise of an Empire"" is a humdrum experience that provides more of the same without venturing into new territory as good sequels (""Hunger Games: Catching Fire"", ""Thor: The Dark World"") should. It's a capable but heartless action flick that would have been better suited as a smaller direct-to-DVD sequel instead of a full theatrical release and, to use video game terms, feels less like a true sequel and more like the film equivalent to DLC.",300 - Rise of an Empire
371,jo-185-56717,Terribly stupid and pointless,2,17 March 2014,"How could you mess up a sequel to 300? The story of the first movie was simple and straight forward, yet jam packed with wit and beautiful details...and came along with a look that was fresh and sexy, very self assured and uncompromising. Rise of an Empire is a joke compared to the original and a huge let down for anybody who appreciates good (or even visually appealing) movies. The story is unnecessary complicated but doesn't make much sense. While the visuals in the first movie seemed stylized and fresh, ROAE seems cheap, the 3D never really impresses (enough to justify it's use) and I had a hard time finishing the movie, partly because I couldn't believe how they could do this to the franchise...and how Zack Snyder is still part of this...I don't think he sleeps well these days.Typical Hollywood sell out of a creative original idea. Really surprising to me are all those good reviews all over the place, but I guess quality standards are just ridiculously low these days.Avoid if you can!!!!!",300 - Rise of an Empire
372,victoric,Do not expected too much before you watch,5,19 March 2014,"I watched 300 a few years ago, which was such a good movie with a special high contrast view and a lot of manhood. So, I was expecting 300: Rise of the empire will bring in similar ideas and a little bit of something new. However, it was not passed.The movie does not describe a lot of manhood, nearly none of those ""Spartan spirit"". There are a lot less of those slow motion shots. The biggest difference between the first and second 300 is Land force become Naval force, General become Commander. The most unsatisfying thing is there aren't enough battle scenes, in other words there is way too few strategy shown in the sea.After watching the movie, it feels like there should be a lot more although the first one has already shown what's next. I do not recommend to watch this movie unless you want to ruin your good memory of the first 300.",300 - Rise of an Empire
373,archaon_91,Neither the worst or best sequel to 300,7,14 March 2015,"For one second, don't remind yourself of all the hating you've read or heard. This movie isn't worthy of such disgusting commentaries, there's too many wanna-be critics trying to make a name for themselves by bringing you negativity (which is usually the best way to attract attention).After seeing this movie i wouldn't say that i was baffled or amazed, but neither was i shocked or disgusted by it. It had its ups and downs, but never did i feel like i was being robbed of my money. The movie basically tells you the story about the naval battles of Themistocles that occurred alongside the battle of Thermopalae in 300. Now naval battles can be cool to watch, especially when the era is the golden age of piracy (18th to 19th century), but during the Greek era you will have to suffice with basic wooden ships without majestic sails or guns blazing, so the action is very limited to ramming and boarding ships... still i believe that they did the best they could to keep the battles interesting, for as far as you can push it while remaining historically accurate at the same time. The action scenes themselves were awesome to watch as we are used of 300, the choreography of the fighting looks a lot more graceful and fluently than before, although there is no real coherency in the melee fights because they are more chaotic as opposed to organized units of soldiers. However, this time they overdid the blood splatter and slow motion, you can already notice this in the first 10 minutes and this makes the movie look a bit more cheap honestly. In terms of photography the movie looks a lot more grand than before, where as 300 felt more like it was filmed in a studio, but then again a lot of the scenes in this movie are located on water, which doesn't stay interesting for long, which is mainly because the Greek fleet uses a defensive-guerrilla strategy and this forces the scenes in between the battles to look like forced posing scenes where the actors had time to flex their abs and show off their muscles, but i guess they have to satisfy the female viewers to some extend as well. However, i do admit that minor scenes like the sex scene was a bit out of sync with the rest of the movie and felt more like an interesting filler to keep your attention on screen during the more boring parts of the movie. But i never felt like the dialogs in the more boring scenes were badly written, only the acting made it look a bit cheap.FINAL VERDICT: The main difference with the original 300 is that this movie doesn't let the action and narrative scenes flow over into each other as seamlessly like they did in 300. This movie jumps from one scene to another without you often realizing on which location the scene is located, so the movie feels like it's all over place and nowhere at the same time, especially if you haven't watched the first 300 movie. Also, most of special effects seem cheap or exaggerated and the narrative dialog scenes aren't that well acted, which adds to the boredom of those scenes, making them feel unnecessary. On the plus side, the fighting looks a bit more spectacular in terms of choreography even though the fighting looks a bit more chaotic than in 300. The story is well written, but sometimes poorly executed. In total this movie was entertaining and tried to tell a historically accurate story and made it as interesting as they possibly could or were allowed. However, this will not appeal to everybody that loved the original 300 which was more fast-paced and better acted.",300 - Rise of an Empire

There are long, boring speeches that go on and on about this so-called ""freedom"" that they seem to be doing a generally bad job protecting.

The battle scenes were shot brilliantly (although there might have been a little bit more blood than it should have been) and most of the time had me on the edge of my seat. The flaw of the movie was the storyline. On many occasions it had me thinking how the hell could that have happened. A few dozen Greek ships attacked the naval fleet of the Persian empire (which was composed of a thousand or so ships)and seemingly never lost a single ship whereas the Persian empire lost forty to fifty ships every battle. These aspects of the movie was exaggerated grossly compared to the real battles that commenced between the Greeks and the Persian empire. Another illogical scene that caught my eye in the movie was the sex scene between Themistokles and Artemisia. It simply made no sense whatsoever. Why would the commander of the Greek forces just go and sleep with one of their biggest enemies and the commander of the naval fleet just be down for that? That just didn't make any sense and in my opinion was just put there so there could be a sex scene in the movie, which let's be honest a lot of viewers would enjoy. Nevertheless the movie was an entertaining movie and I never got bored while watching.

It also show acme about the King Leonidas and 300 men and also about their sacrifice for their country .This movie tell about the Unani army how they defeat huge sea army of Xersi's under their commander Themistokles .

Then the story goes with the Greek general Themistokles leads the charge against invading Persian forces led by mortal-turned-god Xerxes and Artemisia, strong+seductive+vengeful commander of the Persian navy.Actually, I assumed the movie would be empty without Gerard Butler because he was strongly attached to the image of movie 300. But I was wrong! Eva Green rocks the movie! Her acting was FAB and she eats Artemisia alive. For me, Artemisia is an inspiring character ever and now I can not separate the movie from her. The movie is her. I am immensely fond of her...For Themistokles, honestly I am disappointed.I kinda like him at first but I changed my mind. He fell for the crap Artemisia offered, i was like really!!! maybe I'm just not into jackasses. And Xerxes (eyes rolling) for me he is more like a drunken narcissistic homosexual rather than a terrifying God.But, the fighting scenes are extremely intense and sadist. Well, it is OK but there are some bloody moments when I shut my eyes cause I can't stand it, it is just too freaky.

Fast moves and flying body parts made it look like it was made just for the action scenes. There was no drama in it like its predecessor. 300 was more romantic in everything but Rise of an Empire is just hell bent on Vengeance.Rodrigo Santoro has nothing to do in the film like in the original except make a commanding appearance. He is nothing compared to Eva Green. She is the only one who stands out. Sullivan Stapelton does his best to be a warrior. Lena Headey narrates the whole film as does David Wenham in the original. if there should be a sequel I strongly suggest Xerxes fight. The sound was awesome. Graphics eye catching. Fight scenes brilliant.Finally, its suitable for those who thirst for blood and glory and not for the weak hearted.My Favourite line in the movies ""YOU FIGHT HARDER THAN YOU ****.",300 - Rise of an Empire
381,johnnynokeys,"Decent story, terrible special FX and CGI, corny lines throughout",3,3 April 2014,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS: Being a big fan of the original ""300,"" I had mixed feelings about the idea of a sequel. I know Hollywood often times seems to botch sequels in order to cash in on a blockbuster, original film & seems to do so without any regard for quality and consistency these days. ""300: Rise of an Empire"" was NO exception. The trailer even looked cheezy. But, some friends wanted to go see it, so I gave in and tagged along.The film starts out setting up the story, and in this back story, is a battle scene. The CGI blood is SO ridiculously bad & SO horribly done it pretty much took me right out of the film-(in the first few minutes mind you). I could've drawn the blood in with a crayon and made it more believable. Also, when you first see Eva Green standing next to Xerxes for the first time... it is so painfully obvious that she is standing next to a green-screen... it's awful. But still, I wanted to give the film a fair chance, so I tried to watch with an open mind, keep my ""head in the game"" and see some good in it.The story/the way they show the origin of Xerxes and the way they develop the overall story of the film and interweave it with the story of the 300 Spartans was a pretty good approach. It shows what the Athenians were doing & trying to do before, during and after the last stand of the 300. The first meeting/eventual sex scene between Eva Green's character and the leader of the Athenians was also well done and humorous at just the right times as well as the end result. But that's about it. Some of the battle scenes are well conceived. It maintained some of the original characters, played by the original actors-consistency is always good. The costumes are good. The actors do a good job for the most part.But some of the lines written in this film are SO corny and cheezy(and not in the good way, mind you), a couple of times I couldn't help busting out laughing in the theater... and I was not laughing alone. One especially memorable laugh-out-loud line, was just before Eva Green's character makes here last charge, she says: ""I did not come here as a witness"" -something like that... it was incredibly random and awkward. It turned that moment into an unintentional joke. Another ridiculous part is when the Athenians elude to a secret ""weapon"" or hint at a special advantage that they are keeping below deck on their final naval stand with the Persians... turns out to be... HORSES. Yep... horses. WHAT??! If you can shut your mind off and you just want to see blood gushing everywhere with arms and heads being cut off, you'll have some fun with it. (It seems they tried to one-up the gore and blood in this one, instead of having it tactfully placed-giving it more presence.) But if you're expecting the brilliance and awesomeness of the original masterpiece... don't bother-you're going to be terribly disappointed. I'll probably still pick it up on DVD when it goes on sale for real cheap- but I definitely would not pay full price for it, not worth it.",300 - Rise of an Empire
382,rolandr-943-671707,Disaster. Absolutely forgettable.,3,8 March 2014,"Recently, I tend to think that the first couple of thousand of votes and reviewers are paid by the studios on IMDb.com and the flick will receive its real score about half a year later.I browsed through dozens of 7 to 10 reviews and I couldn't believe my eyes. Have you seen the same movie I watched yesterday? I loved 300 but this one is a million miles from it. I really don't want to write about the performance of Eva Green and Sullivan Stapleton because they perfectly matched the movie itself: the storyline, the bloody scenes, the dialogs, everything. Forgettable, CGI-packed action with predictable rhythm of ""calm"" and intense scenes from beginning to end. As far as I remember, the Persians never destroyed Athens and the ""rebirth"" of Xerxes was also a joke, not to mention the union of Artemisia and Themistokles. 300 was almost a perfect movie but it has nothing to do with its glorious predecessor.",300 - Rise of an Empire
383,dgluth,"All the style, none of the charm.",4,13 March 2014,"This film does a fantastic job of recreating the graphic novel feel of the first. Fight sequences look good and some of the visuals are quite spectacular for visual effects. The story is even half- way decent, but lacks what made the first film fun. 300 (2006) was a very standout film for its year, as not very much like it was being made at the time. Since the debut of the first film, cgi has really become integrated into everything. No matter if it is a music video or a sparse drama film, cgi is readily employed to allow the filmmakers greater manipulation of the frame. 300: Rise of an Empire (2014) then seems to have lost its splendor in the look due to how used to such stylized ""comic-book-to-life"" film-goers have become. The story is the spot then, that more time should have been employed. The narrative structure is brilliant, setting it before, during, and after the events of the first film. Unfortunately, it is really only where things take off after the first that one can really enjoy the second. The story is muddled by pacing issues and an overly wordy script. Eva Green is fantastic as a villain, despite the controversy being made over her poor portrayal of feminine values. Sullivan Stapleton is actually quite good, but he lacked a performance quality that Gerard Butler lent his lead in the first film. Others from 300 (2014) make appearances throughout, but most of their screen time feels phoned-in. Overall, a nice film to behold brought down by poor choices. Namely lacking the character of the first and being made a staggering eight years after the core audience cared about the first film.",300 - Rise of an Empire
384,adamssmith490,Not good. not bad,6,30 March 2014,"Well first of all, this movie was unnecessary and did not totally fulfill its expectations from the way the first movie ended. Many things were bad about the movie but the overall action was good. Gorgo's transformation into Sparta's military leader which was unexplained was one problem but this can be fairly explained as her route to seek vengeance for her king. A lot of people have turned this into a sexist argument. Artemisia's sword wielding power was not contested because the basis for her skills were established. As for Gorgo, nothing was said about her ability and so her appearance at the battle was shocking. The basis for the skills of the men was also established. Another problem was that there were a lot of contradictions between this one and the previous movie. I gave this movie a rating of six because the movie was not too exceptional but was not a total waste of time.",300 - Rise of an Empire
385,clement-959-542917,The Fall of a License,5,7 April 2014,"The only common point between this pre- / sequel with its glorious predecessor is to be found in the title. Other than that, '300: The Rise of An Empire' is nothing close to the Greek tragedy of the Hot Gates; it is merely a tragic movie with Greeks in it.With the astounding release of the first movie, '300', we discovered a very acute and recognizable style in Art and Movie directing. It was comparable to 'The Matrix' effect that rippled so far and so long that even the early X-Men team had lost its original suits. Or to Sin City... Which makes sense since both have come from the brilliant mind and hand of comic author Frank Miller!On the contrary, '300: The Rise Of An Empire' does not live up to the expectations that the audience naturally drew from the high appreciation of the first movie. It actually believes a movie can rely exclusively on the good old memories we had from the previous one. But it simply does not work.If the storyline is decent enough to keep you awake, it is told in such a boring fashion that even Eva Green's endless monologues might look more entertaining! The acting is poor, the CG much more dominant, and the fighting scenes terribly poor in choreography. All that ties these cheap elements together is the visual effect work on tints and colours, and the '300 look' and feel. Period.I would highly recommend you do NOT watch this movie and wait for its arrival on Netflix. Which should not take too long...",300 - Rise of an Empire
386,Erginayalp,Couldn't finish it,2,21 May 2014,"This film was terrible from start to middle when I couldn't carry on. The entire movie is based on a major historical in accuracy( Themistocles killing Darius causing Xerxes to have deep hatred/revenge). But that aside, I was still positive to see where the film would go. Nowhere, it went nowhere. The time line is SIMULTANEOUS to the first 300, except while it's implied the Spartans are fighting OK land elsewhere we watch a movie about Themistecles fighting Eva Green on some ships. Why would this time line need a movie? There were only 2 naval battles worth mention and even then, the end result is still death to Leonidis et al (the heroes). So the plot is ridiculous, how about the filming? Also ridiculous. The classic comic bookesque 300 has been stretched soo far in this one that you can't take the movie seriously. The scene where Xerxes comes out of some weird gold cave water as ""a god"" is one of the most ridiculous scenes I've ever scene. The spray abs were also Over the top along with blood that was so fake you has to really question what it was before realizing it was a wound. The characters were so boring and unrealizable that even the ONE ""sex"" scene wasn't enough to wake me. The main character was simply bad, he also lacked a group of 300 loyal/awesome buddies (the whole point of the movie title). The main villain wasn't Persian, but she was extremely dry. Just because Eva had some mascara and leather outfits with lots of squinty eyes and a strange panther like voice, it didn't make her a villain. She was boring and lacked a true motive other than ""revenge on my captives"" which would've worked if her story was developed for say more than a 30 sec flashback. Overall, terrible movie with no redeeming qualities AND NO ENDLESS PIT OF DOOM.",300 - Rise of an Empire
387,sgt_bug,"Dull, boring and shallow",2,26 March 2014,"If you think that you may like this film because you saw the 2006 film, ""300"" starring Gerard Butler, you may be in for a surprise and not in a good way. I haven't read the comic book and I'm evaluating the film on its merit.The time-line of this film is set during the time Leonidas is preparing to defend Sparta with his army of 300 and a little before that time showing the rise of Xerxes. It also covers a small period ahead of the battle of Sparta. The film mainly shows a battle between strategists, Themistokles and Artemisia.I mean, I would be okay if this was a good gore-fest. I had no problems with the blood at all, that was the only reason why this film gets a 2 from me and not anything lower but you expect at least some depth in the characters. Apart from Eva Green, everyone else seems to be sleepwalking. The writing is so bad that after a while, you just want the film to be over.Bottom line: This film is avoidable, but if you do wish to watch it, watch it for Eva Green as Artemisia and the blood.",300 - Rise of an Empire
388,bevanwalling,Disappointing,2,21 March 2015,"The first 300 movie is still currently one of my favorite movies of all times. This is yet another disappointment squeal trying to suck money out of what was an excellent stand alone film. One reason why I liked 300 was due to it's historical accuracy, yes they left a few parts out and exaggerated a few things for entertainment but the premise of the movie fairly was accurate.But this story line was just embarrassing. Athens had one of the greatest naval fleets in the world at the time and Sparta didn't own a single ship, yet in the movie Sparta comes to the rescue with there fleet. No.The combat was no where near as good in the second movie and there was a complete lack of interesting characters. 300 was full of characters like Leonidas, Ephialtes, the backstabbing politician, Xerxes himself. I can't think of one character I really had any strong emotions towards. Even the nudity was bad, In the first 300, the nudity was all appropriate to the situation, but in this movie it's, look at me I'm Eva and I walk around naked because I have great tits. If you're thinking about watching this movie, don't. Just watch the original 300 again.",300 - Rise of an Empire

390,mundejewels,Worst movie ever!,2,3 May 2019,"By far the worst movie I can remember watching ever! So many awful slow motion moves that it entirely destroys any joy one can have in watching movie. Who ever was behind slow motion in this movie did an awful job. Usually that is something one doesn't pay attention in a movie because it's subtle and unnoticable as much, added only at right timing to accent the scene but in this it's like it was used to drag the movie to last longest possible and ascenes are completely unnecessary to have that slow motion. Next and worst thing I find about is - was there really not a single actor in the world that speaks proper english accent, that you HAD to use australian speaking actor? To play a Greek? ! Who on earth gave you that god damn awful idea? This movie is a disgrace to previous 300 movie that was so incomparably better! You should had left it at first one and never did this one because it was a massive disappointment!",300 - Rise of an Empire
391,EDI5289,Who's the hero?,6,19 March 2014,"I loved the original 300 and hoped this one might come close, but sadly it did not. My biggest issue is that I was left confused about who I was supposed to cheer for. The original built a strong connection between Leonidas and Queen Gorgo and you knew the names of his top soldiers and why they followed him with such admiration and devotion. Not so Themistocles - he is underdeveloped as a character and didn't carry the screen presence required. On the other hand Artemesia is given so much of a valid reason for hating the Greeks that it is hard to fault her for fighting them, and she is a great kick-butt character. So the villain comes across more as the hero. They should have made it a battle between Gorgo and Artemisia and left Themistocles out of it. Best moments of the movie were the ones with the Spartans, but those were too brief.",300 - Rise of an Empire

393,espinosaca,Based on this Movie one would think Sparta is stronger than Persia,3,8 March 2014,"Going into this movie, I thought I'd be seeing the Athenian side of the equation in terms of the Greco-Persian War. Instead I witnessed a movie that debased all the other Greek City-States before Sparta.To get some background the main character of this film, Themistocles, is the driving force behind a united Greek stance to fight the Persians. While in the first film we witnessed a refreshing willingness by the Spartans to stand with their fellow Greeks, in this one we rarely see them, unless its for Themistocles to beg for their assistance. We see a Sparta claiming an unwillingness to sacrifice more men, after having sacrificed a paltry 300 men and a king. And holding in reserve both a navy and army that is apparently a match for anything Persia has.Based on this film, I have to ask, why even bother with the other City-States? Sparta is obviously the strongest thing in the world. Seeing the ending, we witness a Spartan Navy, that numbers-wise is as large as the rest of the Greek navy combined.There is none of the camaraderie we saw in the first film. What little back story there is, is extremely rushed. The antagonist in this one, isn't even Xerxes, but Artemisia, and even she seems uncertain as to whether or not to be a bad guy.In conclusion to my rantish review, this film is not a very good companion film to the original. There is little to connect to in terms of the characters, the antagonist can't really even be termed as such, and the Spartans are built up so much that there might as well not even be other Greek City-States.",300 - Rise of an Empire
394,okiereb1,A Rare Sequel Better than the Original,10,21 March 2014,"I went to the theater to see 300: Rise of an Empire this weekend, and it was money very-well spent. I really have the willies about going to spend good money to see any sequel, but I liked the 300 (original) so much, I had to go and take the chance, after watching a couple of online trailers. It was well worth it!*** mild spoiler alert *** (not direct, but alludes to moments in the film, for sake of 'quality commenting') Regardless of what others say, Green played Artemesia excellently - even if 'the scene' between Artemesia and Themistocles on her ship was, shall we say, INTENSE (for lack of far greater spoiler adjectives and phrases).The battle scenes were on par with the 1st 300, and the dialog flowed far better than the first. The acting was actually MORE believable, and the tactics were more-solid, from a military perspective. Overall, this is DEFINITELY a movie you want a copy of in your own home library.

I am speechless - there were so many CGI errors that you will loose count in the first 10 minutes, backgrounds moving out of sync, statues moving even frame skips, it looks like they took a pre render and used it in the final movie.Also an average person contains 50 liters of blood according to this film, the blood will spill like a huge elastic pudding in huge bubbles - and then as it start to fall (after been drawn in a 2 meter long fane after a sword) evaporate before it hit the ground.This is a good candidate for the WORST plot, WORST CGI, Worst Story (or total lack of story) 2014",300 - Rise of an Empire
397,maxim_K,"Repitative scenes, bad story, poor acting!",1,30 November 2014,"Although I watched this movie with low expectations from the previous title it totally disappointed me. 3D graphical effects lose their awesomeness after passing of first 15 minutes. The story is not even remotely historically correct nor good as fiction. Some actors play well but in the shadow of superficial story they could do no good.This is just another movie made to appeal for 3D cinema market. It seems that they felt some force to include something in every scene that could be seen by 3D glasses. Particles passing in foreground out of nowhere. The movement design of particles is so poor that you can see how some one is setting a specific movement path for them. Maybe moving them by hand in a semi-random fashion; Unrealistic and bothersome. 3D blood effects are excessive. In every battle scene these computerized blood splashes could be seen spreading in slow motion in the air! After a couple of these effects it becomes repetitive as every other special effect in this movie. Watching someone play a modern video game would look much more realistic than this.If you can ignore the 3D effects there is the awful story. They tried so hard to make connection between this and the original movie. However, they made it worse. And I don't understand why they felt the need to repeat words ""democracy"" and ""freedom"" so much! Moreover they made a black and white movie with no gray area. In this movie, Persians are the absolute definition of evil and Greek are the absolute definition of good, with the exception of treacherous Artemisia! I don't go into discussing historical facts, if you are interested go read some books. It is like some propaganda movie made to increase the moral of soldiers fighting for freedom and democracy in modern world.Even as a standalone fiction many things do not make sense. The characters depiction is very superficial. There is some primitive effort to make some background for Artemisia, however it does not fit with the her personality in movie. She is not a clever military commander who is seeking revenge. She is more like a poor commander who is ready to kill her officers brutally and at the same time she invite the Greek commander to have sex with him! It looks like a misunderstood woman who is looking for a man! And this unnecessary sex scene is more like an effort to replicate a porn movie in 5 minutes. I think there is also some inspirations from game of thrones here. Showing some skin to make some guys happy? Acting is another poor factor. It is imaginable that acting with a green background and no real world clue around could be hard. The result show people who are trying to convey some meaning but does not make sense at all.However this movie could be considered a good comedy. This is the movie that you can watch with a group of friends, so you can laugh during the movie by finding unlimited number of flaws in story or funny special effects. There is no history here, maybe a result of bite size information age. Story is disappointing and pointless.",300 - Rise of an Empire

The CGI is amazing again but there a few memorable shots of landscapes or angles like the first one had. Every shot of the first 300 could be a screen saver or background, this didn't have as many memorable beautiful shots. The blood looks really fake, the pacing is a bit cramped with too much action, very few emotionally connecting scenes, the soundtrack wasn't memorable at all, few likable characters, few memorable characters, Xerxes pushed to the side and given a clichéd origin story, the ending was anti-climactic, they could have ended it after the finale, but no they had to leave a cliffhanger for the third one, supporting characters suck and aren't half as memorable as the first one, and Eva Green isn't completely naked.

ABSOLUTELY.I think that for some odd reason, some movies become popular to put down (1 out of 10?), however, I watched an entertaining, similar to 300 movie, which makes sense as it was a sequel.I would dare say, the naval battles, the origin of Xerxes, and the crazy final battle make this exactly equal (or a bit better) than the first. The sea battles are amazing, it must be CGI (because how could they have that many people rowing war boats) but it looked amazing.In conclusion, if you enjoyed 300, then this sequel holds up!

I don't have an idea about ancient history and i don't care. I haven't read the comics and i didn't like 300. It was overblown and lost me in the middle of an endless fight with the same things over and over again. But this sequel, is the real deal. It is simpler. The fight scenes are tighter and punchier. Instead of giving a huge 100 minute battle, they divided it into 3 major battles. In between a minor back-story took place, which gave me breathing space and a lighter tone in the plot. Coming to the second best element of the movie: it is goofier than ever. Rise of an empire is not ashamed of its clichés. The actor lines are heard a gazillion times before in epic movies, so they keep them restrained. Less is more in this department. They speak when they have to and when they do, you either feel it or laugh with it. Yes, it is funnier. There is nothing wrong with a sex scene in an epic movie, there nothing wrong in a joke here and there, it is a Hollywood movie and a comic so you are supposed to laugh a little. Or a lot, in my case! Finally, it is totally and uncontrollably (in the end) entertaining. Yes i laughed, i sat with agony in my seat to see where this all goes to, i felt chills and this emotion in my gut (the same in every good epic story) and i watched in awe some of the best battle scenes i have ever saw.

The camera at times is so zoomed in on a character you cannot see anything but their torso and hear grunting sounds. Also, the slow motion effect was used like they couldn't shoot this sequence correctly so just make it slow mo and that will make everything... better... yeah that's it.

403,bengf,Terrible- but quite entertaining.,5,15 March 2014,"300 Rise of an Empire is probably one of the most enjoyably awful films I've ever seen. After the relative success of 300, I was quite excited about going to see this film. What I will say is that it made me laugh. But I'm not sure that was what the director was intending.If you thought 300 was unsubtle, then Rise of an Empire is not the film for you. Like the original film, blood erupts from bodies like a volcano and limbs fly 20 feet in the air. But what is really striking is how much the director is trying to appeal to the senses. Oars smash into the ocean with a hollow boom and at one stage the moon is half the size of the screen. Everything is in-your-face chaos, as you're force-fed a mixture of grimy visuals and unsettling sounds.What I will say for the film is that it provides a strong female lead in the form of Eva Green, and she dominates the screen in most of her scenes. However the rest of the cast are an eclectic mix of English, Australian and South African (judging by the accents.) This didn't add a lot to the realism of the film, but since when was realism a big part of the 300 saga? Unfortunately there was not much in the way of plot either, as the film lurched from one unrealistic battle scene to the next. Although relentless in terms of pacing, it misses out on any really memorable scenes and the dialogue is pretty awful. The visuals seem less striking too, as it felt like a re-hash of 300.In all honesty this wasn't one of the most sophisticated films I've ever seen and I wouldn't exactly call it a classic. But if you're in the mood for a bit of light entertainment that doesn't require any real concentration, then look no further. There was enough beheadings and slit throats to keep me entertained for most of the film, but most of the fight scenes seemed like a bloody mess in comparison to the film's predecessor.

Must be a hard working to make this kind of blood, killing effects etc. Realistic, sadistic, and romantic with little bit vulgar (hope they censored this part at theaters).After the effects, let's discussed about the storyline. Perhaps this idea or suggestion from me will have a good considerable for the next movies. First they were wrong picking up the title ""300: Rise Of an Empire"", nope that's not it. Well, the ""300"" part pronounced as the first ""300"" movies I guess, that's fine it marked as the sequel. But after the "":"" that's what is important, I know it's ""Rise Of An Empire"" it showed up in the last end of the movies, well for the next sequel you(The Director, producers whoever it is) then you can use that title. But for this movies, you should put the title more like this ""300: Artemisia Of Persian"", so the audiences will know that this movies will tell about a girl/woman named Artemisia that the second hands of Xerxes with her fleets army that will destroy most of the Athenian.Then, the next sequel you the Director, Producers etc can give the title with ""300: Rise Of An Empire"" the united of the Athens, Sparta etc and tell the stories what it's all about, what, where, who, when, with whom ""THE RISE OF AN EMPIRE"".Can't you think just a simple thought like that?I have a brilliant idea, I'm not a director or producer but I know HOW TO GIVE A TITLE TO A MOVIE MATCH WITH THE STORIES!!Thank You.",300 - Rise of an Empire

But sadly this was not meant to be. I didn't warm to the characters at all however it must be acknowledged that Eva Green took a brilliant role. The story line had excellent potential but I wanted more from it.Sullivan Stapleton whilst good just didn't achieve the same impact as those in the original and not to sound like a old woman but I thought the sex scene was totally inappropriate and couldn't understand the importance of it. Seriously that kind of sexual violence for a 15??Disappointing",300 - Rise of an Empire

For sure the twine of expectations will be trying to find its root in the outstanding experiences you had have with the blockbuster 300. Well a tale of 300 spartans who sacrificed their lives for the shake of respect and honour. The praise of its worldwide magnificent hit, in your belief, goes to what? the audacious dialogues? the thrilling blood-shadiness? The Brutal, butchery, action sequences presented in the flow of stylish, appealing screenplay with tremendous commitment by the director which amplified the amplitude of writer's conspicuous, magnetic writing? or it is the beautiful, stunning, indirect but highly expressive, twisted, features of its direction? well if you elect anyone of these then RISE OF EMP. uplifts all the stuff u like to the next higher level of interest. unlike the traditional style of building the story forwards... leaving the old version behind in most of the sequels, this one moves parallel to the old 300. the xerxes's chrctr is lightened up personally by covering his backstory but the story in the main stream goes through the Artemisia and the Themistocles who played major role in the battle of ..Artemisium... besides the slay of flesh and bones and splashing blood syringes over the screen, 102 minutes are packed with fascinating graphics, eye-tempting giant historic play forces u to like the mvi genuinely.. anyway... if u discriminate it better than u wll find at some places direction looses its buoyancy and falls to the normal level... specially while directing the drama-genre which was amazingly depicted in the old version.

But why so much respect for Leonidas? Because he fought intrepidly. What would he have gotten if it happened in the modern era? He would probably have received an army commendation or something - posthumously. Get the point? Okay, he's been exaggerated!The people of Athens ran for their lives days before the Persian army reached Hellas borders. Oh, and it was the Persians who grew beards as seen on all the stone carvings remaining from ancient times not the Greeks. In the movie the Persians look like aliens, orcs, zombies and beasts!Some parts of history are musts to be read.

411,geearf,"Sorry but as a movie in the 300 universe, no way...",6,13 August 2017,"I am not a particular huge fan of the original 300, but I do like it for what it is. I'm afraid this is not up to par quality wise.I thought this was to be a sequel, but I was wrong, it's more in parallel of the original, with a bit of prequel and sequel around.I did appreciate seeing some of the original cast back, it was definitely nice, even though the movie is not about them (too bad!).This movie follows the previous one with its central characters, and unfortunately the comparison isn't good for it, and this is exactly my biggest issue.* Leonidas is replaced by Themistokles:I have no problem with Stapleton, he seems a great actor, but unfortunately his character is far less interesting. He's pretty much a good guy that cares a lot for everyone with little humor, I found it somewhat boring to watch compared to our previous lead. I understand that it represents the difference between the Athenians and the Spartans, but it doesn't really work out for me, maybe it would have with a better co-lead.* Xerxes is replaced by Artemisia:Now this really did not work. Xerxes was awesome (in limited quantity of course) whereas Artemisia not quite. There was something about her makeup that made me wonder if she was on meth or a goth or something else that did not belong... Forgetting that, her build is not of a warrior, there is no way for her to wield a sword and a shield all day like this. Why are all the guys huge but her, the best warrior of Persia, so tiny? and yet she's the only one wielding not one sword, but 2! (yes yes I understand skills... still I'd expect more a build like Ferris Hellig, especially for a 300 main character!). Some of her scenes were fine, even if not super interesting, but I felt some of her last speeches lacked feelings).* Dillos was replaced by Aeskylos:It's not that Dillos is such an awesome character in 300, but he's good enough in most of his scenes and great in his last ones. I never felt anything good about Aeskylos, this time it's probably both the character and the actor. It's like they needed Themistokles to have some discussions so they sort of forced this guy in, but he serves no real purpose.* The father and son are replaced by... another father and son! The evolution of their relationship is interestingly opposite, as again one would expect between Spartans and Athenians and that was good, but the characters are not that interesting and the boy that needs to prove his worth to his father is not that fun that we needed it. The dad is fine, I think he should have taken over Aeskylos's role and have more screen time.* The multiple Persian armies are replaced by the Persian Navy: That too was fairly boring in comparison. In the first one you never really know what will be coming next, but here it's always the same... Well it is less insulting to Persians though since it has no demons/monsters this time :)The main characters, which is what the movie is really about, are unfortunately fairly boring. The sex scene has no purpose but itself... I could understand one of the 2 characters taking part in it, but definitely not the other A few things seem to contradict between the 2 movies as well, but nothing too major. The first battle had so much blood, they even splashed it on the camera, it was annoying.All in all, nothing to remember.",300 - Rise of an Empire

416,nashiamamun-56651,Pretty good but innacurate,7,23 September 2021,This movie is good for an action film it has some pretty good effects as well. I can only see the reason for it not being a very good film is cause of it's poor historical inaccuracy regarding a lot of things. I do get that these are ancient times where it has been for a thousand years this story has been passed down and can be subject to change during those thousand years.,300 - Rise of an Empire
417,saintanger3,As good as the original,8,13 September 2014,"We were all ready to dismiss this as another cash in but we were wrong.This film is excellent. Right out of the stall it shows it's colours and wears them with pride. This is a direct sequel/ sidequel to 300 and fleshes out the world and battle of the first film brilliantly.We see a stronger cast and a far more diverse and explored range of characters who all influence the story. As with the first film, men and women are on an equal standing here and arguably the toughest character in the story is Eva Green's warrior commander, who steals the show every time she appears.A lot of people said that we would miss Leonidas, and we do, but we are given Themistocles, who stands in his own right as a powerful warrior and excellent leader of his troops. While we don't have any of the epic lines that Butler got to roar in the first film, we do have some truly brilliant and awe inspiring moments from Themistocles.In short, this film is a worthy brother to it's original. It's uses the same visual themes and techniques which root it in the world we know and love, but explores new and different ones at the same time.Watch this film and enjoy it, you will not be disappointed.",300 - Rise of an Empire
418,babelinterpret,An insult to history and viewers pockets,1,15 March 2014,"It was not even a waste of time because i got time to review mentally the real history of the Battle of marathon whilst dying watching this 3D movie. Firstly, I am tired of the dualism that Hollywood tries to portray when producing these movies: good vs bad. Portrays Greeks as clean, democratic, free civilization,... OK, but always vs dirty, vain, bloody Persians...!!! All that to get viewers to lean towards what they have to judge is good or wrong (america - middle east...). The movie does not portrays a single thing that was real at that time, not even the boats, ...neither, obviously, Artemisa who ""represents""a Goddess. Overall, I am not even sure I want to write much about this movie. In fact the chopping hands, heads, blood and bad 3D are representative of what I thought it was an old style of making movies, probably addressed to -sorry- ignorant viewers or those who are satisfied with bloody movies regardless of how misleading they can be. Don't watch it, a waste of time and waste of money....",300 - Rise of an Empire
419,mkaouer,Pretty historically weak,1,22 September 2014,"To be honest I was really expecting much of this movie, unfortunately, it was far down and much worse than I have understood from the reviews. The movie went from describing the legendary battles between Persians and Greeks to a pure reflection of American vs. middle-eastern conflicts. The Persians were stereotyped as Arabs and black people that are heartless and violent. Greeks are meanwhile white, look more correct and charming. Persians were pictured as monsters that did not care about the slaves and their own soldiers who were killed but the Greeks were pictured as ultimate defenders of not only their country but also the freedom and democracy, moreover, apparently they (Greeks) don't have any slaves working for them, which is completely wrong as slavery was widely spread at that time and it wasn't like the recent slavery of African people, the color did not matter and the Greeks were using them (slaves) to build their monuments like Acropolis.I will not go over and analyze the Movie because its just not Worth the effort.I'm simply going spend my remaining Days praying that all the involved people in this Movie will spend the rest of their lives flipping Burgers at McDonald's.",300 - Rise of an Empire

The only complain is I wish they had done this sooner and that Snyder was available to return as director. Noam Murro didn't do a bad job, but Snyder visual eyes was greatly miss.Acting wise, Eva Green was really the only one that stood out. It was also good to see some of the old actors return from the originally 300.All in all, a very fun flick. Looking forward to Part 38/10",300 - Rise of an Empire
421,BabblesMyBabbles,300: The Downfall of a Movie,2,7 June 2014,"300 was great. The plot was good, the action was good, you had someone to root for, and we were left with a strong indication that the Spartans were about to attack Xerxes.300: Rise of an Empire was not great. The plot was not there, the action was predictable, I found myself rooting for the wrong side, and I was left feeling cheat out of a movie.I wouldn't even categorize this with the general bad movies. I'd put this in the WTF?! category. The bloody scenes didn't even turn out good. The fight scenes were so amateurish compared to the Spartans in the original 300 that I cringed each time a battle occurred... so I was cringing the entire time. What really did it for me was that this movie made Spartans look like wimps who didn't want to fight. The first movie told the opposite story.",300 - Rise of an Empire
422,lune1966,Why did they even bother with actors?,4,23 March 2014,"This movie is 95% computer generated, and feels like a video game multiple time with clunky moves. The blood goes by the gallon in unrealistic texture, and the camera suddenly can see through wooden floor at one point??? What were they trying to achieve??? Trying to be creative?..in a ridiculous manner for sure. The 5% acting is not worth any of your time. Eva Green being the only character who stands out a little bit. There is zero depth in any other character. The story never grips you.The perfect movie for 10y old kid who never watched a good movie before, but made the effort because he wants to see boobies for the first. time.4 is for the effort only, I mean next time give your budget to a charity, it would be far better spent.",300 - Rise of an Empire
423,blnd-jared,Trailer for 3rd 300 Movie,6,7 March 2014,"Look it had great visuals and fighting was good but really I feel we all bought into the Spartan story line from 300 (2006); I loved the people of Sparta and how they were built up to be the best warriors and how a mere 300 of them put up and excellent fight... so when they died and we saw a clip of the entire Spartan fleet taking revenge, that is what I wanted to see, that is what I feel was the hype leading up to this movie... not another movie building up for the exact same clip... I wanted to see Sparta unleash their full power on the Persian army, I don't care about Athens, and why should we be forced to care about them when we fell in love with Sparta from the first movie; that is what I paid all that money to see... not another build up to it.The main character in this one had a bad accent and he did not have the presence of the Leonidas, he was placed as the Commander of the entire Greek fleet (which was disappointingly small)yet he seemed insignificant, his speeches had no impact either; no ""TONIGHT WE DINE IN HELL!"" feels... Also just because there is a male main character and a female main character, doesn't mean they have to have sex for the sake of a sex scene in the movie... What I didn't understand, besides that the Spartan army is bigger than the rest of the Greece's combined, was that the ""army"" in this movie was made up of farmers and traders, yet they were all ripped as stuff and fought like assassins and out classed the Persian fighters, I got that they won with the handy tricks, but besides that how were they so good in hand to hand combat?With regards to Artemisia, she exceeded my expectations from a female main villain, normally they over do their evilness in an over dramatized way, but she did it well. Still I cared not for her defeat, only Xerxes.Anyways, I am really disappointed as I thought I was paying money to see the movie after this one.... I really wanted to see Sparta tear stuff up and send fear into Persian hearts with their war chants.",300 - Rise of an Empire

My eyes were certainly pleased by the beautiful Eva Green, and my sympathy for her background story was very strong at first. However, after a few scenes it felt as if I was watching a 3 part series on TV.Dialogues often lack convincing and did not bring forth the powerful quotes the original movie ""300"" did.The original had some powerful women in the movie as well, but did not emasculate Xerxes or other important figures the way Artemesia did. Xerxes' part in the story was so minimal and weak I almost felt sorry for him.The sex scene was hardly necessary, and even though it was amusing and nicely acted/filmed, it felt like a cheap way to try and distract you from the movie's story, which was lacking.Huge disappointment, I can't believe we waited 8 years for this.",300 - Rise of an Empire

Eva Green portrayed as Atremisia, is excellent in her character and justified her role.She is hot and evil,and seductive with her eyes.Main lead Sullivan Stapleton as Themistocles did his job well, but when compared to Gerrad Butler as Leonidas he is far behind.There was no aggression in him.He is shown more as strategist. Climax scene fight is mind blowing, in entire movie i liked him in this action scene.Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo, did her part, though her screen space is less, she has substantial impact in movie .Even at 40 she looks attractive.Overall movie is good , those who are interested in periodic movies, you will love this and it has high energy action sequences with amazing visuals.Go watch in 3-D for best experience.",300 - Rise of an Empire

The action sequences are so brilliantly choreographed that often one would experience jaw dropping moments throughout the 100 mins of film. Most of story runs parallel to the events of 300 and the role of protagonist Themistokles, an Athenian general and politician is very well portrayed by actor Sullivan Stapleton. The only female naval commander for Xerses, Artemisia is played by Eva Green and there are moments where her ruthlessness makes you hate her. The climax of the film depicts the battle of Salamis and you'll not find it hard to root for Athenians. Eva Green has done a great acting job but her character has not been directed well. Being an antagonist and when referring to history, she really kicked ass. In the film however, she does not match up the badness of Artemisia.

I did like the Original movie more, but that's only because this movie had lots of navy battles, and i am not that into navy battles. Ii still enjoyed the navy battles and thought they were pretty great....but there not really my thing.I would have liked to see the Spartans more, but the movie is not based around them.

That way you'll be too tired to critique it and like me, you may well rather enjoy it :). Unfortunately, you'll end up writing a 'review' of the film that instead of containing any real information, gives five under explained points. Rather like this:1. The film loses much of the comic book feel of the original: a big shame2. The fighting is awesome (as long as you are a teenage boy (or at least can approach a film like one))3. If you watch this as a serious historical film then good luck refraining from tearing your hair out.4. If you struggle to follow films that jump around a bit then ignore my advice above, some have failed to keep up (though I did not)5. If you are a die-hard fan of the original then try not to compare this against it. If you do you'll probably end up dissatisfied.

Sparta has a good navy for... some reason? And everyone shot by an arrow has ample time (sometimes months) to survive long enough to deliver their inspiring last words.

433,calipso-kj,300 : Rise of an Empire,7,12 March 2014,"300: Rise of an Empire is the story of the Battle of Artemisium that occurs simultaneously as the Battle of Thermopylae..So, this film runs parallel to the first part! But it also accounts for the events before and after the fall of Leonidas at the battle of Thermopylae. 300 was the finest of Gerard Butler and Zack Snyder. This I am saying coz 300 offered everything that the 2nd installment couldn't. For starters, the lack of impactful characters made a lot of difference. Even the screenplay stagnates after a while. Music was a disappointment with minimal use of background scores. But the major setback is the lead character Themosticles played by Sullivan as it misses the charm of Leonidas. The film has the same narrative style but in the form of Queen Gorgo; same slow motion battlefield drama but in patches; and blood spurtings, glorified! Nonetheless its a visual treat with wonderful effects. But said that the film lacks the hues of the earlier film. Overall, it fails to impact as much as the earlier film, but still a good watch. Some of the scenes retain the original essence. But one misses the original war cry... Aahoo! Aahoo! Aahoo!",300 - Rise of an Empire

The gore and blood is completely excessive, but is still so freaking awesome.

Many questions from the first film will be answered and just as well new ones will be made.The storyline of the film is interesting and follows historical events with a few slight changes to the reality to make things more interesting and fun for the viewer. Nonetheless, you can't consider story as the best aspect of the film.Most impressive in the film was the play by Eva Green who played Artemisia, the antagonist. Her actress play was confident, strong and very impressive. In my opinion she outdid all the others actors who took part in the film and made this a really enjoyable experience for me.Also the use of 3D effects is very good and this is one of the films who have enough effects to really pay more to get the 3D edition. Overall, also the sound effects were very good.To summarize, the film is a must see for any swords&sandals fan, war film fan and also action film fan. Good effects and great actor play especially by Eva Green should make this a good experience.",300 - Rise of an Empire

Not only this, but I know really well the ancient history of my homeland.The 300 franchise is based on a comic. It is really that clear! So I can't and shouldn't evaluate 300 as a historic movie. All of you foreigners that evaluate it as such, please stop it! You don't have the right, you don't know our ancient history. Stop.The movie itself as a spectacle is fantastic and as good as the 1st movie of 2006.It has some historic references (names, locations etc), but it is clearly an epic comic transfer to the big screen. As such it has almost nothing more to do with history.Violence, blood, gore, sex, darkness! I love the aesthetics.",300 - Rise of an Empire
439,amg-ghorbani,Lies,1,2 March 2015,"Lies will never end! Europeans attempt for changing history: 1- Xerxes I was the eldest son of Atossa and Darius. Atossa lived to see Xerxes invade Greece. 2- Artemisia I of Caria, fought for her overlord Xerxes I, against Greek.She personally commanded her contribution of five ships at the naval battle of Artemisium and in the naval Battle of Salamis in 480 BC. She is mostly known through the writings of Herodotus, who praises her courage and the respect in which Xerxes held her. 3- After War in 472 or 471 BC, Themistocles was ostracised, and went into exile in Argos. The Spartans saw an opportunity to destroy him, and implicated him in the treasonous plot of their own general Pausanias. Themistocles thus fled from Greece, and traveled to Asia Minor, where he entered the service of the Persian king Artaxerxes I. He was made governor of Magnesia, and lived there for the rest of his life. 4- to be continued",300 - Rise of an Empire
440,mrkoukaganga,An innovation in Storytelling that merits our Attention,8,12 March 2014,"Sequels are dangerous territories. In my opinion and in that of most critics they rarely deliver. Even the best franchises are more often than not remembered for their first installments. It's precisely for this reason that I was sceptical when I heard of a second installment to the 300 franchise300: Rise of an Empire astutely finds a way to entertain us with the same material the first movie did without placing itself in the sequel category. Instead of being a prequel or a sequel it takes us on a ride that further develops the context of the first by giving us a different angle from which to view the tale. We really get the sense that the first movie is playing in parallel while watching Rise. The various scenes of the first are well paced throughout and no facts or events were fiddled with. For beautifully pulling off this storytelling variation (and innovation) the movie deserves some credit. It is almost like playing a video game with another character The idea is brilliant. I see more movies following in these footsteps. Seeing as how Zach Snyder contributed to the production of the movie I can't help but direct my attention towards another franchise he happens to be working on and ask: What was Batman doing during Zod's invasion? This new method of storytelling could effectively reunite different characters' story arcs. I digress...Nonetheless, being a second installment, one simple question must be asked: is it better than the first? well, 300: Rise of an Empire, while being being highly entertaining. and aesthetically pleasing does not reach the heights of the first. That is due in in most part to the absence of Gerard Butler, the heart and soul of the first. Themistocles does not have the same star power as the Spartan king.. It was difficult not to let out a cheer after a Leonidas speech. A Themistocles speech is more like a flavourless dish. Far from distasteful, but nothing you would be drawn back to.Upon thinking about this I suspect this was in part intentional, as the plot seemed to focus a lot more on the Persian point of view. This would make sense seeing as how there will be a third installment and the first focused mainly on the Spartans. Two Persian origin stories were told. One arc ended the other did not, which leads to the thought that the third could focus a lot more on Xerxes. Artemisia owned the movie with her charm, wits and galvanizing swagger. She was the one filling in for Butler.Overall 300:Rise of an Empire does justify it's existence. It truly expands on the story the famous graphic novel- turned blockbuster hit told a few years ago. Although it does not have the same mythological gravitas as the first, it has many HOORAH moments",300 - Rise of an Empire

It is a great movie, some war scenes are reminiscent of the game-play in Assassin's Creed, Metal Gear & Modern warfare.

443,apollobez,"Good cinematography, decent story.. silly fight scenes",7,28 March 2014,"Watch this movie the day of release in IMAX 3D.. The visuals were great.. typically my experience has been that some 3D action films seem cluttered or too busy in the jumble of battle or the like, but there was real continuity and division between the elements in each of the battle scenes making the movie easy to take in, in this format..The story, besides some historical theatrics on the life of Xerses, is a ""day in the life of"" type format that runs concurrently and does incorporate the 1st films elements in an effective way. No big plot twists or that kind of thing, but a solid ""this is how it would feel to have been there"" film.Now, I don't know what some critics where expecting going in, but I myself, wasn't looking for some spell binding drama with this movie so I truly don't see the frustration some of these people are feeling.Now I must say, the slow motion, cup of blood tossing, death blow scenes, were way over used and to the point of being ridiculous. This technique should have been used maybe once or twice. Now with that being said, I give the film a solid 7, and definitely, knowing what I know now, don't regret seeing it in IMAX 3D, (the only format for watching big special effects productions, in my view).",300 - Rise of an Empire
444,ThePterodactylGynecologi,Not just another pointless sequel,8,8 March 2014,"When I first heard of the movie and saw the trailer, part of me got excited and the other half got worried that it may just be another sequel made to juice out some extra money.Well i'm glad to say that it did not disappoint. People seem to forget that the original 300 movie did end on a cliffhanger. The plot was not finished with 300, only the 300 were. The plot of Rise of an Empire successfully continues this story, but this time from the view of someone outside of Sparta seeking their help. I won't say much more, but I will say that you may be glad to know that all the money didn't just go into the CGI and not the script.The plot, though nothing special, is sufficient as a base for the delectable elements of the movie to take place. The action was right on par and maybe even better than the first, with my only complaint being that there was maybe just a tad bit too much slow mo this time around. Most of the acting was believable but not great, with the exception of the brilliantly played villain. The protagonist, though not as bad-ass and inspiring as Leonidas, still had his share of awesome moments, though he was played as a conflicted man who didn't quite match Leonidas' strong will and power, but still held up. Also the ending scene gave me goosebumps, and yes, it is another cliffhanger (guess we're gonna get a trilogy after all)All in all i'd highly recommend this movie to anyone who was a fan of the first film or who just wants to be successfully entertained for 2 hours.",300 - Rise of an Empire

It is not a realistic historical movie, we all know that, so you must forget all you know about history and suspend your disbelief for a moment to watch it.It's a good thing that the story is parallel to the story of the first one. The plot is quite simple and it doesn't have any major twists, but it fits well the mood of the 300 universe. A plus maybe the end beyond the lack of realism in some parts of it.The best of all, the visual effects are really great! Yes it's true that this movie had too much gore, unnecessary slaughter in my opinion, but you can see it anyway, that's the idea of the 300 movies.The 3D truly immerses you in the movie and gives substance to the scenes, even if the plot does not always was at the same level. The battles in the sea are really well done. The ""sex scene"" is quite believable and is not a romantic scene at all, that is another point in favor; it had no romantic scenes.So if you want to see it, do it in 3D and enjoy, just as in the first one, don't try to compare it with other things, we all know it's based upon the graphic novel.",300 - Rise of an Empire

The characters are likable and the story keeps you hooked. The 3D is actually well utilized and helps the scope of the large naval battles feel realistic and understandable.

But if you watch this movie and know some history ( I know it's based on comic book but... ) then it is simply awful because it's inaccurate in every way (story, costumes, ethnics, slavery, historical behavior, facts and list goes forever... ) and it is filled with Americanized perspective toward middle- east specially Persian Empire (Iran) for marketing purposes ( they simply want to make it more like recent situations and events) But then again if you want to enjoy a good action-fantasy movie it's good choice, I watched the movie with pleasure.",300 - Rise of an Empire
448,ronnie1962,A far cry from the first 300,6,6 March 2014,"I can't understand why Zack Snyder didn't direct this sequel, and how someone who has never directed an action sequence before and just one feature film can be entrusted with a production of this magnitude. That would already be a recipe for disaster, even though in reality Snyder was supervising.In an attempt to live up to it's predecessor, 300: Rise of An Empire is action-packed, presents impressive visuals and is very bloody. In fact there is more action, more blood, and more nudity than in the original 300. As for the plot, there really isn't much to chew on. A naval commander, Themistocles is supposedly trying to reunite Greece. Since the story takes place before, during and after King Leonidas leads his men to fight the Persians, it can be hard to follow at times. Most of the acting was mediocre and couldn't quite compensate for the weaknesses in the story. The Australian actor cast as Themistocles in my opinion was a very bad choice, and comes nowhere close to what Gerard Butler did as King Leonidas in 300. He just doesn't bring that rugged heroic presence on screen as is expected. Interestingly I read somewhere that director Noam Murro insisted it would be Sullivan Stapleton who played this character, claiming he was 'the one'. Eva Green on the other hand is plays an excellent villain as Artemisia.",300 - Rise of an Empire

I have no idea who the artistic pretender was who directed this film and I'm not interested....he or she might make an okay music video director...but that's where the skill definitely stops.In the end this movie is an unbelievable waste of money and about as historically correct as Monty Python's 'The Life of Brian'.It probably would have been a far better comedy than whatever it was supposed to be.Take my advise and don't bother.,300 - Rise of an Empire
450,sttimebride,Wasn't Worth the Hype (Save Your Money),3,25 March 2014,"I was thrilled to hear the sequel was finally out. I was a bit thrown off that the original director, Zack Snyder, wasn't going to be a part of this one, since that particular style seemed to fit the movie.It brings to question: Can an imitation ever be as good as the original?Where 300 focused on Sparta's charge against the Persians, 300: Rise of an Empire turns its attention to the Greek general Themistokles.The action in the first few minutes had me right away. Then as the movie progressed, the grip on me loosened and by the time it got to the biggest fight scene of the movie, I was drowning like some of the ones who got killed in the battle.Major killjoys:Ahem, where did the plot go?: In 300, the plot of the movie was stated and stayed in focus amidst the bloodshed. In 300: Rise of an Empire, it is stated but seems to go all over the place and just never takes off the ground. The action packed sequences felt like an attempt to cover up the lack of plot development, but those who are fans of the total package noticed this flaw right away. Guess which category I fall under?Loving the villain more than the hero: In this movie, I found myself sympathizing for Xerxes but more so for Artemisia. I loved her character. She's a bad ass. Her whole makeup (and I'm not talking about just on the face) was just wonderful. Wait, but she's not the hero! She's the villain. Themistokles is the hero, yet I feel nothing for him. If imitation is flattery, it's flattery done badly: I get it! In the absence of plot, put in more gory action. That was the formula used here. The director tried to imitate the style of his predecessor, and it just looked forced. Even the blood splatter timing seems misplaced and thrown off—damn near unrealistic.The action and the performances of Eva Green (Artemisia) and Lena Headey (Queen Gorgo) saved this from being a 1 star. Whereas the first 300 was worth the cost of a ticket, save your money for the DVD with this sequel. The actors did the best they could with what was given, but no amount of great acting in the world can salvage a poorly drawn out plot and directorial feats gone sour.",300 - Rise of an Empire

Understanding it was made for 3D I still can't quite cope with blood effects (which are, quite frankly, hilarious) that remind me of certain movies you could watch on SciFi channel and AXN (no offense). For such a large budget movie, this doesn't even deserve to be ripped and uploaded for people to see free of charge. So i believe they are safe when it comes to online piracy :). Acting was terrible, the plot was mushy and at no point of the film did I find myself immersed into the story. I found playing 2048 on my cell phone in a large dose more amusing than watching this.

455,knifeskillz98,Thanks for taking a great big steamy S#?T and serving it to the fans of 300 Noam.,3,22 March 2014,"From not Zack Snyder, comes a well anticipated sequel to one of the most famous historical/action films of the past decade. Directed by someone whose best success so far is a comedy romance starring Sarah Jessica Parker and who is so unheard of that no one has even bothered to write a Wikipedia article about him. Seriously, look him up.Okay so let me guess, you've noticed that the new 300 film is now available to download online and you're now thinking ""Hm, I've got a few hours to waste. Why not?"" Well here's why not: The story line is almost non-existent; you can tell that it has been rushed because they have pieced together such a big event into such a small run time. I mean come on, 3 major historical battles that balanced the fate of the world, squeezed into less than 2 hours of film. It's like Noam hasn't even watched the first film, somehow in this film farmers we're able to kill multiple Persian Immortals single-handed whereas the Spartans, an elite fighting force of Greeks descended from Hercules could not. Also the characters are not portrayed as heroic in any way, Themistocles is shown to be weak to the hint of slight seduction whereas Leonidas basically told the God-king himself to go F#K himself. I find myself warming up to Artemesia rather than Themistocles. The pace as I've vaguely mentioned is far too fast and each battle last no more than 3 minutes each. Noam tries to put as much action and gore in as possible to disguise the lack of story-line and structure, it's as if it was made by a bunch of film students with a few million dollars to spare. And at least in the first film there was some historical accuracy and Zack actually took into account the way Spartans actually fought during battle, yeah there was one unrealistic solo ninja fight scene but the rest was mostly accurate. But Noam, nope, ninja fight scenes here there and everywhere to entertain those amazed by the bright colours and fast moving images.Okay yeah I'll admit some of the fight scenes are pretty cool, but for the above average intelligence action/adventure movie enthusiast it is just not enough to keep us glued to our seats. Overall I would describe this movie as a complete let down, made by amateurs and starring people whose time and talents were wasted making this film. Yes I am being a harsh critic but I was a big fan of 300 and I expected so much more from this one. But if you're reading this I'd say you might as well watch it just to say you have but in my opinion this film should have never been made or at least should have never been entrusted with such an amateur director such as Noam Murro who has obviously never heard of any camera technique other than slow motion and cut-scene.",300 - Rise of an Empire

But this new film but handles like a video game footage and reminds me of God of War, there is nothing more to be a copy of what you have already done a complete overload of violence abuse effects of computer and completely implausible actions even if it were a game like God of war . Regarding the story slowly wanting to build a plot that at times it engages one as a spectator but suddenly it's time to unwrap perish like a runaway horse going over everything built and developed. Although it is fiction exaggerate the number of ships , soldiers and all you get is that you fall into that exploited the resources of the computer effects . Something that if I liked was being able to delve a little into the background of the story of King Gerges and even makes me wonder like the Spartans, or suffering from heat or chose to arm their battles in summer to ride boxers brandishing their swords and throwing arrows.

Butler's Spartan King Leonidas and his men achieved ""a beautiful victory"" — not to mention great box office — but sadly lost their heads. A prequel seemed the obvious path, but then Butler went sitcom soft and Snyder opted for stories of super dudes in leotards. So the mere existence of 300: Rise of an Empire is worthy of note, especially the inventive means by which the story has been advanced. Neither prequel nor sequel (maybe we should call it equal), it looks at the other Greeks versus Persians clash that was happening around the same ancient time as 300's Battle of Thermopylae.",300 - Rise of an Empire

It makes people feel the essence of the movie and take a trip back to history several thousands of years ago. I am a history lover myself and this movie could help recreate an imagination of what really took place in that part of history. The movie with is subtlety with sensitivity to visuals and effects gives emphasize to the action and drama unfolding during those tumultuous centuries of Greek and Persian Empire. What I found disgusting and totally inappropriate is the profanity and obscenity in the film which is totally inaccurate because Greek warriors don't vent out on getting laid when they lose their temper and most of all, most Greek warriors are gay and attracted to their fellow warriors of the same gender so it would have been accurate if they show a man to man action.

465,mdunkley-24418,Undeserved hate for a great sequel,9,16 September 2018,"First time reviewing on this site and I just wanna say this movie is actually pretty good. Although first off, if you were expecting historical accuracy from a COMIC BOOK movie sequel then you will definitely be disappointed. And it does have a story line you just actually have to pay attention to the movie. Now that that is out of the way I can actually talk about this movie. First off, this movie is EPIC! If you have seen 300 then you know what to expect. you will get blood, shirtless Greeks, violence and blood. This movie is sorta like a companion movie. This time it follows the Athenians in their own battle against the Persians. It follows Themistocles in his battles at marathon, defending the 300 by sea and then a final battle that is epic. Also you get to see a little into the Persian backstory even finding out how Xerxes became the Godking. You also have Eva Green as one of the craziest psycho chicks in film. She is crazy in her role and makes the movie worth it just by herself. You also get to see more of the themes of the first movie, mainly focusing on the themes of patriotism and standing up to tyranny since the Athenians are conducting an experiment called democracy and the Persians threaten the existence of it. you also see a huge difference between the Athenian amry and the 300, with different weapons, battle tatics and also how some of them, don't even have a helmet or shield.(Which I thought was a nice touch) but the action is great, just as crazy as the first only with naval combat at time and Greek naval combat aka RAMMING!!! And it actually is still a good story, not the most provoking or deep, but its still a tale of standing up to the tyrannic Persians( at least that is how they are in the movie) and fighting for Greece and liberty. If there was something they could have done better in this movie was that they could have done more with the Persians and go a little more with Eva Green's character. Other than that it is a fun BA movie htat looks great and gets the blood pumping. It is not as bad as people say it is, this is definitely not the worst movie of all time and it is not a bad sequel. This has everything that made the original great and more with the Persians being explored a little more and seeing more behind the scenes action in defending Greece. See it and you won't regret it.",300 - Rise of an Empire

467,elated-firefly,Visually stunning! Definitely worth watching,8,5 June 2014,"300: Rise of an Empire was visually stunning movie. The style is not less spectacular than it was in the first 300.I don't know why so many people get angry with the story. After all, it's a fantasy with parts of a real story, not a documentary.I have to say that I expected the war scenes to be crappy, because it's not so easy to CGI water, but they've done it really good.I really enjoyed the movie, even with the few over the top moments (a horse?! really?!). Also, the number of ships was wrong too, but as I said, you have to understand that it is not a documentary about history, it is a blockbuster and needs to be as epic, as it can be.",300 - Rise of an Empire
468,jeanantoinebruit,Waste of time,2,10 March 2021,"No real story. No development of characters. No surprises. No deeper value. Nothing. Maybe just funny CGI (first star) and breasts of Eva Green (second star). Poor attempt to earn some more money on 300 success.Oh yes and absurd stupid women power fantasy of two ""stroooong"" women leading armoes of bodybuilder sentimental fanatics.Its honestly not worth watching. It literally offers nothing more than you saw with 300.",300 - Rise of an Empire
469,skwidvishus,Just plain awful.,2,16 March 2014,"Terrible!I only gave it 2 stars for *some* visually stunning bits. As compared to the first 300, it gets zero stars.Heroes are less heroic. Acting is terrible. Dialogue is so mediocre. If the first and second movies were switched, it would be more acceptable. This is a GIANT leap backwards.First movie is one of my top 10 favorites of all times, this is one of the worst.Can't recommend enough - do NOT waste your time!",300 - Rise of an Empire
470,ash-san,End of the original 300 legacy!,5,9 March 2014,"The film is based as a backdrop to the original 300 storyline and paves a wave for the next part in the franchise but all the way it just drained the legacy of 300. The hero gives uninspiring talks with beats in the background score rising to make the army automatically charged up to start fighting and die... its very nonsensical just like Themistokles saying "" Today is the day we water the plants"" and with rising music the army responds hu rahhh and they get into the battle. Zack Snyder after delivering the man of steel just seems to have treated this franchise as a step son by doing the screenplay but giving away the direction at Murro's hands who just couldn't pull it off. The casting of suvillian stapleton as a lead actor who clearly fumbles in dialogue delivery and acting was the biggest stupidity. The only silver lining was Eva Green and she delivered right on the money as expected with lena heady who just has a few scenes. guess people will just have to watch this part hoping something better will come in the third. So in all a disappointing experience for one of the awaited films in my list of 2014.",300 - Rise of an Empire
471,stano-8,Bloody and pointless,3,19 July 2014,"In one word ""poor"". Not just comparing to the first ""300"", also comparing to any other movie of this kind. Too bloody, stupid dialogues, unnecessary unreal scenes like persian ships on the ""water hill"" in the middle of the sea, a horse running over the half-destroyed ships, meaningless unfinished sex of enemies and many more. The main character didn't do his job, I didn't like him, doesn't seem to be a hero to me, just a stupid warrior. I could write for hours and use 10 000 words what I disliked, there were only few brighter moments in the movie, but 95% of the time it's a crap. Oh god, how am I missing king Leonidas, I'm going to watch the original 300 again to try to wipe out the memories of this sequel.Don't pay for this, it's a waste of time and money. You can see Eva's breast in other better movies, even if this is the first time to see them in 3D. Maybe that's the only reason to watch this :)",300 - Rise of an Empire

Sorry to waste time making and watching this movie.The image we see of Khashayar in the film is not really Khashayar, but all the sweet intellect that is seen is actually the sweet director of the film.The only thing that has not been distorted is this: the city has been attacked, everything else is all anti-Iranian films, and this is very visible politically.The film has no source at all in history and only narrates a war from the point of view of its stupid and stupid creators.",300 - Rise of an Empire

477,bobot4258,Disappointing Sequel to 300,4,15 July 2014,"I started watching this movie with high hopes from being a huge fan of the first 300 movie. The casting of Sullivan Stapleton as the lead playing Themistocles was a poor one. He was unable to be as compelling and inspiring as Gerard Butler was in the first movie. The story-line of this movie just wasn't engaging enough and I found myself being bored about half way through.Eva Green playing Artemisia was probably the best part of this movie. 300 Rise of an Empire would have been better off being portrayed from her side with the Persian army and not even having Themistocles.All in all a disappointing sequel to a great movie, but I do hope there will be a third installment in the franchise that gets back to what made the first so good.",300 - Rise of an Empire
478,mail-4077,bad reviewers,9,31 December 2017,"I have come to the conclusion by reading a lot of so called reviews that the reviewers havent a clue,or did they even watch the film or maybe its the vogue to slag an action/new film off these days, the question should be asked why bother going to see a film if you are going to bad mouth it before you have even seen it, just stay at home next time and writing rubbish",300 - Rise of an Empire
479,behradzeinali,better than first one,6,7 March 2014,"first of all i didn't like the first movie (300) for both being too unrealistic and fictional like comic books. but this one look better in acting section and better computer design but unfortunately the story is still out of sense and watching this is actually like watching 300 in a better and more bearable graphics which is more than enough to entertain some one once but as you watch for the second and so you will notice some imperfection in design and not as good looking as Spartacus which was better in many ways that you will understand when u watch it. hope u enjoy the movie :D and at the end i hope the true story, be filmed one day",300 - Rise of an Empire
480,blackfmd,So bad.,1,1 August 2015,"This movie is made only to exploit the success the original '300' movie has had. It is so bad people who made it should've payed people to watch it. There's no plot, just randomly scattered little fights at sea which are not even historically correct. There's also a totally inappropriate and irrelevant sex scene which was filmed only to show Green's breasts shaking around... Role of Themistocles was poorly selected, the actor who plays him did not convince me into a single word he said. Poor script. Poor acting. Poor cast selection. Poor movie. A sure waste of my time. If you liked the '300' be sure to skip this ""sequel"", it will only make you regret watching it. That's if you don't die of boredom in the process.",300 - Rise of an Empire
481,ehsanz3,I hate such these lies,1,21 March 2014,I prefer to read the real history instead of wasting my time on such this crap movies. Shame on them to give us this kind of lies just for earning a bit money. Totally not recommend it. Really disappointing. Just people can go to see boobs and gay stuffs in this movie. On that time Persia had the biggest empire in the World and the biggest civilization and culture (you can refer to historic books and articles- And all the world accepted that Persia is the first Country in the World and it has the first Publication rights of human beings in 2500 years ago and there are lots of ancient Inscription that can prove this). How far they want to go with these lies? again I never recommend it and it's totally waste of time and money.,300 - Rise of an Empire
482,tenoren,Worst movie of 2014 so far!,3,23 March 2014,"I can't even begin to explain how much this 300 Rise of an Empire disappointed me.The story was bad, the script was very bad and the lead role was extremely bad!For most parts of the movie I was really bored. No really well made fighting scenes at all, just creme-de-la-crap, excuse my french! A really bad mistake was to choose to make the movie take place on ships for almost all of the time. Incredibly boring!!! In the original 300 we have a strong lead role character, very well and exciting fight scenes and a OK story.300 Rise of an Empire has nothing to offer :-(This one was a stinker from beginning to end. (except the good looking Eva Green) The first review for me in the 11 years I have been a member of IMDb, but I was so incredibly disappointed that I had to warn you!!",300 - Rise of an Empire
483,ross-daniel83,300 things wrong with this movie...,1,19 June 2014,"I love the original ""300"", despite the inaccuracies and overblown macho nonsense, it was silly but fun. So I was looking forward to 300: Rise of an Empire, but this was just nonsense. When Xerxes walks into that pool of magic liquid and gets transformed into an 8 foot tall monster, I gave up being invested, that crossed the line from enjoyably silly to just stupid. Gratuitous sex scenes, over the top action, bad CGI, it's all there, and the 3D makes it even more painful. And Gerard Butler is sorely missed, here we have a pretentious voice over from Lena Heady trying to make sense of the whole mess. And the cast don't manage to wrap themselves round the cheesy script.When you make a film in a historical context, I believe that you can only push the audience so far in terms of playing fast and loose with the facts. Braveheart did it well, so did Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven. Even the original 30balanced that reasonably well. But Xerxes and his father Darius were not at the battle of Marathon, those anachronistic Persian warships were stupid and what was with the origin of Xerxes? I mean, come on, this is not Clash of the Titans. That was laughably bad. Good points? Well the musical score was energetic, some of the action scenes were impressive, even if the CG blood gets too much after a while. But it's not a patch on the first film. Lame.",300 - Rise of an Empire

485,alexi-fan,Awful movie in every way!,1,25 March 2014,"I never usually write reviews on movies as i see them as pointless as one persons views on a subject can differ greatly than another's so I leave it up to the other person to decide their fates. But for 300: Rise of an empire I just couldn't let it go by without saying something. From the opening scene to the end credits of this movie it was apparent that this movie was in no way similar to the original 300 bar the violence and over the top ripped men prancing about on screen. The story lacks fluidity and even a hint of reality regarding what actually happened in known history, I know this is all based of a graphic novel and history can be warped via storytelling but this movie was so crass in its deliverance it made me sick, from the awful storytelling to the pointless slow motion fight scenes to the bad cgi to the pointless sex scene which had no place within the movie at all and killed the movie further more. Zak Snyder should be ashamed of himself, its seems to have become just movies with cgi and some form of exploitation that hes interested in making rather than some ground breaking film everyone should watch. I will here for my anger over this film will have me ending up spewing complete anger induced bullshit which no one needs to read. So if your thinking of going to see this movie don't, waste a couple hours of your time re-watching something you know is good or go see a movie like The Grande Budapest hotel or something!",300 - Rise of an Empire
486,mikk0384,A lot of action - and nothing else at all,2,9 June 2014,"To sum up this movie shortly; 300 men fight 30 000 men on ships, most of them die, and the cameramen did their best to capture EVERY single death in slow-motion. No conversations last for longer than 2 minutes, and almost every time someone speaks it will be in stupid one-liners.I actually learned something from watching the movie, though: Medieval eastern Europeans had at least 80 gallons of blood-like fluids in their bodies, and whenever they received a cut, most of it would immediately be spilled. When the blood hits the ground, it appears to reduce to small specks in a short amount of time. Also, wearing armor is for the stupid - any sword or axe will easily carve a 40 cm (16 inches) wide hole in a scale mail, 15 cm (6 inches) deep into the body of the wearer, and straight out the other side.One thing that shows how little thought is put into the movie for the sake of making thing spectacular: A horse is brought to a naval battle. Who in their right minds would think that a horse on a ship with no side-rails that is intended to ram the enemy ships would be a good idea?",300 - Rise of an Empire
487,eh-ghazaei,Regret,1,11 April 2014,all of this screenplay is falsehood. if you want to know true story of Persia and Achaemenid just read the history.i hate this film and all liar people.what do you think about who people want to show us cruel and wild??? which country everyday attack to another countries these days!!?? we were not wild and we are not wild. from Cyrus to now we were and we are peaceful and kindness. Darius's life was his expedition to punish Athens and Eritrea for their aid in the Ionian revolt and subjugate Greece.Darius organized the empire by dividing it into provinces and placing Satraps to govern it.Darius devised a codification of laws for Egypt.,300 - Rise of an Empire
488,abbey_m1989,The Best Villain EVER ?,9,9 March 2014,"Is it better than the first one? I cant say, maybe yes maybe not, but one thing that i'm DAMN sure about this movie is ""I'm in love with Artemisia (Eva Green)"". She did an incredible job kinda like Heath Ledger in the Dark Knight. I can easily say that she is among the top 5 best villain in my list now. Let's talk about the movie, i thought it would be a sequel as we wanted to know what happened after Leonidas dies. However, this movie runs parallel to the 300 story and it includes a lot of naval fights. I was amazed with the action and when i say action i mean hell lot of action. You'll see some really cool duels, battle sequences and most of all a lot of naval engagements between United Greek and Persia. I got glued to my seat the entire time when the battle was on(and that was the entire time). It will give you goosebumps and you'll be awestruck with this great war movie. I say that we waited for the a good action movie after 300 for a long time and we got it and it lives up to that promise. And have i mentioned that Artemisia was Barbarically beautiful and yes amazing?A must Watch.",300 - Rise of an Empire
489,ir_ehsan,A total mutilation,1,30 March 2014,"I wonder, the people who made this movie are educated at all. did they studied the history, or they just want to make a product?! Every year Hollywood spend thousands of dollars to humiliate nations. And this both of 300 movies are made by this purpose. if any wise person study the history will understand this movie and its story is just a lie and mutilation. I hope you don't take it as spoiler, but beyond of this action movie, this is just a lie, a big one. Humiliation of nations for making money is not strange with Hollywood. I just want you after watching this movie read the history to understand reason of this war. I hope everyone understand the truth.",300 - Rise of an Empire
490,kmokhtar79,Review,1,8 June 2014,"Loool, well played the biggest ""Joke"" over the entire history of cinema. Battle of Marathon was held only to subjugate Greek army once after they murdered Darius messengers. Such a mind-freak script writers doesn't know anything about history shivering hand and using fiction and illustration to show their phobia and hatred of the Persians. Every single word, scene, tone and character in this ""so- called"" movie proves that how they are scared of this tribe. Not even one single word of this movie is inspired of reality. The time and fees in this movie could be spent in a very proper way than demolishing a tribe with its history. Fears and angers have been shown totally opposite.",300 - Rise of an Empire
491,philip-dittmer,I liked it!,10,13 April 2014,"I like the new approach, and the focus on sea battles. I've never seen a film quite like it before and the graphics were amazing. Especially the opening scene (first 5-10minutes). In 3D it was amazing. I felt like Xerxes was beheading me.This has got a lot of bad reviews for not living up to the original 300. However, I think it did the original film justice and without being an outright replica. Also it touched the original storyline enough to make it 'work' and even filled in some gaps in that film. I would say you could watch the film in either order - so if you haven't seen 300 yet don't let that stop you watching Rise of an Empire. There was no one moment that will be remembered 'This is Sparta' however there were plenty of scenes that for me set the new benchmark for battle graphics.If you're into the myth and don't mind, correction, if you really love the gore of 300 then this is one of the few movies I would recommend seeing on a big screen. You have to! Also I'm not usually a fan of 3D but this was done well and I didn't get sore eyes like I do for some e.g. avatar.",300 - Rise of an Empire

493,mitsxtc,Typical Hollywood Movie,4,18 December 2014,"To be honest I decided to watch the movie after all in order to waste time. That was my original thought. I succeeded... Simply put if you want to watch the movie only to see some nice fight scenes do it... but... even the fight scenes are not impressive they are just fun to watch... too gruesome as well but reasonably so (The part with Artemisia kissing the cut head is simply not acceptable and too far fetched in my point of view). As far as the plot is concerned it was absolutely SHOCKING! Nothing special. Simply put the plot of the movie could be put in one or two sentences... disappointing. As far as the depiction of the Greeks and the Persians it is black and white first of all (anyone CAN see what is wrong with that) and nothing like what they were actually but instead simply A BUNCH OF WILD GUYS with a purpose (such as Artemisia's quote you fight harder than you f*ck).fair enough after all the specific version of the Hellenic-Persian war comes from a comic but i was absolutely shocked in the beginning where Themistokles said this is not a street fight this is democracy or something in these lines (A Greek wouldn't use the word democracy that easy to stop uproar. As you know democracy specially to the eyes of the Greeks back then was a divine value... Hence poor choice). As far as acting is concerned Artemisia is simply great, Themistokles is not bad, but the soldiers are acted by Ambercrombie models who cant act... The movie is far from good... It is a movie to watch when you don't have things to do and you don't want to sleep.",300 - Rise of an Empire
494,srikanthseven,Themistocles Vs King Leonidas,8,7 March 2014,"Entertaining. Glorious graphics and astonishing dark backdrop over sea was an intelligent choice. Action sequences are all packed with blood & mutilated body parts.. quite terrific in 3D. Eva Green rocks as usual. Point is, when watching the movie couldn't stop thinking how Gerard Butler would be as the main start cast. Unfortunately can't expect that as the character came to an end. The transformation of Xerses to God King was good, without any excitement. Plot of the movie is while Spartans fight against evil, Athens too was fighting with evil God King and how they motivated by King Leonidas sacrifice. Overall, it is good to watch in IMAX- 3D. Hope the next sequel will have an effective star cast.",300 - Rise of an Empire
495,poury_eblis,This movie is so offensive to Persians,1,19 April 2014,"This movie is so offensive to Persians as they are shown as savages and monsters. In addition, this movie is not based on a true story and so many historical facts are changed in favor of the Greeks. The creator of this movie has to be ashamed of himself for insulting a race and their culture. One of the other points that makes this movie so insulting is the appearance of the King Xerxes. According to historical documents which are still available by this date, ancient Persian kings used to wear long robes and had long beards which in this movie the king is shown as a naked weirdo which completely shows the lack of knowledge from the producers of this movie.",300 - Rise of an Empire

Sure, since the first movie (300) was alright, why wouldn't the second one follow in its footsteps? I know the movie poster looks pretty appealing.. DON'T BE FOOLED. Even if Lena Headey is in it. If you enjoy watching ugly teeth, badly focused scenes with no plot, and blood that doesn't look real....disregard all I said above and see this movie.3/10. Go watch something else.

497,arsik-91,Not worth watching,4,13 March 2014,"It was a sad sequel. I expected much more quality action from this movie. I never thought that it will have a good script, but we all waited for some ""Sparta Action"". Sometimes it made no sense, such as making a useless scene just to show some nudity and sex, Some TV series have a better plot and action scenes with smaller budget than this one. It was boring from the beginning to the end. Why even they shoot it in IMAX. Even the final fight was boring, nothing breathtaking or anything at all.Lately, Zack Snyder disappoints me and many other fans. Concluding all of said, nothing good to say about this movie, not worth your time people who want a good movie to watch on their weekends. Thanx for reading.",300 - Rise of an Empire

Persians always freed the salves never took any.You've shown Persians as beasts, brutal, with no conscience. It's really a shame that how far you would go with your lies and disrespect to one of the oldest (If not the oldest) and the largest civilizations on Earth by day to humiliate them.You can try to smash our past as hard as you can, but you can never damage our glorious and true history.Cheap shot.",300 - Rise of an Empire
499,burningsoybeans,My rant. ***Contains spoiler,1,5 April 2014,"Let me start off with the point that I am a fan of the first 300. This movie however was lacking something the first possessed and that was the romance of what the Spartans were fighting for. Though I know this movie is to glorify the violence of war I was very uncomfortable with how it displayed the sex. ***spoilers*** The two scenes where it was depicted was just disgusting: one being the Greek women and the Persians, the other being the masochistic scene between Artemesia and Themiscoles. Both scenes I could not bare to watch as they just left a bad taste in my mouth. I give the director that, he was able to instill an uneasy feel for me within the movie.It made me feel especially horrible due to the fact that I could not bare to have it done or imagine it being done to my own lover. I do believeIn the first 300 I could relate to King Leonidas. He was fighting for his home,his wife, and the name of Sparta! Though ultimately I want to believe he was really fighting for his wife. Heck, I'm sure the ***spoilers*** short rape scene in 300:RoE was a slap to the fans of Sparta. I personally looked away as it was pretty awful to watch. Good job to the director to making me feel extremely uncomfortable.I'll give it to the fight scenes to deliver the gore but it just didn't have the same panache.***spoilers*** One scene that just did it for me was how easily the immortals were killed by the Athenians It just didn't seem very right that the elite soldiers of Persia were so easily defeated by mere Athenians. Overall, because of the sexual content and lack of deliverance makes me not want to re watch this.",300 - Rise of an Empire

No spark of intrigue and suave touch that defined the original.The entire contents of this film's dialogue probably spans 3 pages, double-spaced. The writers were so ham-fisted that they made no attempt to develop any characters or even have real dialogue. You will be face palming as you hope the plot develops. Meanwhile, characters continue to have mindless quips in place of dialogue and the corpses of clichés outnumber the corpses on screen.All in all I would recommend fans of the first see the film, but with limited expectations and an understanding that, no the writers will not come out of whatever funk they are in.",300 - Rise of an Empire

I don't know if my expectations were lowered by all the bad reviews I read beforehand but I thought this film was still very good. Its not a contender for an Oscar but I think it rises about the mediocrity which hampers most other current films. Eva Green is a set piece of a woman guaranteeing rapt attention from at least half the audience but I don't think she has been transposed into the film awkwardly.

You know you're watching a 300 movie where heroic actions such as WALKING IN MUD, CUTTING A TREE or LOOKING DISTURBED is done in slow-mo for god's sake, the movie probably would have been 5 minutes long if everything would have done at normal speed. 3. I haven't seen so many bad green screen scenes since the 1970's Z category Bollywood movies. 4. The US Army recruit videos are good and everything, but they really should just use parts of 300 with the enemies renamed as Soviets, Afghanis, Iraqis or whoever they need it would work even on my European socialist-pacifist soul :D 5. From now on, every single movie featuring Eva Green should have a compulsory ... scene... lucky bastard. 6. The movie had the weirdest blood I've ever seen in my life it was as if Heinz had started to make Mercury.",300 - Rise of an Empire
505,hbradley001,Feels like a cheap spin off.,4,7 June 2014,"Complete disappointment. It feels like the makers of this have tried to cash in on the first movie by making a sequel that doesn't deserve to exist within the same cinematic universe as the first.It's just lacking in testosterone.It holds up as a decent old-school Greek flick, with a fair amount of blood, sinewy muscle and boob, but apart from the occasional voice over by Queen Gorgo and the slow-mo action sequences there's not much else about it that's in tone with the original.It's not even about the Spartans. Instead it follows the plight of the Athenians and their own battles with Xerxes' armies. There's far more talking and exposition than in the first, and when the Greeks do go into battle it just doesn't seem quite so impressive. If they'd have just released the film as a free-standing movie of its own then it wouldn't have been so disappointing. As it is it carries the '300' brand and so we watch it with the expectation of brilliance.The character development is weak and the script poor. When someone's offed no one gives a damn because they haven't made us care about the characters enough.Visually, the movie's pretty decent. That's about it though.Expect to come away disappointed...and then wanting to watch the first film just to satisfy yourself. It's what I did.",300 - Rise of an Empire
506,elimbrick23,Awesome with capital A!!!,10,8 March 2014,"This 300 Rise Of A Empire movie was awesome, intense, sexy, action packed and intriguing. Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) was a beast like Achilles great acting was about even with Gerard Butler. Eva Green (Artemisia) was sexy, brutal and insane as any villain I have seen.Xerxes and his story line was great. The way the story pieced together with 300 was magnificent. The low reviews others are giving there on some serious drugs.The battle seen with navy ship best affects I have seen.The movie did not drag or leave me clueless. Really hope that director can carry on to another movie. Enjoyed the new characters and plots.This movie low score 8.5 my score 10!!!",300 - Rise of an Empire
507,chris-506-331942,please for the love of god don't waste your money,1,11 March 2014,"worst film of all time, could have been so much, but it felt like the director had no clue what he was doing, the ""actors"" should have walked out, it is utter garbage.... destined to be placed the £1.99 basket by the tills as supermarket. I would have loved this to be as good as the 1st, but really you will walk out feeling as tho you have just had 2 hours of your life stolen from you. I would have rather paid my money to the tax man that have had to sit through this.300:RoaE is a movie willing to alienate part of its prospective audience to appeal to its perceived one. I came to be entertained, and I was, but at the expense of my gender. While I can appreciate a film that is aware of itself, I wish it wasn't hampered by the ill-conceived business plan to cater to the assumed fantasies of its target viewership. Ill- conceived because I've never seen or heard of a film that made less money by being more inclusive. Equality in slaughter is fine by me, as men and women alike get hacked up in 300:RoaE, in endless slow- motion/fast-motion battle sequences. But claiming an explanation is needed for the participation of women in all this bloody fun? Now that's going too far.Don't GO, IT WILL BE ON CHANNEL 5 IN A MATTER OF WEEKS",300 - Rise of an Empire
508,aamc_99,"Visually excellent, but is Frank Miller turning into a middle - aged libertarian crackpot ?",5,18 March 2014,"Whilst 200 was a stripped down story of a valiant defeat. 300: Rise of an Empire attempt to bolt modern day ideology to ancient battles, makes it a clunking mess. I couldn't take any of the speeches about democracy and freedom seriously, especially as Greeks owned slaves and women were denied votes. If anything I'd have joined the Persians, especially as going by Artemisia, a foreigner and a women she was able to reach the very highest level of command based on her own abilities. Strikes me that the Persians were equal-opportunity employers. The battles were enjoyable, though the ultimate showdown I wanted to see was denied: Artemisia vs Queen Gorgo. Artemisia is dispatched all to easily. Especially as she's built up as this one-women death machine. The rage-sex seems completely out of character. A rape-victim with a pathological hatred of the Greeks, invites him on board to win him over with sex? Hmm... Themistocles, hero of the Greeks living a celibate life? Dude couldn't have had a political life without a family. The film is fun, even if its political message is unwieldy and well untrue and its gender roles are well, one - dimensional; you're either a vamp/witch or mother/matriarch.Enjoy, but go home shaking your head at all the things wrong with it.",300 - Rise of an Empire
509,georgebethanis,"Rushed, unfocused, great female breasts though!",7,6 March 2014,"The movie opened with the land battle of Marathon, then continued on with the naval battles of Artemisium and Salamis. It is an impressive list of battles,but the execution could have been better. The movie's story line flowed beautifully right up until the battle of Artemisium. After that, the producers felt that they are running out of time/money, so they decided to rush everything to a less than a spectacular end.The battle of Salamis was the most important battle of the entire war. They should have skipped the battle of Marathon, moved on to show Artemisium right in the beginning, focus more on the destruction of Athens and give the battle of Salamis the spectacular ending it deserved rather than rush it.Other than the above, the movie featured lots of gore, blood, limbs falling off everywhere. Greek supermen hacking and slicing everything they lay their swords in. Artemisia, the Persian commander played by Eva Green was a very pleasant sight, especially the boobs, men would kill for those boobs. Naval battles are the main focus of this film, ships ramming one into another on an epic scale. This movie is just for fun. Don't expect historical accuracy. As for the battle of Salamis, historically, the Athenian navy faced the Persians with 250 warships....",300 - Rise of an Empire
510,matin-551-200120,This is an insult to history!,1,12 May 2014,"In spite the fact that Jewish producers and directors are showing a lot of interest to present an ugly picture about Persians on media and Hollywood , this movie is very annoying with all violating scenes and the funny, incorrect and unfaithful interpretation from history. Really? Arabic music!, black faces for Persian and all blue eyes in Greece!, and the only brave one in the legend in the Persian army herself was a women from Greek ! Come on! Give me a break! It's a pity that Artemisia died in this episode, because the director could keep the child of her and Themistocles to make the 3rd episode of 300 against Palestine!! I invite you to search internet for the battles in which Persian were involve and learn about how they were treating people after their battles and victories (a good examples is saving Jews by Cyrus the Great who figures in the Hebrew Bible as the patron and deliverer of the Jews) and compare to what Alexander the great did on his way. The only positive point was the equality between men and women govern by Darius.BTW, Dark cloths were unusual at that time by Zoroastrians!",300 - Rise of an Empire
511,dtejada16,Just watch the first one,3,27 March 2014,"The movie itself was really nothing more than fight sequences, slow- motion stills of certain hits to the face, more gore and more nudity than 300, in a feeble attempt to recreate the reaction that 300 had. The story itself is nothing to chew on, really. The only performances that could possibly be considered worth mentioning would be the portrayals of Artemisia and Xerxes, and their back-stories (which were ludicrous and false, but what historically inspired movie isn't nowadays?)All in all, the movie is a show-off for visual effects and cheap, unorganized fighting (no use of Greek phalanxes at all). Definitely a step down from 300.",300 - Rise of an Empire
512,theanimal520,Brilliant!,10,3 June 2014,This is one of those movies you didn't know what to expect out of it. The brilliance of this movie was the plot taking place side by side with Leonidas and the 300 Spartans. The incorporation of characters from the first movie allowed for a real sense of place during this whole war. The Fight sequences were on par with the first one if not better. The plot focused on two main characters (Sullivan Stapleton)Themistocles and his pride for his homeland. Then(Eva Green) Artemisia hate for what her homeland allowed to happen. The casting for this movie was perfect. The possibility of a third movie is left out there.,300 - Rise of an Empire
513,sophiebo88,Disappointing,1,8 March 2014,"Waste of money!!I've never felt compelled to leave a review before but my Husband and I were both very disappointed with this film after both really enjoying the first 300 movie. I was totally bored 15 minutes in but was hoping for something interesting to happen- it never happened!I felt like it was all action/graphics but no story line, the entire film was people getting killed with swords in slow motion, ships bashing into each other like the dodgems and then there was Sullivan Stapleton's bad British accent which was a mixture between British, American and Australian.",300 - Rise of an Empire
514,subredoctober,"The movie was really good, though it did not meet my expectation as a sequel/meanwhile to 300",7,23 March 2014,"300 was epic. This sequel/meanwhile seems to fall far behind. This should not carry the 300 in title. The Greek had a great cause for a war, yet we got only several fights at sea. 300 had even more ships than this. I cannot help comparing the film with the original 300. Themistocles (Stapleton) did not had the ""voice"" of a leader like Leonidas (Butler) - like he's whispering to Leonidas. His men did not bear the look of professional warriors like Spartans. Anyway, I think this is OK because the Spartans are the best warriors in the world, right? And Spartan women who gave birth to those men are gorgeous (Queen Gorgo) comparing to the Greek-turned-Persian Artemisia (though I like Eva Green a lot). The divine god king who was so god-like in 300 turned out to be just an arrogant boy who feasts in the shadow while his nanny does the conquering. One more thing is that there was a lot of narration, and also Themistocles spoke too much (with his whispering voice). However I could see this a good movie. The fights were good. The visuals were what I expected the most, and they were really awesome. I completely bought the soundtrack also. Those all made a good movie. And the way it ended made me look forward to a 3rd one at Platea (Dillios, 300 end, remember?) And if your are still with me till this line, thank you for your time",300 - Rise of an Empire
515,ozaivoid0930,Fantastic!,8,10 March 2014,"Watched the movie over the weekend and was surprised at how much I walked away from from this film extremely satisfied. For those who like to compare films like this to actual historical facts, don't even go there, you will only frustrate yourself. Instead walk into it with an open mind and just prepare yourself to view the film on how it was meant to be viewed, an action film with lots of blood and thrilling moments. I am a big fan of the first film and I have to say, I think I may actually like this movie better. So far I have seen quite a few movies at the theaters and have left them rather down about what I've see, finally, a movie that doesn't disappoint but rather exceeds the expectations I had. I rated the film 8 out of 10.",300 - Rise of an Empire
516,nickos26,A classic piece of unforgettable film-making,10,30 September 2014,"OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ 300: Rise of an Empire served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest film. It currently sits at #27 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? this is Sparta It's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the same actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well over 2500 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality, and would only be amplified . And it's not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going, it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off as well, as the tedium of war life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be forgotten",300 - Rise of an Empire
517,andrewkard666,Yeah I don't see how this is any higher then a 5.5,5,19 March 2014,"I don't see how people could even enjoy this schlock fest when compared to even the first 300 movie, let alone plenty of other fantastic movies in this genre. I was bored out of my mind for a majority of the film. Im just going to get it out of the way the fighting was straight up lame. And in a movie like this the fighting is the only important part. The acting on all fronts was just blah at best but considering the script was dog poop I guess they did the best the could. Can't expect much from a movie where the line ""Themistocles, King Leonidas has been betrayed by a hunchback!"" is uttered now can you? The story is bare bones simplistic, this is about the other prong of the attack during the events of the original 300 but from Athens prospective dealing with Persia's fleet. Aaaaand that's it. The main villain is a woman who wants nothing more then to have sex the main character cause I guess in a movie like this where you have a strong female antagonist she still has to want to have sex a dude right? Or was that just to have a boring 3 minute long sex scene that was like the one from the latest dark shadows film except a lot funnier. But back to the main reason you came to see this movie the fighting scenes. I'm sorry but putting a bunch of fancy fake blood over basic choreography does not make it more interesting. It had its moments don't get me wrong that had me going ""Hoo Hoo yeah!"" as muscular white dude #3 cuts off the arms leg and head of a Persian skillfully and beautifully but they were few and far between. I guess a main problem with the fighting is you couldn't give less of a hoot about any of the characters. The only two I can remember are Themistocles since I learned about him all throughout school and his BFF captain kooky eye, you know the guy with the son and he had the weird right eye? yeah you know him.I just I can't really go to in depth about it because there is nothing to be in depth about it's just boring, so freaking boring. The fight scenes are just like 300s but just worse because A) The people fighting aren't nearly as cool as Spartans, remember that scene in the original 300 where Leonidas makes fun of that guy who brought potters, and writers, and masons? Yeah well this movie is about those guys! Aren't you inspired? B) We actually had time to learn and care about the Spartans before the fighting started. They were witty and had chuckle worthy one liners the script was campy but had a nice charm to it. C) The visuals were stunning because they were STYLIZED not blown out of proportion as they are in this film. A simple shot like the Spartans pushing that first wave of Persians off the cliff is infinitely more memorable then when Themistocles like blew up that big ship... by setting the man on fire... and it went boom... and everyone's like, oh look at that... that's cool. This movie just feels like a cheap rip off of the original and your better off watching that and forgetting this ever happened.",300 - Rise of an Empire

This one, however, was even better and now has me HOOKED!Definitely see this movie, and I disagree with the low meta score or whatever that is, that it has received. I made an account on IMDb and this is the first movie I have ever reviewed, just because I enjoyed it so much.So if you liked the 300 movie.. see this one.

Critic reviews are completely inaccurate as it doesn't contain some weird 'political message' they automatically 'dislike it'. To them, I say go watch your boring films and leave this masterpiece alone. Acting top notch too. The only issue, is the blood. A lot of blood flying everywhere however hardly any on the ground but hey, not complaining. The film is by far my favourite this year and worth every penny at the movies. I also think the fact the film is a prequel and a sequel is pretty darn brilliant. My advice is just go see it people! Ha cant wait for the next instalment!",300 - Rise of an Empire
520,samuraiswathy2,Maybe I expected too much,6,6 March 2014,"The movie is definitely not more of the same things from its predecessor, which of-course gives the movie an identity for itself, rather than being in the shadow of 300 (2006).The story is said from the perspective of Artemisia(Eva Green) more, and less as from Themistokles(Sullivan Stapleton), and therefore one might find themselves cheering for the Persians this time. Artemisia, the Persian naval commander is one refined character and Eva Green sure managed to capture that vengeance seeking and unstoppable traits of the character. Same cannot be said about Themistokles, played by Sullivan Stapleton, though. The character managed only to stay soft throughout the movie, and therefore never managed to show the valor as Leonidas from the 2006 movie, played by Gerard Butler.The movie delivers some short side stories, which creates some depth to the story, unlike the predecessor. But the look and feel of the movie has compromised a lot and looks way mediocre, which is why I just rated it 6 stars.",300 - Rise of an Empire
521,irishteaser,Not as good as 300... Fails to add to the original story enough...,5,9 November 2014,The original 300 film was stunning in terms of cinematic experience and how the story was told. This continues with stunning cinematic scenes. The battle scenes although set mostly on the high seas are very impressive and gritty !!!. However for me the film is let down by the lack of any thrills or twists and turns in the plot. It adds to the story of the original 300 but doesn't make the film stand out on its own. Would recommend if you just enjoy fight / battle scenes but wouldn't recommend for anyone looking for a plot that adds to the film. Stick with the 'original' 300 film and don't expect this to add too much more to the experience !!!,300 - Rise of an Empire

523,erik-dragset,300 rise of an empire - Below average movie,3,24 June 2014,"I apologize for any grammatical errors in this text, English is not my first language.After watching 300, I had as many others, great expectations for the sequel. I was however greatly disappointed when i watched the movie. Definitely not worth the money I (should have) paid.It started fine, were we see Athene's general Themistokles leading his troops against the Persians, lead by king Darius. The fighting scene are well directed, with allot of slow motion and ALLOT of badly animated blood. The fighting scene turned out to be one of my biggest grudge against this movie. I don't have anything against blood in films, I actually like it. And although the fights were okay choreographed, they just went TOTALLY overboard. There were just too much slow motion that it got boring. They could have had a quarter the amount of slow motion, and it still would be too much. Frankly, almost the entire movie was the ""same sh*t different day"", just with another background.Because of the amount of fights, blood and slow motion, there were hardly enough time for a plot, which were thinner than England chance of winning the world cup. The possibilities for a fantastic plot were HUGE, considering the history of Greece-Persia-Sparta. They could have done so much. I am no expert in Greece history, but I know that there were allot more to the union of the Greece states. I feel like this could have been a fantastic movie if the writer had more knowledge and the director had more experience.",300 - Rise of an Empire
524,djsantost,"Better than the original, stays true to it",7,9 March 2014,"300 was good but had problems in terms of structure and pacing, but the art design was innovative and stayed true to Frank Miller's work. 300: Rise of an Empire tries to follow such work while also being smart and well put together.The action is stunning and well paced, and the combat is fluid, with slow-motion only kicking in at the times it matters, rather than every time a spartan takes a step. The story is also interesting. It draws inspiration from another Frank Miller's work, Xerxes, a prequel to 300 showing the origins of the god-king. Such is explained in the movie, leading into a story that takes place exactly at the same time as the original movie. The references to it and the constant movement of both stories give a fresh take to this story.The cast also delivers, with Lena Headley and David Wenham returning as Leonidas' wife and the last survivor of the 300, respectively. However, the big focus goes to the two main characters, with Eva Green taking the spotlight for the entire movie. Sullivan Stapleton also takes credit, but his role is simple, being the master strategist of the Greeks who fights with both cunning and bravery. Eva Green as the villain is simply incredible, showing amazing range and expression as a victim who had to fight her way to the commander of the Persian army, using her sexuality and cunning to defeat her opponents.Also, the art style of the movie is stellar, though not so effective as Zach Snyder's work. Soundtrack is also great, accompanying the story well and making itself noted in the right moments.Overall, it's a good surprise to see a movie that could have been made the same way as its predecessor become so much more than that. It's a smart, well paced and fun film that, despite its short flaws. It's still an action movie, but it's a good one. Recommended.",300 - Rise of an Empire
525,chihebkefi,Probably the worst underdog story to ever come out of Hollywood,4,10 March 2014,"Putting aside the gag-inducing ""freedom-loving"" and ""tyranny-bashing"" speeches as well as the ridiculous attempt at historical accuracy (did anyone even open a history book before making this movie?), I think that this movie will go down as the worst underdog story to ever be shown in a movie theater. Approximately 15 minutes into the movie I was already rooting for the Persians, namely Xerxes and Artemisia, given their touching back-story and justified reasons to go to war with ""Greece"" (a bunch of cities busy fighting over who had sex with the most underage boys). The only positive thing about this movie is Eva Greens' performance, but it really cannot make up for all the face-palm moments of the movie, especially the alleged ""strategy"" used by the Persians (not unlike the one in the first movie) which consists basically of running toward the ""greek"" super-soldiers and hoping they will simply ignore you, just to be cut into pieces with what seems to be magical swords (once again, a semblance of historical or medical accuracy just don't seem to be present in this movie). I was hoping this sequel could make me forget how bad the first one was, unfortunately it only made me hate the ""story"" more.",300 - Rise of an Empire

But the movie was well held together and cast n storyline enjoyable. The first movie gave the studio a canvas to write an even larger money spinner and a great show but alas it seems they lost the plot completely.The current movie is a hodge podge of story lines, historical facts and amazingly bad character sketches. Other than Eva Green there is nothing worth remembering in the whole movie.In fact, the 5 starts are only for the cinematography and the CGI effects. The director should realize, just showing buckets of blood gushing out in 101 ways doesn't make a movie.For script, if they had struck to the original Battle of Salamis, it would have made a much better plot.

529,iGabriel16,Excellent!!,10,16 March 2014,"Hello there, reader!I don't want to fry the chicken( expression) by writing a long and boring review. I've read more than a few reviews on IMDb, that were silly, rated with ""1 star"". It's a shame to do such thing, so I've decided to write my first review, ever. OK, enough with the chit-chat.8 years ago when I watched the first 300, I remember the moment when I was blown away, by everything! It was a movie that deserved my heart. Still, many years have passed since then, so many that I didn't even expected a second part, until now, so I bought a ticket for this movie in 3D.I want to mention that THIS MOVIE IS A SIDE-QUEL, which is brilliant and creative. It gives another meaning to what really happened from another point of view. The first thing that gave me chills or goose bumps(strong ones), was the great, great, great soundtrack! I have never heard a soundtrack like this in my whole life, and trust me, I've heard lots of other soundtrack. This soundtrack is perfect, it hits at the right moment and highlights the battles, the characters and dramatic moments. The second thing that attracted my attention were the characters, especially Artemisia( Eva Green). The actors really pulled out the strings, by entering into the characters skin. We can see that clearly. Another thing that I realized at the end of the movie, was that I didn't even had a chance to relax or to breath, because it captured my attention, I was not bored at all; only a few movies deliver this experience( for those who are not blind). I don't think that I need to mention the graphics, or how great are the effects of this movie, because, as the title says, graphics were "" Excellent""!Still, what would be a movie without a good storyline, right? As mentioned at the beginning of this review, this movie is a side-quell and from my point of view, it highlights the villain character now, because in the first movie, everything was about the 300 army.I suggest that everyone should go and watch this movie, in 3D. I haven't seen a movie like this from a long time; probably will watch it again soon xD. I hope you guys enjoyed this review. As you have seen, it does not include spoilers, not even a single clue about the action of this movie. If I could, I would rate this movie 10+ and probably create a monument.",300 - Rise of an Empire
530,rudyornelas45,awesome war film,8,13 April 2014,"Debating on which film to watch this weekend? Well if action is something that interests you then 300 ""Rise of the Spartans"" is a must watch. This high budget film, contains outstanding effects and awesome war scenes. The film begins with an epic battle full of blood and men fighting to the death. The long battle is a great way to begin the film and the bloodshed will have you on the edge of your seat. Themistocles, a man from Athens is the main character for the Spartans and he is a great leader and loyal to his people. On the rival side, there is Artemisia and King Darius. These three main characters are very passionate on winning the war, and each play a huge role throughout the whole film. They play great roles, and are the perfect people to play these charismatic leaders. All of the characters in the film speak with an accent, some with a roman accent and others with a Persian accent. The language spoken through the film contains a lot of yelling and passionate phrases during the long battle. Artemisia and Themistocles go back and forth commanding their armies against each other. The film also contains a very passionate love scene between two people of the film, this scene shows that in war anything is done to win. The Persians wanted to take over Rome and the whole film was a war between the two, and at the end of the film neither side had completely won the war leaving skepticism among the viewers that a third film might be made. None of the many battles of the film occurred on land. The battlefields were all in the ocean and both sides commanded their ships to each other and that's how the battles were fought. This style of war caused the leaders to come up with strategies on how they were going to fight and were they would command their ships to go. The Spartans wore their typical attire which included pants and boots. Spartans in the film do not wear any shirts and probably because they have very muscular bodies. Each Spartan has a sword and shield that they carry with them. As for the Persians, their attire was different, they had pants as well but had many piercing on their body. The leader was colored in gold and looked exotic. Most of the Persian men were bald. The Persian Queen was very sexual and good looking often wearing revealing clothing. The films cast did not contain any movie stars that I knew about, but I thought the actors played great roles in the film. As I mentioned before, the film contained awesome effects during the battle scenes. The graphics in the film were out of this world. The only downfall in my opinion to the films effects was the blood. The reason for that is the blood did not look realistic at all, it did not look like real blood. The camera angles and lighting were on point and could not have been better. Some films tend to get me dizzy because of the poor camera angles, but this film I was able to enjoy without feeling dizzy. Overall, I sat through this movie and not once did I yawn or think about leaving the film and asking for a refund. The film had me on the edge of my seat anticipating what would happen next, and the final part of the film ended with a bang! Two thumbs up for this film on my part. Definitely recommend this film as it has a great story line, and is also filled with such epic scenes of battle all in one.",300 - Rise of an Empire
531,shubhambhargav83,"300:Rise of an ""Empire""......",7,12 March 2014,"So there I was sitting in the theater expecting the film to start from where 300 ended. What I saw was king Themistokles killing Xerxes' father and in an other war provoking him for what he became which we saw in 300. But I've got to admit that this movie's effects were beyond comparison from that of its prequel. Superb effects, a very good performance by all the actors and its link with the prequel is what keeps the audience involved throughout the film. Eva Green in the role of Artemisia was the perfect choice by the the director and she steals the show. Her attitude throughout the film, her sad story, her fierceness and above all her vengeance for her past just makes her the best villain in the recent film. Sullivan Stapleton played the part of Themistokles very well and made us believe what king Leonidas did in 300-""Never Bow Down"". I won't reveal the story to spoil the fun and will advice all to see this movie which won't disappoint you although it will not be the best of the ones recently released.

Every scene was just taking your expectations away bit for bit and makes you realise the inevitable truth that this Movie will take Place on the goddamn ships the whole time. Except of course when they are have shitty romantic speeches about freedom and how awesome it is to be lame. The true heart of the first 300 was the brilliant fighting scenes and the simple principle: - You want to change how we live? - Oh yeah? F you and everyone that looks like you, you shitheads! We rather F our mothers than surrender.The sequel is the complete opposite: - Ooh, look at us. We have to have this bullshit democracy and F up Everything because we have our freedoms. Lets be lame and use Home-Alone-Traps for defense instead of real fighting scenes pumped up with some Persian-hating testosterone.I Went to the Cinema this evening expecting a sure to be awesome Movie and all I got was this bullshit.Im gonna spend my remaining Days praying that all the involved people in this Movie will spend the rest of their lives flipping Burgers at Burger King.",300 - Rise of an Empire

536,antonioballve,Go watch Disney's BRAVE,1,7 March 2014,"So, the last stronghold of men has been pillaged. The original 300 was about strong, brave, reckless men who would die for glory. This sequel is about a girl who outwits the whole Persian empire and defeats men in their own game. Eva Green's character was so unnaturally forced into 300's universe just to have that ""strong female main character"" that it was obscene. No Leonidas, no Spartans, a childish Xerxes whose only role in the film was to be an idiot so that Eva Green character's ""wittiness"" could come to light, and a terrible main character (forgot his name already). I won't even go into the storyline because the real story here is that the spirit of the original 300 has been utterly destroyed. This movie is so politically correct it's stupid, I guess this is what gets money nowadays. I just really hope this movie does badly so that the people who made it give a second thought before killing a franchise next time.Only part worth mentioning: Eva Green's topless scene.",300 - Rise of an Empire
537,Annaparsons859,Ruined absolutely ruined (spoiler alert!),1,7 March 2014,"This movie was absolutely a waste of my time and my money. I went to my local theater on March 7th which is also my birthday and I wanted to see the movie based on the performance of the first 300.The first 300 had catharsis, it had actual character development and made you want to keep going. This new 300, ""rise of an empire"" was absolutely horrendous. Rise of an empire, what empire? This Great War that united the Greeks was barely touched on. It was all about the blood and the guts and breasts. I don't mind nudity. I don't mind blood. But the way the director went about it only cheapened the experience. This movie has a line in it ""you fight harder than you f***"" (Artemisia). It could have been beautiful and filled with the promise of something both hilarious and invigorating if the scene it referred to had not been so vulgar. 300 Rise of an Empire was not worth the money I spent on it. There are books out there on this point in history, historical fiction books that have stronger character development than this script. The actors did the best they could with what they had, but writers and director, you owe the public an apology for this poor display of cinematic ""genius"". It was cheap, crude and not well thought out. I had higher hopes. Next time actually make something worth watching.",300 - Rise of an Empire

It's mildly different to the original 300 with a bulk of battles being naval but was definitely satisfying to watch. I didn't go into 300:RoE expecting it to win Oscars I went for the same reason I saw the original 300, I wanted to see some ""bad assery"" and yes, they do have those moments and more. Also, Themistocles is a ""pimp"", watch the movie or read some reviews, I hate spoiling it even though I got the spoil and watched it anyway. It ends well, with both movies tying into one another so as a disclaimer you may want to watch the original 300 if you haven't already but more likely than not if you are wanting to watch this movie it's likely you already have or want to.",300 - Rise of an Empire

And credit Empire with giving its actresses substantial action roles. But this film telegraphs its punches like a sword to the eyeball. And there are plenty. Empire promises and delivers a literal tide of blood, which will be welcome news for action aficionados looking for a picture that pulls no punches. But for fans of the story, Empire throws none. Is 300 redux as portending of history? No. Does it wear its ethereal quality as loyally to convey a legend in the making? No. Does it tell its story as effectively? No again.",300 - Rise of an Empire
540,Ariannald3,Very disappointed,3,8 March 2014,"300 was such a great movie, so when I seen the trailers of rise of an empire I was so excited even amped the movie up. First day it came out, I had high hopes and couldn't not wait to see the movie. However I was completely disappointed and could not believe that I sat through that entire movie. It's confusing & had excessive amounts of blood, to the point where it made no sense. and the movie looked like a video game at a certain point. I was even more blown away when the Athens all of a sudden could fight. If they were farmers and had pitch forks in 300, how could they have gained so much strength and could actually be a threat to the Persians ? Zercsees looked like he was dipped in gold and was basically chilling throughout the movie. Whatever your thoughts are before the movie, forget about them, your going in for a complete loss. Yes there was more action but the way the movie went was just off. I don't recommend watching this movie, but that's just my opinion.",300 - Rise of an Empire

This little cute story was made to spark the viewers emotions but it didn't spark mine because it was stupid. When there wasn't a fight on the screen i was mostly picturing the food i was gonna cook later. The scenes with Xerxes were OK because he is an interesting character.

OK, lets talk about the movie. At the beginning of the movie, Athens fight against Persia, Athens win. I wonder how these sissy win? Everyone is Spartan? Also this movie is 300: Rise of an empire, details should be how Xerxes become God king, but in the movie, Xerxes only use 5 minutes, he walk into a golden pool, after back, he become god king. I want to watch the movie how Sparta fight against Persia, not the war upon the sea between Athens and Persia. I'm disappointed, don't waste money watch this movie, you will mad after this movie end",300 - Rise of an Empire
543,kyza_t,Cannot wait for the next installment,8,9 March 2014,As a lover of Greek Mythology and the time of swords and arrows this movie does not disappoint. It has excellent follow on from the first 300 installment (although its not so much a follow on as it is a tale of the same 300 battle from a different perspective) and delivers even better graphic fight scenes and limb severs. Although the hero speeches and ego battles are a little OTT it fits in well with the style of these movies that viewers have come to love. Eva Green was surprisingly sexy in this role and proves she is a chick you don't want to be up against. With a fantastic ending that builds you up wanting more this movie is not one to be missed.,300 - Rise of an Empire
544,a-ehsan70,It includes some wrong facts,2,10 March 2014,"The movie is based on several wrong facts about Persian army. At that time, Xerxes army was the only army which: Service in the army did not begin before the age of 20, nor extend past 55. The army was multinational,as illustrated in reliefs found at Persepolis and also mentioned by thehistorian, Herodotus (VII,61FF) and playwright, Aesch_ylos (Persae,l.304-330). Huge payments made to senior men were to support their whole retinues (Lewis,1990:2). {I have found these information from this link: http://tinyurl.com/3kgzr6v, you could also find the actual articles from the provided citation}My point is that Xerxes and his army is nothing close to what is shown in the movie. However, these are some true facts: Unlike Cyrus, Xerxes relied on overwhelming force. Although he invaded Greece with a force of 5,280,000 (Herodotus), he was unsuccessful. Xerxes had Athens burned. He immediately regretted this action and ordered it rebuilt the next day.",300 - Rise of an Empire

No it wasn't 300 but it wasn't suppose to be and maybe all the facts weren't true but I'm sure the same can be said for 300, doubt it followed the true history of the battle at the Hot Gates. I loved the characters and actors, the story and the action. I didn't want a repeat of 300 we have seen that. It's a film and how many films actually follow the facts. For example Braveheart was completely inaccurate but it didn't stop it being an amazing film. If you want history watch a documentary. I didn't have any expectations about the movie and watched it without putting it up against 300. I just hope poor reviews don't stop them making a 3rd film showing the final battle to end the Persian army in Greece. 10/10 for me",300 - Rise of an Empire

I went in with pretty low expectations as the reviews have been harsh on this film. Straight away you understand that this film is going to be exploring events before, during and after the battle of the 300. The film itself offers a grand amount of bloody, brutal combat, which I really enjoyed. There was defiantly more blood and gore in comparison to the first film.The story was okay, it was very simplistic and very straight to the point, which isn't a bad thing bare in mind. The lead character wasn't as strong as Leonidas but that does not mean he is terrible as Leonidas was a great Spartan king.The main highlights for me were the epic, roaring sound track, which really added that extra something to the film and the final battle scenes were simply spin chilling. I won't spoil it but you will work out how the last battle will unfold before it's even begun but when everything happens it will send chills down your spine.",300 - Rise of an Empire
549,firozthegreat,"""Rise of an Empire"" more enigmatic",8,13 March 2014,"It was an amazing experience. Coming to the story this cannot be called as a sequel of Spartans war with the Persians but its definitely a sequel for 300.Assumed it was a sequel. However, it is more of a companion movie - a different view point of the events in 300 and the events after and some events before. Some may find it not as amazing as 300 because just one reason, the lead actor Sullivan Stapleton as Themistocles didn't have the authority and leadership that Gerard Butler as king Leonidas had in 300. But this is made in much bigger canvas and every scenes was amazing. The main attraction of both parts are their color tones.Eva Green as Artemisia was just amazing. That head slaughtering and kissing scene was far too amazing. She was the one who held the film. But i am sure with Spartans joining the army of Greeks the next part will be worth waiting. This.This film surely cleared my doubt.I was always doubting how Xerxes became god-king and what happened after Leonidas and the brave 300 were overrun by the Persian empire.I am sure this part is just a built up for for an amazing part to come.We can watch Lena Headey more in coming part.The united Greeks assembled against the Persian Empire. Like the first, ""Rise of an Empire"" is undoubtedly clothed in beauty, from the moonlighting to the muscled bodies, the eloquent sprays of blood, the film is about an aesthetic which is part of the story. Is it masking a lack of story? definitely not, it is the story. ""300"" was ground breaking at the time of release, ""Rise of an Empire"" merely perfects that first step into a world of a different, and maybe more enigmatic, way of story telling.Must watch in 3D for that amazing experience.",300 - Rise of an Empire
550,zoomcool17,With Great presentation and Few excitements.......!!!! Expect much at end.,7,13 March 2014,"Hi Guys, I am not that much follower of History and does not know much about Greeks and Persians though I enjoyed 300's both parts specially the storyline, action the way it present, graphics and actors posture- true worriers (almost each of them have perfect six packs).About second part, it starts from the end of first part and explain, how and why the war begun. The other end of the Greeks attacked by the Persians navy at the same time when 300 Spartans was attacked by Xerxes. The tactics used by Sullivan Stapleton (Themistocles) will definitely amaze viewers and also how smartly Themistocles damaged the moral of the Persians' Navy within two attacks even though Persians' Navy doubled then Greeks Navy.The middle part of this movie, little bit talkative though interesting, where Eva Green (Artemisia) offered surrender to Themistocles. After that again War begun with huge navy, leading by Artemisia. and destroy most of the Themistocles's Navy and worriers.I was little bit disappointed at the end where Artemisia attacked again with her full strength Navy to demolish Themistocles's Navy fully (only five ships left after last attack and very few worriers) but Artemisia could not even survive against Themistocles' attracts and dramatically defeated by Themistocles within few seconds. This could be more interesting if fight could last long for few more minutes at the end. specially sword fight of Themistocles and Artemisia.Overall, enjoyable movie in theatre with few excitements before the end and definitely attract attention specifically the viewers who enjoy Worries' type action movies.Thanks Guys to read through.",300 - Rise of an Empire

553,littell-sam,Same but horrible version,1,17 March 2014,"After reading some of the reviews left by movie goers for this film I am rather pleased. Pleased, that I'm not the only person who despised this film. I didn't actually have high hopes for the film to start as most movies this year have been let downs. Well this one was no different..Where to start... Well the actor that played Testiclees, or whatever his name was, did not fit the role at all. I did like the back story between him and Xerxes (who not only looks like a lady but actually is a lady in this sequel). Wait nevermind I didn't like it at all because it was just ending of the first movie (hero didn't kill Xerxes, C'mon really, did you even try writer). I should have got up and left right there...I even stood up and thought about it before the guy behind me yelled in arabic :/. The movie just got worse from there... I felt like this movie might have been the rough draft of the first film. Same plot, same character story lines (with little variation), same exact lines.. They even used like 14 scenes from the original film itself. Main character becomes a legend, Persians invade, One man leads army, violence, sex scene, dad dies this time instead of closet gay son, hunchback guy, betrayal, Spartans still make everyone else look like a wuss and save the day.. The one major change in this movie is Xerxes is a vagina pad in this movie vs. being an awesome antagonist.. And the actual antagonist in the film would have been good if she didn't look like a meth head the entire time... Character was dull, shallow, and unoriginal.. The strength of her character is detracted by her inability to control her emotions, which is actually pretty realistic ;). Fight scenes didn't do it for me... Just too over the top with the choreographing.. Overall this film just sucked, I currently live in the middle east and they cut out the only good part where I can only assume Testiclees tried to put it in Eva's butt and she got upset about it... I don't even review movies but I am so upset by this film that I am trolling it..tl;dr - This is the bizzaro version of the original 300",300 - Rise of an Empire
554,mike-a-terrell,"Pirate this, it's not worth the money.",1,17 March 2014,"Let me first start by saying that I am staunchly anti-piracy. I wouldn't want you to watch this on Netflix, by virtue of the fact that you spend roughly $8 a month on Netflix, and would subsequently be paying to watch this movie.Huge fans of the first '300', my fiancée and I went to see 'Rise of an Empire' with another couple on a whim this past Friday. Thirty or so minutes into the film, I had to lean over and ask my friend if this movie was a parody, as it was impossible to take seriously. It could have been the fact that Xerxes now has a heavy Portugese accent amongst poorly executed English accents, used by characters attempting to portray Greeks/Persians. Maybe the cartoonish, video game fight scenes (85% of the film) with a disgusting overuse of the slow motion effect that landed a heavy punch in the first film. Could it be the fact that, without any real firepower, it's almost impossible to make a naval battle truly interesting? How about the lazy use of stock footage from the original film? Maybe the sex scene, which obviously uses slow/fast-mo fighting graphics, and features some Persian chrome-face guards glancing at each other comically whilst they hear the lovemaking from outside the room, a-la Scary Movie. I honestly don't think a parody would do this movie justice.On the other hand, I greatly enjoyed the $5 Espresso Chocolate milkshake I got from the Alamo Drafthouse. I rate that an 8/10, coming in at a close second to the Strawberry Balsamic shake, which gets a perfect 10/10 every time. I would strongly recommend either of these shakes from Drafthouse, to be enjoyed while watching something other than '300, Rise of an Empire'.",300 - Rise of an Empire
555,khavle_khavle,Not a good try by any mean,3,17 March 2014,"Pro: Really nice costumes for the main characters. They went to battle dressing in gowns like going to a ball. So if anyone needs some inspiration for a prom dress there are some there.Con: The movie was very bloody and explicit, unnecessary in my opinion because it doesn't help any with the plot. The plot itself doesn't contain much to think on anyway. The antagonist, Artemisia, acted way better and more convincing than Themistocles, the protagonist. Even the background story of the antagonists is more believable and attracted more sympathy. It is one of the rare movies I have watched that I really want the bad side wins. (Too bad!!) The language is too modern for the ancient setting, especially the profanity. By the way, all those words are modern American profanity (not even European, what the heck!!!) The historical implication is way off from the real history and politic of Greek and I really can't stop comparing it to the real history of Greek and feel it missing. I wished it was set in a fictitious history, that may make the story a bit more believable. And finally, too much movie effects that is absolutely obvious and fake (like fire spreads on water and avoid all the wooden boats.)So, all in all, 3 out of 10 for the costumes and Artemisia.",300 - Rise of an Empire
556,filmographia-com,"Too much pointless action, not so much plot!",6,31 March 2014,"To say it simply, this movie is for those who prefer action over plot. The action scenes are the main positive element of the movie, but they are a too big part of the movie. It's more a movie that is ""action scenes+movie"" than a movie that it is ""movie+action scenes."" To be fair, the action scenes have very good choreography. The problem with the film is that it lacks substance, with its cheesy dialogue and lack of plot. If you are not an action/blood/six packs/sex film kind of viewer, then the movie will leave you either indifferent, or disappointed. On the other hand, if you like that kind of entertainment, then prepare your pop-corn and relax while watching some angry Greeks slaughtering Persians. For sure, the movie doesn't come close to the quality of the first 300 movie.Some people seem annoyed or turned off by the lack of historical accuracy. If you watched this movie for that you wasted your time. A movie that is based on a comic book is not supposed to be accurate, nor are its creators aim for something like that. The first 300 movie wasn't 100% accurate either. Movies like that don't have to be accurate. Their goal is to entertain. Movies are not documentaries. The defect of this movie is that it's too focused on the action scenes, where the rest of the movie is at best mediocre.Why To Watch It 1. Action! Action! Action! Blood! Blood! Blood! 2. You love anything Greek. 3. You love to see the west kicks the east's butt. 4. Eva Green is really gifted. She is also very gifted in the area between her neck and her stomach.Why To Not Watch It 1. You seeks something more than just impressive action scenes and violence in a movie. 2. Historical accuracy is among the elements of a movie that are important to you. 3. You hate the common British accent that historical movies have. 4. The ""Greeks"" of the movie look too much like northern Europeans to you. 5. Cheesy, badly written dialogue. 6. You would rather read a historical book than watch a movie. 7. Because Themistocles didn't yell ""This is Athens!""",300 - Rise of an Empire

558,gertjan-wils,300: rice of an empire,8,23 March 2014,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. A couple of years ago I watched the first 300 so I was very excited about the sequel. Actually isn't it a real sequel. The two films perfectly blend in each other. You certainly need to see 300 before watching 300: rice of an empire. There are a lot references with the first. Both movies are taking place on the same time. 300 is a specific battle between 300 Spartans and the Persians. Rice of an empire tells about the war between Greece and Persia. I strongly recommended this movie to everyone how likes a good action and adventure film. 1h and 43 minutes of intense tension and bloodshed. You can see that the writers have put a lot of time in research to make the film as realistically as possible and historically correct. I think they did a good job. Although the film is historically correct it is nothing like a documentary. During the hole film there is a certain tension that clusters to the screen. The movie is based on the graphic novel Xerxes by Frank Miller. The Greek general Themistokles leads the charge against invading Persian forces led by mortal-turned-god Xerxes and Artemisia, vengeful commander of the Persian navy. Themistokles wants Greece to unite and join arms. Tis doesn't works at first but eventually he achieves his goal. At the beginning of the film you see the young Themistokles at the battle of Marathon how kills Xerxes' father (king Darius) with an arrow. When Xerxes' father dies he is devastated but Artemisia uses the last words of the dyed king (only a god can defeat the Geeks) to motivate Xerxes. She sends him away and he turned into a god king. Now he can revenge his dad. So sends out Artemisia with her fleet. The lead actor is Themistokles played by Sullivan Stapleton. Sullivan is the perfect guy for this role. He has the right attitude and is a great leader. He can also handle the sword really well. You can see him fight almost all the time. For this movie he has practiced allot to get so skilled. The co-star is Artemisia played by Eva Green. I find she has the most distinct character. Artemisia is a Greek. She saw her family get killed by Greek soldiers. After that she was held in the ships hold and raped several years. Then they threw her out for dead. Luckily for her a Persian merchant how took care of her. She was trained by the best worriers but no one could match her skills. She became the head adviser of Darius. She was his best commander and brought him many victories but she really wants to vengeance Greece for what they had done to her. When Darius died she manipulates Xerxes so she can achieve her goal and she almost made it. I find it a great movie especially because of the stories behind the characters. The first 300 was manly focused on the battle by the Hotgates. This movie shows the bigger picture, the tactics they us and what drives the characters. This gives an extra dimension to the movie but it isn't exaggerated. Most of the time you see a lot of epic battles so the film is easy to follow.",300 - Rise of an Empire
559,masoud-zakeri-1377,Unreal Story,1,23 March 2014,"The most important part of each movie is the story and i think the story is completely incorrect. i'm not saying that because i'm Persian ,i'm saying that because i want to give correct information. The Persian Empire was the greatest empire in the world even greater than Greeks in Hakhamaneshian Era. There were great kings such as Cyrus The Great , Darius and some of the other Persian kings.surely there were failures and victories for both empire but this story was really far from the reality.sorry to say that but it looks like an ANTI-PERSIAN movie and there are lots of unhappy people out there....better to study some history!!!!!",300 - Rise of an Empire
560,justoneounce,Worse than I thought...,3,23 March 2014,"Is not a sequel but rather events alongside the previous 300 movie, although they are worlds apart in terms of quality. Special effects were cool and all, which makes anything moderately entertaining. The females taking a more warrior like role in the movie, seemed to be about PR making the movie more applicable to the masses, and it made it bad for those of us that actually like that kind of movie. Cheesy as hell,I was feeling a heightened sense of disappointment in the movie all the way though that ridiculously awkward/thrown in sex scene.I read on another review that they thought this was some kind of bad parody of the 300 movie when they went to see it, I thought they were exaggerating, they really were not, bad acting, bad script writing and a general stench of genre/franchise being used to milk us for tickets, without the quality of the previous movies(cough, the hobbit).The film industry really does make a good case just to wait a few months and download stuff for free, why they hell should people pay premium prices for this utter utter cinema garbage.This is my first time posting a review on IMDb, but this movie just made me so angry I wanted to vent a little, DO NOT PAY THEM TO SEE THIS, I WISH I HAD LISTENED TO EVERYONE ELSE.",300 - Rise of an Empire
561,mehmehmehmeh-956-562989,Eva Green's portrayal is a touch of glory in an overall average movie,10,24 March 2014,"Eva Green's Artemisia elevates an overall scant storyline to an enjoyable compilation of gore and intensity. Her character was the seductive, dark highlight of the movie that gave it a real kick. That, alongside all the eye-caressing stunts and the flashy effects, was what really set the battlefield aflame. Of course, Sullivan Stapleton is also getting a 'bravo' for the strong lead he has achieved. Although having the spotlight partly stolen by Green's far more enchanting presence, Stapelton has also managed to recreate the image of a plausible warrior worth believing. The sparkling chemistry between antagonist and protagonist was so overwhelming that it could almost make you forget about the plot... or the utmost lack of it. It is really hard for a director to tell a story of a time that has long since drifted to a past too distant for people to fully comprehend and connect to... and it gets especially hard when there's practically no story to tell. This movie felt like a connect the dots game. Every single 'backstory', every single motivation that was revealed to lurk behind a character's doings, even the idea as to why the war began, it all seemed as though it were a pile of scattered pieces stitched together only so it could justify the bloodshed that we get thrown in every forty seconds. It can really serve to annoy you when you're watching a movie with the thought: ""Hey, these fellas just come up with non-creative ways to show off the CGI tricks they've got up their sleeve"". And thus, the movie becomes more about the flashy blades and ripped guts than anything else, to the point when even a brilliant figure such as Green can only do so much to save the day. If synthetic blood and earth-smashing sound, visual and stunt effects was what this movie was aiming for, then form the bottom of my heart do I say 'mission accomplished'. It did well in areas that required more computer than brains, but when it comes to values, to realistic human behavior and occurrences that serve to move a person, this movie falls flat on its back. It saddens me, because it is just such movies that have the potential of being so much more. Superficial plot and a bunch of shallow characters. Most of them had less depth than a damned Cartoon series. Their actions were so seeing-through, so predictable, that it just made me wonder if it was the same people who worked on the beautifully structured Artemisia that gave life to such empty, meaningless characters such as more than half the figures that we saw. I don't know who decided on the way characters react to death and personal loss, but that someone is clearly yet to be introduced to the real life.Those harsh words being said... I'd also like to point out what a complete disaster the ending has been. If it was an attempt to 'hook' us for the upcoming sequel that is clearly in the makings or at least on its way there, then... I'm not hooked. Having killed off one of the two main figures that move the story onward, they left us with united Greece against one clown of a king who thinks he's freaking Jesus. Yes, well... Good luck with that, my dears. I'm out.",300 - Rise of an Empire
562,msdevious8,Review 300,3,24 March 2014,"This film did not hold my attention, and Stapleton was very ""hammy"" especially a Greek General with an Aussie accent! - Eva Green as ever a delight to watch. The film is 300 (the rise ..), but we hardly saw any of the 300. The music was good and created the atmosphere for the film, and the way it was shot, the look of the film I enjoyed. The characters were not believable - at the point in which Stapleton give speech to a more a less defeated army ""you are free men"" I think I would have got up and left quite frankly.Normally I like watching Lena Headley, especially in Game of Thrones - but I did not really find her right in this film for the part. When she gave her speech at the beginning of the film it did not inspire me.",300 - Rise of an Empire
563,hungryass,This movie sucked,1,24 March 2014,"This movie sucked. It had no real story to it. It was just a bunch of action scenes cut together, then a sex scene, then some more action scenes. Half of the move retold the first movie instead of continuing the story. I was glad my friend got free tickets, because I would have been very mad if I spent any money to watch what was a horrible movie. Don't waste a dollar of your money ever to watch this as you will feel ripped off if you do. The flow of the movie is bad as the story goes. The acting is worse then you can imagine. Even the action/battle scenes are just a exercise in the weird special effects that were developed for this series, with no real thrill to them. Just a bad movie that shouldn't have been made.",300 - Rise of an Empire
564,aparajitamon,Review on 300: Rise of an Empire (2014),1,25 March 2014,I have never imagined the movie 300 will have a sequel like this awful. There are too much talking and planning than real actions. All the planning contain modern speech pattern. No effort of making it authentic and worthy of its time. The movie proves Greek men could see infinite distance in sea and could make eye contact effectively. Only the special effects of blood splattering make up some of its reputations but the actions on sea seems like actions on trucks on road. Actions on sea should have different dynamics and should have detail plans. Looks like makers of film was so in hurry to release. Very weak direction. no where near the previous one. Actors looks like they are waiting to hear 'action' from director to start acting. Cast of Artemisia looks no where near 'ferocious' rather she is sensual. She justifies her appearance in the movie in special segment with Themistocles. Some death scene of close allies reminds me of old movie days when men could say everything they wanted before death. Total wastage of time. Should not have released in theater after the movie premier.,300 - Rise of an Empire
565,johan-qin,"Boring and uneventful, too much talking going on",4,26 March 2014,"I would say this is not worth watching. The original 300 was great and the trailer for this movie was also exciting, so I wanted to watch this. But afterward, I wouldn't recommend this to friends. Boring plot, too much talking, and the sex scene was just completely out of the random and more humorous than action. The chemistry between Demysticles and Artemisia was not stellar, a little awkward at times. This movie could have been made by an average film student (besides the graphics and action) because the plot was that boring. Xerxes didn't do much either, just a little talking here-and-there and a bitchslap. Overall, I give it a 4/10.",300 - Rise of an Empire
566,mizzouram-958-618073,"Hack, Slash, Rinse, Repeat",7,8 July 2014,"I enjoyed the movie. Obviously it's a visual feast, much like the first one. Story wise, however, it's not much different, and it definitely doesn't blaze new trails like the first one did.There are a few new interesting characters, especially Artemisia. The story generally does a pretty good job of explaining everyone's motives and emotions, but as you would probably imagine the story is more about the action that the characters. I think the way they contextualized the Greek universe with the inclusion of other city states casts the first one in an entirely different light. I vaguely remember some grumbles about the nationalistic overtones of the first movie. The addition of the Athenians offers a variable point of view. Definitely recommend it if you liked the first one or if you like the genre. I am not I very hard sell when it comes to action movies, all I ask is that you don't give mt any of those ""Ah c'mon!"" moments. 300: ROAE didn't give me any of those, but it didn't give me much else either.",300 - Rise of an Empire

In the original 300 the messenger asks "" What makes this woman think she can speak among men"" when the queen speaks. In this movie he was the one who found the girl Artemisia. He then taught and trained her. She then becomes a general. Now she is making decisions and leading men. If he thought women to be below men then he would never had trained her nor accepted her as an equal. So I ask Which is it? Women cannot speak among men or they can be in charge of men?

I have to say that I find that people are forgetting that Mythology is just that - Myth! As a movie I found it colorful, action packed and fun to watch but I do not understand the comments from reviewers complaining about historical accuracies? These same reviewers who favor the first film seem to have no problem believing that 300 men defeated several thousand enemies with ease before succumbing to superior numbers and yet find this second movie to be too far fetched? I liked both films for what they were intended to be - fun adult action movies.

My issue is that I will probably have to watch the movie again to give it a more accurate rating. I was so, wow'd I guess you could say, by the visual effects that the events that took place seemed to be a secondary thought. I felt the movie could have easily elaborated a bit more with the story and been longer as it seemed to end a bit abruptly. I can only assume they are setting up for a third installment. My favorite thing, besides the visuals, that this movie did was consistently refer to Leonidas' 300. It kept the name, 300: Rise of an Empire, relevant.I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys action, as it seemed to never end, and beautiful visuals.

One thing I loved about the movie was the decapitation during the epic fight scenes because I enjoy blood being splattered and limbs falling off and to make it even better it happens in slow motion. Another thing that I loved about this movie was the acting because the actors really do fit the character and roll that they play in the story. Lastly, the women in this movie are sexy fine, enough said. I also always recommend waiting for the movie to always come out on DVD or BLU-Ray because I just don't agree with the prices they have at the theaters.

576,monicasieng,300 Rise of an Empire is about Mortal-turned-God Xerxes taking revenge upon his father's death by attempting to take over all of Greece.,5,13 April 2014,"300 Rise of an Empire didn't do much rising from its first film. The leading general of Athens Themistocles tries to unite all of Greece to fight off the Persians but his plans don't come about up until after the first 300 Spartan's die. Artemisia, the leading general for Xerxes army, is a Greek women herself who is out for blood against Greece for what they had done to her and her family in the past. The overall story is war between two countries to resist the Persian invasion that was sparked by the killing of Xerxes father. In a literary perspective, this movie was mediocre. I give it 5 stars out of 10. They spent most of the time trying to connect the story to the first 300 and I believe they did a poor job at it. The plot was so bland and uninteresting that I felt they added Artemsia character to make up for it. It only made it worse. The story felt very sporadic, jumping from one point to another with little climax. The first 300 was an inspiring sad film while the sequel tried to follow in its footsteps but ended up being a time consuming and predictable story line. However they did do something right, the language and dialog fit well with the story and time frame. The characters were believable except Artemisia. In an era where Athen and Spartan men represented what an entire nation was about, they were getting taken down like domino by a small girl? In the first film 300, it took millions to take down the Spartan 300 and in this sequel they couldn't beat a woman who was trained by a nation who cared more for number in army than quality in the army? It didn't match up too well for me and this isn't because I'm sexist or anything, I too am a women but how they portrayed the mighty Spartans and Athenians as pretty much Hercules of their times yet got their asses handed to them by a woman is hard for me to swallow. As for Xerxes, for a mortal turned God, he is pretty useless. I don't recall him doing pretty much anything but walk around in his weird outfit. The main conflict was revenge and trying to overcome invasion and I believe this was resolved towards the end when the Spartans and Athenians finally worked together. The story didn't interest me much but the dramatic and cinematic aspect did. In a dramatic aspect I believe the set, actors/actresses and costume was perfect for the story. The actors did a wonderful job in their acting and the costumes looked appropriate. The setting was very nice and interesting, if there was one thing that I liked about the movie it would be the physical aspect of it, the set, costumes, actors and action. Now in a cinematic perspective, I believe that the director did a wonderful job filming. The angle, lighting and sound effect made the film very enticing and fun to watch. It really brought out the action in the film and although the story was bad I would consider watching it again just for the cinematography. Overall if you're looking to watch a high end movie with great camera quality and action and don't mind too much for the storyline then this is the movie for you. If you go into this with high hopes for this sequel to be anything like the first be prepared to be disappointed.",300 - Rise of an Empire

The number of so called ""blockbusters"" is steadily increasing and so is the number of total drags. Someone should tell these self-proclaimed directors that a movie is something else than just blood, CGI and slow motion. About this slow motion thing, half of what I watched was slow motion. This reduces a 90 minutes to a bare 67 minutes. One should accordingly ask the production for a prorata money refund. Anyway, with or even without slow motion this movie is an epic fail. The storyline is nothing more than ridiculous, the acting as poor as in a cheap B series and the aesthetics so utterly reddish, bloody and artificial that even a SCI-FI channel hardcore fan-boy would be capable of pleasuring himself watching.

Seriously director..Persian suicide bombers are yu insane, evil or on some evil freaks payroll??",300 - Rise of an Empire
583,mihailtossovic,A new movie genre : slow motion movie,1,16 June 2014,"This movie is a complete waste of time. It's awful but there are some awful movies who are fun to watch because you can laugh at them. In "" 300 : Rise of an Empire "" you can't even laugh at this pitiful attempt to show some nice battles.First of all, the movie is glutted with slow-motion scenes. 99% of them are useless. Where's the point in watching a general shouting in slow-motion ? Where's the point in watching a man pointing at something in slow motion ? It literally ruins the whole experience, assuming there is one.The dialogues are lousy. I felt like almost every single sentence was nothing but a reason to include the words "" Sparta "" "" Greek "" or "" Persia "" in it. As if there was something sexy about these words...The actors have no charisma at all, their facial expressions are non-existent, or they don't match with the dialogues which are crap ( have I already mentioned that the dialogues are terrible ? ). Caitlin Carmichael's scene when she cries was probably the only real acting moment ( yes it doesn't last long what did you expect ? ). Otherwise, it just goes from one disappointing to the other.A great Spartan visionnary poet once said "" Do not watch the movie 300:Rise of an Empire ! "" . I think you should all follow his advice.",300 - Rise of an Empire
584,mike-roberts-41-866738,300 Reasons to Hate This Movie ...,1,29 June 2014,"Remember when King Leonidas roared ""This IS SPARTA!!""? Well here's my summary of this sequel in the same exact tone; ""This .. IS ... DREADFULLLLL!!!"" That sums it up, but here's some more detail, since we need ten lines.The main characters (male or female) are hollow, unnatural and have been stripped of their intelligence, weight and substance. None of the artfulness, subtlety or consistency from the first film are present. There's nothing noteworthy or memorable.I'm surprised one of the misguided troglodytes responsible for ruining the sequel to one of my favorite movies forgot to try and improve upon the original by casting Sandra Bullock, Robin Williams and Woody Allen in the lead roles and make the whole thing a romantic comedy.I sense a reciprocal relationship at work here. The more you loved the first film, the more you'll hate the second.",300 - Rise of an Empire
585,petromaniac2020,A sequel to a controversial movie turns to be even worse than its predecessor.,1,4 July 2014,"Absolutely terrible. When I saw the first movie, I was just considering an artistic aspect of the movie and tried to turn a blind eye on all the lacks that the movie had like story twists and unreal character buildings but with the sequel these guys brought it to a whole new level! Aside from the mistakes that we come upon on the story, characters and even known facts, this film fails to provide its audience with a decent experience. In other words, when You see a black person is depicted as a Persian emissary or Persians are dressed like Arabs, You probably come to a conclusion that we are dealing with people that we can not trust. After watching the movie, some may even get the feeling that the movie is intentionally made to humiliate Persians and their great heritage. I have to say that I was disappointed to see a movie like this even being considered by the public let alone be acclaimed.",300 - Rise of an Empire
586,tamjan24,Not bad,7,12 July 2014,"I watched this movie and I was not overly impressed, overall the movie was not bad, the action was very good just like brutality, although I think this movie is too short given the story, the first part was better and I think that most thinks so, too bad, this movie has not fulfilled its maximum. This movie with a story like this requires more effort and work, well done to everyone, but this is supposed to be much better with regard to great effect in this film, such as blood and sound effects, effects during battles at sea were great, breaking the ships looked so powerful, the film is not realistic, but all in all the story is supposed to be longer",300 - Rise of an Empire
587,harsmith-217,One giant video game cutscene.,2,25 July 2014,"There is a reason why I gave this movie two out of ten instead of one. Watching this movie with others allowed me to commiserate with everyone in the room.The overall idea and general story is something that had a lot of potential. The description of this movie coerced me into watching it. This sequel however was a complete and utter disgrace to the original 300 movie, which I enjoyed.The entire movie looked like it was computer generated and felt like a video game as the film went into slow motion for each of several hundred shots of a Greek killing a Persian. I got this feeling even more as the main character rode his horse on a boat that is breaking apart as other ships and the bodies of the men on board fly past; not to mention plenty of fire. There are too many points during this movie where I was thinking, ""That would barely be possible even in physics were removed."" At too many times the CGI is so abundantly obvious one might feel embarrassed for the filmmakers. Everything, I mean everything looks computer generated including the characters. One would think that in an all CGI movie more time would have been spent on doing a better job of generating images. The lines in this movie were rare, and when I did get to hear one I was less then impressed. They were all bad attempts at creating a dramatic feel to the movie.There was more then enough gore. Blood is splattering for nearly three quarters of the movie. Additionally we get plenty of shots of heads without bodies, bodies without heads, and piles of heads in general. Not to mention the occasional variety that comes in the form of limbs without bodies and bodies without limbs. One scene that comes with these less than pleasing sights is one very strange sex scene.Between the bad lines, bad plot, and bad visuals I would definitely recommend you pick a different movie to watch.",300 - Rise of an Empire
588,chrisdedmon,This movie was absolutely worthless,1,17 August 2014,"I have never posted a review before. I want my 2 hours back and the money I spent. I was hoping for something even remotely similar to 300, the epic fight scenes, storyline, heroic sacrifice... What I got was shitty effects, crappy fight choreography, dialog I would expect from porno and if that wasn't enough, they ruined the characters from the first 300. If there was any justice in this world a new Emmy award category would be created for this movie... ""Biggest waste of a storyline"".In closing, to the writers and directors of this movie... F**k you. Go manage a taco bell or something worthy of your skill.",300 - Rise of an Empire

The Film has nothing in Historical objects. Some lies about slaves in Persia, and free people in Greek.Black and uncivilized Persians!!! As you know or not there is no slaves in Persia and it was a free emperor for all races and religions, as in roman times the Jewish people run away to Persia, a safe place. Good Points:Action scenes, Special effects.The Hitler Nazism machine had made perfect movie and advertisement too. so can we be proud of them? this movies are directed and made perfectly, but they are nothing but worthless racism advertisement.",300 - Rise of an Empire

591,sokplataris,Not true history,1,10 April 2015,"The worst and most foolish nonsense historical film I could see. As a Greek I know very well my country's history so let me have my opinion about this film. 1) The hero of Marathon is not Themistokles but Miltiades and this was the cause that Themistokles used to say that Miltiade's success could not let him sleep. 2) Dario was not killed in Marathon but died a few years later in Persia as he was preparing a new army and fleet to attack Greece. 3) Artemisia queen of Alikarnassos was not killed by Themistokles, but after the sea-battle in Salamis returned back to her city. 4) The Spartans took part in the sea-battle of Salamis right from the beginning and had the command of the fleet by the admiral Evryviades, although the real commander of the fleet was Themistokles. Next time that you Americans make a historical film please study well the history first and then make a film. Unless your intention is to destroy through films real history.",300 - Rise of an Empire
592,feartotti,is lie,1,27 October 2015,"i from Iran. i did not use Comments emotional. i see this movie three time. this movie is a lie. and not Historical basis. Rise of an Empire is a joke compared to the original and a huge let down for anybody who appreciates good (or even visually appealing) movies. The story is unnecessary complicated but doesn't make much sense. While the visuals in the first movie seemed stylized and fresh, ROAE seems cheap, the 3D never really impresses (enough to justify it's use) and I had a hard time finishing the movie, partly because I couldn't believe how they could do this to the franchise...and how Zack Snyder is still part of this...I don't think he sleeps well these days.one king of the world.that not fire city after. victory is Cyrus the great. and his child.Xerxes not Destruction the Athens but Alexander the Great fire the Persepolis and kill the Peoples.fire the book.he want fire history of Persia but he loseeuro and world if still a live all for. Cyrus... Viva Cyrus....",300 - Rise of an Empire
593,bigsaltynuts,What a steaming pile of horse crap!,1,28 April 2015,"The reviews here are more entertaining. Where do I start? I'm no expert by any stretch of the imagination and I could be wrong, but do the Greek characters in this movie seem more like Anglos with very bad accents? Overdid the CGI blood and limbs. Dialog was cheesy and at times cringe worthy.Ships rammed. Ships burning. Ships sinking. Ship blown up by suicide bomber. Yes, you read that right. The last straw was when a horse burst forth to bring death and destruction to the Persian navy.My review ends here, because this was the point where I just gave up. I just couldn't make myself watch anymore even though it was so close to the end.However, I did rewind back to the most memorable scene. Thank you Eva Green for not making it a complete waste of my time.",300 - Rise of an Empire
594,danny001,Did not think it was possible to screw up the story more than the original,1,26 July 2014,"That they miscast the leader of the Athenians at Marathon is bad enough, but the entire story line is a slap in the face to one of the greatest military stories in history. They mess up everything about the story including the most salient fact that in the end, it was the Athenian navy that won the war and Themistocles was the architect of the plan, not some bad ass riding a horse through the water. Both this and the original are insults to story telling. No, this is all about guys doing crunches, which is why the Hoplites once again have abandoned their armor for leather Speedos. And anyone who buys into anything about Spartans talking about freedom needs to buy a bridge from me. Let me put it this way, this is so disjoint that even watching it to go MST-3000 on it is no fun.",300 - Rise of an Empire
595,lovedthehate-97725,Not worth it,2,4 January 2016,"If you don't have OCD about having to watch all sequels to a movie you've seen, then I don't recommend watching this. All that was in this movie was racism, death, and some cool sounding lines in between. This is like something out of a 10 year old'a mind. Everyone has muscles like rocks, the enemy is a sexy girl, and there is one handicapped guy, that is just there to add a freak to the movie. Sometimes we return to Sparta and even Sparta is boring. There are so many effects and filters that you cannot help but wonder if all this was shot in front of a green wall or something. All in all, really really lame cash-grab that you should avoid or watch if you just want to look at something and just feel empty and apathetic to rest of the world while drooling all over. That is what happened to me. I wanted to commit suicide to this movie.",300 - Rise of an Empire

597,seha-37008,This movie does not deserve to have a number 300 in it's title.,2,9 April 2016,"At one point in time I thought this is a porn video. Really poor use of words almost through the entire movie, except a couple of scenes like the one where Themistokles encourages his soldiers and fellow men to fight one final navy battle as free men of Greece. Eva Green is just not up for this role and most of the other actors are not man enough to even star in this movie. However, I like the scene where Themistokles dreams about the giant sea beast devouring the fallen men of Athens. It shows good graphics and contribution to showing the Greek mythology, but on the other hand I don't know what the director was thinking regarding the blood in every fight scene. In conclusion, the movie cannot be epic if you can count all the great scenes in it on the fingers of only one hand. Compared to the original 300 movie, this does not deserve to have the same number in it's title.",300 - Rise of an Empire
598,nireasgkinis,a b splatter Sci-Fi movie,1,20 March 2016,"From historical aspect this movie is completely incorrect. Wrong characters, wrong story. just blood and nonsense. some examples to understand this follow: 1) Sparta has no sea and never, never had a navy!!!! 2) Artemisia was the one who said Xerxis to not to fight in Salamina, but he ignored her so he lost the wore. 3) Artemisia did not die during the battle of Salamina, she killed her self much later. 4) the Salamina battle did not unify the Hellenic (greek) kingdoms, it was a victory of Athens, which made Athens the greatest kingdom-state of the Hellenic world... and so on... very very bad movie. watch in only if you like splatter movies",300 - Rise of an Empire

600,harnekalsharif,Propaganda with love from Israel,1,13 December 2016,Given the Israeli Jewish producer and director I am not surprised by this movie's portrayal of good smart brave (western) Greeks vs backward retarded dump terrorists (east or more like Middle East) and obvious indications to Muslims.Some examples include suicide bombing by Persians all dressed in black with turbans and outfits identified with Arabs and Muslims and shown as backward barbaric with only strength only being their shear numbers of course a dozen Persians gets killed by a every Greek kid simply farting! The Greeks are brave and civilized and the so called good guys. And the real sad thing is it is based on a true story!It's a shame propaganda and agenda driven movies get spurned out so regularly and the masses get brainwashed and 'de-humanise' Middle East without even knowing it.

So awful that I created an account to warn others. The only character in this movie that generated any resonance with the audience is Artemesia. The movie was an excuse to use 300- esque graphics without any of the story or heart. You actually root for the Persians as it was really the only story-building the movie did. You saw how Xerxes rose to power, but very little about our protagonist. As such, I found myself pitying the Persians and found the Greek characters lacking any dimensions",300 - Rise of an Empire

Was apparent from start that the Director focused mainly on (very fake looking) CGI blood splattering towards the audience and constantly floating artifacts (cinders and the like) targeted solely for the 3D experience. Far more so than any compelling characters, story and/or cinematography. In 2D it looked washed out and fake.The characters were too shallow to become invested in. Even when Athens was burning you were like 'so what'. The first 300 was visually *beautiful* even in 2D with a compelling story where you came out of the theater inspired like after an old 'Rocky' movie. This one, not so much.",300 - Rise of an Empire
