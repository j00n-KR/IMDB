0,MartinHafer,"Cerebral....sort of like an episode of ""Masterpiece Theatre"".",8,13 September 2013,"Okay, I'll admit it...my summary is completely ridiculous! ""Escape From New York"" is anything but cerebral or sophisticated. Instead, it's a rather absurd little sci-fi film that actually manages to be awfully entertaining despite being utterly ridiculous. Much of this is because the film takes itself so very seriously--and this heightens the campy atmosphere and makes the film a lot of fun.This John Carpenter film is set in the near future. Lawlessness has taken hold until society has come up with a strange solution--to turn Manhattan Island into a giant prison. This 'prison' is really just a dumping ground--a dumping ground where there are no guards and no rules--just a weird self-created society of scum.When a terrorist hijacks Air Force One and crashes it into this city, the President is able to use an escape pod--but he lands in the middle of this hellish city. For some odd reason, instead of sending in the Marines or the Navy Seals, they send in one man--'Snake' Plissken (Kurt Russell). Plissken is ridiculously overplayed by Russell--and that adds to the fun. I am pretty sure he didn't take himself very seriously and the viewer certainly can't! Plissken is sort of like Rambo and Clint Eastwood (Russell REALLY had the Eastwood voice down pat)--but even more indestructible! Now Plissken is NOT the hero type. He himself is a convicted criminal but he's also a war hero. To convince him to take the assignment, they not only promise him his freedom but his life. You see, this is because they implanted a nanoprobe into him that will kill him if the assignment isn't completed in 24 hours! Can he do it? What do you think? As I said above, Plissken is played in such an overly serious and over-the-top manner that the film is really a hoot to watch. Also, the film is very original even if it is silly. A few other things I loved were the faux computer graphics (done amazingly well considering everything--see the IMDb trivia for more on this), the scene towards the end of the President having his revenge on 'The Duke' and the incredible soundtrack (by Carpenter himself). All in all, a dumb but incredibly cool guilty pleasure. And sometimes you just have to let your brain relax and watch something mindlessly fun.",Escape from New York
1,bkoganbing,A Snake Saves The Free World,7,31 March 2008,"One of the things I like about Escape From New York is the fact that the lead character is named Snake. It was a snake who tricked mankind out of paradise and in John Carpenter's world a snake is what saves the free world's leader.Of course the free world ain't all that free any more. In Escape From New York crime has risen to astronomic proportions, so much so that the entire island of Manhattan is now one big prison surrounded by the National Police Force. We now have one of those, I assume this is what the Federal Bureau of Investigation has morphed into. And the USA is at war, with who they don't say. But the enemies of the new American way of life have seized Air Force One and crash it in a suicide move worthy of what we see from the Middle East. But President Donald Pleasance, who looks a whole lot like Peter Sellers's president from Dr. Strangelove. He escapes in a pod that crashes on the prison island of Manhattan.What to do, but rescue Pleasance. And the guy that police chief Lee Van Cleef has in mind is Snake Plissken, former war hero, now career criminal with a Rooster Cogburn patch and played by Kurt Russell. To make sure that Russell doesn't double-cross him, Van Cleef implants a couple of mini bombs in his veins, just enough for him to bleed out when detonated in seconds. And they will detonate 22 hours from the point implantation. The rest of the film is Russell's rescue of President Pleasance who is being held by the head of the criminal society that has grown up in Manhattan headed by Isaac Hayes. Russell gets some help and some betrayal from folks like Adrienne Barbeau, Ernest Borgnine, Harry Dean Stanton and Season Hubley. To see who does what, watch the film.Escape From New York is a fun science fiction film that's attained a cult status of sorts. Certainly the world has not quite developed as John Carpenter envisioned it for 1997.Or has it?",Escape from New York
2,Leofwine_draca,"I like Carpenter, but this film's overrated",6,8 July 2016,"John Carpenter's science fiction film has long been regarded as a cult classic, but after finally seeing it I find it difficult to see what all the fuss was about. What starts off as an interesting premise is wasted in a film which feels a little disjointed, and is more about visuals than anything else. It's just one sequence after another with little to recommend it in terms of special effects, acting ability, even pacing. For movie fans, there are plenty of reasons to watch ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK as it's not all that bad. The first third of the film is rather good, but the rest just lacks in momentum and comes across as slightly limp and lifeless.Kurt Russell looks cool with his eye patch and bulging muscles but doesn't have the interior toughness he brings to THE THING. The rest of the cast is exemplary, although opportunities for actual acting are limited. Mixing such old-name stars as Ernest Borgnine and Lee Van Cleef with more recent familiar faces like Harry Dean Stanton and Isaac Hayes, the whole cast really is something to die for. But...while Van Cleef is good as the chief guard, Borgnine is fairly annoying as a jovial taxi driver. Stanton is given little to do apart from walk around in a white coat and look moody, while the sole purpose for Adrienne Barbeau to be in the film is to wear a low-cut dress. Isaac Hayes is a charismatic but not-at-all fearsome villain, and Donald Pleasence is odd as the president.The action sequences, when they come, are fairly exciting, but not memorable. The best bit is in the opening where Russell is chased by a gang of mutants, this brings to mind Carpenter's earlier ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 with the grubby locations and faceless rabble of murderers (in this case cannibals). As a plus, the film does offer some excellent set design, with streets full of broken cars, rubbish etc. This kind of ""barren wasteland inhabited by mutants"" was the basis for many later rip-offs and cash-ins, especially by the Italians. The only sad thing is that while ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK could have been something brilliant, it's average at best due to a lack of ideas and originality. Not one to go out of your way for, and far surpassed in quality by many other Carpenter movies, including ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 and THE THING.",Escape from New York
3,SnoopyStyle,John Carpenter classic,8,10 September 2013,"It's the future 1997. Manhattan has been turned into a maximum security prison. The President had to do an emergency ejection, but lands inside the prison. Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is coerced into bringing the President and his cargo out. Once inside, Snake gets help from Cabbie (Ernest Borgnine), and Maggie (Adrienne Barbeau).John Carpenter creates one of the most original movie and an iconic fantasy world. 'Escape from New York' is a cult classic. This was about the beginning of the end of the '70s crime ridden NY paranoia. The style is no longer realism but rather surreal. It is the best of campy adventure. Kurt Russell creates an iconic character. Don't come in expecting realism. Come in expecting a fun time.",Escape from New York
4,Hitchcoc,Carpenter Meets the Snake,7,2 December 2016,"This movie could make your head explode, literally. New York City has become a big penal colony where the works of the worst are being watched by machine gunned guards. They build a society of their own based on their own traits, murder and mayhem. All is going smoothly until the President's plane goes down in this mess and he needs to be rescued. A guy named Snake, played by Kurt Russell, is sent in to quickly rescue POTUS. With his eye patch and disheveled look, he fits in right away. He has all the necessary qualities to do the job, but he has a serious time line. He will die if he does not complete his task within a prescribed time. It's a pretty idiotic premise, I guess. Why such a short time? The star of this show is the world created by Carpenter and his people. The nouveau prison is really interesting to look at. There is an overriding blackness to the whole thing. Russell's smirking Snake is also pretty good.",Escape from New York
5,claudio_carvalho,The Timeless Cult Adventure of the Badass Anti-Hero Snake Plissken,10,17 July 2013,"In 1997, Manhattan has been transformed in the New York Maximum Security Penitentiary, where criminals are sent in life sentence. When the Air Force One crashes in Manhattan with the president of the USA (Donald Pleasence) that is traveling to a summit with other leaders, the prison dean Hauk (Lee Van Cleef) proposes a deal to the convicted one-eyed bank robber Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell). If he rescues the president and his tape in less than 23 hours, he would be granted pardon. In order to guarantee full commitment of Snake Plissken, Hauk lures him and injects a lethal capsule in his blood that will dissolve in the scheduled time.Snake Plissken uses a small glider to land one the roof of the World Trade Center. Soon he finds that the tracking device was removed from the president. When he meets the taxi driver Cabbie (Ernest Borgnine), he learns that the warlord The Duke (Isaac Hayes) has captured the president. Now Snake Plissken has to team-up with his former partner Brain (Harry Dean Stanton), who has double-crossed him in the past, and his squeeze Maggie (Adrienne Barbeau) to rescue the president and save his own life.""Escape from New York"" is the timeless cult adventure of the badass one- eyed anti-hero Snake Plissken by John Carpenter. It is amazing how this movie has not aged and even after watching it so many times, I do not get tired of it. Kurt Russell has a fantastic shape and is perfect in the role of the tough Snake Plissken. The president dressed with blonde wig and with cosmetics and his rage in the end against The Duke seems to indicate that something else had happened to him besides losing his thumb. The movie has a dream cast and also a wonderful music score. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Fuga de Nova York"" (""Escape from New York"")Note: On 01/12/2017, I saw this film again.Note: On 14 Sep 2020, I saw this film again.",Escape from New York
6,kosmasp,Moral High Ground,8,16 November 2020,"Or is it low ground? Sometimes it is tough to tell. Especially with a character Like Snake Plissken. Call him Snake please (and towards the end you'll know one of the reasons why you should do so) ... maybe even more than one reason actually. But one vivid one that you won't be able to miss.Due to the low budget nature of the movie, certain things look dated nowadays, like matte paintings especially at the beginning and even more so in 4K resolution. I'm not trying to nit pick, just telling it like it is. Of course, when it comes to where Snakes loyalties lie ... or how he gets duped into doing something as risky as saving the president (I mean just suspend your disbelief). One other thing that struck me as odd or at least a bold move, was to almost not show our main character for the first 15 minutes. He's like a side character, shown and walked to a prison ... but other than that? But there is a whole scene that was cut out (was featured as bonus on the discs I own) ... but that was deemed confusing and not necessary. For the better I reckon, to still have that mystery surrounding our main guy as it is.If you don't mind the budget restrictions, some predictability and some cliches (which back then probably weren't) or the anarchic nature of it ... here's an Anti Hero to cheer for! Even if he doesn't save the girl that is being assaulted ... no one is perfect, right?",Escape from New York
7,classicsoncall,"""The rules are simple - once you go in, you don't come out.""",7,12 November 2015,"Ah yes, Snake Plissken. No matter how much time goes by I can always remember the name of the main protagonist in ""Escape From New York"". I don't know that Kurt Russell would have been my first choice to portray the infamous Snake, but he sure goes at it with gusto, and that huge cobra tattoo on his stomach really adds to the flavor of the character. Throw in the eye patch as a bonus and you have a real bad-ass anti-hero.What really made the picture for me was the wrestling ring appearance of one of the all time great mat villains, Ox Baker. Can you imagine meeting up with this guy in an alley someplace? I don't recall hearing his name Slag in the story but it seems perfectly appropriate. A slag-heap of a man in a slag-heap of a city that becomes a prison for all the misfit criminals in the country.There's a great supporting cast here with the likes of Lee Van Cleef, Harry Dean Stanton and Adrienne Barbeau. This doesn't seem like the kind of picture Donald Pleasance would have wound up in but he holds his own among the derelicts of a dystopian Manhattan in the way distant future of 1997 from the film's vantage point. I guess it's a relief that we haven't descended to this type of anarchy in the twenty second century yet but there are days when it seems like we're getting close. Too bad about The Brain (Stanton) and Maggie (Barbeau), they should have made it to the end of the picture.",Escape from New York
8,gavin6942,Great Cult Fun,8,19 April 2014,"In 1997, when the US President (Donald Pleasence) crashes into Manhattan, now a giant maximum security prison, a convicted bank robber (Kurt Russell) is sent in for a rescue.If you love seeing a classic science fiction film with plenty of John Carpenter regulars, including Tom Atkins, Adrienne Barbeau and more... this is your film. Vastly superior to its sequel, this outlandish plot actually has some semblance of reality: from the time this film was made to 2009, the prison population of the United States more than tripled. We have not created specific cities for criminals yet, but it makes a certain level of sense (and may not be far off from how Australia was started).The story is really just all kinds of fun, though, and I am not the least bit surprised that it has gained cult status. Most of Carpenter's films have, but this one may be even bigger than his others as far as a broad appeal.",Escape from New York
9,lee_eisenberg,There's a pizzeria in Portland named after this movie.,10,5 December 2005,"John Carpenter had looked at urban decay in ""Assault on Precinct 13"", but took it to a whole new level with ""Escape from New York"". In 1997, war hero-turned-convict Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is hired to rescue the president (Donald Pleasance) from New York City, now a maximum security prison (to accommodate the crime wave that swept the country in 1988).This is certainly one cool movie. Wearing an eye-patch, Kurt Russell looks like the ultimate bad-ass. And mark my words, that's exactly what Snake is. As for New York as a maximum security prison: it's any bad mother****er's wet dream. And the other cast members: Isaac Hayes (yes, the ""Shaft"" singer and Chef on ""South Park"") plays the Duke, who is in complete control of the Big Apple; Ernest Borgnine plays Cabbie, who knows exactly how to survive in this most dangerous land; Harry Dean Stanton plays Brain, one of Snake's former acquaintances; and Adrienne Barbeau plays Maggie, Brain's hubby.Oh, and I noted that there's a pizzeria here in Portland called Escape from New York. It's located on NW 23rd St, if you ever come to Portland.",Escape from New York
10,jboothmillard,Escape from New York,6,7 October 2009,"I recognised the title and knew the leading star, and when I confirmed it was John Carpenter (Halloween, The Thing) directing (and making the music), there was no way I would miss it. Set in the future, 1997, New York City was turned into a maximum security prison for criminals to be for life, and any way or out of the city is mined and walled. On his way to a conference, the President (Donald Pleasence) has Air Force One crash, forcing him to eject, landing in a New York building. Police Force Commissioner Bob Hauk (For a Few Dollars More's Lee Van Cleef) knows that one-eyed prisoner Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is the only man capable of bringing the President out alive. To make sure he does actually do the job, Plissken has explosive devices put into him that will detonate in 24 hours, and obviously when the job is done he will be saved and get freedom. So begins a search for the President, with the help of characters like Cabbie (Ernest Borgnine), Maggie (Adrienne Barbeau), and eventually Brain (Harry Dean Stanton). They do eventually find the President, being held hostage by ruthless warlord The Duke (Isaac Hayes), it is just a question of will Plissken either get the President out before his time is up, or will he try to escape from New York. It may not be a fast moving story, but it does have some eye-catching stuff, like the special effects and its slick dark tone, it is an action thriller to be liked. Good!",Escape from New York
11,ccthemovieman-1,"Grungy, Dated But Entertaining",6,5 June 2006,"""Grungy"" and 'entertaining"" are two words that perhaps might best describe this John Carpenter-directed box-office success from 1981. Kurt Russell made himself into a macho movie star by putting a patch over his eye and playing ""Snake Plissken."" His job is to get into New York City ,which in the ""distant"" year of 1997 was turned into a maximum security prison, and rescue the President of the U.S. who had crashed there.The whole atmosphere of this is sleazy except for one character: a cab driver, played by Ernest Borgnine. Adrienne Barbeau is in here strictly to be eye candy. The grungy characters even included the President of the United States in a very unrealistic portrayal by Donald Pleasance.This was somewhat ""cool"" when it came out but the special-effects are so bad the film is laughable right now. It almost looks a like a ""B"" sci-fi film from the '50s. The Manhattan skyline is a cardboard cutout! Oh, well, the story is still very interesting, so if you can overlook things it's still an enjoyable 99 minutes.",Escape from New York
12,Tweekums,An '80s classic,9,11 September 2019,"This film is set in a not too distant future, the island on Manhattan has been turned into a maximum security prison. There are no guards inside but nobody is allowed to leave. Then one day Air Force One is hijacked; the president ejects in an escape pod which land in the middle of New York. He is captured by people who threaten to kill him if security forces enter the city. There is a matter of urgency as he is carrying a tape which is essential for peace talks taking place in twenty four hours. Snake Plissken, a former special forces hero who has been convicted of various crimes is given an opportunity; get the President out in time or be killed by an explosive device installed in his neck. He flies into the city and makes some allies who inform him that the President is being held by a man known as The Duke who appears to rule the prison-city... getting to him and rescuing him within the lime limit won't be easy.I really enjoyed this film; it may be rather cheesy at times but it is still a classic. It provides plenty of excitement and unforced humour. Snake Plissken is a fine protagonist and Kurt Russell does a fine job in the role. There is solid support from Ernest Borgnine, as Cabbie; Adrienne Barbeau, as Maggie; and Harry Dean Stanton, as Brain; two people who help Snake. Isaac Hayes is fun as The Duke; a delightfully over the top character who drives a car complete with chandeliers and a disco ball! Donald Pleasence adds a touch of class as the president and Lee Van Cleef is fun as police chief Hauk. Despite being made in 1981 and being set in 1997 the story still feels relevant with terrorists and a discontent with politics. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of eighties action.",Escape from New York
13,ma-cortes,Thrilling and spectacular rescue in Manhattan become in a top-security prison,7,18 December 2006,"We are in the year 1997, the Air Force One is hijacked by a band of revolutionaries and the President (Donald Pleasence : Halloween) is dropped into a capsule crashing on a nearly deserted Manhattan, which is an island turned into a maximum security jail and finds itself under siege by violent gangs . A previous war hero named Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) gone rebel must effect a daring recapture and bring up the President in twenty four hours , but an interior device (installed by Lee Van Cleef and Tom Atkins) blowing him up . Snake must retrieve him and along the way facing off a lot of villains like the Duke (Isaac Hayes : Shaft's musician) and others .

The world's greatest leader is a hostage in the most dangerous place on Earth. Now only the deadliest man alive can save him . As New York City is now a maximum security prison . Breaking out is impossible . Breaking in is insane. New York City has Become the Only Maximum Security Prison for the Entire Country. Once You go In, You don't Come Out... Until Today.The film is a comic-book plenty of action , chills , fun , adventures , thriller and susprise-filled entertainment . Magnificent plethora of characters with exceptional performances for its entire cast . Kurt Russell as a tough and valiant renegade is terrific . Lee Van Cleef was hired by Carpenter and Debra Hill (the producer) for their admiration on spaghetti Western's hero roles. Adrienne Barbeau (at the time Carpenter's wife) is gorgeous , her role (similar to The Fog) was specifically written with her in mind . The picture contains an imaginative and memorable production design by Joe Alves (Jaws) . Colorful cinematography by Dean Cundey . John Carpenter also composed the eerie and atmospheric music score as well as he did in Halloween . The movie will probably like to action enthusiasts and Kurt Russell fans . It's followed by an inferior sequel by the same protagonist actor , Kurt Russell , and director Carpenter : ¨Escape from L.A.¨.

14,BA_Harrison,It's 1997 and The Big Apple is rotten to the core.,7,6 April 2011,"Ex-war hero turned criminal Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) has less than 24 hours to rescue the President of the USA (Donald Pleasance) from the prison hell that is Manhattan Island, after which the small explosive charges that have been planted in his neck will rupture his arteries.Escape from New York, a typically early-80s dystopian vision of the near future, has an undeniably cool concept, a great cast (that includes Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, Harry Dean Stanton, Isaac Hayes and Adrienne Barbeau's breasts), a memorable anti-hero, Russell doing his best Clint Eastwood impersonation, and a decent director in John Carpenter, who had already proved himself more than capable of producing a classic with Assault on Precinct 13 and Halloween.Despite these quality ingredients, though, the magic just doesn't work as well as perhaps it should, and the film, although often very impressive to look at thanks to excellent set design and Dean Cundey's marvellous cinematography, fails to generate much in the way genuine excitement.The blame for this must be attributed to Carpenter's measured approach, which effectively mirrors Plissken's unflappable demeanour, but results in less than scintillating action scenes. Thanks to this overly leisurely pace, which is further accentuated by Carpenter's emotionless synth score, Escape from New York lacks the much needed sense of urgency that should have been generated by Snake's desperate situation.For once, this is a film I'd actually like to see get the remake treatment. 6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",Escape from New York
15,moonspinner55,"""Are ya gonna kill me now, Snake?"" ... ""I'm too tired. Maybe later.""",6,29 March 2009,"One of director and co-writer John Carpenter's best-sustained pieces of counterculture pop-trash, an adventure with enough plot for three pictures, and yet pared down in the final act to a snatch-&-grab which is completely satisfying. In 1997, nearly ten years after the U.S. crime rate has risen to astronomical proportions, a walled-up Manhattan Island has been deemed the world's prison center; after the President ejects himself from a hijacked Air Force One and ends up amongst the nasty, scurrilous gangs, master criminal Snake Plissken is assigned to rescue him. The catch: he has less than 24 hours to do it. Although the effects and computer graphics are badly dated, Carpenter's film blessedly moves instead of preaching...and surprises by not making Kurt Russell's Plisskin an indestructible hero (already wearing a patch over one eye, like a pirate, the guy gets a real beating). Interestingly cast, and with good performances here and there (particularly from Harry Dean Stanton as nerdy Brain, who has connections with icy-cool villain Isaac Hayes, and tough, bosomy Adrienne Barbeau as Brain's fiercely loyal girlfriend). Russell is so low-keyed he barely flinches when he gets hit in the leg with an arrow, and Donald Pleasance as the President doesn't even try to disguise his British accent, but the cast works uniformly well together, overcoming the deficiencies with the budget and the exhausting opening set-up. Followed by a sequel in 1996. **1/2 from ****",Escape from New York
16,Quinoa1984,"a hybrid of punk, spaghetti western, and futuristic action picture",10,28 January 2006,"John Carpenter's Escape from New York is, up there with Assault on Precinct 13 one of his real 'cult' films, however with a larger budget and stars. And it was a box-office success, but people don't go to it as quickly as they might Halloween or The Thing. It's an action film, but at times there's very little action, with wide-angle lenses pitting Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) in the streets of Manhattan like he was a gunslinger. It is then, in turn, a tip-of-the-hat to Leone's films, as not only Russell does a good, cool, if not brilliant, kind of channeling-Eastwood-performance, but also Lee Van Cleef co-stars in a big role. It's also a futuristic movie, but in a future with only sparks of technology, with much of the story rooted amid the 'crazies', a band of underground criminals and degenerates that have a run over the city. It even has a pinch of black-exploitation via the casting of Isaac Hayes as 'The Duke', the bad-ass antagonist. It combines all of this to make for a movie that takes an 'A' budget and a few old-time character actors all for one thing- attitude.Snake Plissken isn't as mythic and mysterious as Eastwood's 'Man-with-no-name', and at times one wonders if he's more supposed to be like a super-hero than an anti-hero. But it is a character that can keep this story, which is extremely B-movie style (save the president before the world ends, you're the only one, don't mess it up, that kind of story), moving along without too much interference. It's actually so simple a story, and the events that happen in the film so relatively simple (though the last half hour has a couple of genre-style surprises it needs the elevation of the style to make it more than just curiously average fare. This style, again on loan from westerns and widescreen sci-fi stories, doesn't interfere with the story, but gives it a slightly bigger scope. It's also fascinating how little of the music Carpenter uses for the film- the sweet, electronic theme of the film the exception- to just up the thrills by either on-the-set noises (of the ambiance of the dark Manhattan corners and 'bumps' in the night), or little touches of unconventional music. I wonder if Carpenter, in general, had influence on movies that would follow in the years after this with the use of music like this.I liked Escape from New York, and liked it for what it was (and a hilarious ending indeed), though it's not necessarily any 'great' movie. It's the kind of flick I would love to catch again with a bunch of friends with some beers, maybe playing drinking games with how many times someone says the near catch phrase of the picture- ""Snake...I thought you were dead.""

They simply built a wall around it and declared it a maximum security prison. The natural separation from surrounding land helped, geographically. This is explained in a prologue.

Dark, dangerous, often deserted-looking, and very naughty...Our ""hero"" is beautifully trussed, er, tressed Kurt Russell (as ""Snake"" Plissken).

18,BandSAboutMovies,Perfect!,10,2 June 2021,"Seriously, this article should just say, ""This is the best movie of all time"" and nothing else.It is absolutely impossible for me to be impartial to this movie. How can you be? A western set inside a destroyed New York City that's been converted into a prison for the worst people in America being invaded by someone even worse than all of them put together to rescue a President with only 24 hours to do it? Yeah, they don't make them like this anymore.Actually, they never did. This is a once in a lifetime film.AVCO Embassy Pictures wanted Charles Bronson or Tommy Lee Jones to play Snake. Kurt Russell was still seen as a Disney kid. But Carpenter saw in him someone who could be a Clint Eastwood-like mercenary who lived for the next minute and nothing else.The film slams us into 1997, a time and place where the world is constantly at war. As the President of the United States flies to a peace summit in Hartford, Connecticut, Air Force One is hijacked and crashed, with the President (Donald Pleasence!) being taken to New York City and captured by the Duke of New York City (Isaac Hayes!).The police would never make it on a rescue mission. That's when Police Commissioner Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef) gets an idea. Instead of sending in a military force, he sends Snake into the Hell on Earth that is New York City to save the President. If he completes the rescue mission, he gets a full pardon. And if not, well...he was going to die anyway. To keep Snake from running, he's injected with micro-explosives that will kill him in 22 hours.Driven in an armored cab by Ernest Borgnine to Harold ""Brain"" Hellman (Harry Dean Stanton!) to attempt to find the leader of the free world, Snake encounters all manner of enemies that he outwits, outfights and outright murders to complete his mission, including an incredible fight with pro wrestler Ox Baker (originally it was going to be Bruiser Brody, but he was in Japan at the time). Plus, you get appearances by Carpenter regulars like Adrienne Barbeau, George Wilbur, Dick Warlock, Nancy Stephens, George ""Buck"" Flower, John Strobel, Tom Atkins, Charles Cyphers and a voice cameo by Jamie Lee Curtis.At the end, the President tells Snake he can have anything he wants. Snake only wants to know how he feels about everyone that had to die so that he could live. The President barely conveys gratitude as Snake walks away in disgust.You can see echoes of Snake in nearly every post-apocalyptic movie that came after this film. In a perfect world, there would have been way more than just one sequel to this movie.",Escape from New York
19,Coventry,Cult monument with a dream cast!,8,11 August 2005,"Nearly 25 years and an endless amount of viewings later, John Carpenter's ""Escape from NY"" still ranks high among the chosen few, quintessential cult films of the 80's. This is, simply put, one of the coolest productions ever with legendary characters, ingenious plot and pitch-black humor. Kurt Russell, with eye patch and nihilistic 'you-don't-like-it-go-to-hell' attitude, plays the role of his life as anti-hero Snake Plissken, recruited by his authority-nemesis Bob Hauk to bring back the American president who crashed with his plane in New York. One problem though; ever since crime rose with 400% in 1987, New York has become one giant and demarcated prison where criminals determine their own ""civilization"". Offered no other choice, Snake infiltrates NY for his mission and for a personal race against the clock. Especially the first sixty minutes of this movie are terrific, since there constantly is the introduction of new and imaginative characters. Class-A actors play all these utterly cool characters, which makes it even more memorable! Apart from Kurt Russell, ""Escape from New York"" also stars icons like Lee Van Cleef (""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly""), Isaac Hayes (""Truck Turner""), Donald Pleasance (""Halloween"") and Harry Dean Stanton (""Repo Man""). Even the smaller supportive roles are well distributed, with the underrated Tom Atkins as Van Cleef's sidekick and Adrienne Barbeau in a very sexy part. The downfall of America's number one city is atmospherically portrayed and Carpenter's own music score creates an excellent mood of despair. The action sequences are impressively photographed and John Capenter professionally camouflages that his film is, in fact, and independent production. My only slightly negative remark is that the story should have had a better, more explosive climax. Particularly because the first hour is so great, the ending seems quite tame. But, what the hell, this movie is a must for every film lover! In 1996, Carpenter also made ""Escape from L.A."" and even though it's good entertainment, it can't compete with ""NY"".",Escape from New York
20,michaelRokeefe,"Taut, dangerous rescue of a high profile hostage.",6,8 November 2001,"John Carpenter takes part in the script writing, conducts the pacesetting score and directs this action thriller. In the late 90s, Manhattan Island of New York is a maximum security national prison. The President of the United States(Donald Pleasence)is forced to crash land inside the prison walls. Lee Van Cleef plays the head of the military  that guards the prison walls and chooses the perfect man to rescue the President from the criminals that now run their own island world. Former honored war hero Snake Plissken(Kurt Russell)turned criminal/bank robber is offered a full pardon and release upon getting the President to safety.This is not the greatest action movie you will ever see, but I doubt if you could forget it after watching it. Pretty intense when it needs to be and enough conflict and action to keep your interest. The fantastic score really inflicts the pace and action. Russell is not over powering as Snake, but comes across cool and in charge. I really liked his Clint Eastwood type whispering reply...""Call me Snake."" And oh yes, the line ""Get a new President."" Russell's macho swagger and ruthless attitude defines Snake perfectly. Van Cleef clever and calm, could have called his part in over a cell phone. Pleasence to me is an odd choice to play the leader of the free world.Visually watching the hero land a glider on top of the World Trade Center is now pretty awesome in the light of what has recently happened(September 11, 2001). Ernest Borgnine has a notable, but small role as the energetic cab driver. Look out for Issac Hayes...The Duke of New York. Adrienne Barbeau and Season Hubley are little more than decoration. The whole cast makes this film look effortless and it is worth yours. ""Call me, Snake.""",Escape from New York

22,hitchcockthelegend,"A Snake, a Brain, a Cabbie, a Duke and the President Of The USA,",9,16 October 2008,"It's 1997 and Manhattan Island is a walled off prison, during the flight of Air Force One, the president's plane is taken over by a terrorist and the president ejects out in the safety pod. Sadly for him he lands right in the middle of Manhattan Island, when an armed unit lands inside the walls they are told that the president has been taken hostage and they must get out of their prison ASAP. At a loss what to do, the authorities decide to send one man in alone, ex war hero turned criminal, Snake Plissken, not only does he have to contend with surviving the incredibly hostile prison, he also has a time bomb implanted in his body that, should he not get the president out safely within 24 hours, will explode and mean no more Snake Plissken!.Made in 1981 and set in 1997, it's safe to say John Carpenter is not the best predictor of the future around. However his vision of a future where America has thrown all it's criminals on one island, where they create their own society out of harms way, has to rank as an incredibly adroit piece of work. This place is grim and deadly, the flotsam and jetsam of society thrust together in this bleak and desolate place of class separation. What Carpenter has achieved with his usual minimal budget allowance is a smouldering sci-fi classic that may be as daft as they come, but it pulses with cool and cheekily slaps you round the face with its cheeky satirical edginess. I must give kudos at this point to the great production design from Joe Alves, who along with Carpenter has crafted this brilliantly dirty netherworld of crime.Our anti-hero of the piece, Snake Plissken, is superbly played by Kurt Russell, the original choice interestingly was Tommy Lee Jones, but Russell fuels Plissken's mantra to make him one of the eighties coolest grumpy bastards!, and his work here is first class in terms of the films apocalyptic structure. Surroundning Russell is a wealth of quality performers each adding their personal bits to this tick-tock stew, Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, Donald Pleasance, Harry Dean Stanton, Adrienne Barbeau and Isaac Hayes all earn their money and flesh out the story to the end.Calling Escape From New York an action picture would be setting first time viewers up for a real let down, what action there is is minimal but highly effective, the machismo flourishes acting more as a point of reference to the pictures time bomb urgency. I like to think of the film as more a sci-fi adventure yarn laced with darkly comic humour, with of course machismo thrown in as a side salad to accentuate the bleakness of it all, wonderful. 9/10",Escape from New York
23,Theo Robertson,Classic Old Fashioned Cinematic Look At The Future,8,22 June 2013,"In 1988 America experiences a surge in criminal violence that leads to Manhatten being turned in to one massive prison . In 1997 Airforce One is hijacked and crashes in to the prison . Newly convicted prisoner Snake Plissken is given a be given deal - if he can rescue the president he'll be given an amnesty but only has 22 hours to do so . If the mission fails the world may very well be heading towards World War 3 Earlier tonight I watched AEON FLUX , a film that some could claim is style over substance . I certainly didn't see any substance in that film and if you saw any style let me know what scene it appeared in . ESCAPE FROM NY is entirely different from FLUX . It's directed by John Carpenter who also did the electronic score and opened to moderate business on its released and later became a cult film . It's easy to see why . The camera work might be relatively static but this with hindsight compared to film making in the 21st century is a blessing since the visuals don't overwhelm the storytelling The story itself from real life events that over took this fictional scenario where in 1997 the cold war looks like hotting up big time but I doubt if Mikhail Gorbachev was sitting down at a table thinking ending the cold war would invalidate John Carpenter's vision of the future but that said a Marxist Leninist spouting rhetoric about workers and imperialist pigs does date the film Thankfully the film isn't really interested in politics and concentrates on keeping the audience excited which is does a good job at as Snake finds constant barriers in his way as he tries to find the missing president knowing that the clock is ticking away . Some of the action scenes aren't entirely plausible such as a machine pistol having an unrealistic capacity and despite being a not unlikable anti-hero in the vein of New Hollywood Kurt Russell plays Snake Plissken far too much like Clint Eastwood would have . Has anyone watched Russell's performance and not mentioned Eastwood ? Regardless of this ESCAPE FROM NY is a very enjoyable action thriller set in the future",Escape from New York
24,Hey_Sweden,You are the Duke of New York! You're A # 1!,8,14 May 2015,"The second historic teaming of filmmaker John Carpenter and actor Kurt Russell (after the made for TV movie 'Elvis'), ""Escape from New York"" is slick entertainment. It's a futuristic actioner that can boast some believably decrepit environments, a typically simple but effective Carpenter music score, and a top notch cast led by Russell in a performance of quiet cool.Taking place in the ""future"" year of 1997 (it's amusing, as it always is, to watch this kind of thing when the time period in the movie is now well into the past), it shows us how the island of Manhattan has been turned into a maximum security prison. An enormous wall surrounds the island, and the bridges are mined. Russell plays ""Snake"" Plissken, a war hero turned antisocial criminal on his way to prison for bank robbery. Meanwhile, revolutionaries take control of Air Force One and crash land inside Manhattan. Now the head honcho of the prison, Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef), offers Snake a deal: retrieve the President (Donald Pleasence) and earn his freedom. The catch? He has to pull off the mission within 24 hours, so the President can make it to a critical summit meeting.Carpenter works with many talented collaborators in front of and behind the camera. The cast also includes Isaac Hayes as a cool but not that menacing villain, Harry Dean Stanton as the aptly named ""Brain"", Ernest Borgnine as the jovial ""Cabbie"", Carpenter's then wife Adrienne Barbeau as Brains' girlfriend Maggie, Kurts' ex Season Hubley as a punk girl whom Snake runs into, Tom Atkins as Rehme (a nod to Avco Embassy boss Bob Rehme), and Charles Cyphers as the Secretary of State. There's a number of familiar faces in small parts, too: Frank Doubleday, John Diehl, Nancy Stephens, Bob Minor, Carmen Filpi, George 'Buck' Flower. Carpenters' producer Debra Hill and Jamie Lee Curtis both make voice only contributions. Production designer Joe Alves (""Jaws"") and Carpenters' frequent cinematographer Dean Cundey help to create a striking look for the movie.The special effects are generally good for the budget available to Carpenter and company. While some of the visuals may seem dated now to modern viewers, they work just fine for the time when this was made. These effects were handled by the people at New World, including none other than James Cameron.Since the action takes place during the course of a single night, there is a fair amount of urgency to the set-up, and pacing is consistent enough to hold ones' attention. One highlight is seeing Snake being forced to fight a thug inside a wrestling ring (said thug is played by the late Ox Baker).The ending is quite satisfying, with Snake finding a means of symbolically extending a middle finger to the uncaring authority figures whom he holds in contempt.Written by Carpenter and Nick Castle, who'd previously acted for the director in the horror classic ""Halloween"" (where Castle played The Shape), and followed by the belated sequel ""Escape from L.A."" 15 years later.Eight out of 10.",Escape from New York
25,Doylenf,Dark futuristic comic book slant on a bleaker than bleak New York...,5,13 January 2007,"Far from being a cult masterpiece, as some of these enthusiastic comments would suggest, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK is no more than a bleak escapade from John Carpenter envisioning a New York City that has become a maximum security prison--and full of the most unlikeable, sleaziest, grungiest characters you're ever likely to see paraded across the screen.This is one of those rare films that I walked out on when I saw it at my local theater on the big screen. I was disgusted by the overall plot, the characters (""Snake Plissken"" is played with overacted zeal by KURT RUSSELL), the dungeon-like settings and the inept dialog.It was discouraging to see reputable actors like DONALD PLEASENCE, LEE VAN CLEEF and ERNEST BORGNINE wallowing in this messy bit of futuristic junk. And it's even more discouraging to read some of these comments which seem to have no perspective at all in passing judgment on what Carpenter has done here. He obviously wanted audiences to respond to his warped vision of urban blight, but for me it was too tiresomely unreal and outrageously overacted by just about everyone in the cast.",Escape from New York

From the Haunting, but typical, thumping of the Synthesizer, not one scene in the Daylight (Dawn at best), Thrift Store Chic Costumes, a Larger than Life Anti-Hero, and assorted Street Dregs, mixed with the Classical Chestnut ""do this thing and you are Pardoned"", it all comes together with simplistic, but Colorful Sets and Graphics and bit of the ol' Ultraviolence.It is Sci-Punk Noir and the Talented Creators both in front of and behind the Camera make for an Amalgamated Apocalyptic Fan Favorite Film.",Escape from New York

The once free city of New York becomes the one maximum security prison for the entire country. A fifty foot containment wall is erected along the New Jersey shoreline, across the Harlem river and along the Brooklyn shoreline. It completely surrounds Manhattan island, all bridges and waterways are mined. The United States police, like an army, is encamped around the island. There are no guards inside the prison, only prisoners and the world they have made. The rules are simple, once you go in you don't come out. 1997 now."" The president (Donald Pleasence) of the United States is flying to a important meeting with China and the Soviet Union for talks that could possibly effect the existence of the human race. Unfortunately Air Force One is hijacked by anti US terrorists who crash it into a large New York skyscraper, but not before the president manages to bail out in a small emergency escape pod. On the Statue of Libertry island security control center police commander Bob Haulk (Lee Van Cleef) takes off for Manhattan by helicopter to see if the president has survived. Once there Haulk and his men are confronted by a freaky looking guy named Romero (Frank Doubleday) who hands Haulk a severed finger and warns him if he and his men aren't gone in thirty seconds the president dies, and not to come back either. Haulk and his men quickly take off back for the Statue of Liberty island security center to try and decide what to do. In twenty-four hours the all important meeting will be over and the president will effectively be useless, so Haulk decides to enlist the help of convicted bank robber Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) to go into New York on his own, locate the president and bring him back to safety. After learning they have implanted electrical charges in his body which will explode and kill him in twenty-four hours unless neutralised, Snake obviously feels he has no choice but to go along with Haulk's plan. Armed with a gun and various other supplies like a tracker to find the president, a locater so Haulk can locate him & the president and a walkie-talkie Snake takes off in a small glider which he successfully manages to land on top of the world trade center, the search begins. Once there Snake quickly realises that finding the president isn't going to be as easy as everyone had initially thought. Snake befriends Cabbie (Ernest Borgnine) who drives a cab and comes across an old friend named Harold 'Brain' Helman (Harry Dean Stanton) & his girlfriend Maggie (Adrienne Barbeau) who agree to help Snake find the president in exchange for their freedom. Snake has to deal with vicious gangs, rough terrain and the 'Duke' (Isaac Hayes) of New York who has plans for the president himself. Can Snake find and rescue the president in time? Watch it and find out. Co-written and directed by John Carpenter this is a cracking piece of Sci-Fi entertainment. The script by Carpenter and Nick Castle moves along at a great pace and is never boring, the dialogue is good and as a whole the somewhat silly premise works very well. The special effects are also quite good and they certainly hold up pretty well even today. The cast is great, I really like Russell in this and he looks more or less perfect for the role of Snake Plissken with his long hair, thick stubble and eye-patch! Experienced actors Cleef, Borgnine, Stanton, Hayes and Barbeau also all turn in fun performances. The appropriately cool sounding music by Carpenter and Alan Howarth reminds me of the score for Carpenter's Halloween (1978) a bit but that's no bad thing. It's generally well made overall and the widescreen cinematography by Dean Cundey and Jim Lucas does the job perfectly well. On the negative side it lacks any really big-budget action scenes, we get a few speeding cars and a few fights but nothing that's going to amaze anyone these days. It is also painfully obvious that a lot of this wasn't shot in New York itself. I wasn't sure about the ending either, it felt a little rushed and I didn't quite get what Carpenter was trying to say. But as it stands these are minor quibbles as this is great entertainment all the way! Definitely worth watching, so if you haven't already what are you waiting for?",Escape from New York

30,zardoz-13,Okay Futuristic Actioneer,7,17 June 2011,"Director John Carpenter didn't fare as luckily with ""Escape from New York"" as he did with ""Halloween."" Although it didn't generate as many sequels, knock-offs, and a remake as ""Halloween"" spawned, this futuristic tough-guy thriller inspired a sequel. According to Box Office.Mojo, the low-budgeted ""Escape from New York"" coined $50 million worldwide on a mere seven-million dollar investment so it qualifies as a colossal hit. Carpenter manages to get every cent on film. The scenes in New York City appear realistic enough in what constituted a juvenile delinquent hellhole lighted with fires that cast ominous shadows. Interestingly, nobody but Carpenter saw Kurt Russell as integral to the lead role as Snake Plissken. The studio preferred Charles Bronson, but Carpenter rejected him as too old. Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, Isaac Hayes, Donald Pleasance, Adrienne Barbeau, and Harry Dean Stanton co-star. The action is hard and gritty and Carpenter stages the violence with reasonable aplomb. Carpenter's work as music composer, along with Alan Howarth, surpasses his work as director. The opening ""Escape from New York"" theme is classic stuff! Clocking in at 99 minutes, this ""Dirty Dozen"" type genre film never wears out its welcome. The best parts are the opening twenty minutes and the concluding twenty minutes. Knowing that gigantic wrestler Ox Baker wasn't trying to throw his punches, but connect them with Russell makes their memorable in the arena as they clobber each other with clubs more realistic. The snake tattoo that Snake wears and his eye-patch look thoroughly believable and Snake's refrain ""Call me Snake"" bolsters Russell's performance. Van Cleef contributes an intimidating mongoose performance.""Escape from New York"" opens with some expository narrative that Carpenter said they decided to incorporate to give audiences a leg up on the setting and background of the story. Graphics accompany the following narration: ""In 1988, the crime rate in the United States rises four hundred percent. The once great city of New York becomes the one maximum security prison for the entire country. A fifty-foot containment wall is erected along the New Jersey shoreline, across the Harlem River, and down along the Brooklyn shoreline. It completely surrounds Manhattan Island. All bridges and waterways are mined. The United States Police Force, like an army, is encamped around the island. There are no guards inside the prison, only prisoners and the worlds they have made. The rules are simple: once you go in, you don't come out."" Basically, World War III is coming to a close and the anonymous President (Donald Pleasance of ""Halloween"") is flying in Air Force One when a terrorist masquerading as a stewardess hijacks it and broadcasts: ""Tell this to the workers when they ask where their leader went. We, the soldiers of The National Liberation Front of America, in the name of the workers and all the oppressed of this imperialist country, have struck a fatal blow to the fascist police state. What better revolutionary example than to let their president perish in the inhuman dungeon of his own imperialist prison."" Police Commissioner Hauk (Lee Van Cleef of ""For Few Dollars More"") discusses a plan with the Vice President to send in a hardened criminal facing a life sentence in Manhattan to rescue the chief executive. He chooses a former war hero, Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell), because he had flown an ultra-quiet glider called the Gullfire during the war in Leningrad. Hauk offers the reluctant Plissken amnesty for all his crimes if he will rescue the President. Kurt Russell looks suitably tough as Plissken with a raspy voice, a black eye-patch, and a beard. You see, Snake had been arrested for trying to rob a Federal Bank. Snake doesn't exactly leap at the offer and Hauk explains that time is of the essence. The President was scheduled to appear at the critical Hartford Summit to deliver an audio cassette that had a message on it about nuclear fusion. It is essential that the President appears with that message.Plissken agrees to fly the Gullfire and bring out the President, but the suspicious Hauk takes special precautions to ensure Snake's loyalty. He explains how he will keep Snake from flying the other way once he is airborne. "" Two microscopic capsules lodged in your arteries. They're already starting to dissolve. In 22 hours, the cores will completely dissolve. Inside the cores are a heat-sensing charge. Not a large explosion, about the size of a pinhead, just big enough to open up both of your arteries. I'd say you'd be dead in 10-15 seconds..."" Snake flies the Gullfire into Manhattan and lands narrowly atop the World Trade Center. One more foot and the Gullfire and he would plunge to the streets. He locates the wreckage of Air Force One and consults the tracking device that receives signals from the President's electronic wrist bracelet. Eventually, Snake tracks down the signal, only to discover that a drunk (George 'Buck' Flower) is wearing it instead of the Chief Executive. Snake is taken on a tour of the city by Cabbie (Ernest Borgnine), who has been cruising the city streets in his cab for 30 years. Snake learns from the 'Brain' (Harry Dean Stanton) that the Duke of New York (Isaac Hayes) has captured the President. Snake tries to rescue the President, but neither are free for long. Snake takes an arrow in the leg and is forced to fight a giant (Ox Baker) in an arena with clubs. Snake defeats the giant and gathers 'Brain,' the President, and Maggie and they make a break for the 69th Street Bridge. Earlier, the Duke had planned to lead his army of convicts and storm the bridge. The Duke needed the 'Brain' because he had a diagram of where all the land mines where placed.""Escape from New York"" is an above-average but threadbare thriller.",Escape from New York

However, it could have been good, and entertaining the whole way through, but for the pacing.John Carpenter takes pains to set up the movie: the background to New York being as it is, the President being stuck in it and Snake Plissken going in to save him. You get to meet the bad guys and the side characters. Then, having taken time to develop the set of characters, the movie suddenly rushes to its conclusion. It's as if there is no Act 2, just Act 1 and Act 3 (and Act 3 is quite short).Action movies usually overstay their welcome, this one ended too quickly.Performances are so-so. Kurt Russell does his best to channel Clint Eastwood. His whole performance seemed so derivative. Lee Van Cleef is solid as Hauk.

The atmosphere is built up expertly, very bleak and relentless. This has well-done dark comedy. Dialog is well-written and delivered impeccably. The plot is interesting and develops fairly nicely throughout. Pacing is fast, and this is an tension-packed ride that only just exactly lets you relax. The acting and casting is spot-on, all the way. Russell is endlessly memorable and quotable, as he almost invariably is in John's films. The music is well-composed. This has cool and exciting action, though not the greatest the director has done. In general he's done better elsewhere, with the execution of the alternate time-line this takes place in(with the script coming as a close second) being arguably the best thing about this. It all looks really good, and the effects are well-done. This gives us about what we expect from JC, especially as far as the brooding tone goes. The cinematography and editing are skillful, and this holds plenty of his infamous foreboding shots.

I don't know why, because John Carpenter has a proved track record of making art out of pulp. Maybe it's the fact that the film stars Kurt Russell, who I've never been able to take seriously.But then I just got around to actually watching it, only to discover that it's kind of a kick-ass movie and deserves to be treated much more seriously than I had originally given it credit for. Carpenter, as usual, does much with what's obviously a limited budget, and the gritty scrappiness of the movie actually adds to its apocalyptic atmosphere. The premise is as high-concept as they come, and while the film has not changed my opinion of Kurt Russell as an actor, it did at least confirm for me that he's serviceable enough when matched with the right role.Grade: A-",Escape from New York
36,Uriah43,Imaginative and Entertaining,7,10 September 2021,"This film takes place in the future with Manhattan Island having been turned into one gigantic maximum security prison and sealed off from America by a 50-foot security wall on the opposite side of its river banks. There are no prison guards inside and the prisoners have been essentially left to fend for themselves. To that effect, since all of them have been given life sentences anyone attempting to escape is immediately fired upon by helicopters or machine gun nests on the prison walls. In essence then, once a person is sent inside they do not come back out. At least, that was the case up until the moment that terrorists hijacked Air Force One and caused the President of the United States ""John Harker"" (Donald Pleasance) to jettison out in an escape pod and land directly into the heart of the city. To make matters even worse, prior to the hijacking he was about to attend a high-level summit which could result in a nuclear war should he not show up within 24 hours. That said, when word is relayed from the prison that any attempt to free him by a massive show of force would result in his death ""Police Commissioner Bob Hauk"" (Lee Van Cleef) decides to secretly send in a former Special Forces soldier named ""Snake Plissken"" (Kurt Russell) who had just been convicted of a crime and sentenced to life imprisonment a short time earlier. And although he is promised a complete pardon, to further ensure his compliance a small capsule is inserted into his arteries which will explode within 24 hours if he fails to bring President Harker back out alive. The problem is that he has no real idea where President Harker is being held or whether he is actually still living or not. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a pretty entertaining science-fiction movie due in large part to the imaginative setting and the presence of the solid actors just mentioned along with Ernest Borgnine (as ""Cabbie""), Harry Dean Stanton (""Brain"") and Adrienne Barbeau (""Maggie"").

39,FlashCallahan,Call me snake......,10,30 August 2016,"When you compare Escape From New York to other dystopian science fiction films, it stands apart from those because even though it's set in the future (or past, if you would), it has a very grimy, earthy, almost cheap feel to it.In the future, crime is out of control and New York City is a maximum security prison. Grabbing a bargaining chip right out of the air, convicts bring down the President's plane in bad old Gotham. Snake Plissken, a one-eyed lone warrior, who does a great impression of Clint Eastwood, new to prison life, is coaxed into bringing the President, and his cargo, out of this land of undesirables.....There is nothing to say about this film that hasn't been said before, it's a whole heap of fun, if you look up the word cult in the dictionary, I'm sure there is a picture of this film right next to the definition.And then there is Russell. Michael Myers aside, this is the most memorable character from any John Carpenter film, and Russell has never been better than in this career defining role.He's as cold as ice, but has a very distant human side to him, seen only briefly in a few scenes. All in all, Snake is a total Bada$$ from the way he talks, walks, smokes, and generally acts in any situation.Support is wonderful also, but only when we are in New York. Van Cleef is okay, but he spends the entire film sitting down, due to a knee injury. He has a little banter with Snake, but the film comes alive when Snake lands on the WTC.The characters are bonkers, scary, funny, and most importantly, untrustworthy, so this adds a little more urgency to the narrative, as you never know who will double cross Snake, and whom he has ran into in the past.My only gripe is that they should have included the original opening in the final cut, those few minutes really flesh out Snake just that little bit more.But other than that, it's a wonderful film that never gets old, and is always begging a re watch.",Escape from New York

This movie also features one of the coolest characters ever featured in a John Carpenter movie Snake. He is the highlight of the movie and one has to wonder how he would handle Michael Myers eh? The movie has the president's plane crashing in New York and he is needed out of said location. New York in this movie has become some sort of maximum security facility. Well they authorities have a very infamous criminal Snake and they decide to use him to retrieve the president. Well he is not very cooperative, but he finally decides to help...mainly because they but explosive charges in his neck. Well he enters New York by some sort of glider and the mission almost immediately goes wrong. Thankfully, Snake is able to find unlikely allies in this twisted New York. Granted they are mainly trying to help in the hopes of also escaping New York. So what is wrong with the movie that I gave it a six and not something higher? Needs more action in for one...for a movie like this you would expect fewer dead spots than what you get. Also, I thought the whole Duke of New York was a bit overdone and over the top. Still, it ends rather good and for the most part it is an okay movie. The music is what one would expect in a John Carpenter movie, good. The cast is top notch add a few gun fights and minus a couple of the talky scenes and this movie would really rock.",Escape from New York
41,zetes,Weak supporting characters and cheap production design drag this cult flick down a bit,7,3 February 2008,"I think I was expecting something a little more along the lines of the other Kurt Russell / John Carpenter film I've seen, Big Trouble in Little China. But Escape from New York isn't a wacky comic action movie, but rather a dark, somber thriller, somewhat closer to Carpenter's Escape from Precinct 13. The plot follows Snake Plissken (Russell) as he is sent into the prison colony of Manhattan Island to rescue the President (Donald Pleasance), whose plane was hijacked by terrorists and downed there. The film is fairly entertaining, but it could have used a shot of adrenaline. It moves along quite slowly for this genre. The setting is ripe for some fantastic production design, but I imagine Carpenter didn't have a lot of money to make the movie. I also wish the supporting characters were a little more vivid. You've got some great character actors here, including Harry Dean Stanton, Ernest Borgnine and Lee Van Cleef, but their characters are all rather bland. Adrienne Barbeau is an actress whose looks have aged quite badly  yeah, she has large breasts, but she's quite ugly in the face. And Isaac Hayes makes for a dull villain. I did enjoy the movie, and it ends especially well. I was expecting more, though.",Escape from New York

And Snake Plissken is such a middle finger to authority that you can't help but sense the streak of distrust running through this movie. But this is why I so love it: even with the sci-fi/action premise (and a brilliantly realized hellscape of urban decay) there's just something demented about all of this. It's cult, b-movie, madhouse all thrown into a fondue pot . . . and melted down into a thoroughly entertaining meal.Also, Isaac Hayes in a Cadillac with chandeliers.And Adrienne Barbeau.9/10",Escape from New York
44,christopher-underwood,very amusing with some great dialogue,7,30 November 2008,"Watching this after a recent repeat viewing of 'Assault on Precinct 13', it is clear that this suffers more than the earlier film from lack of a decent budget. Carpenter manages well enough but as this is far more ambitious it inevitably wobbles now and again. Also, I fear that here, we are so reliant on Kurt Russell in the lead. He is very good but for all the support efforts this is not the ensemble piece that is the earlier siege movie. Nevertheless this moves along well enough and the action sequences are efficiently carried through. Another problem for me is that we never really get fully behind Russell and his mission and in truth he is only committed through self interest, so we are never on the edge of our seat for the life of podgy Pleasence playing the President. Positively, the film never drags, is very amusing with some great dialogue and Russell maintains that snarl throughout.",Escape from New York

46,namashi_1,Plain Average...,5,9 February 2011,"John Carpenter's cult-hit 'Escape from New York' begins tepidly, gathers momentum in the middle, and culminates with some distractions. It's an average cinematic experience, that offers a solid idea, a fascinating, stylish protagonist, but suffers from below-the-mark writing.'Escape from New York' takes place in a dystopian 1997, the near future in a crime-ridden United States that has converted Manhattan Island in New York City into a maximum security prison, where Ex-soldier and legendary fugitive 'Snake' Plissken played marvelously by Kurt Russell, is given 24 hours to find the President of the United States, who has been captured by inmates after Air Force One crashed on the island.As said, the idea is truly super and there are genuinely some entertaining scenes. But the writing at most places, lacks the bite. Also, the inconsistent pacing leaves you unsatisfied. Carpenter's direction is sharp & note-worthy as ever, but his writing is far from his standards.Kurt Russell has truly embodied 'Snake' Plissken in here, and he's marvelous from start to end. He stands out throughout, even when the writing lets him down. Without doubt, a cult-character and a cult-performance! On the whole, though not bad at all, this sci-fi flick could've been better for sure. Nonetheless, watch it for Russell's memorable take on 'Snake' Plissken.",Escape from New York

Hal Sparks said that it would have been more fun with ""Escape from Idaho"" ""Potatoes, all these damned potatoes"". LOL! But I recently rented some movies and came across this film and figured why not? I love Kurt Russell and John Carpenter.Escape From New York is a very exciting film taking place in the future, the world is a different place. New York has been taken over by the criminals and the president's plane crashes there, he is presumed dead, but the detectives send Snake Plaskin, an outlaw who is the only possible one to get the president out of there. There is a catch, Snake has 22 hours to get the president, or the drugs put in him will kill him in that 22 hours if he does not succeed.This is an on the edge of your seat thriller with cool effects, awesome actors, and terrific and catchy lines that you'll find yourself repeating after the movie is done.

After landing his stealth glider on top of World Trade Center, a machine-gun-toting Snake roams the rubble-ridden, decrepit metropolis in the dead night, brushes with danger but finally is apprised that the president (Pleasence) is hold hostage by the Duke (Hayes), the kingpin of the turf. Aided by some unlikely altruistic allies, like his former partner-in-crime Brain (Stanton), who has betrayed him and now becomes Duke's advisor, Brain's touch-looking squeeze Maggie (Barbeau), and the gabby Cabbie (Borgnine), who still rides his big yellow taxi amid the chaos, his rescue mission takes a haphazard but not entirely insipid trajectory (a deathmatch here, a car chase involving a chandeliers-mounted Cadillac there) before escorting the president to safety, and 2 seconds before the deadline. Performers are game, but in default setting with the exception of Frank Doubleday's vampiric mannerism as Duke's sidekick Romero, and a sinister Donald Pleasence's explosion with a vengeful salvo near the end. Russell finds a new lifeline in his beefy anti-hero persona and will become Carpenter's frequent leading man for 3 more pictures, including Carpenter's best work THE THING (1982).

49,Red-Barracuda,Iconic early 80's sci-fi action cult classic,7,28 June 2017,"This early 80's bit of dystopian sci-fi set in a future America which is now a fascist state has gone on to garner a cult reputation. Set in the future of 1997, Manhattan Island is now a high security prison where the criminal dregs of society are contained. When the president's aeroplane crashes in the middle of this city prison and captured by the resident criminals, a mercenary called Snake Plissken is sent in on a do-or-die mission to retrieve him within twenty-four hours.Escape From New York is another in the long line of strong movies director John Carpenter made in his 70's-80's heyday. After a couple of big horror hits under his belt he returned to the more action-oriented style of his earlier Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), except in this case adding a science-fiction premise to add considerable colour. To this end, the film features dark dilapidated New York settings for the action to take place and these, added to the nice panoramic views of the darkened city add considerable atmosphere. As does Carpenter's main theme music which is amongst the very best be ever composed and given the high calibre of his original soundtrack music, that's saying quite a lot. The film also benefits from a cast of b-movie legends, we have Donald Pleasence as an improbable President of the United States, Isaac Hayes is a blaxploitation styled Duke of New York, Kurt Russell as the iconic eye-patch sporting anti-hero, Adrienne Barbeau appears throughout in an eye-popping low cut tight red outfit, Ernest Borgnine is a comic-relief cabbie, Lee Van Cleef is a hard-bitten police chief and Harry Dean Stanton pitches up as a shifty character called Brain. The film isn't always fully exciting stuff it has to be admitted and it sometimes promises more than it delivers but the set-up, settings and cast are very good, while there are some memorable scenes such as the death match and mine-infested bridge to keep the pace up. Ultimately, this is a very solid bit of early 80's sci-fi action, with enough distinctive elements to ensure its ongoing cult appeal.",Escape from New York
50,disdressed12,"not a masterpiece,but a pretty good film",8,22 April 2007,"after just watching this movie,i am of two minds about it.on the one hand,i think the filmmakers were pretty bang on in their view of what a post apocalyptic world might look like,or at least New York and surrounding areas.i thought Kurt Russel was a perfect choice for the hero,or rather anti-hero,in this case.he was very convincing as a loner/outlaw,for lack of better terms.i did find it amusing that the movie,made in 1980,shows us a future world in the year 1997.of course,that year has come and gone,and the real world has had(up to this point)little in common with the world depicted on screen.this is not a criticism,merely an observation.i found the movie somewhat compelling,yet also slow at the same time.most of the movie is pure drama,with a bit of action,and some humour thrown in.i liked the rough edge the movie had.it seemed unpolished,which is good in this case.i did not find the movie to be a masterpiece or anything profound,which is what i was hoping and expecting.i remember seeing bits of the movie a long long time ago,and recall being blown away.but that was then,this is now.tastes change over time.having said that,i enjoyed the movie more than not.Overall,i'd give ""Escape From New York an 8/10",Escape from New York
51,KineticSeoul,Oudated and a bit too campy but for a movie from the 1980's it's pretty good,7,7 June 2012,"This movie is a cult classic to some movie buffs and inspired a some other movie characters including video game characters as well. One video that comes to mind straight off the bat is ""Metal Gear Solid"" the character Solid Snake is inspired by Snake Plissken who is the main protagonist and a bit of a anti-hero in this movie. This movie is probably Kurt Russell's big break in some ways and plays a character that sticks with him even today. This movie is outdated and not just because the special effects but it's just a really slow-paced action movie in today's standards. The plot is this in year 1988 crime rates go out of hand and thus the government decides to barricade and isolate the people of New York and no one is allowed to leave and those that enter aren't allowed to leave either. The movie takes place in 1997 and New York is now a isolated slum filled with bunch of homeless and crazy people or both and some of them are savage criminals in a ravaged wasted city. The president gets kidnapped and that is when Snake Plissken comes in, he has no other option but to go to New York and rescue the president or die trying. Despite the low budget this movie has some creativity going for it when it comes to the anarchic atmosphere and actions of the characters. So despite the linear story it mysterious and dark atmosphere that screams shady used in a effective manner makes it worth a watch even today. This movie can get really campy at times but for a movie made in 1980's it's not too shabby.7/10",Escape from New York
52,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Not as great an action film as I'd have hoped but great atmosphere and tension through-out,9,25 December 2007,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In a futuristic New York, the capital city has been turned into a gigantic maximum security prison where some of the most dangerous and violent criminals have been left to rot. But when some rebel fighters threaten to shoot the president's plane down, it is forced to crashland there, only for the president to be taken hostage by some of the criminals who rule the land. So the authorities send in Snake Plisskin (Kurt Russell) an imprisoned soldier, to rescue him, but they trick him into thinking they've given him a vaccine, only to find it's a device that will kill him if he doesn't complete his mission in 24 hours.It's amazing all the classics and 'cult' classics I've never got round to watching but until last night Escape From New York was another one of these. Now I've finally seen it I'm glad I have, as I can mostly see why it was rated so much. As a sci-fi action film it was ahead of it's time, with a style, look and feel that was to shape the way some future action films were to pen out.It's meant to be an action film, but the first half really relies more on a neat atmosphere and sense of tension than any thrilling adventure, typical Carpenter really. Things heat up a bit more in the second half, though and the film certainly created one of action's most iconic characters, Snake Plisskin, the blue khakied, black vested, eye-patch wearing hard-ass with his gravelly voice and anti-authority attitude. It's the role Russell will most likely best be remembered for, and it's clear to see why. Joining him is a lively supporting cast, including Donald Pleasance, fresh from Carpenter's previous Halloween, as the president, Ernest Borgnine as a chirpy cab driver always on hand to help, Shaft warbler Isaac Hayes as the villain, as well as other supporting turns from Harry Dean Stanton and Lee Van Cleef.It's showing it's age now, but this is still an action film any true lover of the genre would be well advised to see if they haven't done so already. ****",Escape from New York
53,ThomasDrufke,Strangely Flat For a Carpenter Film,4,19 April 2017,"Snake Plissken is known as one of the most iconic sci-fi characters in film history, but why? Kurt Russell is a fine actor in just about everything he does, but Escape From New York never gives him anything to do besides hold a gun which he uses maybe once the entire film? It's safe to say I wasn't impressed with this film.Manhattan is now a security prison for criminals of all variety and after the President crash lands in the middle of the city, Plissken is hired to rescue him. Apparently Plissken is like the boogeyman for these Manhattan criminals, since they all know who he is but didn't seem to know he actually existed or where he's been. The weirdest part, however, is we never get to see him to anything of value. Even in criminals past references, they never mentioned anything specifically which would warrant him a spot to save the President.It's one thing if the film embraces its silliness and makes all of the dialogue, action, and performances cheesy, but they don't. The tone is never truly set. On one hand, you have Plissken taking on dozens of criminals who look like they are wearing Mad Max cosplay, but then you have the issue of the President's life being on the line. Those are two opposing tones butting heads, and you never get a grasp on the type of film John Carpenter wants to make. I think Carpenter is a masterful director, but Escape From New York felt kind of like a cheap side project for him. Though, I will say Carpenter's original score made for this film is brilliant.I think a lot of my frustration comes from the fact that this film was made close to 40 years ago, and therefore, there's plenty of dated qualities to it. CGI was young in 1981, and it shows. That and the green screen effects were difficult to watch. Of course, these aren't necessarily the film's fault, but sometimes the reach shouldn't exceed the grasp by that much of a margin. It's not the fault of the film, but I've seen plenty that are better since. Donald Pleasance doesn't get much to do, and neither does anybody in a supporting role. And most of all, I just didn't care for any of the characters or the story they were in.+Great score-Why is Plissken so revered?-Dated4.2/10",Escape from New York

57,ironhorse_iv,"Breaking out is impossible, breaking in is insane",7,30 October 2012,"How can somebody escape from not seeing this 1981 gritty and grim sci-fiction movie? It's one of the best John Carpenter's films of all times. Carpenter took the real-life pathologies that assailed New York in the '70s, like crime, decadence, drugs, blackouts, riots, economic turmoil, and punk rock, extrapolated to create this dire scenario. Carpenter wrote the film in the mid-1970s as a reaction to the Watergate scandal and it's shows as Escape From New York's political themes are well-grounded than its sequel Escape from LA which was full of satire, so New York seem a bit more grounded in reality than LA. It's story is a compelling but relentlessly sour and pessimistic action flick whose only levity comes from the inherent dark humor. Escape From New York's is the story about two societies. One is the far right fascist state that has created a prison island on Manhattan to imprisoned those who don't see their way, it's lead by a future US dystopia president (Donald Pleasence) whom plane was taken over by terrorist over the air space over the island. The plane crashes into Manhattan, but the President makes it to an escape pod and survives. The President finds himself in a world of the far left, an anarchy state, where a leader known as the Duke of New York (Isaac Hayes) takes him hostage, and order the government the right to leave Manhattan immediately or they will kill him. Police Commissioner Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef) is forced to send a special force soldiers turned criminal ""Snake"" Plissken (Kurt Russell) to rescue him. The movie is amazing, with its limitations to the point that a video game director from Japan Hideo Kojima saw it as an influence on his work, The Metal Gear series starting a character Solid Snake, strongly based on Snake Plissken. There is a bit of a mystery to Snake due his character having no redeeming social value. It's clearly paying homage to the Man with No name from the Sergio Leone's movies, and maybe the reason why Lee Van Cleef was hired to play the Police Commissoner. Snake Plissken is pretty much one of the ultimate movie anti-hero rebel. Snake doesn't represent America, it represents humanity and the passion for freedom from the ''prison'' that modern America (and generally the people in power) have created, by destroying a key item in the end. It's the direct message from Carpenter against the capitalist system. An powerful message. Rather than, ""escapism"" in the Hollywood sense and made this a thrill-ride, Carpenter instead shot on a low budget, using a burnt-out St. Louis standing in for ghost-town NYC to makes it painfully plain that this alternative Manhattan is really not a nice place to visit and you wouldn't want to live there.

Nobody gets out of New York alive, it would seem; even the President of the United States... unless Plissken can haul his fat out of the fire. En route to the Chief Executive (""President of what?"" Plissken asks at one point), there are downed planes and starving crazies who live in the sewers and old acquaintances hiding out in libraries and The Duke of New York (Isaac Hayes), whose army of ne'er do wells must be contended with. All within the allotted time: Plissken is literally a ticking time bomb, thanks to duplicitous Lee Van Cleef as the commander of the United States Police Force. For all its dark doings, however, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK is also infused with an often subtle black humor that helps keep it from devolving into the kind of lackluster action film that features stars who can't act; Russell as Plissken is also- surprise- vulnerable, and thence more real, than most action leads. One can't help but sympathize with his character. (And one can't help but think back to ELVIS, the amazing boob-tube biography directed by Carpenter with Russell in the lead: like ELVIS, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK delivers on an emotional level.

He came up with every form of facial distortion possible for a human to make. He was just too bad [and sometimes bad is bad]. In fact everybody in this 'thriller' was too bad. I was overwhelmed with BAD! It is too bad that I bothered to sit all the way through this bad production. Stay away.,Escape from New York
65,insomniac_rod,Cult classic action film that lands in the horror genre.,9,17 July 2010,"""Snake"" Plissken is the kind of guy that makes you actually thank cinema for his existence. He has the bad-ass attitude of Clint Eastwood. Well, he only cares about his own law. He believes his country has taken everything away from him, but his patriotism is still intact because in his opinion, government is absolute crap and corruption.This is what I would call John Carpenter's urban masterpiece. We find action and more action through black humor, suspense, and a dynamic direction. The social criticism by John Carpenter shows us a fascist politic and a government that is more worried in reprehending rather than readapting. In this New York everything gets solved through mafias and corruption through a setting of illegality. But to be honest, only action matters! This is a cult film in all of it's glory. We get memorable characters. ""Snake"" is a historical nowadays because of his attitude, his violent moods, his cool dialogs, and the way that he doesn't cares about anything. ""Snake doesn't like anyone"". This is possible through Kurt Russell's excellent acting. Other characters like Cabbie (played by the great Ernest Borgnine), Brain (the always functional Harry Dean Stanton), Maggie (the sexy Adrienne Barbue, whose cleave makes men drool), Hauk (superbly played by Lee Van Cleef), the mythical Tom Atkins (in a secondary role), and the weird and spooky Romero played by a guy who would later inspire Evil Ed in ""Fright Night"" (in my opinion). Donald Pleasence delivers some good black humor and cool action sequences.Special mention for the late Isaac Hayes who gives life to ""The Duke"". His part is absolutely memorable. And generates one of the most bad-ass introductions ever in cinema.The fact that I cared about all the characters made me hate the scrip writers who doesn't know a thing about the meaning of a team. They all get offed in bad fashion and very quick.Carpenter's Direction is explosive. I mean, at any point you forget you are watching an action film even though the master applies his unique style (inspired by Horror) in such scenes like the ""living dead"" that come out of the sewers, the freak Romero character, and the tension that he could only create. A solid work.The atmosphere of the city was great. Every single detail was perfectly taken care of. It is a world that you would like to enter and explore like a sandbox freely. The setting looks perfect for a video game. Although I think the settings could be more ""explored"".The violence is adequate and in excess. The Greek-roman fight was not that impressive, just ""blah"". The escape in the bridge could've delivered more explosions and blood. We still get stabbings, wounds caused by shot guns, and kick-ass explosions.We should not forget that this is a B-Movie. Because of that, it looks ridiculous in some moments. For example, in the clothing, editing, scenarios, dialogs. But those elements give it a Sui generis style. Yes, even because of that, it's still better that many actual action movies.The soundtrack is so 80's it will make you smile. Great rhythm. And, did it make you think about ""Halloween"" at some point? Yes, of course.The Cinematography and Art Direction give it a touch of mysticism and surrealism. It looks classy at it's own way. I mean, a visually sinister world, dark, but stylish and detailed. It probably inspired the settings of the ""Terminator"" movies and the acclaimed video game ""Fallout 3"". Just my opinion.Completely recommended for those who enjoy action and horror in this cult classic. It won't disappoint you.",Escape from New York
66,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"The potential of Carpenter's cool, dark-future style film isn't fully realized",6,15 August 2008,"John Carpenter's ""Escape From New York"" probably set the tone for dark 80s sci-fi actioners, painting that grim and barbaric picture of humanity in the future, in this case when crime has risen so much that Manhattan had to be sealed up and turned into a giant prison. Though action should probably be the least emphasized of all those words. Carpenter seems to avoid action sequences of any kind, particularly explosions, with only occasional fights and gun shootouts. ""Escape from NY"" is more a dark, deeply-imagined style film that grinds along like a horror film rather than gliding along on adrenaline.Carpenter's film takes place in 1997, when Manhattan has long been a prison. When Airforce One crashes inside the city and the president is missing, the US Police Force calls on a signature Carpenter anti-hero, Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell), a former military pilot with an eye patch and a chip-on-his-shoulder attitude about everything, to get him out. Plissken is one of those enigmatic heroes who you never get to know but like because he's a bad ass and because the man is trying to keep him down (Lee Van Cleef). Snake is not a terrific anti- hero as far as films go, but he carries a uniqueness about him that is easy to like. Russell plays the character pretty stoic which works for the way he's written.This is a rather grim film, with strange, pitiful characters that you never come to know or like. It's more bizarre than anything else, feeling like a horror film that's not scary or suspenseful in the way it's told and shot with all the darkness. I suppose that's not a surprise coming so soon for Carpenter after ""Halloween."" Maybe I come from too much of a modern action-happy perspective, but this film could have benefited from some serious explosions or intense fight scenes--some excitement. It just mulls along, staying satisfied with just being interesting with no desire to pick up the suspense with slight exception at the end.The creative concept here is rich for a great action flick, but I think even as a dark futuristic film, the concept is mostly unrealized. There's great potential to create compelling characters living in a city that's been left to them as a prison and the organizing principle of chaos that leads their lives, but Carpenter pushes to just get you through the film and have your anti- hero reluctantly give his all to save the day. So it's cool and interesting, but never really takes flight.",Escape from New York
67,Vartiainen,Early 80s action gold,7,21 May 2015,"An action cult classic and one of the most memorable Kurt Russell roles, Escape from New York is an influential movie for its genre and still holds up well over thirty years later.The story goes that in the mystical year of 1997 we live in the crime-torn horrors of the future and have turned Manhattan into one huge prison island. You know, like we often do with our most valuable pieces of real estate. But now the President has crash landed into the prison and it's up to one man, one Snake Plissken (Russell), to pull him out of there before it's too late.The film mainly shines because of its style and its main character. It was made in 1981, but already you can see all the staples of the 80s. Dark, urban settings, lots and lots of shooting, wild yelling, tribal gangsters, antiheroes and grey morality all around. Escape from New York has since then influenced whole generations of film makers, and for a good reason. It's a very tight package, even if the story is rather straightforward and the supporting cast is not the strongest.Russell, however, is very strong in his role. His character has become one of the role models of antiheroes and once again for a good reason. He's tormented, mean and lean, stone cold, born badass yet in the end he's filling to see the job through, to do the right thing, no matter how reluctantly.Escape from New York is a blast of fun and style. One of the must see 80s action films and a great introduction to Kurt Russell. Recommended.",Escape from New York

This is set in the post-apocalyptic future in 1997 where New York has become a dark place. One night, the President (Pleasence) is on his Air Force One jet that's hijacked and crashes. The police force and command center learn that the President ejected and was kidnapped by a gang lead by the Duke (Hayes). Command leader, Bob Hauk (Van Cleef) sends criminal war hero, Snake Plissken (Russell) to rescue him, but only has a limited amount of time. Snake also has help from Cabbie (Borgnine), Maggie (Barbeau) and Brain (Stanton). Russell is terrific as Snake and does a great Clint Eastwood impersonation. The rest of the cast is great too and Carpenter & Alan Howarth's score is excellent as usual. This is one of Carpenter & Russell's best I recommend.",Escape from New York
69,hellraiser7,Freedom Fighter,10,27 September 2012,"Rebels are always my favorite type of hero because their people that don't go with the flow they simply want to do their own thing and don't want anyone to tell them otherwise. But also that they are willing to defend themselves against what seems unfair and unjust. This is my third favorite movie from my favorite movie director John Carpenter and one of my favorite movies in general.Everything about the movie is just great. I really like how dark the futuristic setting is, even though there isn't a great deal of depth uncovered you know enough to get a feeling of a society that has turned it's back on it's own principles it once stood by. The fact that New York has been made into a maximum security prison is irony of this since New York is considered the heart of America, a place where great things occurred and were achieved, and anything was possible. But I just really like the look of New York, the model, set pieces, use of lighting and use of an old abandoned town was great and it was all done on a low budget. It's just a prime example of a budget used the right way no matter what range it goes as long as heart and effort is put into it. The world of the city prison is really dark and dangerous it's someplace you don't want to live in.The action is good it's not wall to wall but that's a good thing because it made the film a little realistic plus this film is more of a suspense thriller. My favorite sequence is the gladiatorial fight against the giant, I just like how the fight didn't look too much like a well choreographed martial arts battle but an actual fight.And of course the best things were the suspense, I really liked the dark moody atmosphere the darkness and the ruin of the city really give you the sense of isolation and constant danger, there could be a gang of killers hiding within the shadows. The music is superb, as usual John Carpenter best fortays is music, the theme song is one of my favorite themes ever. His score creates moodiness some places as well as excitement in others.Supporting characters are good, Snakes allies are likable though unreliable. Cabbie played by the late Ernest Borgnine is funny he's helpful but at the same time a bit of a coward. Brain by Harry Dean Stanton is true to his name a thinker/schemer and Maggie by Adrienne Barbeau whom is hot as usual but she's tough. Both sort of have a bronze and brains dynamic, Brain is the one that always has a plan and leads while Maggie is sort of a bodyguard for him since it seems like she's the one with some fighting capabilities.The main villain the Duke played by the late Issac Hayes is great and yeah I like his music, I like how he's menacing he a man in charge but also he's fun at the same time because he's got some really got really good lines or just simply how he delivers them.But of course the best thing about the movie for me is the character Snake Plisken played brilliantly by one of my favorite actors Kurt Rusell. Snake is my favorite fictional hero of all time, I really love the voice he has it's sort of a Clint Eastwood like tone. Snake is tough as nails both verbally and physically. There's not a great deal of depth to his character but I think that's a good thing because it give him sort of a mystique value. I love the fact that he's a guy that has a problem with authority, isn't really looking to be a hero but mainly just wants to keep to himself, and doesn't take crap from anyone or even give a crap about certain problems. But he's a hero because he does what is right or at least what he's meant to do whether he wants to or not, because there is no one else. I highly emphasize with him because I too have a problem with authority, I don't like being told what to do, and I like keeping to myself. To me Snake is America, America was founded and created by rebels like him.Escape from New York is escapist fun.Rating: 4 stars",Escape from New York
70,Captain_Couth,The Cinema of John Carpenter: Escape from New York.,9,19 August 2005,"Escape from New York (1981) was one of the best films that John Carpenter has ever directed. A low budget science fiction action film that's still cool today. Kurt Russell also earns a life time man card for breathing life into one of the greatest anti-heroes to ever grace their presence upon the silver screen. During the eighties, John Carpenter produced several classic films. A few of them are highly underrated and they have been dismissed by the critics and viewing public.The film takes place in ""The Future"". Manhattan Island has become a federal prison for undesirables. The United States has become a conservative country and has been on the brink of war with it's enemies. During a hairy negotiation period, the President's plane was hijacked by a group of left-wing radicals. But the plane was knocked out of commission and the President's(Donald Pleasance) escape pod has landed inside the walls of New York Federal Prison. The government is desperate and they'll do anything to try and save the world from a nuclear meltdown. Prison officials have designated a new convict Snake Plisken (Kurt Russell) to take the deadly assignment. A reluctant Snake takes the assignment but he's given something by the warden (Lee Van Cleef) that'll force him to co-operate.After hang gliding inside the prison. Snake uses a transmitter that's supposed to lead him to the President's body. But all he finds is a drunk who's wearing the President's transmitter. Whilst searching the city, Snake finds a few allies (Harry Dean Stanton, Adrienne Barbeau, Ernest Borgnine) who'll help him for a promise of release. We learn that most of the convicts are followers of a mad man who calls himself The Duke (Issac Hayes). But he's captured by the Duke and is brutalized by a nasty man (Ox Baker) before he has to suck it up and kill the dude. Snake fights his way out of New York Penal Colony. He survives with the President, but at what cost? His friends are dead and the President shrugs them off and addressed the nation and the world. With the President is a brief case that has a message on an audio cassette that'll save the world. The President and his men look for the tape but they can't find it (That was the whole purpose of the mission, not to rescue the President but the find the tape). While they continue to search for it, Snake pulls the cassette from his pocket and yanks out the precious ribbon and rips it to shreds. The fate of the World lied with it. A somber Snake walks off into the darkness of night.Awesome! If you ever wanted to see a cool nihilistic action film, then look no further. John Carpenter would later create an even more depressing film with his remake of THE THING.Highly recommended.",Escape from New York
71,elshikh4,"Not enjoyable, but interesting !",6,6 March 2012,"This is no enjoyable movie. Look at it.Kurt Russell as Snake Plissken spent all the time imitating poorly Clint Eastwood's man-with-no-name; the reference book of his anti-heroic character, though I thought that he was more like Steven Seagal; with the same whispering voice and dead performance! I didn't find anything different in Russell's character, except his eye patch, and filthy talk sometimes. Isaac Hayes was more pathetic. OH MY GOD, here's the most trivial evil guy ever appeared on screen. He had nothing to do, or to say, but winking by his eye hysterically (Was he mute?). Again, I didn't find anything different in his character, except his Cadillac with chandeliers on it!There is no actual dialogue, because there are no roles. The conversations of Russell and Lee Van Cleef were tasteless, with no one-liners or smart antics, so when the latter tells the first at last: ""How we can make a good couple"", I didn't know what in god's name he was talking about! At the climax, the weakest character around - the American president - was the one who saved Plissken, and the day, by shooting down the bad guy; so in terms of Plissken being anti-hero, does anti-hero here mean no-hero?!! The tape's content was never revealed or understood. The lead's moral speech to the president at the end seemed out of place, forced and leaning on thin air; since the ""people"" who died in the road of freeing and saving the president weren't people in the first place; they were cardboard characters, with no real patriotism or any clearness.The bore is powerful, especially when the action is nonexistent. Frankly, and shockingly, this is an action movie without any action. And when there is any, it's done too weak it's embarrassing (the fistfight at the train station for example). Carpenter just filled it with dark streets, wrecked buildings, many thugs, and that's it. The editing is heavy-handed, with not much to meditate on, let alone that we're supposed to be in an ACTION! Carpenter's music was the worst music you can dance to in a 70s disco. Indistinct was its main mark. And when he put it on the so-called action scenes, it increased their bad campiness!I liked the main ambition as a thriller / action / sci-fi, with ""you have only 24 hours to finish the task, otherwise you'll be killed"". I liked the taste of it as a kind of futuristic western with melancholic world. And I liked some of the cinematography; it was elegantly dirty at most of the time. It did draw my attention while using the Steadicam (the shot of going out Brain's home). But overall, all of what I liked was pure colors for a very good painting which I didn't enjoy, rather see. For instance, did the Steadicam serve the action?, or - ha ha beforehand - the story?!Nevertheless, it ranked as a big hit at its time. It was produced by $ 6 million to earn $ 50 million; that's more than 8 times its budget, which - in a way - makes it more successful than (Titanic - 1997). So despite that it artistically doesn't ""have"" it, sure it ""has"" another thing; some secret appeal to it, which did make it interesting to the audiences of 1981.Firstly, its formula: cool looking anti-hero + apocalyptic dark future + no law + tortured but humiliated American president (proved to be something always cool for the American viewers!) + rescuing on the nick of time. Apparently all of that, as merely the plot's skeleton, worked.Plus, maybe - at the moment - the Americans needed Snake Plissken as a mix of so cold soldier-to-criminal ""man with no name"", peevish anti-authority Dirty Harry, with touches of being a war machine like in-the-future Rambo which this movie is a prophecy of (Rambo would show up firstly in ""First Blood - 1982"" to be a real Vietnam vet, not a shadow of it). That mix was an appropriate son of the missed up America of the 1970s, and a good reaction towards its heavy scandals and defeats; like Watergate, and Vietnam. By the way, Carpenter wrote the script in the mid-'70s, as a reaction to the Watergate scandal.Although deep down inside Plissken is a good guy, but with having very personal moral codes, and being against the system that betrayed him. So when he does the forced official mission successfully, he doesn't forget to serve his own, almost nihilist, goals. He's a black point in the government's white image, yet a light black point in his ""so black"" version of the same image. Ahh, the 1970s was cruel, and needed as - or more - cruel lead I presume.Also, it has what we can call apparent subliminal messages: America is desolate and ruinous, being run by craven clerk. Its streets are full of loose crime, while the possible heroes are the ones in jail. But ultimately, the satiric substance wasn't solid, and the surface B movie wasn't good either.So yes, (Escape from New York) is one of the most successful movies that John Carpenter ever made, and one of his worst too. The best part is that he went to remedying it while remaking it through the sequel (Escape from L.A. - 1996) which had almost all of its antecedent's plot points, characters, and end, yet done way Way WAY better. The thing is while being more enjoyable, (..from L.A.) was less interesting, passing as another violent actioner, without any original formula, clickable lead or satire.For many people, it clicked at its time. But **for me**, **now**, this is pale and dated fun. Rating it highly, along with enjoying it, can be exclusively American I believe.",Escape from New York
72,BeneCumb,A good sci-fi action - especially when considering the year of release,8,17 February 2013,"Of course, later 1980ies and more recent decades have seen better elaborated movies, mainly due to much more enhanced technological possibilities. Nevertheless, Escape from New York is not embarrassing to watch even at present as focusing on future allowed exploiting significant features of that period as less as possible. The venue - depleted New York governed by the scum of society - seems realistic, Kurt Russell as Snake Plissken is convincing; the rest of the cast is strong as well and includes some catchy performances (e.g., Ernest Borgnine as Cabbie and Frank Doubleday as Romero). The plot has some shortcomings, but it is no profound movie for art's sake anyway, so they do not become annoying. Thus, the movie can be recommended to younger generations as well.",Escape from New York
73,thinker1691,""" Hi Snake, . . . I heard you were dead!""",8,30 June 2007,"Many fans of Kurt Russell were extremely surprised he emerged from his years as a child actor to evolve into a believable, hard hitting, action hero. True, he was traditionally recognized to many for his whimsical, good-looks and high school persona. Thus when movie-goers saw him in this film, many stood aghast at his mature tenor. This futuristic story begins with the President's plane being high-jacked by rebel extremists and flown into the island city of New York which has been transformed into a maximum prison. The plane with the president (Donald Pleasence) on board crashes into the prison and it falls to the warden/Police Commissioner, one, Bob Hauk, (Lee Van Cleef) to rescue the chief executive. His plan? To send in a new convict, an experienced ex-soldier and special ops veteran, named, Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) with the promise of a presidential pardon if he can return him alive. To insure the clever criminal does not take the opportunity to escape, he is given a lethal injection which can only be removed by the commissioner's medical staff. Thus, begins a timely drama which means life or death for the hero, the president and ultimately the world. The success of this film owes much to the film's other characters like the talkative Cabbie (Ernest Borgnine, terrific acting), Harold ' Brain' Helman (Harry Dean Stanton), his 'squeeze' Maggie (Adrienne Barbeau) and Isaac Hayes, who plays the heavy, The Duke of New York.

75,freemantle_uk,B-Movie Schlock...,8,17 December 2009,"...but it's good schlock. Escape from New York is possibly John Carpenter's most well know film, along side Halloween. It was a popular hit at the time, and helped make Kurt Russell into a star. Escape from New York has now become a cult hit for younger generations and film fans (especially fans of B-Movies).In 1997 America ends up having a problem with raising levels of crime, and in the middle of a war with the Soviet Union and China. To solve the crime problem New York has become the largest prison in the world, where no one can get in or out. New York itself becomes a lawless city where anything goes. Whilst flying to Hartford, Air Force One is hijacked by a left-wing terrorist, and crashes it in the middle of the prison city. The President (Donald Pleasence) manages to escape, but ends up getting captured by some of the prisoners. There threaten to kill the president if there is any military attempt to free him. The Government need to free him in 24 hours to keep the prospect of peace alive. The warden of the prison (Lee Van Cleef) comes up with one opinion, to send in special-forces veteran/convicted criminal 'Snake' Plissken (Kurt Russell). He describes himself as 'not giving a sh*t', but gets talked in the mission. It becomes a race against time for Snake to save the President from very hostile forces led by the Duke of New York (Issac Hayes) (a possibly subtle reference to the novel A Clockwork Orange?).The plot is pretty thin, but with a film like this, plot isn't the most important think. This is a film about the set pieces, and there some good action based ones. It is also about the characters, John Carpenter setting out to make memorable ones. Snake Plissken is a cool character, with Kurt Russell obviously bases his performance on Clint Eastwood's characters The Man With No Name and Harry Callahan. His so-called uncaring attitude is what makes him an appealing character. We also have another master of cool, Issac Hayes to help with blaxploitation type character: always fun to see. To add balance to the film is Donald Pleasence, the man famous for being the best Blofied and staring in The Great Escape. He is a talented actor, gave the film a bit of galvanise. However the big question is why did the president of the United State have an English accent? I liked the aspect seeing how New York would have delayed, with many people turning against each other, falling into anarchy. There are hints The Warriors and A Clockwork Orange in this film.There are some logically questions to the film's own internal reality, but you have to pull them aside to enjoy the film. The obvious would be why didn't the military just go into the city straight, or why was New York turned into a prison, and where did the citizens go? But that's just nitpicking.A worthy film for B-Movie fans.",Escape from New York

I know it's just-a-movie, but, all the same, what a dumb idea having the US government turn the 22-square-mile island of Manhattan into an ultimate maximum security prison. ( Such a big space, yet, all I saw, at the most, was maybe 200 prisoners, in all) Like, isn't NYC America's most beloved, most historically important, most architecturally diverse city in their entire nation!? Isn't it!!??And, yet, here in Escape From New York, this city-of-all-cities is given completely over to the absolute scum of the earth to do with it whatever they please. And, of course, they trash it.Now, that's what I call a really-Really-REALLY (!!) dumb idea for a movie's setting.And, it really figures that this utter stupidity for this film's setting came out of the head of that nit-wit director John Carpenter, who clearly has no knack for building or sustaining drama, terror, or suspense, whatsoever.I think that Carpenter is nothing but a self-deluded amateur who just happened to hit it lucky with 1978's Halloween. And, from that point onwards, he has continued to ride on its success throughout the entire duration of his career as a director of one dud after another.I also thought that wimp-actor, Kurt Russell, as Snake Plissken (the sneering, one-eyed, bad-boy, master-criminal), really sucked. Russell is totally pathetic in tough-guy roles. He's all puppy-dog bark and no pit-bull bite.It really killed me that even though this film's story covered a 24-hour period, only once (at about the half-way point) did the sun actually shine. Otherwise the action was all shot in the darkness of night. This, I'm sure, was probably a directorial ploy of Carpenter's which allowed him an easy way to hide all of this film's many glaring visual flaws.Oh, yeah - And after all is said and done - It's at the finale when Snake finally gets to say his piece to the US president.

The storyline takes place in the future, 1997, when New York has been turned into a prison. One day the president's plane crashes in New York and the largest gang holds him hostage. A convicted robber is sent in to save him and will need to fight his way in and out of the city to have any chance of accomplishing his mission.

The storyline and concept for this movie was so innovative, unique and action packed. Their depiction of New York was awesome. Isaac Hayes was a great villain and as you can tell by the cast every character was well executed and delivered. The props and weapons were also very good as were the fights and action sequences. Snake is such a well delivered character and easy to root for...a villain that is also a hero. His one-liners are classic. The ending keeps the audience at the edge of their seats right till the credits. Overall this is a classic gem that is worth your time that I'd score a 9/10.",Escape from New York

Upon closer examination of the films story and characters, you will see that it is showing us a frightening depiction of what America could have become had not our society improved.  It's completely ironic that we would have ended up choosing New York City (and later Los Angeles in the sequel), which in this country are landmark cities, as the last place to house America's worst criminals.  With all of the problems currently facing our society, is this what things could have eventually come to?""Escape from New York"" is set in the future, in the year 1997.  We learn that Manhattan Island has become a giant maximum-security prison.  It is completely surrounded on all sides by a fifty-foot containment wall that has soldiers patrolling it at all times.  All roads and waterways that lead off of the island are mined.  The prison itself is kept under constant watch from security headquarters, which is stationed at nearby Liberty Island. Everyone in the prison follows one simple rule: once you go in, you don't come out.  When Air Force One, which we should all know is the president's airplane, is hijacked and crash lands inside the prison, the security officials in charge blackmail a hardened but highly decorated war hero who is currently on his way to the island to serve a life sentence for a daring robbery.  His mission is to infiltrate the prison and safely escort the president and the tape recording in his possession off of the island.  To ensure that the convict doesn't try to escape, two micro-charges are injected into his arteries that if he doesn't get the president back within twenty-two hours, will explode.  If he does succeed, the charges will be deactivated and all crimes he has been convicted of will be fully pardoned. And so the adventure begins...From here we really don't know what to expect of this film and that's good. You'd probably be expecting to hear car horns or the sounds of a city that is alive and full of people.  When we first see New York, it looks a lot like a ghost town, meaning as in dead.  The city is crawling with rapists, thieves and murderers.  Things in the city have become so bad, that some groups of people, most notably the ""crazies"" who are a group of underground subway-dwellers, have had to resort to cannibalism to survive.  The ""new"" New York is not a prison at all, but more of an asylum for the worst of the worst.  People here are basically living out death sentences, as that is the equivalent of saying these people are serving out life sentences.  It is really nice that the prison gives you the option of being executed on site, rather than dying somewhere inside the prison where you'll probably end up becoming someone's lunch.  Which would you prefer?Snake Plissken, played here by Kurt Russell, was an excellent choice to play a reluctant hero.  He plays his role very good.  Singer Isaac Hayes makes a great villain here with his role as The Duke of New York.  He is very good too.  It amazes me though about how a man such as himself could have come to power and become the most feared man in ""new"" New York.
""Escape from New York"" is an excellent film that has received a much deserved cult following.  This John Carpenter film is easily one of his best and I really like it.",Escape from New York
79,MBunge,It's too bad more people probably can't appreciate this movie,7,25 July 2011,"Escape From New York is one of those cult classics that probably become harder and harder for people to appreciate as time goes by. Partly that's because its descendants and imitators have grown more and more cartoonish over the years. Partly that's because it represents a sort of cinema storytelling that's been subsumed by cultural and economic changes. Partly its because John Carpenter was so excited to have a decent budget to work with that he was damn sure it was all going to get shown on screen, even if it tended to slow the action down to a crawl. But if you're not a member of today's ADHD movie going audience, this is still a pretty cool flick.In the far flung future of 1997, New York City has been transformed into a giant prison surrounded by a 50 foot high concrete wall. For years, prisoners have been dumped inside and left to fend for themselves while the U.S. Police Force stands guard on the perimeter. The unavoidable complaints of the ACLU apparently don't bother anyone, but the crash of Air Force One inside the city does. Police Commissioner Hauck (Lee Van Cleef) mounts a rescue mission, only to find the President (Donald Pleasance) has been taken prisoner by the Duke of New York (Isaac Hayes).Unable to launch a direct assault without risking the President's life, Hauck send legendary outlaw Snake Plissken (Kurt Russel) into the prison to retrieve the President and a tape cassette of nuclear secrets. If Snake doesn't get the job done in 22 hours so the President can address a summit meeting with Russia and China, tiny explosives in his neck will go off and kill him. With the help of an old partner who now calls himself Brain (Harry Dean Stanton), Brain's girlfriend (Adrienne Barbeau) and a cabbie (Ernest Borgnine) who's way too happy-go-lucky for a guy who's been living inside a violent hellhole of murder and deprivation, Snake has to battle his way through sewer crazies, the Duke's army of thugs and pro wrestler Ox Baker to save himself, the President and the United States. Of course, Snake isn't really all that interested in saving those last two.As I mentioned, there are three basic problems with Escape From New York and only one of them has anything to do with the movie itself.First, even though this is a sci-fi, dystopic action film, it was made at a time when even these sorts of dramas were expected to adhere as close to reality as possible. So, Snake Plissken isn't some superhuman killing machine who slaughters scores of people while making clever quips and sprinting headlong from one kinetic madhouse of violence to another. He mainly sneaks around superior forces and has only one really big fight scene. The whole thing is rather restrained by modern standards, especially for such an over the top premise.Secondly, this film reflects and projects 1970's attitudes about urban decay and societal disintegration that don't resonate all that well after decades of gentrification and falling crime rates. Oddly enough, some viewers might still respond to the surface politics of the story, but I don't believe it can truly connect in a deeper, instinctual way as it could in the early 80s.Thirdly, director John Carpenter wanted every single person who watched Escape From New York to notice the wonderful and expansive scenery that he could afford when he made it. You can understand why a guy from the world of low budget filmmaking would get caught up in that, but the advances in special effects have eliminated how impressive such scenes would have been to people who had never seen that sort of thing in this sort of movie. Now, it only seems like the camera lingers for an excessively long time on the desolate appearance of the Big Apple circa 1997.On the positive side, this film is a lot like Highlander. Even with its flaws, it creates an incredibly interesting reality populated with compelling characters. If it had been made a few years later when the infrastructure of geek culture was more established, this thing might have spawned an immediate series of sequels and a long running TV show, instead of a big budget sequel too long delayed to have any relevance to the cultural zeitgeist.Snake Plissken is cool. The police state world he inhabits is cool. A story that ends with the hero nihilistically throwing away society's last chance at survival is cool. Unfortunately, Escape From New York is probably a little too dated for a lot of folks to appreciate how cool it is.",Escape from New York
80,Fluke_Skywalker,"Lean, mean dystopian machine",7,13 October 2020,"John Carpenter's cult classic has less fat than a super model. Clocking in a smidge over 90 minutes (sans credits), it gets right down to business and never lets up. It's not that it's non stop action so much as it just takes off at a sprint and never stops to catch its breath or take the scenic route.Populated with the kinds of actors who take to this genre like its their Shakespeare, Escape from New York does an outstanding job of creating the immaculate reality of this askew view New York where the line between hero and villain is razor thin and blurred to boot.I don't suppose the basic logic of the universe created here holds up to much scrutiny, but this isn't the sort of film you overanalyze, despite its purported ""commentary"". You just need to buckle up and enjoy the madness, and I certainly did.",Escape from New York
81,barnabyrudge,Diverting futuristic actioner.,5,7 July 2007,"John Carpenter's low budget cult film has a terrific premise and cast, but the narrative is a little too episodic for comfort. Carpenter's vision of the future is bleak to say the least  society has become cold and cynical; the prison system has failed; even the supposed ""good guys"" have few redeeming qualities. For those of a pessimistic inclination there should be enough in this futuristic actioner to draw them in.In 1997, Manhattan has become a self-contained prison populated by the meanest life-term criminals. The city is surrounded by guarded walls; helicopters fly overhead monitoring the activities of the inmates on the ground; land mines make escape all-but impossible. Within this dangerous urban prison, things are run by The Duke Of New York (Isaac Hayes), a feared warlord of crime. A plane carrying the American president (Donald Pleasance) crash-lands in Manhattan where he is quickly taken hostage by the roaming gangs. Police Commissioner Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef) is faced with the impossible task of getting the president out alive. He enlists the aid of a recently captured criminal, Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell), offering him a pardon for his previous crimes if he will go into the urban hell-hole and rescue the president. Plissken agrees, but his mission is complicated further when an explosive on a 24-hour timer is injected into his neck to ensure that he doesn't use the whole affair as an opportunity to escape. As he makes his way through the debris-strewn streets, Plissken picks up various travelling companions  among them Cabbie (Ernest Borgnine), Brain (Harry Dean Stanton), and Maggie (Adrienne Barbeau)  that aid and hinder him in his quest.It is rare for a Carpenter film to have such an A-list cast. Russell makes the most of his tough anti-hero role, memorable for his charismatic eye-patch and minimal (but cool) dialogue. Van Cleef also has a sizable role and delivers it well; but the likes of Borgnine, Pleasance, Hayes, Stanton and Barbeau aren't given enough to get their teeth into  their characters simply follow Plissken around aimlessly, and have little bearing on the plot. Carpenter again provides his own music, a simple synthesised score that is quite effective if a little repetitive. The production design is pretty good within the budgetary limitations, with suitably crumbling sets that create the impression of a once-great neighbourhood in ruin. There are flashes of excitement along the way, including a fight-to-the-death with nail-embedded clubs and a tense nick-of-time climax. Indeed, the film could never be accused of being slow or boring, even if in parts it is somewhat repetitious. On the whole Escape From New York is an adequate, diverting action flick. A little over-rated by some reviewers, perhaps, but you could spend your time on a lot worse.",Escape from New York
82,lukem-52760,GREAT LATE-NIGHT ENTERTAINMENT,9,2 August 2018,"ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK has become one of my favourite movies but it's not perfect but it's well made & so relevant today in 2019!!!
The world is a dark evil place full of scum & corruption so in a fantasy way Escape from New York has almost really happened in some places!!!
Also Snake Plisskin is in my top 5 favourite movie characters & stands next to Paul Kersey (Bronson) from the fantastic Death Wish franchise & Dr. Dan Challis (Tom Atkins) from Halloween 3 season of the witch (1982) among others.
One BIG mistake with this otherwise fantastic film is the time scale, Snake has one night to get the president back but it became morning in some scenes (the Wrestling Ring Fight) & then it's suddenly night time again? It definitely reached Morning Light in other scenes & that would've meant Snake was outta time & would've failed completely? A huge plot hole & Mistake right there & that's why i couldn't give this flick a full 10/10.Snake is the type of real gritty tough guy you need in a world this messed up!!!
He's tough & deadly but not evil & that separates him from the real nasty evil scum out there!!!
This is John Carpenters masterpiece.Pure enjoyable entertainment &
Awesome fun,a late night sci-fi Adventure Thriller with the BRILLIANT Kurt Russell in his most iconic role ever as the tough Snake Plisskin & he's amazing in this simply amazing!!! This is another classic from one of the greatest & most influential directors of all time the king JOHN CARPENTER & once again he drops us into a very atmospheric world of danger & this time it's New York City that's now become a no go zone prison!!! We all know the incredible iconic story so not talking about that.The look of this movie is AMAZING thanks to the great DEAN CUNDY who worked with Carpenter alot & here cundy gives the film a dark,menacing shadow filled gloomy look & when you get light it's often some glowing Neon light & it really shines & stands out it's really stunning!!!
Kurt Russell is Fantastic as always & really plays his lone tough guy role perfectly,snake is smart,weary & quick.
I love Kurt Russell & love the guy even more as Snake Plisskin, one of my fave film characters of all time, along with Ray Stantz (Ghostbusters 1&2), Paul Kersey (Death Wish franchise) & a few other's.All the cast are great in their roles & make an impressive ensemble cast with kurt.
New York City the prison looks Amazing & is now iconic.
The music is outstanding throughout thanks to the multi talented CARPENTER.Escape from New York is in my all time top 10 fave movies list.
Everything about this night time Adventure is great movie making & the type of exciting movie that you don't get anymore.
An exciting night time,grimy futuristic Thriller that gets better every time i watch it & i can't get enough of that dangerous dark & grimy apocalyptic Atmosphere & the sense of lost in a messed up world feel that our characters exist in especially Snake Plisskin!!!
Escape from New York has most in common with Blade Runner i think as both are dark,moody futuristic Noir Thriller's with a real sense of complete loss & loneliness for our main characters Snake & Deckard & with the music for both movies it really gives us a sense of that hopelessness & how do i fit in to this dark world feel & tone & that's very powerful for a movie to give us that emotion.
A true cult classic masterpiece
& easily my favourite film of all time.
A true carpenter classic full of his classic atmosphere & dark look!!!
I think Halloween (1978),The Fog (1980) & Escape from New York (1981) are Carpenters masterpieces his Classic Trilogy of films.ANOTHER of my favourite movie characters is also from the Carpenter universe it's Dr.Dan Challis (tom atkins) from the cult classic Halloween 3 season of the witch (1982) that Carpenter was producer of & done the incredible music for.
Carpenter has created some of the greatest flawed & unusual anti-hero characters in movie history.
Great gritty fun",Escape from New York
83,hu675,"One of the best movies of John Carpenter, there's a reason why this is a cult classic today.",9,6 July 2008,"The world has changed into a dark and cruel world by 1988, every year the crime rates went higher. Now most major cities has become an maximum security prison. Now in 1997, New York City has become an top security prison. Since some of the most dangerous criminals in the world are sent there for live, although there's some good people find themselves stuck in that prison. When an Air Force One crash landed in the middle of the city, while the President of the United States (Donald Pleasence) escaped from a pod but the president finds himself quickly kidnapped by criminals. The ""New York"" Special Police needs a man, who knows his way around the city and without getting caught. Bob Hawk (Lee Van Cleef) sends a former Special Forces turned Career Criminal (Kurt Russell) named Snake Plissken. They asked him to find the president in 24 hours or less, if he succeed to become a free man or die. But once, Snake finds himself in the city. He finds the mission more difficult than he thought and he's running against time.Directed by John Carpenter (Assault on Precient 13, The Fog, Halloween) made an entertaining, dark, futuristic Sci-Fi adventure with plenty of action and dark comedy. Russell is terrific as the anti-hero Snake Plissken. Which that character remind one of the most popular cult figures of the movies of filmmaker:Carpenter. Oscar-Winner:Ernest Borgnine, Oscar-Winner:Issac Hayes, Harry Dean Stanton, Adrienne Barbeau, Season Hubley, Frank Doubleday, Tom Atkins and Charles Cyphers in memorable supporting roles as well. For ambitious low-budget project, this feature is well produced. Since the special effects still looks good with great model work and excellent matte paintings. Which it's one of the best looking movies in the 1980's. ""Escape from L.A."", i felt the special effects has dated much more than this picture.From the Two Disc DVD ""Special Edition"" Set.The first DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Disc 1 includes the original Laserdisc commentary track by director:Carpenter and actor:Russell. Which it is certainly one of the most enjoyable commentaries around. There's an new commentary track also by the late Debra Hill (The Dead Zone, The Fisher King, World Trade Center) and production designer Joe Alves (Jaws 1 & 2, Close Encounters of the Third Kind). Disc 2 includes an new featurette with the cast & crew, the long awaited Deleted Scene with optional commentary by Carpenter & Russell, Photo Gallery and more. Although the special features in Disc 2 are good but they are disappointing short. I wish the featurette was much more longer. All those special features from Disc 2 could have been fitted in disc 1 for sure.""Escape from New York"" is still great looking movie for all over the years. Because the intriguing premise still works, there's great character moments from the cast, the visual style is outstanding and the music from John Carpenter and Alan Howarth is memorable. The sequel ""Escape from L.A."" is watchable but it's much campy version of the original. Now there's rumors of the upcoming remake of the original with Josh Brolin being a possible lead role for Snake Plissken. Since the three previous Carpenter remakes were not so successful in storytelling or at the box office (""The Fog"" remake was the worst). I think ""Escape from New York"" is Carpenter's third best movie. My favorite from Carpenter is ""Halloween"" and ""The Thing"". I just wish Carpenter would make a movie soon, it's been too long since ""Ghosts of Mars"". If you haven't seen it but heard of this for many years. See it now, you won't regret it. Written by Carpenter and Nick Castle (The Boy Who Could Fly, Dennis the Menace, Mr. Wrong). Listen closely to Jamie Lee Curtis' narration in the opening sequence.

84,Samuel-Shovel,"Good Premise, Poor Execution",6,17 April 2017,"This is a movie that I'd actually be okay with Hollywood remaking. The premise is solid but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. It has a weak script that starts slow, picks up speeds in the middle, and then loses complete control down the stretch. The significance of the tape is never significantly explained, why Snake decides to destroy is a bit convoluted (because the President was non-appreciative I guess?). None of the characters are fully fleshed out, even Snake is fairly one-dimensional. Why does everyone assume he's dead? Why does everyone know him? What's Snake & Brain's relationship before this movie? I'm shocked this movie is 1 hour 39 minutes because, even though I just finished watching it, I can't imagine what we were doing the entire time! All the acting is fine, nothing to shout about though. The set design is pretty good. I wish we could have spent more time in New York and less time messing around in the Army base. I also wish we would have spent a lot more time learning about the different gangs in New York? We barely know anything about The Duke's gang. Who are those people on Broadway chucking bricks at the cars? Who are the people coming out of the sewers, these Crazies? Who are these Tribesmen roaming around the World Trade Center? So many loose ends that I would like to have seen cleared up. There's a lot of promise here but the payout is not great.",Escape from New York
85,dworldeater,Action packed classic,10,12 February 2015,"Escape From New York is the second collaboration between writer/director John Carpenter and actor Kurt Russell. This film and the one they did next, The Thing are in my opinion the strongest films of the five times they worked together, as well as my personal favorites. In this dark, dystopian science fiction/action flick, the government is a fascist police state and the island of Manhattan is a walled off prison and once you come in, you don't come out. The president, played by Donald Pleasance was in a plane that was shot down while flying above the island and is held hostage. The outlaw Snake Plisken(Kurt Russell) is an ex war hero and the hardest man on Earth. He is sent by The Man to retrive the dumb ass president and his cassette tape that is needed for his speech in 22 hours for a summit meeting with The Soviet Union and China. This dark and subversive classic is set up much like a western and Kurt approaches his character much like Clint Eastwood would have done. Also police chief Hauk is played by legend Lee Van Cleef and The Wild Bunch star Ernest Borgnine appears as Cabbie as well. Character actor Harry Dean Stanton is The Brain and Carpenter's very talented wife at the time, Adrienne Barbeau is Brain's squeeze and has a huge rack. Kurt's wife at that time, Season Hubley is also cast, only as a cameo, but a memorable one that I totally approve of. Super cool cat Isaac Hayes is The Duke Of New York our main villain and bad ass that has the president hostage and runs the show in NY. John Carpenter also crafted one of his signature scores that is dark and ominous and creates great ambiance for the film. Although this film was made for little money it was a very influential and original for its time and John Carpenter is a genius for putting it all together and Kurt did an outstanding job in carrying the film as well. The social commentary is still relevant today, especially in the post 9/11 world where The United States is engaged in constant war, police are unaccountable for misconduct and there are more people in prison here than anywhere else in the world. I hope this film does not get remade, but even if Justin Bieber is cast as Snake Plisken, this film will hold up.",Escape from New York
86,Witchfinder-General-666,One of Carpenters Best,9,26 March 2010,"John Carpenter is a filmmaker who knows how to make gritty, tense, action-packed entertainment, and the spectacular dystopian action film ""Escape from New York"" (1981) is doubtlessly one of his greatest achievements, and arguably one of the coolest, most influential cult gems of the 80s. Along with the fantastic Australian ""Mad Max"" franchise, ""Escape from New York"" basically created the popularity of apocalyptic action films in the 80s - the many films inspired by ""Mad Max"" being set in post-apocalyptic wastelands, those inspired by ""Escape from NY"" being set in anarchic dystopian urban settings. As Mad Max (especially in the greatest part ""Mad Max 2 - The Road Warrior""), Kurt Russel's ""Escape from NY"" protagonist Snake Plissken is the epitome of an anti-hero.Carpenter creates a dark future Manhattan, which, in 1997, is a max security prison. Fully inhabited by convicts, and without influence from the outside world, Manhattan has obtained its own anarchic structures and society. All inhabitants have been sentenced to life imprisonment - once in Manhattan, there is no going back. World War III is near the end. When terrorist make the plane of the US President (Donald Pleasence) crash into Manhattan shortly before a peace conference, he is immediately taken hostage. US Police force commissioner Hauck (Lee Van Cleef) offers the super-tough convict and former special forces soldier Snake Plissken (Kurt Russel) a chance for a pardon. Plissken has to enter Manhattan and return with the living president within 24 hours. Should he succeed, he will get a full pardon. Should he fail, microscopic explosives he has been injected with will go off and tear his arteries apart...Snake Plissken must be one of the coolest and most iconic anti-hero characters of American cinema and Russel was the perfect man to play him. The super-tough bad-ass who sports an eye-patch and a snake-tattoo on his stomach (for some reason it was moved to his arm on the poster) has a constant 'f*** the world' attitude and solely fights for his own freedom. The rest of the cast includes a variety of GREAT actors: Lee Van Cleef, Donald Pleasence, Isaac Hayes (who plays the 'Duke' an underworld kingpin and boss of Manhattan), Ernest Borgnine, Harry Dean Stanton, as well as Carpenter's then-wife Adrienne Barbeau (as a sexy and lethal prostitute) all are fantastic in their roles. Van Cleef (one of my favorite actors) doubtlessly had his greatest moments in Spaghetti Westerns such as Sergio Sollima's ""La Resa Dei Conti"" (""The Big Gundown"") and Sergio Leone's masterpieces ""For A Few Dollars More"" (1965) and (above all) ""The Good, the Bad and The Ugly"" (1966). This is probably the most notable non-Western film he was ever part of. Donald Plesence (another favorite actor of mine) is great as the hypocrite President, and Isacc Hayes is equally fantastic as the supremely bad-ass 'Duke'.""Escape from New York"" is a hard-boiled, violent and action-packed film that is great in terms of action, effects, acting, etc, but personally I bear the opinion that the most fantastic thing about the film is the brilliant scenario of an entire futuristic prison city. The film is wonderfully shot, cinematography and settings are simply awesome and Carpenter's own score is, as always, memorable and tension-increasing. ""Escape from New York"" is, simply put, as entertaining as it gets, and an absolute must-see for all fans of cult-cinema, sci-fi and hard-boiled action. A remake is planned for 2011, which of course will be utter crap like the entire rotten overload of terrible remakes of classic films that Hollywood is torturing us with. Watch this fantastic original and have a blast - over and over again. One of Carpenters best.",Escape from New York
87,I_Ailurophile,An essential sci-fi thriller,10,3 March 2021,"'Escape from New York' is a film that, 40 years later, still hardly needs an introduction. It's an incredible dystopian classic, a thriller that has aged very well and feels dated only because technology has advanced.Snake Plissken is a decorated soldier turned outlaw who, in the distant future of 1997, finds himself on a one-way trip to the maximum security prison called Manhattan. When Air Force One is hijacked, and the president's escape pod lands inside the ruined city, he's given the opportunity for a pardon if he can effect a rescue.From the very opening scene of the film, showing viewers an attempted escape, we catch a glimpse of what was New York, and find out how grim this future is. That dystopian vision only comes into greater focus as the narrative begins for real, and we see the new society that prisoners and outcasts have created in the cordoned-off ruins of the old.New York is populated by the likes of Cabbie, a friendly and irrepressibly joyful cab driver, played enthusiastically by Ernest Borgnine. There's Brain, an experienced, intelligent engineer portrayed by Harry Dean Stanton - and Maggie, Brain's put-upon ""girlfriend,"" played by Adrienne Barbeau. And of course there's the big man himself, The Duke of New York, A-#1, given life with a quietly menacing coolness and by Isaac Hayes.But this is a very large cast, and certainly we can't overlook the president, played with a nervous energy by the great Donald Pleasence; nor can we forget the police commissioner Bob Hauk, portrayed by the legendary Lee Van Cleef. And of course Snake Plissken is one of the most iconic roles of Kurt Russell, who returned to the role for the 1996 sequel 'Escape from L.A.' Russell gives our antihero such a believable air of tired contempt that our eyes would be glued to him even if he weren't the star. Snake is a fantastic character, and no one could ever breathe life into the role the way that Russell does.And we're still not done discussing the cast, as it also includes repeat Carpenter collaborators including Nancy Stephens, Tom Atkins, Charlie Cyphers, and George Buck Flower. Even Jamie Lee Curtis has a small role to play as the narrator providing a voiceover at the beginning of the feature - and renowned voice actor Rodger Bumpass has a brief moment of screentime, too, in one of his earliest credits.All these names would amount to nothing if the screenplay weren't solid, but it absolutely is. Written by Carpenter and Nick Castle, we're given near-constant suspense and tension along with thrilling action as Snake explores the streets of Manhattan. The dialogue is smart and impactful, with more than a few sneering one-liners from Snake especially. The plot isn't convoluted, but there are still plentiful turns that would help to keep the audience engaged even if we didn't have everything else to see on screen.As we've rather come to expect from Carpenter over the years, the climax of the film is riveting, filled with as much suspense and action as the entire rest of the feature. The conclusion is deeply satisfying, hammering home with great finality the personality of the antihero the movie has focused on. Even as the credits roll, we're ready to watch it again.The score was once again composed by Carpenter himself and is very befitting for the picture. The main theme, of course, is a true classic, intoning in some sense a bit of the wary resignation of the dystopian society we're viewing, and of the protagonist we're following. Carpenter's music is as essential a part of his movies as the atmosphere and suspense, and 'Escape from New York' is one of his very best works.It's a bit violent at points, and surely not the type of movie for everyone. But it's a major part of John Carpenter's legacy, and I'd argue important to cinema in general for the fact of the characters we meet and the witty dialogue and character interactions that litter the screenplay. 'Escape from New York' is a finely made thriller that I would recommend to all, and anyone with even a passing interest in the genre needs to watch it as much in 2021 as they did in 1981.And good luck with ever again getting ""Bandstand boogie"" out of your head.",Escape from New York
88,aidanratesmovies,Carpenter and Russell shine yet again,9,20 November 2020,"Yet another hit from John Carpenter, Escape From New York may be a little slow at times, but there is no denying how uniquely original and well thought out this little sci-fi adventure can be. First off, Kurt Russell is fantastic in this film. I have always been a fan of Russell since the first moment I saw him on screen, but here he really outdoes himself. Russell plays the lead, a character that goes by the name of Snake, and he is as cool as you could possibly imagine. The film can be a little tropey at times, a little slow at others, but it certainly proves to be very interesting throughout- allowing just enough suspense, action, and adventure to have you interested until the very end. Carpenter does a great job directing the film, as well as writing it along with Nick Castle. I enjoy the screen play a lot, and although it does seem a bit muttled at times in terms of execution, I found the final product to still be quite riveting. The music in the film is also rather good, which also happens to be done by Carpenter. In the end, Escape From New York may not be the best action flick I have seen, nor sci-fi, but it'll certainly be one I will always remember.
My Rating: 9/10",Escape from New York
89,Agent10,"Decent film to watch, but not enough action",6,4 April 2005,"John Carpenter's history of making bad films is quite know, so when you watch this movie, you'll wonder why he didn't try building off this film instead of making garbage like Big Trouble in Little China. He had a good run at this point with Escape..., The Thing, and Starman, which shows there is some talent in that noodle of his.Escape From New York was really a visual treat, taking us to a a piece of New York that had yet to be seen. Kurt Russell appropriately shed his image of Disney teen idol in the very first shot of the film, wearing his eye-patch and funky skin-tight jeans that were outrageous even in the 80s. Sadly, the action in the film seemed to be too far and in between. There was plenty of good ideas, but the lack of a budget kept it from being the truly great film it could have been.",Escape from New York
90,Jonny_Numb,possibly the best B-movie cast ever assembled,7,17 July 2005,"One thing you can't deny director John Carpenter, though his body of work has been wildly erratic in terms of overall quality, is his unbridled chutzpah and vision. ""Escape from New York"" comes from his most prolific period, and isn't at a loss when it comes to bending genres, taking chances, and even injecting some sly satire into the proceedings--he's like George Romero (whose own films ultimately have more to say than their surface qualities portend) with a more jaded sense of humor. In one of those deliciously hokey prologues that seem to be the norm of most science fiction, it is revealed that in 1988 (the 'future') the crime rate has increased by 400%, and New York has been transformed into a sprawling prison-slash-wasteland as a result. In 1997 (the 'future,' again), Air Force One crash-lands inside its perimeter on the eve of an international nuclear summit, and the police commissioner (Spaghetti Western vet Lee Van Cleef) drafts grizzled convict Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell in one of his signature roles) to retrieve the President; successful completion of the task will result in Snake's freedom, while failure will cause two artery-shredding capsules injected into his body to burst. Once inside the city, Snake comes into contact with a variety of colorful characters played by name actors: street-smart Cabbie (Ernest Borgnine, hamming it up), a ruthless dictator known as The Duke (Isaac Hayes), and his right-hand man, Brain (the always enjoyable Harry Dean Stanton). In addition to Van Cleef, the authority figures (who, while representing traditional law and order, are also a source of ridicule for both Carpenter and Plissken) consist of Tom Atkins, Charles Cyphers, and Donald Pleasance as a convincing--yet VERY uncomfortable-looking--President. This is one of Carpenter's best casts, and in the context of such an absurd tale, works wonderfully--neither totally serious nor completely winking, everyone hits a perfect pitch between camp and conviction. And though the action sequences don't seem as spectacular as they no doubt did back in 1981, they still pack a suspenseful charge today, aided by Carpenter's clear vision. Though I believe Carpenter's commentary on the breakdown of society and the logic behind what transforms people into 'monsters' isn't as pungent as in Romero's films, at the same time it's not necessarily his aim to make ""Escape from New York"" a commentary on anything in particular--the note of irony the movie ends on seems to confirm that, and is as good a synopsis as any for a movie that wishes to thrill and entertain, and mostly succeeds.",Escape from New York
91,questl-18592,Escape 1,8,18 January 2021,I weirdly watched these out oof order but they were both a whole lot of wild and crazy fun. I love when Russel was doing these insane action flicks. The man just has a magic on screen that I'm totally into and he has this way of embracing the insanity that I love. I give this one the edge over the sequel simply for a lack of murder basketball but aside from that I think they're both great fun. Awesome double feature that's absolutely worth checking out.,Escape from New York
92,Samiam3,Great Carpenter film,8,15 September 2009,"Due to a higher does of adrenaline, and a larger handful of pyrotechnics, and gunfire I think a lot of critics prefer Escape from L.A. over New York, but not I. This is my Favorite John Carpenter movie. Eerie evocative, yet slick and psychedelic, sometimes even suspenseful. Written in 1980, Carpenter and his partner in crime Dedra Hill set the film in 1997, but the year doesn't matter, just so long as we are aware that it is a future and a time of darkness. Manhattan Island has now become a hellhole where the government dumps criminals and thugs the way the British empire dumped their prisoners in Australia two hundred years ago. No prisoner has ever escaped Manhattan except one, Snake Plisken, one of America's most dangerous criminals. Today is going to be his lucky day (maybe). The Us government gives him a chance to get off. He must infiltrate Manhattan and rescue the president who is being held captive there, he has nineteen hours.Carpenter has a great eye and an equally great ear. What I mean by that latter, is his knowledge of music. His movies have interesting electronic scores which always fit the tone perfectly. The music is never glamorous or operatic like modern summer blockbusters, it is simple and uses the' less is more' principle of art creation. When I say Carpenter has a great eye, I am referring to his mise-en-scene. By balancing all the right elements, he can make New York look absolutely haunting, like a concrete ghost town. It is even more impressive when considering the limited size of the budget. Make no mistake, Escape from New York is a great example of Low-Budget filmaking if approached the right way. Of course it is not perfect, but no film is.",Escape from New York
93,davidmvining,World Building,7,31 August 2021,"There are three movies I most closely associate with my father, The Hunt for Red October, The Great Escape, and Escape from New York. Of the three, I still unabashedly love the first two, but my affection for the third has diminished over the years. I still enjoy it, finding it an entertaining 100 minutes worthy of recommendation, but it also ends up feeling like a lesser Carpenter work, which isn't what I really expected to see when I decided to do this retrospective. This movie is weird, and it's weird in certain ways that kind of rub me the wrong way.In the distant future of 1997 New York City has been turned into the maximum-security prison for the criminal element of America. Walled off and monitored from Liberty Island, the City has become a self-contained society of criminality. Into this flies Air Force One, overtaken by terrorists, crashing into a building with the president (Donald Pleasence) escaping in a pod into the city below. The president gets captured by the Duke of New York (Isaac Hayes) with the threat to kill him if any rescue is attempted. With a ticking clock because of a summit meeting the president was going to involving China and the Soviet Union, the police commissioner Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef) uses the best tool he has to go in clandestinely, Kurt Russell's Snake Plissken.Snake is the center of this movie, and Kurt Russell makes him a wonderful anchor for everything that happens around him. Channeling Clint Eastwood, in particular the Man with No Name, Snake is the epitome of John Carpenter's cynical nihilism. A former decorated Army lieutenant who decided to rob the Federal Reserve in Colorado, Snake has no concern for what's going on around him. His complete dismissiveness at Hauk's offer to save the president is endemic of a generation made cynical by Watergate, seeing nothing worthwhile to save but his own skin, is what ends up making him appealing in this kind of dungy world that Carpenter made real by visiting East St. Louis and filming it. Snake never cares about the mission he has as anything other than a vehicle for his own freedom. He never really connects with anyone, and the man he goes in to explicitly save is as little concerned with Snake as Snake is with him. Snake just wants to get back before his twenty-three hour clock is up and the tiny explosives in his neck go off.I think that's a great place to center a film, but the problems arise around him, especially in how the story is actually built. The movie doesn't seem to have much in terms of actual structure, and after Snake flies his glider into New York, landing on top of the World Trade Center, the story doesn't really seem to have any direction. Snake finds the president's locator beacon on a bum, and he goes and sits down, unsure of what on earth to do next. And yet, at the same time, while this construction feels weird at best, there is something going on at the same time that feels worthwhile, the world building. The introduction of the ""crazies"" that rule the sewar system, coming up out onto the street because it's the end of the month and they're out of food, is interesting. Could it have been included into Snake's story better? I think so, but it's far from worthless.Along the way, Snake meets Ernest Borgnine's Cabbie, and if Cabbie were played by anyone other than Borgnine, I think I'd hate the character. Borgnine brings such a sunny and warm personality to Cabbie, the New York cabbie who's been driving that very same cab for thirty years and comes to Snakes inexplicable rescue not once, but twice, throughout the film. He's loud and brash and disappears from the movie when he feels threatened, but I just find Borgnine's energy and positive attitude every moment he's on screen to be a breath of fresh air in a movie filled with such cynical nihilism.Cabbie takes Snake to see Brain (Harry Dean Stanton), the Duke's scientist, of sorts. Snake, who happens to know Brain (Harold is his real name), threatens to kill both Brain and his girl Maggie (Adrienne Barbeau) if they don't show him to the president. And at about the halfway point of the film. Snake gets to the president, held up in a train car, and immediately gets captured. The story then grinds to a halt as Snake sleeps through the night, after having caught an arrow in the leg, the Duke tortures the president a bit, and Brain tries to figure out how Snake got into the city, eventually figuring it out, deciding he needs the president to ensure his safety if he were to steal the glider. The Duke pits Snake in a gladiatorial bout as a show for his people, and I've always been a fan of this sequence.None of this feels like it fits into how to tell a story, even a weird one about New York becoming a prison and the president needing a rescue, but, as I've said, there are consistent entertainments to be had. The fight is one of those. Snake, injured and unsure of where he is, takes the weapons give to him (a baseball bat and then another baseball bat with nails) and makes the most of his situation against his much stronger and larger opponent. His ultimate victory ends up winning the crowd to his side. It's not exactly a hugely emotionally swelling moment, but it is a satisfying one, seeing our anti-hero triumph in a physical battle.The movie then moves headfirst into its finale with Brain having stolen the president away, getting to the top of the World Trade Center, losing the glider, and Snake catching up. Cornered by the Duke when they get back to the ground, they are rescued by Cabbie who...just...drives up randomly. I can talk about how oddly the movie's structure feels, but Cabbie's two magical appearances to save Snake's life and help move the movie forward (including him having the tape the president had been carrying but had been taken from him by the Duke right when it was most needed) make him feel like a last minute bit of narrative adhesive thrown together in a later draft to get our characters from one place to another. See, if played by almost anyone other than Borgnine, Cabbie would outright anger me because of his mechanical uses in getting the plot moving.The finale also feels too easy, driving over a mined 69th Street Bridge and only hitting a few mines along the way, either having no impact or killing minor characters. The cynical disconnect with anything also prevents any kind of emotional response as these characters begin to die off, and I'm not sure if that's the point or not. Were we supposed to find worth in these people, these common people who are all dying to help the president, worth enough that we would bemoan their loses? Or are we supposed to be completely cynical through it all and feel nothing because they're just meat? I think the movie tries to create this balance between the two, and I don't think it quite lands it.All of that being said, I really do find this film consistently entertaining. The acting is solid all around, especially from Russell and Pleasence. Cleef has fun with his role, and Borgnine makes what would be an awful character fun. The use of the real world locations in East St. Louis provide the film the right kind of ugly realism it needs in order to as fully accomplish Carpenter's dystopian vision as possible on such a modest budget. It does feel like his reach exceeded his grasp overall, like this is the one movie of his where he really did need a much larger budget to completely realize what his imagination was cooking up. The lack of impact of Air Force One's crash is probably the chief effect that really feels missing. Still, I wish this film's script had another couple of drafts to iron stuff out and give it a firmer structure. After its rather great opening, it ends up being more meandering that it probably should be, and I think that diminishes the film's overall impact and entertainment value.",Escape from New York

I saw this awhile ago so I can't really go into specifics as I don't remember a lot but I do remember SOME of it and I just didn't see the appeal.I'm not a major fan of action flicks so maybe that's why but I have enjoyed SOME action movies and was determined to give this a try(the video was actually a birthday gift-long story). Anyway-I was reading some IMDb reviews of this and there was an imdbuser who said this didn't seem like an action flick, it was boring. I agree. I can't remember it scene by scene but I can remember being bored out of my skull. I remember thinking thhere wasn't any warmth to the picture which would be fine if there was something I could get into but there wasn't. The film did seem dated, even when I saw it, and I was pretty detached from the pic after a very short time.That's it, can't say more because I don't remember more frankly, people I've asked have said they like it because it's an incredible action picture so maybe it's just my personal tastes but I was not engaged by this flick at all.",Escape from New York

Thanks to the evil forces driving us to kill each other, the ones who love to do things, play with fire and dance with snakes. But this is more of a study than a film. Notice how they only show the prisoners and guards in these ""Escape from"" films. They never show the people living off of the hard work of the enforcers. They never show them. You need to watch ""They Live"" by the same director to see.. them. Oh, how I wish I can tell you the problem. But you already know, don't you? Now the only question is, are you going to continue to do nothing about it? That is what this film dares to ask you.",Escape from New York
96,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Escape from New York (1981),8,29 December 2011,"John Carpenter's 80's classic is still pretty damn superb. It gives us an awesome antihero, one that's cool without trying too hard. SUch a character is essential here, as the film deals with a man forced to do something against his will. Pride is at stake and not just the life of the president. In some ways it looks at how those we'd consider to be heroes wont always spring into action. The plot is also well paced and delicately set out. The film is certainly lacking in character development as absolutely no one is developed. This is a story about the situation presented to us. This does help the film avoid schmaltzy melodrama, or misguided politics. It's a shooterific action piece with enough ideas to keep you interested.",Escape from New York
97,RainDogJr,"You must know that ""Snake"" is not dead",10,18 December 2007,"Is 1997 and New York is now a prison, when the president's plane crashes into the island Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef) the police commissioner, must get the president out of the island in 24 hours so the president can be in an important meeting for the peace of the world. Hauk left the mission in ""Snake"" Plissken (Kurt Russell), an ex war-hero, with the promise that he would left Snake without any accusation. To make sure that ""Snake"" rescue the president, Hauk implant in him two capsules that will explode within 22 hours.That is the main plot of this sci-fi cult classic of John Carpenter, and for me is one of my favourite stories in sci-films ever. The idea of New York as a prison is nothing but original and really good, and the visual part of this film is really cool; lots of films in this days will die for an environment like the one that Carpenter creates.The cast is great, Kurt Russell makes one of his best performances ever for one of the best characters in sci-fi films: ""Snake"". And with the participation of Lee Van Cleef (The Good, the bad and the ugly), Isaac Hayes as ""The Duke"" and the great Harry Dean Stanton (Paris Texas) as ""Brain"" makes this as a amazing cast that is the perfect complement for the great story of Carpenter.So this is nothing but an exciting film, now a true cult classic and Carpenter teach us that you don't need the biggest budget to make one of the best sci-fi/action films ever because this film budget is $7,000,000 so is nothing if we compare to Hollywood latest films.Conclusion: i highly recommend this cult classic and you must know that ""Snake"" is not dead, prove to that is that 26 years later he is still one of the best characters ever. In the end of the film (which i love) we can see a resume of the personality of ""Snake"" and why he is not the classic hero.DVD: i have a single edition that doesn't contain bonus material so i wish that soon an special edition came in the Region 4.PS: i hear that is coming a remake of this film, i hope this respect the essence of the original and at least Carpenter will be the producer. I like to imagine a director like Robert Rodriguez making this remake.",Escape from New York
98,burlesonjesse5,"Kurt Russell channels his inner Clint Eastwood in 1981's cult classic, Escape From New York",8,9 May 2014,"Unleashed into theaters in the summer of 1981, Escape from New York is a true cult classic. It's a film of heightened originality and it is brought to you from the brilliant mind of director John Carpenter. Inspired by his reaction to the 1970's Watergate scandal (I'm not sure how this movie and Watergate are connected but it doesn't matter), this film depicts a dangerous criminal (Kurt Russell) racing against time to rescue the President of the United States (as well as retrieving a secret government cassette tape with messages on it). The worst part is that the President's plane goes down in Manhattan which in the future is the country's only maximum security prison. As antihero, former war soldier, and badly unshaven convict, Kurt Russell commands the screen as iconic screen legend, Snake ""Plissken"". Doing a sort of younger Clint Eastwood impersonation, he still manages to make the character totally his own. He's helped out by an oddball cast consisting of Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine as a cab driver (huh?), music sensation Isaac Hayes as the antagonistic ""Duke of New York"", and Halloween alum Donald Pleasence as, the President (the flick doesn't give his name). ""Escape"" benefits from being quirky, action packed, and full of great one-liners courtesy of Russell. Yes, the film's special effects are easily outdated, but it's not about the effects per se. It's about Carpenter's terrific direction. He does an adequate job of filming with hardly any light (the shots of light he does use are soft and gleaming which look eerie as can be) and his synthesizer soundtrack (which he composed by the way) is tops all around (the opening title music is awesome, no joke). And as in most of his films (including the one I'm reviewing), he is methodical in character build up and setting up scenes for monster payoffs. Overall, this is a neat and satisfying futuristic sci-fi thriller. It will no doubt command multiple viewings. Be on alert though for its inferior sequel Escape from L.A. Skip it unless you have nothing else to do.",Escape from New York

I watched it all from the roof of my office in lower Manhattan. Its a lot more visceral in person; trust me. Like the difference between watching a car accident on TV, or actually being in the accident. Anyway, this was a pretty cool film for it's day. However, ""Alien"" was released 2 years before this by Rickey Scott. After doing thousands if advertisements and music videos, he made ""The Duellists"" which was not seen by many people (still a good film), a year or so before he made ""Alien""; a genre defininhlg film if there ever was one.

100,PredragReviews,"""The name is Plisskin.""",9,31 May 2016,"John carpenter has directed so many cult classic horrors and Sci-Fi's over the years and Escape from new York is certainly one of them, a very memorable sci-fi with an awesome cast, a great visual style and a cool story, Kurt Russell is the notorious Snake Plisskin and ex special forces soldier turned criminal who is sent into New York which is now a massive maximum security prison, any one who goes in never comes out, the presidents plane air force one crashes into the middle of the prison island and Snake is recruited with the promise of a full pardon to save the president within 24 hours, the effects in the movie look great for the early 80's, a very cool visual style of a torn up new York city, the rest of the cast is great too, many famous faces from the past including Donald Pleasance as the president, Lee Van Cleef, Isaac Hayes, and Tom Atkins, many of whom are no longer with us, this is a must have in your collection if your a big 80's fan of cult classic sci-fi, always worth going back too! John Carpenter has done a terrific job of painting a dark and bleak picture of law enforcement as we know it. At the same time, he does an excellent job of creating a successful and subtle satire of law and authority. The script is always clever and surprising. While the movie might be a little dated, it still does not take away anything from the raw effect the movie has on us. Kurt Russell is fantastic as the mono-toned ""Snake Plisskin."" He makes the role his own and stands out as one of our favorite anti-heroes in film. All of the right ingredients to make a successful and exciting film are there. The panoramic CinemaScope image of the Manhattan skyline, as gray and lifeless as the sky above it with no artificial light or power in evidence at all, is not easily forgotten. The skyscrapers are now giant tombstones for the American dream, with all the quiet and still bizarre architecture of an Alien landscape in a 1970's Sci-Fi picture. Truly a gloomy vision of this once prosperous city. The story itself is pretty slight, however the performances, soundtrack, and general early 80's cult ambiance, make it worth watching, and altogether it has dated very well.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Escape from New York
101,Sandcooler,Call me Snake,9,12 February 2009,"This would be a nice assignment for creative writing classes, make up a name for an action hero. John Carpenter saw the light one day, Snake Plissken! I don't know every name in the world, but as far as my knowledge goes that's the coolest name around. The futuristic style of this movie and the wooden tough guy shooting people remind me a lot of ""The Terminator"", and it's difficult to say which one is better. This one is earlier, I can give it that. As I could already see in ""Assault On Precinct 13"", straight-forward action is what John Carpenter does best, his horror entries well, there's always a lot of craftsmanship involved in them but generally I don't care that much. Only downside to this otherwise great movie is that at one point Carpenter was so uninspired he made this thing called ""Escape From LA"" which is so similar to this one(it's essentially the same movie, just without creativity) I can't even tell which scene is in which movie half the time. Not that this is my biggest worry in the world, but it's annoying. To end on a positive note, the guy's name is Snake Plissken!",Escape from New York
102,philip_vanderveken,One of the better action movies ever,7,16 August 2005,"Normally I'm not too much a fan of action movies and John Carpenter has never been on my list of favorite directors. In my opinion he only made one good movie, except for this one of course, and that's ""Halloween"". But as I already said before, even though I'm normally not a fan of this kind of movies or of the man's work, I must say that I'm glad to make an exception when it comes to this movie. ""Escape from New York"" may well be seen as one of the better action movies of all times and even after 25 years it still gives me a good time when watching it.Due to huge crime rates in 1997, the US government has changed New York into a maximum security prison where the toughest criminals are put away for life. All the bridges have been mined, a huge wall has been built around the city and a large police force army is stationed near the statue of liberty. Inside this prison it's the survival of the fittest. There are no rules or regulations, except for those made up by the prisoners themselves, making this one of the most dangerous places to be in. When Air Force One, with the President on board, is taken over by a terrorist and crashed into a building, the President is able to escape by ejecting in a pod. But he has landed in the middle of New York and someone needs to get him out of there soon. That's where Snake Plissken comes in. He's an ex-soldier and a new prisoner who is asked to save the President and to find a tape with some important information. In return his sentence will be canceled and Plissken will be a free man again. He agrees, but to make sure that he will return on time, they inject him with a small but powerful explosive that will only be destroyed if his mission is successful. So now he does not only have to take care of the President and try to stay alive in between all those criminals, he also has a lot of time pressure...I must say that this movie reminded me a lot of the Australian ""Mad Max""-movies, especially the second one. In case you are wondering if that is a good or a bad thing: I liked those movies and yes I like this one as well. Despite the fact that it was made in 1981, this movie still feels quite futuristic. OK, we know that 1997 wasn't like this, but that doesn't really matter this time. If they had set the date to 2097, this would still have been the same movie and then we wouldn't have know that this was impossible. And the fact that some details show the real age of the movie isn't a bad thing either. Take for instance the computers. They used a lot of flashing lights and stuff like that, but those are only some small details which shouldn't spoil your fun. The acting in this movie is OK as well. This may well have been one of Kurt Russell's best performances and I really loved Ernest Borgnine as Cabbie. I even appreciated Lee Van Cleef in this movie, despite the fact that I'm normally not a fan of the man. I guess I must say that all actors did a good job. As a conclusion I would like to say that a good and still futuristic looking story, some good acting, several interesting action scenes,... make this movie more than just worth a watch. I really like it and that's why I give it a 7/10.",Escape from New York

When you watch a cab be blown in half, and four out of five passengers walk away like they're on a Sunday stroll, you're not sure if you're watching a parody or a serious action flick.  And apparently, Carpenter isn't really sure either.  The action sequences are so-so, and they are surprisingly involving.  Even Plissken's fight with the gladiator bad-guy is curiously uninvolving.

This film has got punchy action, one-liners galore and an appropriately desolate New York for its Mad Max-influenced dystopia.Though this movie's now technically set in the past, it's still one of the 1980s' most interesting takes on what was then the near-future.

108,oneguyrambling,Snake Plissken - an All-Time Classic character in a merely solid 80s action flick.,7,13 April 2011,"Snake Plissken was such a good character creation that he actually deserved a better movie than Escape from New York, not that ENY sucks, it's just that Plissken is potentially an 'All-Time Classic' character, while the film he appears in is merely a solid 80s flick.Snake is a mulleted, eye-patched, tattooed, super-cool whispering assassin. The problem is in this film he has an inferior platform on which to display his wares.Put another way, if Stallone came up with Plissken we'd be getting ready for Snake 7 where a geriatric Stallone must kill more people against his will yet again. Stallone knows how to milk a character, all Carpenter got out of Plissken was a solid first film and a lousy sequel.Anyway in this particular film Manhattan Island is walled off from society, the inhabitants being dangerous criminals trapped inside with no hope of release – they are there until they die or are killed by the other more nasty inhabitants.Snake himself is due to be inserted into this death trap, where escape is met with instant death from all sides and staying put is met by constant threat by all in-sides. Only on this fateful day the President of the United States himself crash lands within the walls and is taken, along with vital information that only he knows that is required to save the world – or something – we are never explicitly told.Snake is taken aside and informed that if can locate and save the Prez within 24 hours he will be given an unconditional release, if not his head will explode...So after a slow build Whispering Snake takes a glider and lands on one of the World Trade Center towers (costly prison), once in he must avoid roaming gangs of guys whose look is best described as homeless-punk-pirate, and random acts of violence perpetrated by guys with funny John Carpenter-film names: The Brain (whose girlfriend is more cleavage than woman!), The Duke (Isaac Hayes in the most innocently racist car I can think of), Cabbie (Ernest Borgnine) etc What follows is quite straightforward, Snake must work out who will actually help him and who means him harm, and with time running out how exactly to find the Prez and get him out safely.The film is entertaining but harmless.One thing about John Carpenter films: the man can take $12 and make it look like he spent $17. That is indeed meant as a compliment, but even when comparatively ""cashed up"" it seems Carpenter was never given much to work with. The costuming all looks wacky and way out in a Mad Max 3 way, when you would thing that in reality the inmates would spend a little more time looking deliberately disheveled and be a little more concerned with their day to day wellbeing – but I guess this isn't reality anyway, so perhaps guys dressed like homeless-punk-pirates is just as appropriate. Also the background all looks suitably cool and authentic, but it's just all a little shiny and clean, at times coming off like a video game. During the film I kept thinking of the original Left 4 Dead game.I dunno, I think Big Trouble in Little China was more fun – and better – and that The Thing was infinitely better and a genre classic, so perhaps Escape from New York really only suffers from comparison. It is indeed better than many other 80s flicks and is still fondly remembered (thanks to Snake mostly), so that's a plus, I just think it could have been so much better.All that aside though you put those four films up and add Halloween to the mix and it is inarguable that Carpenter had a most enviable track record in the 80s.Final Rating – 7 / 10. Hasn't dated well over time, but Plissken remains a classic character deserving of a better film to appear in. Watch it for him – just don't tell him you thought he was dead – everyone does that.",Escape from New York
109,PimpinAinttEasy,Dull ..... Awful ..... Unbearable .....,1,17 February 2016,"Dear John Carpenter,your film was crap. Your background score was worse than the film. The score almost put me to sleep during the title sequence itself. Sinister sounding but tuneless beats played at regular intervals is not music, OK?Snake Plissken was an interesting creation. He did mouth some amusing dialogs. Kurt Russell did a great job I guess. But the rest of the cast was wasted completely. You made Lee Van Cliff look like a middle class uncle. The great Ernest Borgnine was a goofy taxi driver in a b-movie. That role could have been played by anyone. Donald Pleasance played a token one dimensional evil US president. Harry Dean Stanton had that ridiculous costume on and he seemed to sleepwalk through his role.Some of the visuals were interesting. I mean, you were obviously aiming for a very consistent visual style throughout the film. But the awful acting and costumes made the film very hard to watch.

110,inspectors71,Junk,4,25 April 2017,"I felt disappointed when I watched John Carpenter's Escape from New York some 36 years ago, and when I saw it again two weeks ago, getting over a viral menace that makes everything ache, except the muscles for the remote, I found EfNY just as disappointing and silly. Now, mind you, this isn't supposed to be a big, thoughtful dystopian nightmare, just an adventure into the bowels of Manhattan-as- Supermax, wherein the President, Donald Pleasance, of all people, crashes, and it's up to our hero, Kurt Russell, to get him out. Read that last sentence again. Yes, I know it's a ginormous run-on, but all you need to know is right above this paragraph.It's that pretentious and dumb. And it's not even very good. Carpenter lets the reins go in the third reel, and the movie meanders and muddles until its inevitable ""big message"" ending. The whole thing is only 80+ minutes long, and I got bored. Never a good thing for dystopian nightmare action flicks.I guess Escape from New York was the first true inkling that Carpenter was going to collapse as a major director. I think he had one more goodun' in him, The Thing.",Escape from New York
111,RNMorton,Wha' happened ??,6,12 June 2004,"Great concept, good special effects for the time, eerie music, Kurt Russell in the action lead (you would think a good thing), some entertaining supporting cast, all good stuff, so wha' happened? I've always been so fascinated with the idea of this movie and so utterly disappointed with where it actually went. The first half hour or so is pretty fascinating but once Snake hits town things degenerate into a Grade Z actioner, the sort of arbitrary pointless stuff Hollywood excels at. Russell's exhaustion at the end could just as likely be from slogging through this storyline and script as from his on-screen drubbings. A generous 6/10",Escape from New York
112,mentalcritic,The one true great escape...,10,24 October 2004,"The projected date for Manhattan island becoming a prison has been and gone, and this should serve as a lesson to all budding directors to never be specific with dates. However, in spite of this dating, Escape From New York seems to get more relevant with age, especially in this day of constant terror alerts. The entire film gives one a sense of future-shock that seems to get more intense with every viewing.Kurt Russell was an excellent choice for Snake Plissken. He doesn't look like your stereotypical action hero, which heightens the feeling of the everyday man being hounded and persecuted for exercising certain freedoms he used to take for granted. The whole concept of a United States police force is indeed a frightening one, especially given the world's current atmosphere of one militaristic nation deciding to police the entire world.The entire film screams its low budget from the get go. The composite shot of the glider falling from the World Trade Centre looks so fake that it elicits howls of laughter, and the cassette players make it obvious that the filmmakers couldn't afford to use props that were less dated. I believe I actually stopped using cassette tapes for any purpose around the year that the film is supposedly set in. The doomsday supposition that crime rates will only continue to rise as time goes on also comes off as somewhat comical after the last ten years.As in almost any Carpenter film, the music hits a spectacular high note. Although it sounds a lot like the soundtrack for one of the video games on the Commodore 64, it works because it sets exactly the right mood. The collective beeps of the synthesiser, along with the thudding bass drum and the click of what sounds like a really padded cymbal, give the opening and closing themes a resonance that makes them memorable independent of the film.This is one of Donald Pleasance's more memorable roles, and he plays it absolutely straight-faced, with not a hint of guile. In fact, the serious attitude of the entire production makes it difficult to discern whether the film was actually meant to be a satire. It wasn't advertised as anything other than an action film in the 1980s. However, one can't help but wonder if the scenes where we see that the New Yorkers can rig a car to run on steam, but can't get the lights to work, represent what John Carpenter thinks of the titular city's people.I gave Escape From New York a ten out of ten. It makes me grateful for formats like DVD-Video, as it is a relic of the days when it took some creativity to make a film, and deserves to be preserved. It belongs in an elite class of films that give a lasting record of how the average human being saw themselves at the time.",Escape from New York
113,sharky_55,Call me Snake.,7,8 April 2016,"Escape from New York has a clean, crisp premise that is relayed to the viewer quickly and without fuss. With nothing but a small budget, the model makers and production designers have managed to convey a sense of a much larger and decayed city in their future dystopia vision. The neon green wireframe models do an excellent job of expressing the scale of this widespread, near-empty wasteland from all angles. There are two distinct worlds here. In one, crime has become so prevalent and widespread that offenders have simply been dumped onto Manhattan and fenced off the area to leave the criminals to themselves. Naturally, they create their own society removed from the rest of the world with their own rules, and like many dystopias, assimilate within the remnants of the environment, stacking cars as walls and hosting their own little theatre productions and gladiatorial battles. There is even an aged taxi driver who continues on his routes as if nothing has changed. And beyond the walls, the sleek, modernised world of the police officers in charge of infiltrating New York and rescuing the President. The cinematographer has fun shooting Lee Van Cleef in the many blinking and flickering coloured lights of their tech. In between the two is Kurt Russell's Snake Plissken, who immediately signals his type by his namesake. With his dark, edgy eyepatch and wiry, muscled body he is more action figure than character (some have expressed his anti-hero qualities, but his characterisation is much too thin for anything resembling that). Like the no-name western heroes before him, he enters without a stake in the game, kills without much remorse, and as the film wraps up walks off into the distance, once again cold and indifferent. The plot is about what we can expect from a John Carpenter action B-movie - the lone soldier is given a time limit and launched into a dead zone to fend for himself. In a James Bond-esque briefing sequence, the movie gives the audience all the information we really need to know, and shows off all the fancy gadgets they've equipped Snake (most of which he does not use). The plan is simple and thrilling enough; to fly over the top of the city and land on its highest point, the World Trade centre. And from there Russell navigates his way through the decay - this is a setting where goons will literally burst out of the rotting ground to open fire. The shambles of a electrical system helps too, adding a murky, atmospheric quality to each set. Together with the pulsing, electronic score the feeling created makes us want to get out of the city immediately, but also want to stay a little longer, if only to see Kurt Russell ice another criminal.",Escape from New York
114,fmarkland32,On the loose...,10,16 June 2009,"Kurt Russell stars as Snake Plissken, a bad ass loner who is given a chance for freedom in exchange for him rescuing the President from the prison population that has become a prison in the 21st century, However it's a do or die mission as Snake has been injected with a poison that will kill him if he doesn't find the president in time. If Death Wish was the companion piece to Dirty Harry, than Escape From New York was the companion piece to Mad Max (Or The Road Warrior, your choice.) and as such it's a classic. I sadly didn't get to see this in theaters (I was 8 when it came out) but this was easily one of the ones I rented the most. Indeed I've seen this movie on DVD, almost as much as on VHS, it really is that compulsively watchable. Kurt Russell is a great anti-hero, and effortlessly pulls of the action element. The supporting cast which includes Lee Van Cleef, Donald Pleasance,Isaac Hayes, Ernest Borgnine,Harry Dean Stanton, Tom Atkins and Adrienne Barbeau who all give great performances. The one to give most credit to, is John Carpenter who directs with a daunting mood, a film noir atmosphere and indeed a message. The action is edgy, the pace is relentless and the film is so exciting. This is classic science fiction and I can't think of a more defining film of the genre.**** Out Of 4-(Excellent, Must See!)",Escape from New York

118,RforFilm,"Escape from New York is the perfect kind of a big budget b-movie: atmospheric, thrilling, and Snake Plissken",10,19 November 2017,"You have to give credit to those who not only take an insane idea and go all serious with it, but if they can somehow put in some smart commentary about how it relates to social issues to it's then current audience (trust me, it's a lot harder then it sounds without sounding forced). Escape From New York dealt with the issue of rising crime rates in urban environments, but especially New York. Though it's seen as a mostly safe city to live in, the 1970s and 1980s were known as hell for most New Yorkers as they tried to make it without facing trouble.Though film has many ways to explore this and how the city and the United States tried to respond to that, filmmaker John Carpenter knew that he had to bring his message to a large audience. He made the ideology into a blockbustera blockbuster on a budget, but we'll get there It's clear that he was not in favor of the authoritarian ways that city officials tried to implement. I can't say this has answers, but perhaps this isn't supposed to be. Let's look at why Escape from New York may have shown that carpenter may have been better with thrillers then horror.In an alternate future, the crime rate has risen so high that New York City is redesigned as a maximum-security prison with no chance of parole. A wall is built around Manhattan with several booby traps, armed guards, and computer surveillance that ensures that no one escapes. There are no rules and patrol on the inside, now a city that is surrounded by darkness.In 1997 (don't forget that this movie was released in 1981), the Air Force One is hijacked, giving time for the president (played by Donald Pleasence) to get sent out through the escape pod. The problem is that the pod lands in New York. When guards follow the escape pods tracker, they discover that the president has already been captured by the Duke of New York (played by Issac Hayes) and his gang says that any rescue attempt will result in automatic execution. At the same time, former Special Forces solider turned bank robber Snake Plissken (played by Kurt Russell) is currently being processed to enter New York for his crimes. He agrees to a deal that if he can get the president out in 22 hours, they'll let him go. He makes his way in the find the president while getting help from an old Cabbie (Played by Ernest Borgnine), Brain (played by Harry Dean Stanton), and Maggie (played by Adrienne Barbeau).I had seen Escape from New York once a while ago, and I was surprised how much it held up. A lot of it probably had to do with three things. The first is the atmosphere, which turns New York into a hellhole, giving you a sense of suspense. It's nearly all told from Snake's perspective, allowing us, the viewer to feel like this is how we'd be seeing this prison for the first time. If you're hoping for a lot of action, this is not that kind of movie. Like The Bourne Identity series, this film is all about how much stealth Snake can use in order to not be spotted by the gangs. This gives us more time to take in New York, which looks impressive, considering this has a lower budget. You definitely sense that the place is large with little hope in sight. That's the second thing that makes this great, the villain. The constant gang attacks makes this a lot like an extension of Assault on Precinct 13, Carpenter's earlier movie. It all feels like a wave of force rather then one person attacking (though there is a leader this time).The last thing I'll address are the characters. Kurt Russell is perfect for Snake. He's great at playing the antihero who you want to see succeed, yet are not sure you can trust him. He always plays that he's seen a lot and that even he's not sure if society is worth saving. Yet you still root for him, because he is likable enough that you want to follow him. Though their parts are smaller, Donald Pleasance, Ernest Borgnine, and Isaac Hayes all add to their characters, which are a little goofy, but that's kind of the nature of the movie. Escape to New York is John Carpenter's vision of a B-movie with a blockbuster look. It all gels together perfectly making one of Carpenter's best.I'll give this ten cars with chandeliers out of five. This is definitely a thriller that I'd recommend, even if your not into science-fiction. It has dark moments, over-the-top moments, quiet moments, loud moments, and of course, time to take in the films atmosphere. Escape from New York is one prison that you shouldn't escape from; go see this.",Escape from New York
119,ivo-cobra8,A classic film John Carpenter's the best Action Sci-Fi flick,10,15 October 2015,"Escape from New York is a 1981 American dystopian action film co-written, co-scored, and directed by John Carpenter.A classic film. Escape From New York (1981) Is also one of my personal favorite classic Action Sci-Fi John Carpenter movies. It was also the first movie I ever saw from John Carpenter as a child and It I still the best movie in my opinion. I love this movie to death I own it on Blu-ray tough it doesn't have great video quality like it should have I still love it to death. Kurt Russell is Snake Plissken period! Also Lee Van Cleef Is also in it from a Few Dollars More and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly I just love those Western movies to death. Adrienne Barbeau from The Fog is also in it and she is the beautiful, but deadly Maggie.The plot is set more in the future American by the late 90's. In 1997, when the US President crashes into Manhattan, now a giant maximum security prison, a convicted bank robber is sent in for a rescue. In a world ravaged by crime, the entire island of Manhattan has been converted into a prison which houses the world's most brutal inmates. And when the President of the United States crash lands inside, only one man can bring him back: Snake Plissken, a notorious outlaw and former Special Forces war hero who, in exchange for a full pardon, descends into the decayed city and wages a blistering war against the captors. But time is short: in 24 hours, an explosive charge planted inside Snake's body will end the mission -- and his life -- unless he succeeds.You've got Kurt Russell, wearing a freaking eye patch and toting a massive assault rifle, squatting in the middle of a fire. You know, just taking it easy, popping a squat while the city burns around him. Non-plussed. Chillaxed. In the background, Lady Liberty's decapitated head lies in the middle of the street, her copper-green eyes staring vacantly up into a crowded, off-kilter skyline. What the hell happened, I wondered. I'd have to wait for Cloverfield to find out, because, as it turns out, that nifty piece of poster art-while summing up the film's nothing is sacred attitude and permanently establishing Kurt Russell as an icon of badass - has no relation to the film's plot. When I finally managed to see the movie, I kept waiting for Lady Liberty's head to get blown off, but it never happened. I was a little disappointed. And in a way, that's still how I feel about Escape From New York. The premise is a near-perfect action movie set-up, and the world that John Carpenter creates has so much potential for edge-of- your-seat storytelling, but the end result doesn't fully deliver on its promise. But that's not to say that it doesn't have its moments of undiluted awesomeness. Long proclaimed as an action film cult classic, there's surprisingly little action in Escape From New York, at least, not of the Michael Bay, in your face, two explosions per minute variety, the kind to which today's Rockstar-infused audiences are acclimated. Watching the film now, nearly thirty years after it hit theaters in 1981, EFNY seems curiously slow-paced. Snake limps through the city, occasionally bopping a guy in the face, occasionally busting a cap.The film is John Carpenter best work I have seen, there are some other films I don't like, Escape From New York (1981) is one of the best cult classic films from John carpenter and Kurt Russell. Kurt Russell's iconic character of all time Snake Plissken is his best roles of all time on the screen, I have ever seen. I also love the sequel to death the same as I love this film. Snake Plissken is an ex-soldier turned criminal, recruited/blackmailed into rescuing a hostage president from the prison of New York City. Lee Van Cleef as Bob Hauk New York Police Commissioner did a great job portraying one of the most memorable characters. I wish he would return in the sequel but he couldn't because 8.later the actor died. Rest in peace Lee.I love main theme music from John Carpenter and Alan Howarth and I enjoy some action scenes performed from Kurt Russell in the film.I love this film to death and It is my favorite action science fiction flick of all time I love it. 10/10",Escape from New York

Also I'm not a big Kurt Russel fan and I can say with honesty that any other actor could have played his part, namely Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, Chuck Norris etc. etc. Russel's acting talent is doubt-able.The plot of the film is exciting enough but Carpenter does a bad job of directing.

Ever since my dad showed me 'Escape From New York', I wanted to don an eye patch, stick it to authority, and save the human race, just like Plissken does, but I knew I'd never be as cool as Plissken ever was.The thing about 'Escape From New York' is that Kurt Russell's character Snake is such a bad-ass, that's it's super rare find a hero that stand for good of the common man and also acts like he doesn't care about anything. This is one of John Carpenter's finest films and was smack dab in the middle of his greatest movies, in between 'Halloween' and 'The Thing', which are two of my favorites of all time. Carpenter didn't have access to the modern technology of CG back in 1981, so he relied on a great team to construct miniature models of New York City, along with matte paintings that are ultra realistic.These practical effects provide that good old nostalgic feeling for us kids of the 80s, because more often than not, movies today only use computer generated effects, which in my opinion, take you out of the film all together. All these aspects come together to conjure up a damn near perfect and highly entertaining film in my opinion. A film that after more than three decades, still holds up today.It's a hell of a story too. A highly decorated US soldier and recent bank robber Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is taken out of prison in a futuristic 1997 where the world is mostly a post apocalyptic scene to rescue the President of the United States (Donald Pleaseance), after his Air Force One Place is hijacked and crashes into a building. If that weren't enough, he has to navigate the war-torn streets of New York City while avoiding crazy murderers and rapists who are all out to kill him. Luckily he does find a little bit of help with an old cab driver known as Cabbie (Ernest Borgnine), Brain (Harry Dean Stanton), and Maggie (Adrienne Barbeau), as they try to find the President who is being tortured and held hostage by The Duke (Isaac Hayes) and his insane minions.'Escape From New York' is the ultimate bad-ass movie. It never slows down and each character is so particular and fun, that each one has become iconic. There's just something about this film where anytime it's on, you can't help but watch, and now that this Blu-ray Collector's edition is out, you'll be able to watch the best video and audio presentation thus far of this movie.

He symbolizes the actual pulse of the viewer, as well as the characters' pulses in the film, through this simple, yet dramatic heartbeat pulse sound. The murky dystopian atmosphere that every single scene in the movie is drenched in is also quite convincing. This is probably would make many people angry, but I couldn't help but feel that this film might have an influence on Ridley Scott's masterpiece, Blade Runner!Unfortunately, I was bored to death watching Escape from New York, for many reasons. First and foremost, the film is cheesy and slow-buring a the same time, and I just couldn't digest that. Hence, I found the movie very silly and slow-paced for its own good.Secondly, all of the characters are extremely flat, including the bad-ass protagonist, Snake Plissken. Kurt Russell is not to blame, though. He's as cool as always. The rest of the cast also did a good job. I digged the characters of Maggie and Brain, though. I liked how untrustworthy and unreliable they are.Thirdly, the plot is underdeveloped, unoriginal and stretched out. That made me feel that the film never ends despite its short runtime.I know it's an unpopular opinion, and the fans may get so pissed off.

The distinct use of shadows and clever use of sound definitely brings you back to his horror works. Not to mention, it's one of his self-scored films, though Alan Howarth is the constant co-composer people always seem to leave out. Any who, fantastic score with some very dark and ominous moments.The cast just reeks of Carpenter, how awesome. The very tempting Adrienne Barbeau stars, and Donald Pleascence as our cowardly President. As if that wasn't enough, you also get Harry Dean Stanton as Brain. Carpenter also pays tribute to his love of spaghetti westerns by casting (applause starts) Lee Van Cleef! Lee Van Cleef plays his character with the same slyness as Angel Eyes back in '66, truly sealing the deal as one of my favorite cast ever. And the ever bad-ass Kurt Russell is Snake Plissken, the virtual Man with No Name. He's one of the quintessential anti-hero figures in cinema if you ask me, leading up to the very impressive and clever ending where Snake throws aside world peace without the blink of an eye, it's great. The film definitely portrays a dystopia and the cinematography captures this quite well. There are also many shots of well-built miniatures and nicely executed matte shots.

127,Bogmeister,"New York-if You Could Make it Here,You can Make it Anywhere",8,15 January 2006,"You've gotta give this pic props just for the concept alone: New York City walled off as the only maximum security prison in the USA. Who would come up with an idea like that? John Carpenter, that's who. This follows up on the thematic elements of his earlier ""Assault on Precinct 13""(76) in terms of crime spiraling out of control. This takes it to another level, the future of 1997 (since it's no longer 'the future' now, we can look at it as an alternate history). Then we have the iconic character of Snake Plissken (Russell), who appears to have stepped out of some classic pulp men's adventure story with science fiction overtones. Russell imitates the equally-classic Clint Eastwood delivery for tough characters, but Eastwood never looked so anti-establishment. Everything about the Plissken figure spells out 'outlaw' or just iconoclast. Basically, if you need someone to pull off a 'mission impossible' type of deal, this is the guy you go to. Why? Because he follows his own rules, makes up his own rules and, at the same time, doesn't follow any rules. This was also spelled out in an earlier made-for-TV movie called ""The Challenge""(1970); you don't necessarily send in the best soldier to accomplish the mission. You send the guy who will break all the rules.In this case, the mission is a real corker: the President (Pleasence) of the U.S. ends up inside the one place where no one else can get him out of - NYC. Military or Secret Service isn't going to work for something like this; it's all a matter of expediency, too. The Prez is needed for an important conference, of world-shaking matters. Carpenter assembled a dream cast to bring his story to fruition. Besides Russell, who turned out to be the ideal choice for Plissken, and Pleasence, who is excellent as usual, Carpenter nabbed Van Cleef is his last great role, as an intimidating top cop; Borgnine as the prototypical cab driver; Stanton as the amusing and sly Brain; then-wife Barbeau as femme fatale; and Hayes as the King, er, Duke of New York. Mention should also be made of actor Doubleday in the bizarre Romero role. These colorful characters dance and spar with each other on the dark streets of a more-than-gritty New York City. With a limited budget, and actually filming in another city, Carpenter, his cinematographer Cundey and his set designer managed to convey the dystopian ambiance of a once-great big city, now in ruin and lorded over by pure anarchy.Like ""The Road Warrior""(81)(aka ""Mad Max 2""), ""Escape From New York"" was heavily influential on the science fiction sub-genre of post holocaust adventure. The Plissken character himself seems to have been copied in many of the later sci-fi imitations of squalid future landscapes. They probably waited too long for its own sequel, ""Escape From L.A."" in '96, which was an amusing retread of the original.",Escape from New York

Russell is perfection playing the anti-hero Snake who became sort of a cult figure much like his Jack Burton character in ""Big Trouble in Little China"", the film also co-stars Adrienne Barbeau, Ernest Borgnine, Lee Van cleef, Tom Atkins and Harry Deadn Stanton. The acting is very good and the action is thrilling, i also love the production quality of this movie to make it look like a realistic post-apocalyptic New York City and the score by Carpenter is soaring as well.The film is futuristic fun for any fan of Sci-fi and action movies, a true must see and one of the best movies John Carpenter has made.Also recommended: ""Escape from L.A."", ""Battle Royale"", ""The Running Man"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Akira"", ""Mad Max"", ""The Road Warrior"", ""The Island (2005)"", ""The Fifth Element"", ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", ""Aliens"", ""Die Hard"", ""Death Race 2000"", ""Rats: A Night of Terror"", ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome"", ""The Warriors"" and ""Transformers (2007)"".",Escape from New York

Great idea!The only real complaints I have about this film is the cheesy lines throughout the film, Kurt Russell's stupid whisper voice, and the music. For most of the film Kurt Russell did an excellent job, but there were a few scenes where I couldn't stand the way he talked.  As for the music, I'm unsure whether the blame lies with the fact that this film was made in the early 1980's or if it resides with John Carpenter's choice of music (I don't like the music in just about any of his films).All of that aside, I thought the film was very good and definitely one of John Carpenter's best.  John needs to stick to movies like this, I think it's safe to say that it's movies like this that fans appreciate.  Anyhow, if you are a fan of John Carpenter, then you MUST see this film.  If you're a fan of futuristic action/adventure films, then you also MUST check this out.  I hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,-Chris",Escape from New York
133,Horror-yo,"Fun Carpenter Action ""classic""",6,17 May 2016,"If you know Carpenter about now, you know his style is quite an underwhelming one. His films are often very superficial and focus on all but depth and attention to details. And they're oddly...""quiet"". This one has scenes that usually don't belong in this action genre; where a bit of an artist's vision comes in, a bit like how 'the Fog' had those long drives into the wilderness countryside. So this film is quite visual and smooth for the eye. The plot is ultra-simple. This is basically a sci-fi, futuristic, post-apocalyptic Western Spaghetti, the latter being the genre Carpenter originally intended to be making. Kurt Russell is a cool protagonist for a casual watch, sort of the Duke Nukem type anti-hero with a sense of justice and fairness but not an angel either. The plot is fine as a whole, but does lack a lot of attention to detail. Carpenter as often composed the score for this, and as usual, over-simplistic, if not minimalistic. Setting the tone for a very simple, obvious/direct atmosphere. I'm surprised, as most Carpenter films, this was so well received...",Escape from New York
134,Java_Joe,The very definition of classic.,9,14 March 2019,"What do you get when you take a charismatic star, a bunch of great character actors, a director that knows his stuff and some imagination? You hopefully get a movie like this one. It has since gone on to be a cult classic and required viewing for anybody interested in sci-fi or political commentary.The story is rather simple. In the far off year of 1997, Manhattan has been turned into a maximum security prison. You get tossed in there and you're stuck. However the President of the United States drops in unexpectedly and they need to send somebody in to get him out.Enter Kurt Russell playing a role he was meant to play in Snake Pliskin. He's a an ex-soldier turned mercenary turned criminal and he's their best bet. Only thing is, he's only got 24 hours to do this or else the microbombs implanted in his neck will go off killing him immediately. And thus starts one of the best escape movies of all time.Snake Pliskin is one of the best anti-heroes ever put to screen. He's a tightly bound ball of anger, pain and a desire to do what needs to be done. And this role cemented Kurt Russel as a bona fide action star. Pretty good considering he got his start doing Disney movies. He was so good that Solid Snake from the Metal Gear series was based on him and his overall look.Other artists, like novelist William Gibson, says that the look of this movie influenced his vision of the future in his novel ""Neuromancer"".All in all a very enjoyable movie that should be seen.",Escape from New York
135,richieandsam,Such a good movie.,7,14 November 2013,"ESCAPE FROM NEW YORKA cult classic that I had not seen before yesterday.New York has been blocked off and turned into a giant prison. The presidents plane has crashed inside the compound and he has been held hostage. The government has promised a convict a clean slate if he gets the president out in 22 hours. Snake must make his way around New York, find the president and escape without getting the president killed or getting killed himself.This film was made in the 80's and you can really tell. It has that amazing 80's feel to it. The sound effects are so bad, but great at the same time. When Snake is fighting people it is funny. When he hits someone, the sound that the punch makes it classic 80's. The effects are not great, but again that just adds to the atmosphere to the movie. Great soundtrack too.The movie stars Kurt Russell as Snake. He plays this part with such attitude, and it doesn't really suit him. Especially with his deep gravelly voice that he puts on. But after watching him for over 30 minutes in this character you get used to it. Other cast members were Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, Donald Pleasence & Isaac Hayes. The casting was brilliant. I like all of these actors, especially the legendary Ernest Borgnine. I had the pleasure of meeting Ernest before he passed away, and he was such a nice friendly man. The acting throughout was not brilliant, but then back in the 80's, especially for action films, the acting was never important. It was all about the cheese. I love cheesy action films and this was definitely that.There was quite a lot of violence in it and some gory scenes, but nothing too bad. I was a little bit surprised to see a head on a stick in one scene, but it was awesome. There are some great, creepy characters too.The story is great. I love the idea of the president being kidnapped and a criminal having to save the day. Snake is not really a likable character which is what makes this film different. The hero is not really a hero. He is only doing it for selfish reasons and that is a good spin on the story.I have not seen Escape from L.A., but after watching this I will be looking out for it. I am looking forward to seeing it.I will give this film 7 out of 10.""Snake?

137,Al_The_Strange,"""There was an accident. About an hour ago, a small jet went down inside New York City. The President was on board."" ""President of what?""",7,9 September 2013,"In this dark dystopian sci-fi adventure, ultimate tough guy Snake Plissken is sent on a mission to enter New York, a city now turned into the world's largest penitentiary with a huge retaining wall, to rescue the President from a group of the roughest and most violent criminals imaginable. Sounds awesome, right? Escape From New York has all the right elements to make something awesome. The premise, the characters, the settings, and the overall essence of the film are indeed awesome. However, in the hands of John Carpenter, the film moves at a slow and brooding pace. It's the same creepy, methodic style that makes his other movies - Halloween, The Fog, Christine, The Thing – so effective. For this movie, I never felt that it works as well as it should: the film creeps along so much in the dark that all sense of action and excitement is dampened. When action does hit – a few pedestrian scenes where bad guys throw rocks and sticks, beat and rape a few people, throw Snake into a death match arena, and then finally chase the heroes across a mined bridge – it's all pretty lightweight, lacking in particularly deep impact or thrills. I can't help but to think that, in the hands of guys like John McTiernan or Paul Verhoeven, Escape From NY could be the awesomest, pulpiest, and most badass movie out there. As it is, it's mildly cool, but it never fully capitalizes off of its own potential.The story this film tells is pretty neat, filled with some far-out sci-fi concepts (ideas that would be replicated in plenty of other films, most blatant of which is Doomdsay). The actual plot is pretty standard; it gives you just enough to the story and characters to understand what's going on and to kick off the big adventure, but there's not much depth or exploration offered beyond the surface-level expositions. Characters are pretty flat and lifeless all around, except for Snake Plissken, who is the epitome of cool, with his moody, dangerous, devil-may-care attitude. His character is not only a great antihero, but also a massive influence on other popular characters (remember Solid Snake from Metal Gear Solid?). The only problem is, you never really learn much about Snake beyond that surface level; he is as one-dimensional as everybody else. There are moments where I also wonder if this movie tries to pick at some social themes regarding American society and culture; after all, this is one of America's biggest and most popular cities turned into a total hellhole, and it's the American President caught up in the middle of the chaos. There are times when it seems like the film is underscoring the ugly undercurrent of social corruption and decay, but these themes never really materialize into anything tangible.This film uses rather pedestrian photography, in a manner not much different than Halloween. The camera moves and angles are interesting at times, but the shots are so long that they appear pretty indistinctive. Lighting is very dark throughout, for appropriate effect. Editing is good. Acting is generally okay: Kurt Russell is the man throughout, opposite Lee Van Cleef and Isaac Hayes, who also try their best to be tough. Ernest Borgnine provides a little bit of goofiness to the mix, and Adrienne Barbeau adds a little bit of sex appeal. Harry Dean Stanton isn't given much to do, and his role is ultimately forgettable. And, Donald Pleasence is pretty much himself. Writing is okay; there are a few amusing lines. This movie uses sets, props, and costumes that show some limitations, but get the job done very well. John Carpenter's music score is pretty darn cool.Escape From New York has its share of coolness, but it could be cooler yet. It's not terribly exciting, but it is mildly interesting and mildly satisfying. Given its popularity, the film is a must-see for fans of dark and violent dystopian sci-fi.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Average | Film: Pretty Good)",Escape from New York
138,markovd111,"Good, but not really what I was expecting!",8,13 July 2020,"Given the cult status of the movie, I was expecting Snake Plissken to demolish half of the New York while rescuing the president. Instead of that, we are left with Russel's cheesy voice, great and interesting setting and amazing cleavage of Adrienne Barbeau. Movie would have benefited from being longer, but even as it is, it's a great piece of simple fun. Oh, and the ending is phenomenal! All in all, I liked the movie, though it's a shame there too little action scenes. I recommend the movie to everyone! 8/10",Escape from New York
139,DavidSim240183,Call me Snake!,10,20 November 2008,"John Carpenter could once be counted among the most exciting, invigorating names in Hollywood. Every film he made was a classic of its genre. Whether it be action, science-fiction or horror. His career has slowed down considerably in recent years, but back in the late 70s and early 80s, there was no stopping him. Escape From New York was a huge success, and is one of John Carpenter's best films. It was one of the first to attempt to meld the whole action genre onto a SF backdrop. And its something that John Carpenter achieves with considerable finesse.Carpenter has always seemed like a man who refuses to play by the rules. Which is why the heroes of his films are often wild-cards trusted by neither side of the wars they wind up flung into. So it makes sense that Carpenter would draw upon the rules of the Ancient West when creating Escape From New York, because its the perfect aesthetic for this conceit.The idea behind the film is a great one. In 1997, Manhattan Island has been converted into a maximum security prison. Prisoners from all across the Western Seaboard are put here with no chance of a reprieve. All bridges and waterways off the Island are mined. There are no guards. No wardens. And no escape. Until Air Force One is hijacked while flying over Manhattan, and The President is taken prisoner. So the Prison Commissioner sends in Snake Plissken, a former war hero and current convicted criminal, on a mission to find the President and bring him back alive. If he doesn't, he'll die in 24 hours thanks to a bomb implanted in his head.Escape From New York is one of my favourite films of John Carpenter's. The Thing takes the No 1 spot, but Escape From New York is a close runner-up. It has so many fine things about it. Carpenter's direction is smooth, and polished. It has probably the best score he's ever composed for his own films. And it has a terrific cast. Maybe the best you're ever likely to find in a John Carpenter film.The first half is particularly impressive. The way Carpenter's direction allows the film to glide from one stylish set-piece to the next. The President's capture. Meeting Snake. Heading into New York. Exploring the dark, eerie streets of Manhattan. All helped along by Carpenter's music that throbs and ebbs away in the background. The first 40 minutes feel more like 10.Escape From New York was made on a 7 million dollar budget, but it has the look and feel of a much more expensive film. 7 million is not a lot of money to work with, especially when making an action film, but John Carpenter has always had a knack for crafting superb films from shoestring budgets. This is no exception. The dark photography helps to make the Island of Manhattan a much more ominous place, and the sinister urgency of the music helps as well. There are also some excellent special effects work from none other than James Cameron, three years before he hit big with The Terminator. Snake's glider flight over Manhattan is quite a sight. Its spectacular without ever drawing attention to itself as a special effect.In the role of Snake Plissken, John Carpenter defied the wishes of the studio by casting Kurt Russell. You can understand their scepticism. Russell was only known for teen comedies with Disney, so the idea of making him the star of an action vehicle sounds a recipe for disaster. But he's a perfect Snake. A black eye-patch, khaki pants and assault rifle make him an intimidating sight. Snake often seems like the new sheriff in town, ready to clean up Manhattan. Russell must have had Clint Eastwood in mind when playing Snake, what with his sneering eye and quiet rasp of a voice. Kurt Russell always reserves his best performances for John Carpenter, and this is by far the best.Russell has plenty of excellent backup too. The Clint Eastwood analogy seems even more apt when we have Spaghetti Western veteran Lee Van Cleef in the film too. His beady-eyed Prison Commissioner is an amusing contrast to Snake's sneery-eyed defiance. The film really lights up whenever they're paired together. Donald Pleasance is an amusingly squeamish President. Its especially funny to see him when he's back in his comfort zone. His cowardice replaced by self-importance. He's a true politician. Harry Dean Stanton and especially Adrienne Barbeau offer up welcome support, even if they're not particularly well developed by Carpenter. And Ernest Borgnine brings a bit of warmth as Cabbie. His death is quite affecting at the end.Some of the action scenes are held back by the film's low budget. Some are a little too low-key, and I'm not sure the film needed the wrestling match. It seems a bit out of step with the rest of it. But Carpenter's direction is so slick that you may not even notice these flaws. Escape From New York is still one of the best of its kind.",Escape from New York

Kurt Russell's Snake Plissken would be renowned as one of the most memorable anti heroes on screen. Director John Carpenter directed, co-wrote and co-scored Escape From New York and this would also be one of a number of collaborations with Kurt Russell who would later reunite with The Thing (1982) and Big Trouble In Little China (1986).Escape From New York takes place in a dystopian 1997 where Manhattan has been converted into a heavily fortified maximum security prison after the crime rate has skyrocketed 400% and the US Government has ordered New York to be cut off from the rest of the USA.Former special forces soldier turned convicted criminal Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) has been offered a full presidential pardon in exchange for accepting a top secret mission by Police Commissioner Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef) to rescue the US President (Donald Pleasance) after his escape pod lands in New York after Air Force One crashes following a hijacking. The US President is found and taken hostage by a group of criminals led by crime boss The Duke (Isaac Hayes). Plissken successfully enters New York via a stealthy glider. While he is there, he meets a friendly taxi driver named Cabbie (Ernest Borgnine) who drives an armoured taxi who agrees to helps him navigate his way around the island. Fellow inhabitants/inmates Brain (Harry Dean Stanton) and Maggie (Adrienne Barbeau) also help Plissken find the whereabouts of The Duke's hideout where the President is being held prisoner.Kurt Russell has always been a quality and very versatile actor. His role as Snake Plissken is definitely one of his best roles, and he has stated himself that it is one of his favorite roles.Director John Carpenter, well known for the horror slasher Halloween (1978), creates an atmosphere of suspenseful action, dark humour, memorable one liners, and great characters. After mixed success with low budget movies, Escape From New York would turn out to be a critical and commercial success for him which would lead on to bigger projects with a bigger budget.I don't rate the sequel Escape From L. A. (1996), I thought they just tried to recycle the plot from the first movie albeit in Los Angeles. No surprise that it was a box office flop and not well received by critics.I still enjoy Escape From New York. It's also a favourite amongst many Kurt Russell fans who agree that Snake Plissken is one of the best characters.Escape From New York still holds up today and is still a classic 40 years on.7/10.",Escape from New York

Kurt Russell plays the moody anti hero, Snake Pilskin, superbly, with more broody looks and action than talk. Carpenter presents a desolate and barren New York with night stalking creatures and Mad Max style gangs, controlled by the Duke. The film sets a fast pace and keeps your brain from engaging long enough to think about the simple plot and the one dimensional characters. Fun story, with a cool, unflawed character as the hero.

144,emperor_bender,"""It's the survival of the human race, Plissken. Something you don't give a sh*t about.""",8,13 June 2008,"John Carpenter has a habit of making unique horror movies out of nowhere. Escape from New York is no exception.This movie reminds me of Resident Evil Apocalypse in some ways. People trapped in city by army with some kind of race of mutants running around wild. But don't get me wrong, they are barely even in the same league. Nothing compares to horror classics like Carpenter's.Snake Plissken is sent in New York, which is now a prison itself, to retrieve the president (Donald Pleasance) whose plane crashed in the city due to hijackers. Snake is sent by Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef), commissioner of the police force that guards New York. Snake must survive the city's maniac, criminal inhabitants, retrieve the president alive, and make it out before a world convention starts without him.Snake runs into some interesting character's, like The Duke of New York (Isaac Hayes), who wants to use the president as a hostage to leave the city/prison. He also meets Brain (Harry Dean Stanton), who supplies the Duke with oil and fuel for his cars and whatnot, and Brain's girl, Maggie (Adrienne Barbeau). He also meets Cabbie (Ernest Borgnine), who shows Snake all around the city and is his personal tour guide.This movie is underrated I think.

Surprisingly clever for an action movie, with characters that we feel may have depth, but never show it. That did not make sense, but it's true. Kurt Russell is an underrated actor, and here, gives one of his most memorable performances. Most of his partnerships with Carpenter have been a success, this one included, and the character of Snake is given the perfect playground in New York.

Kurt Russell delivers an iconic performance, and the idea is very cool, but something gets lost in the translation and the final result is rather disappointing. It's quite short, and not a whole lot of note happens; most of the characters are only barely introduced, and so I felt no attachment to any of them, whether positive or negative. The production design is cool but obviously hampered by the budget, and the action scenes are kinda lame. The supporting cast looks good on paper but don't really add a whole lot, as this is clearly Russell's show.

147,rowmorg,An interesting idea destroyed by the director,1,25 August 2009,"John Carpenter makes excruciatingly bad films. He has no idea how to tell a story, or how to create suspense. All he has in Escape from New York is the budget to deliver an impressive setting. However, he has nothing with which to fill it. Unfortunately, the popcorn crowd has little discrimination with which to tell the difference. Carpenter is another of those fakes who has never studied scripting, or forgot everything he ever learned. In a movie script, (OMG here we go again) the hero has to be likable: Kurt Russell is as unpleasant as possible without actually unzipping his pants and taking a p*** on the camera lens. There is simply nothing quirky, individual or interesting about him, except that he is very rude to authority, something that no doubt endears him to the least amiable of the back row. The kind of people who kick the back of your seat and chew loudly. The creation of suspense is even harder than creating a likable hero.

151,buckikris,A Look Into A Futuristic New York As Told In The Year 1981.,9,31 July 2015,"Escape From New York Has got to one of the best cult films from the 20th Century. Those who find this movie weird, I guess the reason is because it's dated or your not a hardcore John Carpenter fan. I really like EFNY, to this day, yes it's dated; but that's because it came out in 1981 and who knew what 1997 would hold. If the dates 1988 and 1997 were not included, younger viewers; and others might enjoy it more. To me it's a cult classic, up there with the original Star Wars trilogy, JAWS, and E.T.. The story begins with Snake Plisskin being taken into custody to the Manhattan Maximum Security Prison. In 1997 since to crime rate grew to 400 % all of Manhattan Island is a Maximum Security Prison for the U.S.. Plisskin is an ex-special forces officer, who was convicted of a bank robbery. His character Snake is the ultimate bas A##. Once in you do not come out, the head of the prison is Hauk( Lee Van Cleef). Hauk discovers that Air Force 1 has been hi-jacked and Hauk needs help finding the President inside NYC.. Hauk calls in Snake Plisskin( Kurt Russel), after hearing the distress signal. Hauk gives Snake an offer, to go in and retrieve the President( Donald Pleasance). If he is successful he will receive a full pardon; but Hauk has a catch. When Snake gets ready to leave Hauk fits him with a tracker, and puts two capsules into his system. Plisskin has 22 hours to complete his mission; and there is no way for him to escape. In 1997 NYC looks like a demilitarized zone. Snake has to move swiftly, and carefully due to the crazies that live outside. These are people who have become lost and now work for the Duke of New York(Isaac Hays). Once Snake is in he gets help from Cabbie(Ernest Borgnine), Brain( Harry Dean Stanton, and Maggie( Adrienne Barbeau). To save the President he will need there help, and he will have tough trials while he faces The Duke of New York and his minions. He has 22 hours to complete the mission, and bring the President back safely.The reason why I liked this movie is it's futuristic approach, and when you see it for the first time at age 8 in 81, it stays with you forever. This film is action packed and Snake Plisskin is the true anti-hero you cheer on from beginning to end. I also liked the excellent cast they all meshed well, and some have worked with Carpenter before. The movie unites old school actors with new school, a great cast indeed. As I watched the movie I put myself in the shoes of Plisskin. A total thrill ride from the beginning to the end for the viewer.I love John Carpenter films and even though this is more sci-fi than horror, it has style. Watching this movie and looking at some of the parts makes me wonder what the future has in store for us. Meaning if our crime rate where to ever hit that high would we be prepared, would our big cities fall apart; and would humanity live like savages. It makes me wonder, maybe you too? BTW a remake of Escape From New York is in development as of 2014/2015. If it is green lighted I can't wait to see what it holds. I'm sure the time line will be spaced father apart; like 30 years into the future, story line might be the same with some differences. I think it would be great to remake it, but will it hold up to the original? THX, Kris L. CocKayne",Escape from New York
152,happipuppi13,See Snake. See Snake Run. See Snake Escape.,10,27 October 2006,"Safe to say a lot of us (not all) but a lot,when we were younger decided at one time to get into a movie we weren't permitted to see because of it's rating. 3 years before PG-13,""Escape From New York"" was a movie just about any teen-age boy would want to go to. It had great action,cool looking good guys & bad guys and hey,Adrienne Barbeau! Unfortunately,it was rated R for language,violence and ""partail"" nudity. I happened to be 13 at the time & my oldest brother while 17 got away with saying he was 18. I still couldn't join my two brothers & their friends,so I had to see ""Arthur"" w/Dudley Moore (or did I?) I was escorted to that movie but when I peeked out the door,I made an ""Escape"" to New York!Anyhow,my review. Since then,despite the success of this film,it's been labeled a ""cult"" classic and it's now marking it's 25th anniversary as we speak. It's rather funny now to hear ""in 1998 crime went up over 200%"" or such. Although fictional,it seemed like a scary prospect but once Snake received his reluctant mission,I forgot about all that.There's certainly enough reviews here describing the plot about Snake going in to the maximum security prison that New York City has become,to save the President of The United States. So I'll just say from the moment he lands,the race is on and the nail biting begins! Kurt Russel never looked so tough on screen before and he plays it just right,not over the top,which could have been laughable.Supporting players Ernest Borgnine,Adrienne Barbeau,Lee Van Cleef (in quite a subdued part for him),Issac Hayes & Donald Pleasance all play their parts wonderfully. The mood of the world has turned dark and gloomy and the attitudes of the actors reflect that. Always funny to me though will be when Snake meets up with a Billy Idol looking punk and the guy hisses at him! The setting is so dark that,at the time,I jumped every time Snake did when something came at him from the shadows.So,I'll end by saying,it doesn't matter if you buy this,rent it or whatever,just see it for the actors & the action. Even for a storyline that now seems like it couldn't happen in this post 9/11 world. Hopefully,it's safe to say the world will never get that far gone,but back then,it sure seemed plausible. Then again you never know! Punk:""I heard you we're dead"" Snake:""You and everyone else!"" (END)",Escape from New York
153,jcbutthead86,A Sci-FI/Action Classic. One of Carpenter's best.,10,28 May 2012,"Escape From New York is a Sci-FI/Action classic and is one of my favorite movies of all time and along with The Road Warrior set the standard for post-apocalyptic movies.Set in a futuristic 1997,New York has become a prison for the entire country where you get but don't come out. The president's(Donald Pleasence)plane has been hijacked and crashed into a building,and although he survives The President has been kidnapped inside the prison by a terrorist-like organization. A former war hero Snake Plissken(Kurt Russell) has been hired to go inside the prison and get the president out within 24 hours,putting Plissken in a hellish journey.Escape From New York is a great film that works so well because the great story,the character Snake Plissken and direction. The story of EFNY is original and imaginative having the idea of having the entire city of New York be a prison for the entire country and it's great and well done. The future in the film is dark and bleak and unforgettable and even though you're free in the New York prison for the entire country you can't get out because the prison is guarded and water is dangerous. Like any post-apocalyptic film the film has an over the top comic book style and the characters,action and style are pushed to the limit. Carpenter is a master of making films that were made on a low budget but at times look like they cost a lot more and EFNY is no exception. With 6-7 million dollar budget,EFNY looks like it costs 50 million dollars.The Action in the film for a small budget is well done and executed with skill,one of my favorite Action scenes in the film being the Wrestling scene which is well-directed. As a Wrestling fan,I loved that Carpenter put this scene in,which is one of the best and hardcore Wrestling scenes in film history. Great scene. EFNY is a film that will have glued to the screen from beginning to end and at 98 minutes the film moves at a fast pace. As a viewer you can relate to Snake and wondering will he survive? Will Snake get out of the prison in 24 hours? It's an a dangerous,suspense filled adventure that puts the viewer in a since of dread and fear,but at the same time you are in the moment. Snake Plissken is such a great character because he's tough,human and complex. Snake is character we all wish we were like,a character who is tough but can also get out of dangerous situations and Snake in the city of New York which is an entire prison gets in many dangerous situations. Snake like Carpenter's other anti-hero's are loners,outcasts and outsiders in society that don't play well with others and are tough and are pretty much similar to Western characters. Snake is truly at the top of Carpenter's great anti-hero's including Jack Burton(Big Trouble In Little China),R.J MacReady(The Thing),John Nada(They Live),Napoleon Wilson(Assault On Precinct 13),Jack Crow(Vampires)John Trent(In the Mouth Of Madness)and James ""Desolation"" Williams(Ghosts Of Mars). They're all like Snake,tough and outspoken individuals. Carpenter loves the Western genre and EFNY is in many ways a futuristic western and Snake is a lone cowboy. Instead of cowboys, dust,dirt,outlaws,lawmen and tumbleweeds it dirty streets,burned-out buildings,crazed criminals and corrupt,futuristic lawmen. The script by John Carpenter and Nick Castle is well-written and memorable filled with great lines and characters and dark humor. The ending of the film is excellent cap-off to the film and is cynical,yet funny at the same time and one of the things that makes this movie classic and iconic.Kurt Russell is excellent as Snake Plissken one of my favorite movie characters of all time. Russell plays Snake to a hilt,wearing a eye patch and sporting a Clint Eastwood voice not giving a damn about the law,the president or anyone in general,Plissken is THE definition of an antihero. This is Russell's best and most iconic role and one of the reasons Kurt Russell is one of my favorite actors. Lee Van Cleef is wonderful as Hauk the man who runs the prison. Van Cleef's scenes with Russell are great and the two have a great chemistry together. Donald Pleasence is great as the president,playing scared and nervous well in the film. Ernest Borgnine does a fine job as Cabbie bringing most of the film's humor. Harry Dean Stanton is amazing as Brain a man who is smart and can figure things out quickly. Adrienne Barbeau is fantastic and sexy as Maggie,Brain's girlfriend,squeeze and bodyguard who will protect Brain at all costs. Issac Hayes is outstanding as the villain The Duke Of New York bringing a larger than life character with the soulful voice and presence he brought to his music. Tom Atkins(Rehme),Frank Doubleday(Romero),Season Hubley(Girl In Chock Full O'Nuts)and Charles Cyphers(Secretary Of State)do good jobs as well.The direction by John Carpenter is excellent because's he's always moving the camera and never slowing down and the fact the film mostly takes place at night adds to the film's suspense and tension. The action scenes are well-done and timed and the film moves at a wonderful fast pace. Like I said before,Carpenter makes low budget films look like they have a bigger budget and greater than they are and EFNY is no exception. Great job,John.The score by Carpenter and Alan Howarth is wonderful and adds to the tone of the film and the Escape From New York theme is one of my all time favorite movie theme songs. One of Carpenter's best scores.In final word,Escape From New York is a classic that will stand the test of time and will not be forgotten,from it's great beginning to it's cynical yet funny ending. John Carpenter and Kurt Russell at their best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Escape from New York

Manhattan has been turned into a penal colony - a large wall has been built around the island in response to a huge rise in crime rates, and the prisoners are left to their own devices behind these walls which are guarded by the police. Plissken is due for arrival at the prison, just as Air Force One crashes into the island with the president (Donald Pleasance) on board. Plissken is told that he will receive a full pardon if he goes in and rescues the president within 24 hours. He accepts the mission because he hasn't much to lose.""Escape from New York"" is a gritty Sci-Fi thriller from John Carpenter with superb cinematography, an excellent music score and a fine performance from Kurt Russell in creating one of the greatest anti-heroes of all-time. Donald Pleasance (""Halloween""), Harry Dean Stanton (""Alien"") and Tom Aikens (""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"") are also amongst the supporting cast. This is a very good film that epitomises the aura of 1980s action flicks but unfortunately Carpenter does not allow the material to flourish the way it should have. The film lacks urgency; it is no where near as exciting as it should be, and I came away from it feeling a little underwhelmed. I was expecting a lot more suspense and a bit more action and violence. I didn't like the silly business with the cassette tape, I felt that it wasn't really necessary and was a weak point. Surely, saving the president is enough of a reason to go in there.The ingredients were there for this to be a true '80s masterpiece - the props, the story, the actors - but it simply does not give the pay-off it should. But overall this is a great film and I probably have been a little too harsh on it; I loved the gritty and sleazy vibe, the very dark cinematography and the atmospheric and bleak score. It may be undercooked, but ""Escape from New York"" is still classic 80's. Also, there is no denying how eerie the World Trade Centre looks in this film in today's viewing.",Escape from New York

Escape from New York is apocalyptic classic action futuristic movie that belongs with The Road Warrior. The best 80's action science fiction film about anti-hero of all time. Snake Plissken is Kurt Russell's best role even Kurt himself addmited his favorite character he ever played was Snake Plissken. One of the best futuristic action movies I have ever seen. Directed and Writen was by John Carpenter which this is a classic masterpiece film. Starring: Kurt Russell, Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, Donald Pleasence, Isaac Hayes, Harry Dean Stanton and Adrienne Barbeau.""I heard you were dead!""The movie is about a rescue mission of US President. In 1988, following a 400% increase in crime, the United States has turned Manhattan into a giant maximum-security prison. A 50-foot (15 m) wall surrounds the island, bridges have been mined, and all prisoners are sentenced to life terms. , set in the near-future world of 1997, concerns a crime-ridden United States, which has converted Manhattan Island in New York City into the country's maximum-security prison. ""Once you go in you don't come out"". Air Force One is hijacked by a terrorist and crash lands in the island of Manhattan. Government need their president back in 24 hours or whole country dies. Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef) gives Snake Plissken 22 hours to go in to island and bring back their president and the cassette tape that is important. Hauk has Plissken injected with micro-explosives in 22 hours they will explode and Plissken dies unless he complete the task. Snake Plissken is a former U.S. Army Lieutenant now convict who accepts a deal and goes trough hell in New York in the serach for US president. A long the way he takes three people with him Cabbie (Ernest Borgnine), Brain (Harry Dean Stanton) and Brain's gf Maggie (Adrienne Barbeau). On the way they meet a lot of gangs trough the city like are: Skulls gang country on the Broadway and ""Duke of New York"" (Isaac Hayes), who is the leader of the Gypsies, the largest and most powerful gang in the city who has the president.The movie is serious, everything is for real, the music groundbreath taking. Great lines, great lines, great dialogues. Great music score by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth love the music score! A lot of action scens that are well executed. Great performance by Kurt Russell, Adrienne Barbeau and Harry Dean Stanton. I love the rescue mission by Snake when he finds the President who is being held in an abandoned railroad car in what was the Grand Central Train Station and a thug shoots with his crossbow an arrow and wounds Snake's leg, but Snake throws a knife in his head killing him. Excellent effect great scene my favorite. Snake is forced to fight with a giant power-house brute (Ox Baker). Great choreography you have Snake and a giant with baseball bat that has nails trough the bat awesome. You have a car chase Duke chasing them in his Cadillac, Snake and the others who drive trough mine-strewn bridge cab hits a land mine, the cab is destroyed excellent sequence.One of the best action movie of all time, I really love Kurt Russell as Snake Plissken. Kurt Russell and John Carpenter return 15 years later in a sequel Escape from L.A. (1996) I like that film but it is astep down from this movie. The sequel made Snake Plissken more bad guy which I don't like that. In this movie at least his character tries to save that girl in the diner that she was taken by hannibals. He saved US President in this movie. In the sequel he didn't. Snake Plissken turn from anti-hero in to a real hero in here and I love and appreciate that. I love this movie so much, I always enjoy it. ""Duke of New York"" played by Isaac Hayes was one of the greatest villians of all time.I miss 80's, I miss action movies like this, why can't we get movies like this anymore? They don't make movies like this nowdays anymore. Hollywood sucks nowdays. Escape from New York is a stone cold classic with a practical special effects, great action. Frank Doubleday as Romero one of Duke's henchmans was great, he was the best villain with Duke number one of New York. The movie remindes me on The Warriors (1979) in which the city had gangs. They don't make movies nowdays like this anymore.John Carpenter's script and vision about the future in this movie was great, The Warriors, The Road Warrior, Escape from New York where are those kind of movies today? Like they were in the 70's and 80's.

""Escape From New York"" is an exciting tale of Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell), a former war hero who is now a criminal with a Eastwood-like accent and is ordered by Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef), the calm, but stubborn U.S. Police Commissioner to go into New York City, now the country's only maximum security prison and rescue the President (Donald Pleasence) in twenty-four hours.  Some of the scenes in this movie are terrific such as Snake eluding the Crazies, Snake finds Brain (Harry Dean Stanton), an old friend of his who betrayed him in a robbery, and the car chase across the 69th Street bridge that is mined.   Kurt Russell gives a near perfect performance as Snake and the film gets solid supporting performances from Cleef, Stanton, Pleasence, Ernest Borgnine as the last cab driver in the Big Apple, Adrianne Barbeau, Issac Hayes as the vicious Duke, and Frank Doubleday as Romero, who manages to steal some scenes in the movie with his freaky appearence and Jack Nicholson-like laugh. The story that was written by Carpenter and Nick Castle is smart and very well detailed.  Also, Carpenter makes a terrific musical score that pays off in some of the key scenes.

The greatest strength of the film is the anti-hero Snake Plissken, who is brilliantly embodied by Kurt Russell, a character who, in addition to having an ingenious name, has a fun and striking look.

But after rewatching it again tonight I don't see anything special about it anymore; maybe it's the adult eyes and the way that I see movies now that didn't allow me to enjoy this movie the way the teenager me did but the fact stays. To begin with there is no escape in Escape from New York per se - just a ten minute scene towards the end of the movie - this is not the right way to name the whole movie by. Secondly, the main hero, Snake Plissken, is a walking and talking caricature of any action hero figure there is and we basically know nothing about him by the end of the movie; especially after we hear so much (and so often!) about how everybody thinks he's dead. The score of the movie is downright awful and too minimalistic. Overall I can see why this movie has become such an instant classic with its fine visuals, occasional outbursts of violence, go-get-the-job-done action hero and the whole futuristic atmosphere but it's overrated in terms of its ""classic"" status and should not be considered as such simply out of its shallow nature and ALL of the characters, not so much of a plot and the way action itself is handled.",Escape from New York
161,swedzin,Carpenter's classic.,7,12 September 2011,"A pure early 80s action-SF classic film, directed by John Carpenter. Sweet. It was a good idea for the time. And Carpenter and, of course Kurt Russell created one of the most memorable bad-ass action heroes - Snake Plissken. Well, you can easily say that SF element here is just for some kind of... ""decorative"" nature, because the plot is set in 1997, in New York that is actually one big prison. While the action elements are pretty usual here, a normal action genre entry. Well, in my eyes, the movie succeeded, although I expected more generic concreteness.This is one of those, if not one of first ""save the president, time race"" action films. Kurt Russell, who was in the tough guy element, with husky, quiet voice, just like Clint Eastwood in ""Dirty Harry"", but Snake Plissken has bigger weapons. He is one of those anti-hero icons of the 80s and that's what we like about this film. Long live Kurt Russell! Lee Van Cleef, a western star, here comes pretty solid as a supporting villain, to send Snake to save president, played by always brilliant Donald Pleasence. Of course Snake got some help from Brain (played by excellent Harry Dean Stanton) and his girl Maggie (played by talented and smoking hot Adrienne Barbeau). There's also a Cabbie, played by cool Ernest Borgnine, he was great. While the leading bad guy is The Duke, call him that, played by that cool deep voiced singer Issac Hayes, loved the Duke.Everything else about this film, well, that's just Carpenter's trademark.

162,Sonatine97,"""Chef"" Assaults Clint Eastwood's sound-alike Mad Max On Precinct 13!",7,25 August 2000,"Badly dated future noir with fascist dictators and Manhattan as one big secure prison full of the dregs of humanity, while the World is on the brink of a big bad pow-wow!!Enter Snake, (Kurt Russell) the anti-hero, sent in by Lee Van Cleef to rescue the President (Pleasence) from the prison island and return him in time for World Peace Talks AND to remove a capsule injected into Snake's arteries that will explode and kill him inside 24 hours.And that's about it really. From then on it's all action, action, action. Which is all very nice but it really feels so dated & wooden that you wonder why Carpenter bothered with this rubbish.Russell has obviously being watching too many Clint Eastwood/Mad Max films and as a consequence went into ""Method Acting"" to perfect the rather one dimensional Snake Plissken. The role is so barren & souless that I really didn't give a toss whether he succeeded or not. Unlike other Russell vehicles such as The Thing or Big Trouble in Little China, where he played the roles for laughs and thus added a lot wit, drive, humour & warmth into his parts, Snake is nothing more than an android with a Bad Attitude.
This isn't helped by the lacklustre support. Van Cleef fails to convince and just wanders around with squinted eyes mumbling on about the end of the world is in Snake's hands, and all that gubbings. Unlike Ernest Borgnine, who realises right from the start that this movie is junk and treats it as such, with only the pay cheque at the end of it his only driving interest.Harry Dean Stanton & Donald Plesence look totally out of place, and their discomfort is so obvious it's positively embarrassing. While Adrienne Barbeau adds a little feminine charm to proceedings to keep the male audience interested (although not for her acting abilities unfortunately, but more for her bouncing chest).Then there's the chief baddy Isaac Hayes. Dear oh dear, he should stick to what he does best - produce damn fine soul records. Even his Chef character from South Park offers superior acting compared to his limp attempt in this movie.Escape is okay for what it is, but I feel Carpenter took a backward step here after such a good start with Dark Star and the middling Assault on Precinct 13.

164,Jared_Andrews,"Stylish, Gritty Ation Sci-Fi Movie with Incredible Music",7,8 July 2020,"It's 1997 (but it's the future since this movie was made in 1981) and the United States crime rates have skyrocketed, particularly in New York City. To handle the rising prison population and abundance of violent inmates, the government opts to turn New York City into a maximum security fortress for individuals who have committed the most vile crimes. There are no guards inside the prison, only inmates. They form their own society. Guards only intercede if a prisoner attempts to escape. No one gets out alive.
When the president's plane is hijacked and terrorists bring him into the prison city, convicted felon and soon-to-be resident of the prison, Snake Plissken is asked to do the impossible and bring the president out alive.
The setup is rich and compelling, yet there's a tremendous amount of backstory that is left untold in ""Escape from New York"" and that's part of what makes it work. There's an air of mystery wafting through the movie that continually begs questions but leaves it up to the viewer to imagine what the answers might be. ""Why does Snake have an eyepatch?"" ""What caused the explosion in crime rates?"" ""Why does the president have a British accent?"" All these questions and more make the movie fun to discuss and re-watch repeatedly, searching for hints that help unravel the mystery.
Kurt Russell is unforgettable as Snake, who should be a loathsome character but instead becomes a hero we have no trouble rooting for. He practically growls every line of dialogue because he crackles with too much anger to simply speak. Somehow, despite everything about him being ostensibly unlikable, he's still charming in a way. He would make for an incredible dinner party guest. On one hand, he would likely scare most of the guests and make them feel dumb. But on the other hand, he would probably make all of the guests think, ""wow, if you have a friend like this guy, you must be a really interesting person."" Inviting him is a big gamble, for sure. Though, it just might pay off.
Along with Snake, the highlight of the movie is John Carpenters music. Find another 1980s movie with a cooler score. I dare you. Carpenter has created two of the most recognizable and undeniably excellent theme music tracks of the 70s and 80s (""Halloween"" is the other). And he directed both movies.

The film itself was directed, written, and music composed by John Carpenter himself who previously had the highly successful Halloween a few years before. Escape from New York got critcial acclaim from both critics and audiences alike and turned in a profit at the box office. Escape from New York would later get a sequel in 1996 titled Escape from L.A. which was not as well recieved. The film stars Kurt Russell as Snake Plissken with Donald Pleasence as the President (he appeared in the Halloween films), Ernest Borgnine, and Harry Dean Stanton (would later appear in Red Dawn).Our film takes place in the future of 1997 where the United States is in a war and it is just ending. The President is in Air Force One heading to a peace summit when it is hijacked and he escapes via an escape pod and gets kidnapped by the Duke in New York which has become a wasteland and the island of Manhattan is a big maximum security prison. With the President kidnapped, the government asks convict, former Special Ops and Purple Heart recipient, Snake Plissken to rescue the President in 24 hours. If he fails, he dies.The story is an interesting one and has some good social commentary for the time. It is funny to think that John Carpenter was inspired by the whole Watergate scandal to make this film. So yes the story is pretty good. The whole dark tone of this film is done pretty well and Carpenter usually does a great job in creating dark tones. The set designs are extraordinary and even convince me that , yes, they are in fact in New York inhabited by crazies. The acting is done fairly well with a few memorable characters here and there with Cabby and Snake being my favorite characters of the film. Now, I do honestly feel like this film is fairly overrated. This film has been on my watchlist for a long time and when I saw that it was going to be on television, I recorded it. Here is where things went wrong. The film without commercials should be 100 minutes long. With commercials, you would be looking at maybe 120 minutes. The broadcast that I watched was 90 minutes long WITH commercials. So my first time viewing experience was not great. So, I took to the internet and found the film online and watched it in its entirety. But I do have some things that I have to complain or rather nitpick about this film. First, (funny enough) is the length of this film. The film clocks in at under 100 minutes which is completely fine. But I felt like this film could have had more scenes cause I end up feeling like I should be getting more out of this film. This film is labeled as an Action/ Sci Fi film. Die Hard was the first modern action movie and changed action movies. Escape from New York does not have a ton of action scenes in my opinion. I did not feel a whole lot of suspense either in this film. Another complaint is how Snake Plissken is OVERRATED. Sure, he may be my favorite character in the film. Sure, he maybe badass in terms of his looks, and what he says and how he says those things (""The name's Plissken""). But, I don't see him do a whole lot of things in this film that puts him on par with John McClane or Rambo. But he is serviceable enough. Lastly, is the musical score. Now hear me out, I love the Escape from New York soundtrack. John Carpenter has some great music out there and this film's soundtrack is just another one of his greats. But, sometimes it does not fit well with the dark nature of this film. There are only a few parts of the film where it feels this way.In all, Escape from New York is overrated in a few ways but manages to excel in certain areas. Is it the film that I was hoping it be? Not entirely. Coming out of this film, I felt like I could have had more. There was just too little in my opinion. But nonetheless, the film was fun to watch and I do not hate this film at all.",Escape from New York

Oh. The ending sucked ;> The ending was in keeping with the period during which it was made, and that 'bad-ass' attitude. I probably really enjoyed the ending when I was young and stupid ;> Not so much now.
It's fun, good action. It has a terrific cast, good acting. I like the roughness of the movie, compared to the super-slick action of today's movies. It's not difficult to follow, but at the same time, we the viewers aren't spoon-fed the plot as is very common in movies nowadays.

169,dkncd,Call him Snake,10,27 October 2007,"John Carpenter's ""Escape from New York"" begins with a statement that in 1988 crime in the United States increased 400 percent. It is never explained why crime increased so drastically, but the importance of the statement is only to establish that Manhattan Island has been converted to a maximum security prison.The film's story takes place in a hypothetical 1997 and concerns the efforts of one Snake Plissken, a former war hero and convicted bank robber coerced into rescuing the President of the United States after Airforce One crashes on Manhattan Island. Not surprisingly, conditions within the prison are harsh and the film excellently creates a dingy, run-down setting with decaying buildings, dark lighting and even some rats. The score is unmistakably a product of the 1980s and is mostly effective but sometimes over-the-top. The theme from the start and end credits is strangely catchy. The costumes are also memorable, with the outlandish costumes of the prisoners contrasting nicely with the imposing costumes of the police force guarding the prison.This film strongly benefits from its cast. Kurt Russell leads the cast as Snake Plissken, the anti-social, anti-establishment, semi-celebrity anti-hero that is made memorable despite speaking in short lines in low tones. Lee Van Cleef, known as a villain from Westerns, is a perfect choice to play the police commissioner that oversees Snake's efforts. Ernest Borgnine is likewise memorable as the affable, energetic cab driver that allies with Snake. Donald Pleasence is well-cast as the President of the United States and Isaac Hayes is too as the self-styled ""Duke of New York"".The film's story remains interesting with the different turns Snake has to take to seek the President. This is in part because the script is focused and doesn't meander. Carpenter does indulge in one very horror-like scene, but it does not detract from the film's dystopian storyline.",Escape from New York

But Not enough good things can be said about the classic cult action film this is. It has a great cast with a great director at the wheel.The performances are fantastic and everyone has a interesting personality that makes you either hate them or respect them. Kurt russel does awesome as a likeable heroic that can be compared to arnold in terminator or Stallone in Rambo.The music is phenomenal, classic 80s with carpenter's touch. You get a extreme thrill and suspense as soon as you hear it.The story is equally just as good as the characters. Together they make the story insanely suspenseful and interesting. This isnt a ordinary action flick. I cant say enough how much of a awesome plot this has and how much you get immersed inside this place. It's a crazy city that every corner is more interesting than the last.Summary:

This is just plain simple ridiculous.This movie is a disaster or should I call it the mother of disaster. Script is horrible, the plot is full of holes, the lighting was worse, the set was silly. And the hero talks like as if he has a very bad case of constipation. Maybe the director thought it would be macho to talk like that but it definitely was not. Another funny thing was the chief of police was wearing a earring, and acting like he was doing something when all he was doing sitting on a chair in front of a microphone.This movie has nothing, no suspense, no twist, no romance, no action, no comedy, no drama, not even attractive actor or actresses.

172,JeffG.,An 80's classic.,8,5 November 1999,"John Carpenter has this real gift for being able to make really good movies with small budgets. This movie is a fine example. Carpenter manages to overcome the $6 million budget (then a large amount for a Carpenter film) and manages to create a film with some cool sets, fine visual effects (assisited by James Cameron) and lots of atmosphere. Carpenter's films have always relied on atmosphere and mood and this movie is no exception. The ""dark"" look and feel of the movie really set the proper mood. I'm also impressed at how none of the characters, especially Snake, are completely good or completely bad. There are shades of grey in everyone. Something lacking in too many movies nowadays.With this movie Carpenter managed to create one of the finest sci-fi/action films of the 80's.

It's strange that a director so good at suspense couldn't get more excitement out of the lead character's impending death, but it just isn't there... and the brief action scenes are few and far between. Also, Carpenter's dull musical score doesn't match up well with what's happening on screen. His simplistic scores worked in ""Assault on Precinct 13"" and ""Halloween,"" but it's totally of place here. However, the movie makes up for these shortcomings just by being so damn tough. The cool noir atmosphere is very menacing, and Kurt Russell does a perfect job with his role, looking like he's about to rip someone's head off at any moment. The rest of the cast shines as well (it's one of the best casts in movie history!).Even with the lack of ""high octane action,"" this is a dark, rough, and downright cool film that is definitely worth watching. 8/10 stars.",Escape from New York

He is sent into a modern day Manhattan which has been converted into a prison Island, to retrieve the president of the USA, who's plane has crashed in the center of the city. Plissken has exactly 22 hours to retrieve him, or two micro bombs in his neck will explode. He will also win his freedom if he makes it back alive.

Snake...... my name's Plissken.,8,5 April 2016,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Futuristic dystopia. President at large. Crimes everywhere. The worlds most vast prison; an entire island.The elements that the specific synthesizer music creates is very evocative. The pulses within the music tend to get me on edge. It is like something is soon going to happen.... and at the same time an alarm to show that something is wrong. Brings the thoughts to another motion picture.... ""The Thing"". Also starring Kurt Russell. Evil lurks somewhere.... at some time.... get ready....... The motion picture about an almost apocalyptic future is highly entertaining.... such as Running Man. Theme songs such as in this motion picture only existed then and there, and that is a sad thing. In the same manner than Michael Mann sets the mood for pictures like Manhunter, this piece of art creates a good flick with help by the modern (of its time) sounds and music. Almost like an video game, with the touch and twist of a music video.I really understand and grasp why this film has become an classic. There, in 1981, the entire production were of high class. The story follows through and keeps it interesting all the time. Could have called it slow paced and tense.... maybe it is just those things. Anarchy in a future ""island prison"" lays out the solemn history of the characters, showing the main characters how to survive at the same time as time is running out.A masterpiece speaking of creating an atmosphere that reached out there and still to this day reaches out and make the followers create new things out of this one.And....last and maybe the best part; the music....the soundtrack. Three letters: WOW!Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Nice and dark. Enough to create the environment of an anarchistic prison. Once again; the music....oh, my....! - The actors : Kurt Russell. Lee Van Cleef. Ernest Borgnine. Isaac Hayes. All brings their characters to life... Good work! Snake Plissken....

176,talllwoood13,over rated,3,18 July 2021,"Maybe 25 or so years ago this may have been an iconic movie but on todays standards it was just mediocre at best. I bet half the people only watched this the last while because of the inspiration for Metal Gear and to a certain degree it feels like the game Dying Light but Dying Light is reaching. The plot was dull and unoriginal. Then again this movie turned 40 this year so I'll give it some credit. It's the story of an average skinny guy with a hilarious reverse tramp stamp on his stomach because why else would we call him snake and a surprisingly nice head of hair goes in to Manhattan to save the president. Snake is against such memorable villains as crack addict Goku and Isaac Hayes in poorly done Halloween costume of Lemmy KIlmister of Motorhead it feels like. He almost effortlessly finds the president because he's such a professional. I have no idea why the Uzi looking sub machine gun has a sniper rifle scope on it considering how inaccurate they can be. But just like many movies by chance or way too easily he finds the president.The ending was awful for many reasons and I felt Isaac could have been more hated as a bad guy but who knows maybe Kurt Russell was just there to be 80s eye candy. The movie has some great CGI and it's got a great atmosphere both with such a dark and gritty set, the lighting, a surprising amount of fires but the story is so poorly done and poorly paced. Seriously how the heck does this movie have a 7 out of 10 other than maybe the nostalgic people or those who are infatuated with Hideo Kojima as if he was the only person to make metal gear solid an iconic game.As great as Kurt can look for the movie he should have got in better shape to play the role as we all remember what WWF and similar wrestlers looked like back then and got him to do martial arts training because the few times he ""fights"" which is a broad use of the word it looked awful. It's like the one kid who brags he can beat people up in school and when he finally fights you realize how weak he is. The gun sound effects sound so horrible the Foley (sound effect maker) should have been fired. If everything wasn't so convenient it would have helped as well. He meets henchmen aside like 9 people give or take I didn't count and 6 of them help him in a city as big as Manhattan.Would I watch it again? No.",Escape from New York

Kurt Russell was decent as the title role and Donald Pleasance is always great (though he didn't have that much screen time in this which sucked). Don sounds so much like Alec Guiness it's crazy. While I usually don't say this I think this is actually a film that may benefit from a remake because with a new writer and some CGI it could probably go a long way. This was an okay movie, but nothing to write home about.Final Word:Movies : No, unless I could go back to when it first came out.DVD Purchase : Nah, didn't catch my attention enough.Rental : Yes, it was a good movie to see only once.",Escape from New York
178,The-Social-Introvert,Quickie Review: Escape from New York,8,24 August 2015,"Escape from New York is a solid and memorable independent action film that shot Kurt Russell to stardom, who plays the now-classic anti- hero Snake Plissken. This is probably the quintessential cult film of the 80's, with an extraordinary premise you'd only find in a B movie and one of the coolest collection of characters ever put on screen. Russell's anarchist eyepatch-wearing lead is joined by Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, Donald Pleasence, Isaac Hayes, Adrienne Barbeau, Adrienne Barbeau's cleavage, Harry Dean Stanton and Tom Atkins. These guys play utterly cool and inventive characters that, had Escape been made today, there would surely be the subject of countless spinoffs and sequels. The story involves the military sending in Snake to rescue the president of the US from New York, which in the future of 1997 (hold your laughter) has been turned into a prison island where criminals are thrown into and left to do as they please. As you can expect, this leads to Snake confronting a vast amount of deranged and wacky characters. It's a grim and deadly place (much like New York now!) with the very worst humanity has to offer thrust in a claustrophobic environment. Despite the bleakness, a cheeky satirical edge and healthy amount of dark humour is present throughout, and the runtime (just over an hour and a half, like most Carpenter films) leaves you wanting more from a film with lines like ""I don't give a damn about you or your president."" The machismo nature of the characters, especially Snake and The Duke, make your biceps and balls grow just by watching them. Best Scene: Which to choose? For me it'll be when The Duke arrives (in a car with chandeliers!) accompanied by Carpenter's hip score. That man just doesn't get enough credit for his jams.",Escape from New York
179,Snake-666,Another great action flick from John Carpenter!,7,14 August 2003,"I have to say, although Carpenter is mainly associated with the horror genre, I prefer him as a director of a few great action movies. Having previously given us the superbly chilling Assault on Precinct 13' Carpenter offers us this perhaps accurate look at the future.1997 - Manhattan Island has now been turned into a maximum security prison due to the alarmingly high escalation of crime. The police are encamped around the island like the military but inside there is no law, just the world the prisoners create for themselves. After a plane carrying the President of the United States (Donald Pleasance) is hijacked and brought down inside the compounds of the island future prisoner and ex-soldier Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is offered a pardon if he rescues the President and more importantly a valuable tape. To ensure his co-operation and eliminate his chance of escape Plissken is fitted with a small explosive that will detonate and kill him unless he completes the mission and rescues the tape inside 24 hours.The film looks very dated these days, aside from the fact that we are now past 1997, the computer equipment featured and the general quality of the print (at least the one I viewed) makes the film look old. However, that does hardly anything to harm Escape from New York'. In the same vein as Assault on Precinct 13' there is no over-the-top Hollywood style action but instead shorter and more controlled action sequences that in some ways impress more than the lengthy and firey action sequences of Hollywood movies. Escape from New York' in some ways takes on a thriller feel as we wait to see whether Snake can rescue the President on time or if he can even find the President amongst the now crime-run desolate streets of New York. The movie is gripping and Snake Plissken is one of the few truly interesting action movie characters. Snake isn't really a good guy yet the audience is still made to sympathise with him and support his cause.For anyone who doubts Kurt Russell's acting abilities I suggest you watch this film. In the same way that the character of The Terminator seems like it was written for Arnie, the character of Snake Plissken is made his own by an excellent performance from Kurt Russell. Russell is supported by quite a strong cast and the performance from Isaac Hayes as the Duke of New York is worthy of recognition as one of the best portrayals of a villain in the last thirty years. The only problem with the cast I had was the casting of Donald Pleasance as the President of the United States. It might just be me but I think Donald just sounds a little too British to be playing the role of the President. Credit though where it is due, Mr. Pleasance certainly gave it his all for the role and played it quite well.This is definitely worth a watch for action fans. Some may be disappointed by the lack of gunfights and explosions but this is still a very adept action-thriller. With so many memorable lines and scenes I think that any movie fan, especially those of Assault on Precinct 13' and early John Carpenter, should make it a personal mission to check out this movie. My rating for Escape from New York'  8/10.",Escape from New York
180,irishm,Forgettable action-adventure,4,18 March 2014,"There were several things that bugged me about this movie, which I finally watched for the first time in 2014. I guess the first was Kurt Russell's voice... he sounded like he was doing a Clint Eastwood imitation. I'm no big fan of Eastwood's so I won't classify it as either a good or a poor rendition, just that every line he spoke came across as some kind of vocal caricature, like someone ""doing"" Marlon Brando.The glider landing on top of the World Trade Center, I liked. I didn't really believe it could have been done, but I liked it. The part I was the most interested in seeing, watching Kurt Eastwood... I mean, Clint Russell... take off in the thing at the end of his mission ended up not happening. I sincerely doubted he could have piloted a glider off the edge of the tower with no running start and somehow managed to immediately gain rather than lose altitude, and I was looking forward to watching him try. Alas, he found another way to 'Escape from New York'...... via the world's least convincing New York City bridge. I mean really, folks. We're all familiar with the Brooklyn, George Washington, Queensborough Bridges to some extent. The things are huge, multi-lane jobs with multiple decks. This is New York. There were a lot of cars going back and forth before they turned Manhattan into a prison. Yet Kurt & Co. escape across a two-lane truss bridge that looks like the one over the river a mile from my house in semi-rural New England, only longer. I saw the movie last night and I'm still laughing. Good luck putting that puny little spindly thing across the Hudson River. I see in the Trivia section that the sequence was filmed on a real bridge somewhere far from New York City... THAT, I believe.Ernest Borgnine was fun as a cabbie, and there was a singularly unpleasant-looking dude in the background that hissed a lot and looked like some kind of a mostly-human mutant who was very entertaining in a dark, creepy way. The rest of the movie was rather poorly thought out and the visuals didn't support what they were trying to do. Good gravy, that bridge... well, action-adventure fans might want to give it a look anyway. Held my attention adequately until the end.",Escape from New York
181,ALauff,Great director-actor collaboration,8,11 August 2004,"In the year 1997, crime has jumped 400%. Manhattan is a maximum-security prison with armed guards and a 50-foot concrete wall surrounding its perimeter, essentially quarantining the criminal element. Kurt Russell, Carpenter's oft-used lone hero, plays decorated war vet Snake Plissken, whose robbery of a federal depository has landed him in the big house for life. Meanwhile, the president's (Donald Pleasance) plane has crashed within the prison walls and he needs to deliver a speech on nuclear fusion to an international roundtable within the next 24 hours or else the planet is doomed. So Plissken, who has a widespread rep as a bad ass mercenary-for-hire, in exchange for immunity, agrees to rescue the president and bring him out of Manhattan. ""Escape"" seems to float on this engaging premise, buoyed by cool offhand satirical remarks about what war and duplicitous leadership can do to one's principles—""I don't give a fuc& about your war or your president"" sums it up quite nicely—plus memorable production design, dank lighting, and wide shots of the New York skyline (once again, Carpenter + Panavision = magic) to evoke mundane, realistic anomie.Although the ideology is probably under-emphasized—we can presume that the world is run by nuclear energy, which speaks to an ecological precautionary tale that never fully materializes—I think what should be inferred is what's visible on the surface: for one, how the police state has reduced citizens to scurrying about under search lights like sewer rats, the state's inseparability of lawbreaker from law-abider. The more I see, the more I appreciate Carpenter's visual approach, particularly his way of filling the frame with coalescing suspicious and heroic characters, which highlights a moral complexity and willingness to interrogate traditional ideas of right and wrong.",Escape from New York

183,CalDexter,8 reasons why Escape From New York is a Masterpiece.,10,16 December 2006,"My favourite scenes in Escape From New York.1. The camera slowly rising over the Security Wall to reveal a very bleak and darkly New York Skyline to John Carpenter and Alan Howarth's brooding soundtrack.2. Air Force One hijacked and flown into a New York building (Very Very disturbing when watching this in 2006, you know why).3. Snake Plissken's interview with Lee Van Cleef's Security Commander. A brilliant Eastwood performance by Kurt Russell brings back the glory days of Van Cleef's sparring with the man with no name in For A Few Dollars More and The Good The Bad And The Ugly. Excellent.4. Plissken's flight into New York by Glider Plane is superb, as is the soundtrack for this sequence. Again it felt strange seeing his glider approaching The World Trade Center. That such a towering structure no longer exists is just depressing.5. The Duke's car....LOL every time i see it when we are introduced to him. The soundtrack beat in this sequence is fantastic.6. The ring match between the 7 foot wrestler and Plissken is really good, but could have been better staged, like the way the Arena scenes in Gladiator were filmed. Despite this, its still good.7. The final race over the mined 69th street Bridge is excellent and rather moving, when characters you've warmed to over the last hour start getting killed. Snake's struggle over the Security wall the first time you see Escape From New York will have you on the edge of your seat. Also When Snake tries to get Maggie to move after what has happened to Brain, i found this sequence to be lingering in my mind long after the ending. Great stuff.8. The ending. Its both funny and very very cool.",Escape from New York
184,nmholland,"Really Not A Great Film, But Wasn't Bad Either",7,5 April 2016,"Escape From New York is directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell as Snake Plissken, a criminal living in a ""futuristic"" world in 1997. Keep in mind, this film came out in 1981, so at the time, 1997 was futuristic. In this future, the United States government has completely walled up the city of Manhattan, and all criminals have been sent there, with no way out. There are no established laws, except that nobody is allowed to escape. Snake Plissken is a military man gone felon that was sentenced to this dystopian New York due to his heist of the federal reserve. When Air Force One, the plane with the President on board, goes down in the middle of Manhattan, Snake is recruited (more like forced) to bring the President back to safety within a specific amount of time. In return, he will be forgiven of all crimes committed, and will live the life of a free man.1980's action cheese. Three little words describe about 90% of this film. However, that's not exactly a bad thing. It's good to see a cheesy movie, such as Predator (1987), or Commando (1985), unless it's tone doesn't fit the style in which the movie was made in, which Escape From New York is a good example of. Not that the movie is bad, it's just something that I wouldn't personally plan on watching again, and I love cheesy movies. There are good qualities, but there are also bad qualities, which somewhat even out each other.The first bad thing that stood out to me about the film is the score. The score follows the early 1980's trend of just containing electronic ""beeps,"" or tuned sounds rising and falling back down again. This type of score was very common in the early 80's, and didn't do justice for any film, especially with all of the movies coming out that had amazing, original scores like Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) or Back to the Future (1985). I don't like to compare films too often, but scores are a bit different, and when comparing a single keyboard and a computer to an entire orchestra, it's pretty easy to see why the latter has scores that are still common and loved today, while nobody downloads the score for Escape From New York. This particular score works very well in some scenes, especially when the script, the actors, and the camera work is building suspense, but during an action scene, it just fails.On the contrary the plot for this film is a really good one. The plot for this movie is very simple, and that's all a good movie ever has for a foundation. An easy to follow plot. This simplicity works especially well in an action film, because the filmmakers aren't trying to cram in plot details within the action scenes, so the film doesn't drag down at all. Escape From New York clocks in at about an hour and a half, and only about 5-10 minutes of it is exposition. Due to this, the script had a lot of time for action, which lets up on the director, and the actors, majorly.The direction in this movie does most of the talking. John Carpenter is a great director, and he really shows it in this movie. Although the movie may not be perfect, or even that great, the camera work is the exact opposite. Carpenter displays his beautiful gift for film all throughout the movie, and knows when to use different camera angles. I've no complaints with the direction; it's great.The acting is also really good. The only real part that anyone pays attention to is Snake, and Kurt Russell does a great job as this cold criminal. He cares about no one else, yet will do whatever it takes to make things his way. Russell is very iconic as this role, and I couldn't see anyone replacing him. I'm glad the filmmakers made this casting choice, because it really paid off. Although they may not matter too much, the other characters were cast well. I agreed with most of the casting choices, however weak their character may have been.Now, the biggest problem Escape From New York has lies with the editing. The editing of this film, particularly the sound, is bad. There are honestly moments in which a gun will be fired, and no sound effects will go with it. Or, a character will fall onto the hood of a car, yet there's no noise at all. There are also parts in which somebody will get hurt, and the weapon of their death is never seen doing any harm to them at all, which makes the editing look very poor. If I had to grade this movie on the editing alone, it would scrape in at a 4 out of 10. However, I'm not, and the editing can be overlooked by the great things mentioned above.In conclusion, Escape From New York was a mindless action movie, but I can't say it was fun to watch. I wouldn't pay to see it again, and there were points in which I wasn't really enjoying myself while watching it. However, it still is a pretty decent movie, and there are respectable things about it, namely the straightforward plot, the great acting, and the excellent direction delivered from Carpenter.",Escape from New York

186,Space_Lord,Great sci-fi actioner!,7,10 February 2005,"This film is a great way to sit back, relax and kill some time. What a cool movie! Kurt Russell is great as Snake Plissken, a one time war hero cum outlaw who is recruited by the US government. His mission: to rescue the president from New York, now a walled off maximum security prison. It's more of a no man's land filled with the worst of American society.While this film has some great moments, in my opinion it suffers from a misused cast. This is a top notch cast that have not been used to their full potential, mostly settling for cameo roles and underdeveloped characters.However, John Carpenter knew how to make a cool action flick back in those days!! What a pity he can't seem to nail the right combination and deliver the action flick for the new millennium that he must know we're all craving! OK it might be just me, but I'm sure Carpenter fans will agree with me!!",Escape from New York
187,MadReviewer,"Not Exactly An ""A-Number One"" Movie, But Darn Close",8,28 August 2001,"""Set in the dark future of 1997 . . .""Okay, so John Carpenter's post-apocalyptic vision of the future didn't exactly come true, but ""Escape From New York"" still holds up as a darn fine low-budget sci-fi/action flick.  Snake Plissken (as played by Kurt Russell) is still one of the coolest anti-heroes ever to grace the silver screen, and the story still contains some great scenes and dialogue . . . so who cares if parts of it look like low-budget cheese?  As long as you can appreciate great low-budget cheese, you'll be fine.""Escape From New York"" is set in the supposedly dark future of 1997, where the island of Manhattan, completely overrun with criminals and terrorists, has been walled off and turned into a Federal prison colony by the United States government.  The most vicious and ruthless criminals in America aren't sent to regular prisons anymore . . . they're simply dropped into the walled confines of Manhattan, where they face the choice of being killed by the other criminals living on the island or being killed by government sharpshooters if they try to climb the walls and escape the prison colony. So, New York has been transformed into a lawless hellhole where murderers rule the streets, and from which escape is impossible . . . and exactly where Air Force One has just crash-landed, with the President of the United States (Donald Pleasance) aboard.  To rescue the President -- and the President's unknown but valuable cargo -- military man Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef) decides to send the best man for the job into the heart of this lawless hellhole.  That man is Snake Plissken (Russell), an ex-soldier and former war hero who no longer takes orders from any man -- but who faces execution unless he can bring the President back from New York alive . . ..""Escape From New York"" features a terrific plot as its foundation and a great cast for support. It's the details, though, where the film starts to slip.  Some of the details -- both in terms of story and production -- are quite good, others . . . well, they'll make you wince.  Director (and script co-writer) John Carpenter is smart enough to keep things simple and to keep everything moving along at a rapid pace; whenever things start moving into the realms of the laughably stupid, something new and cool happens onscreen to wipe that stupidity away.  It's a story painted with very broad and vivid strokes; everything seems very cool and makes sense as long as you don't dwell on the details.  Carpenter also takes what advantages he can from his low budget and low production values -- almost everything is filmed in the dark, and a lot is filmed indoors; also, everything (props, costumes, etc.) are deliberately given a cheap and dirty look, rather than attempting to make things look good with no money.  Not only do these moves let ""Escape From New York"" look as good as it possibly can, but it also fits the feel of the ""gritty, dark future"" that already permeates the film.The characters in ""Escape From New York"", though, are what really make the film shine.  Donald Pleasance is perfectly cast -- and perfectly scummy -- as the President, who is little more than a weasel in a three-piece suit. It's great to watch Pleasance strut around pompously in the beginning of the film -- hey, after all, he's the President of the United States -- and then eventually be reduced to a pathetic, animal-like, gun-wielding thug, no better than any other criminal trapped within the walls of Manhattan. Ernest Borgnine serves up some welcome comic relief as the cheerful Cabbie, who's possibly the only happy person still living in New York.  Isaac Hayes, of all people, turns out to be very good as the ""A-Number One Duke of New York""; he's not exactly what you'd expect from a movie villain, but he definitely makes the part distinctly his own.  Lee Van Cleef is great as the no-nonsense Bob Hauk; he plays Hauk in a low-key but menacing manner that stands out nicely against the over-the-top performances put in by nearly every other actor.  But ""Escape From New York"" is really Snake Plissken's movie, and Kurt Russell is THE reason that Snake Plissken is one of the best movie anti-heroes of all time.  Partly borrowing from Clint Eastwood's ""Man With No Name"" character, Snake Plissken is a man who's going to do whatever he feels is right or necessary, and orders be damned.  He doesn't say much -- he usually lets his guns or his fists speak for him -- but when he does speak, he doesn't mince words.  It's interesting to note that nearly every other character in ""Escape From New York"" is a liar of some sort with selfish hidden agendas . . . not Snake.  He always speaks his mind, he nearly always speaks the truth, and ironically, he's the most dangerous character in the movie.  Kudos to Kurt Russell for making Snake Plissken one of the best sci-fi/action characters of all time.  For Snake Plissken alone, it's a genuine pleasure to watch ""Escape From New York"".Director John Carpenter will probably never be appreciated for what he is -- the master of the modern B-movie.  Along with ""Halloween"" and ""They Live"", the film ""Escape From New York"" stands as one of the greatest modern B-movies ever made.  Carpenter's films often look like they have the budget of a high school musical production, but they usually at least manage to be original and entertaining . . . which is something more than a lot of recent $100 million dollar so-called ""blockbusters"" can claim.  (Forget the production values; I'll watch ""Escape From New York"" over the soulless, spectacularly unoriginal ""Tomb Raider"" any day of the week.)  ""Escape From New York"" might not be one of the slickest or best-produced action films ever made -- but it is one of the coolest action films, and certainly one of the most memorable ones.  It might seem cheesy in places, or a little raw and crude in others . . . but it's got heart, and it's got guts, and in the end, that's what really matters.  A great action flick, and one of the best ""B"" movies ever made.  Grade: A-.",Escape from New York

I read in interviews that the filmmakers looked upon this movie as more of a joke; if that's the case they didn't really succeed. Had this film a slightly bigger budget and a more serious attitude (like Walter Hill's fantastic, ""The Warriors""), this could have been considered one of the best of the pessimistic, mankind-is-doomed-in-the-future movies, rather than just a very good b-movie.",Escape from New York

194,Welshfilmfan,A Supberb Modern Classic with a great cast ***** out of *****,10,31 January 2009,"'Escape From New York' is set in the near future (well... 1997), In a crime-ridden United States that has turned Manhattan Island in New York City into a Maximum Security Prison, Former Soldier and Legendary Fugitive 'Snake' Plissken (Kurt Russell) is given just 24 hours to find the President of the United States (Donald Pleasance)who has been captured by the inmates after 'Air Force One' crashes on the Island.Review:- Escape from NY is one of the best films of all time, which has been often imitated but never bettered or even equalled, The cast is top notch with stars such as Lee Van Cleef,Donald Pleasence, Issac Hayes, Harry Dean Stanton & Ernest Borgnine. it is by far Russell's best film and he fits the role of 'Snake' with ease, a role he wasn't first or even second choice to play, The studio at the time preferred Charles Bronson or Tommy Lee Jones as at the time Russell was deemed too lightweight after numerous forgettable Disney Flicks, thankfully though Carpenter refused and Russell was cast. 'Escape' was a huge hit, it opened in 1981 to positive reviews and made $25.2M on it's original release and $50M Worldwide on a budget of only $6M.This among various other modern classics such as 'Assault On Precinct 13 (1976), Halloween (1978), The Fog (1980) and The Thing (1982) solidified Carpenter's reputation as one of the best Filmmakers of all time, it's sad that in the years since he's become synonymous with trash, inferior sequels & remakes, including an unnecessary sequel to this 15 years later in 'Escape from L.A' (1996) because at the time Carpenter was having a tough time after numerous flops, and sadly, L.A. was no different, it was panned on it's original release for being inferior and it tanked taking only half it's budget.I'm sad to report that a Remake of New York is on it's way in the foreseeable future, which was to star bland actor Gerard Butler before he dropped out, my advice...DON'T BOTHER, think of new ideas John - stop tarnishing your Originals with trashy PG-13 sequels!***** out of *****",Escape from New York

I watched it again a few years ago and my stance on it changed (which is still my opinion today). What is the appeal of this? It has a neat concept, Kurt Russel is chilling as Snake Plisken (who served as one of the inspirations for Solid Snake, my favorite video game protagonist) and it has a subtle and dark atmosphere.This film falls short however in being a compelling action film, the opening scenes are slow but not in an interesting way, there's not much in the way of riveting action (even by 80's standards) and the characters are hollow (aside from Snake).

The pace is slow and the action is essentially nonexistent, but it compensates for what it lacks in traditional entertainment with pure cheese.Here, the anti-fascist stewardess overacts to the extreme, the term ""Air Force One"" blinks on the display for no reason, we see a cabbie enjoy a drag show, there's a campy henchman or three, the president is put into drag, Brain somehow has a map from a guy that didn't escape, there's an implant that will explode in *exactly* 24 hours unless subjected to X-rays (one can only wonder how they tested it), well... the list goes on.To say this is inferior to Halloween and even the Fog would be correct.

As Pleasance riddles Hayes with bullets at close range, he shouts back to him Hayes' own boastful refrain (Hayes would continually boast of this prowess to Pleasance, saying ""I'm the Duke of New York, I A-Number-One"", all the while keeping the President, PLeasance, in line with force). PLeasance showed the depth of his talent during this scene as he let his satisfaction show in an understated way, his voice trailing off to a soft, satisfied murmur as he continued to blast Hayes's now dead body with bullets---""...you're A-Number-One....""Chilling.

201,actionstar-89625,"""Call me Snake.""",7,18 January 2021,"First thing to remember is this was made in 1981, so the times and technology are going to be a little off by an excellent concept and setup shows that by 1988 crime has risen 400%. Manhattan Island has been selected to keep the worst criminals. Once they are put there they can not escape. If they attempt to get off the island by water or bridge they will be shot and killed. In 1997 the president (Donald Pleasance) is flying in Air Force One and the plane has been skyjacked. He escapes the plane using an escape pod, but lands right on Manhattan Island. The main baddie on the Island The Duke (Isaac Hayes) has grabbed the president to look for a way out. Meanwhile a prisoner Lt. Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell in a standout great role) is given a deal by police commissioner Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef, also in a great role) to get into Manhattan Island, get the president within 24 hours, because he has vital information needed at a summit he was going to and he will be pardoned for his crime of robbing the Federal Reserve. Thing is microscopic explosives that will detonate at that point and he will die if he does not return.The music in this film done by Carpenter with assistance from Alan Howarth is actually very minimal which in fact works as a plus towards the film. The theme to the film though to me is the best Carpenter ever did. Yes even beating the iconic HALLOWEEN theme, which is also amazing. The theme is so 1981 with its synths and keyboards all with a beautiful driving beat (which I would say Carpenter is known for).Excellent cast that also includes Ernest Borgnine, Harry Dean Stanton, Adrienne Barbeau and Tom Atkins to name a few. Time really clicks by quick in this futuristic action/sci-fi romp. As I mentioned earlier Russell kicks butt as Snake Plissken, who is a one man anti-hero before they were in every movie out there. I think Van Cleef is perfectly cast as the shadowy good guy who needs to get the best end of the deal with Plissken. Really to me a pretty good Carpenter flick that hit a homerun at the box office.

202,Colonel Ted,Frustratingly mediocre,5,5 April 2000,"Before 1981 and Escape from New York, John Carpenter had already scored huge hits and all time classics with Dark Star, Assault on Prescient 13 and Halloween. Why on earth he didn't opt for higher budgets is anyone's guess, because Escape from New York squanders a brilliant premise on shortages of budget, imagination and action. Kurt Russell impersonates Clint Eastwood as Snake Plissken: a convicted criminal who is sent into New York in 1997, which is now America's one and only maximum security prison, to rescue the President (Pleasence) whose plane has crashed. The film plays like a futuristic western, with Lee Van Cleef overseeing the operation from the control room, making the film's roots in Sergio Leone apparent. To be fair to Carpenter, he manages a lot on the $6 million budget: a great, dark look to the film, a panoramic cityscape, good special effects, impressive sets, a couple of effective action sequences, a script laced with black humour as well a great main theme. As a whole these elements make the film reasonably enjoyable. However it simply isn't enough. The film never fulfils its ingenious premise by not making use of Snake's time limit to complete the mission until the very end and as a result it spends a long time just not going anywhere. There's not enough action and the bad guys are a bunch of lacklustre convicts, lead by Isaac Hayes.

The setup for the ""future"" world is intriguing. A US that has become a right-wing police state, the city of New York used to dump America's criminal elements. The first half of the film is easily the strongest, building suspense and atmosphere.

But that alone could not make 'Escape from New York' the exciting race against time that it was supposed to be, even if director John Carpenter's conceptual basis behind the film creates as much intrigue as it does. The storyline progression is not as good as expected despite a premise which could have involved something more daring rather than more linear. In spite of this linearity, it was by no means a laborious watch. Touted as a 'futuristic' sci-fi based in the late 90s, the sets and cinematography still gave a very 80s feel which undermined the film's futuristic ambitions, as hard as it might have been with the technology at the time. The action, or inadequacy of it, was the most underwhelming aspect; Plissken's stealth exploits don't count as action. Nonetheless, the world within the film is made believable through the wide array of well played supporting characters from the 'means to an end' attitude police commissioner played by Lee Van Cleef to the intimidating 'Duke of New York' (Isaac Hayes) and his cronies. Decent, but only scratched the surface of something which had the potential to be a mainstream action classic rather than a concealed cult film.",Escape from New York

Had my popcorn and beer ready for some hell of a crazy 80s retro action flick ride.However the story and execution of this movie were poorly lacking. Most of the time you don't know what is really going on. The humor was a bit off. And the oneliners didn't really matter much. The characters were flat and the different factions and gangs in the forsaken barren depiction of New York Manhattan City weren't explained and weren't fleshed out. You just didn't care much about them all. There weren't even that many of New York landmarks to make this movie a worthwhile watch, this movie could have been filmed anywhere else, it didn't made it feel like explicitly New York, which is a shame.The actions were bland and lacked inspiration. And overall it was trying too hard to be something, but failed at it. Even for a B-movie this was badly executed and an abomination of a film. I would not even recommend this for nostalgia sake, it leaves a bitter after taste that can only be forgotten by washing down with some couple cans of more beer......",Escape from New York

Good camera work, and great stage art work, to reflect the secluded Manhattan as good as it could have been done in the very early 80's. I bet director John Carpenter was delighted with the finished product. His prime movie quartet was to be completed with ""The Thing"" in 1982, sealing a 4 year retinue that started with ""Halloween"" in 1978. (But never to forget the great ""Assault on Precinct 13"".) 1976. A really good comic book flick with classic takes and one-liners. ""Call me Snake""...

218,edwardjamessmith,One of John Carpenter's best films from the early 80's,10,22 February 2008,"John Carpenter has to be one of the best sci-fi horror helmers who's made so many great cult favourites. This one is one of them. ""Escape From New York"" may be quite dated but it still packs a punch! Kurt Russell's potrail as Snake Plissken, the war-hero turned criminal is great. John Crapenter's score is so good (got the remastered CD) and the apocalyptic tone & style of a ruined New York is one of the great things about this film. It doesn't even feel low-budget this film and watching this film in widescreen feels so good (one of the reasons why it doesn't feel low-budget).

It's a very dark film, visually but still holds up after all these years.
Ernest Borgnine plays one of his better roles as Cabbie and director John Carpenter is in top form here.The effects are pretty good considering the budget and the time period and the story is up to par for a sci-fi flick. I looked forward to the sequel which was okay but not as good as the original despite the bigger budget. Maybe they will make an updated version since this film has attained cult status. 8 out of 10.",Escape from New York
220,cinemabon,Kurt Russell is unforgettable,10,31 May 2012,"In 1981, New York's Times Square was filled with pawn shops, strip joints, peep shows, drug addicts, and prostitutes. It seems worlds away from the Disney stages and suburban mall feel that has taken its place. For nearly fifteen years between 1965 and 1980, Americans watched the hearts of their largest cities degenerate into havens for the miserable, misbegotten, and mislead. Great theaters fell into disrepair or were torn down. Unique specialty shops disappeared. The major department stores that at one time drew people from hundreds of miles away were sold off for real estate speculators. Small wonder we didn't expect that trend to continue.Writers/Directors John Carpenter and Nick Castle wrote a pessimistic future for New York. That one day, instead of trying to fix the mess, society would throw up its hands and walk away. We'd burn our bridges behind us, wall off the place and make it a large penal colony. Carpenter and Castle couldn't see that one factor prevented that scenario from ever taking place – Wall Street had too much invested in its infrastructure to write off leaving their investment behind, which was then and is even more today, considerable. Therefore, the premise is not only dated but goofy. Still, the movie delivers on different levels that can be satisfying even without implausibility of its premise.""Escape from New York"" actually takes place in the 1990's and unlike the more plausible but equally pessimistic ""Blade Runner"" the entire island of Manhattan becomes a huge prison. Through some mishap of fate, the president's jet, Air Force One, goes down and the president escapes via a special survivor's pod that ends up inside the futuristic colony (picture New York City even more run down than it was in 1981). Enter the comic book superhero and sexy cross-over anti-hero Snake Plissken, played to sneering perfection by a youthful, slim and muscular Kurt Russell. Once a Disney goody-two-shoes, Russell cast that image aside the moment he strode onto the set with his eye patch slightly askew and a cigarette dangling from under his long blond locks. Sent in after the president with a built-in self-destruct timer, Snake must deliver the president or suffer a terminal end to his assignment. A great supporting cast helps this low-budget sci-fi thriller such as Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, Donald Pleasence, Isaac Hayes, Harry Dean Stanton, and Adrienne Barbeau (at her voluptuous peak).Carpenter never really directed a large budget film until ""Halloween"" which made millions in its first release. After that, he directed several hits, including ""Starman"" and ""The Thing"" both which had respectable box office. As strangely out of date as the film is in regards to predicting the future, it works as a storytelling device in creating a film that has suspense, action, drama, and some wonderful characters worth watching. ""Escape from New York"" eventually achieved cult status in the sci-fi ""con"" world, and if you can forget the opening premise, is entertaining fare for those who love dark comic book anti-heroes like Snake Plissken, more or less a precursor to ""Batman."" Russell so impressed audiences at the time that he could never completely shake the persona he had created. For those of us who became fans of Russell from that point on imagined the tattoo of a snake on his front that ended well, you know where it ended. I always thought Goldie Hawn was the luckiest Hollywood bride during the decade that followed that film, partnered with a man's man, whatever that is. Years later, Russell reprised the same role for the even more fantastic but slightly more humorous ""Escape from LA"" also directed by John Carpenter.If you've never seen ""Escape from New York,"" watch the supporting cast for some surprising levels of excellence. If you haven't seen ""Escape from New York"" in a while, I suggest it's time for a second, third, or fourth look.",Escape from New York
221,manalone923,Good but could've been better; overrated,6,15 October 2003,"Hmm, this one really had potential. Not that I feel it's a bad movie, because it's not. Merely, I've known since my youth that this was regarded as THE quintessential Kurt Russel movie, and was the birth of a character so warmly received that he even was the basis and namesake for one of video game's most popular characters (from ""Metal Gear"" for those not in the know). Right from the getgo, I was interested. I liked the idea of a state-wide penal system, where there is no law except for those with the power to enforce it. That would be The Duke (Isaac Hayes, in an inspired choice), who may have captured the crashed president who has crucial summit information. The cops don't want to get their hands dirty, so they send in Snake Plissken, because he's a former military specialist and simply because he's available. I loved Snake like I thought I would. Players of said game will instantly recognize the influence: A self-preserving, mercenary attitude, rugged good looks, and an unmistakable hush in every word spoken. While Russel is my favorite actor and has tremendous power to his louder tones, he somehow pulls off this character's quietness just as well. It's not a Clint Eastwood ripoff, but I'd say there are shades of good 'ol Dirty Harry in there just the same. After meeting the enigmatic character, who ""doesn't give a f*** about your war OR your president"", we watch as he enters NY in a plane that lands upon the Twin Towers, which is actually difficult to watch in today's times. Snake then works down into the city, and here's where I think the movie slows considerably. For one thing, we meet several characters that have very little development who try to assist and/or hinder Snake, and although I respect that he deals with each of them with the same incompassion, it's not very fun watching people interact with Snake that neither of us really care about. We soon meet the Duke, who is interesting enough but has little to do other than be threatening. The scenes go from the streets to some deserted buildings to a strange, sort of pointless gladiator match, and then the finale which I found to be anticlimactic. Jeez though, I really love Snake and wish he had more to do or say. Instead he's strictly business, which makes for a cool and intriguing character but not one with much to do. I wanted to love the movie as much as I did Snake, but instead I found it to be kind of a slow chase movie populated with people less interesting than the protagonist, and he himself has virtually no character development or background information. The slinky Romero character was a treat to watch, but he wasn't in there as much as some of Snake's cohorts.  And although I won't spoil it for you, I found the ending perplexing because while it stays true to Snake's character, it rendered the whole concept of the film a little pointless. All in all I liked it okay, but not enough to strongly recommend to anyone other than true genre fans or Russel fans like myself.",Escape from New York
222,PadraigWalshFilm,Typical 8o's/Carpenter film,6,29 July 2012,"New York, now separated from the United States, has become a maximum security prison where they keep prisoners and let them form their own civilization within. When the president's jet crashes into Manhattan, a convicted bank robber is sent in to extract the president and his reward is total immunity. Kurt Russell plays the protagonist, Snake Plissken, a macho tough guy who has committed crimes and is presumed dead by the prisoners within New York. Kurt Russell acted well but the character didn't really require any great acting. Earnest Borgnine plays Cabbie, a man who drives a cab around New York, he's very fun to watch and makes the bumpy ride a bit more enjoyable. I didn't quite like the film. It was a typical 8o's/Carpenter film with cheesy dialog and a very unconvincing premise with unrelatable characters. However, these types of films are just meant for enjoyment and a bit of a laugh so if you don't mind those types of films, you'd probably like this. This film is something like modern filmmaker Robert Rodriquez would do. This film isn't supposed to be taken seriously and although I didn't like, doesn't mean I didn't like it ;) . It's just a fun way to pass 100 minutes. And believe me, some things are very over-the-top and bad enough to laugh at.

224,skyminster,"Snake, Snake, Severus Sna oh wait",6,13 October 2016,"You've probably heard of Snake Plissken, right? You know, that guy with the eye-patch. Solid Snake? From Metal Gear Solid? Yeah, basically the same guy. This particular bloke is the protagonist of Escape From New York, one of the classic 80's action films I mentioned in my Turbo Kid review (click it, you know you want to). It's set 16 years in the future, the far-out year of 1997 – weird to think that I wasn't born then – in a USA that saw a 400% increase in crime-rate and so had Manhattan made into effectively a massive prison, where criminals who enter are there for life, in the society that they have built.Snake Plissken happens to be a convicted bank robber, and is sent to the giant prison for life for his crime. However, when the President crash lands in the heart of the island, Snake is sent in (as a former war hero) to bring him back in time for an important TV conference. That's all the story is, really. A simple one, but one that works, if only just because it throws Snake into the perfectly designed ghetto streets of New York. There is a sinister and dark undertone flowing through the ruined streets, as many urban dwellers run around in flashy and cave-man like outfits like a mixture between costumes in Streets of Rage and Golden Axe. These features coupled with flashing street lights and an electronic Mega Drive beat-em-up soundtrack make for a perfectly cheesy and overblown 80's techno aesthetic. There is a constant 8- bit beat throughout the movie, giving it a tempo that really works. I wonder where Streets of Rage got its influence?Nonetheless, the tempo is too slow, because there is a 22 HOUR TIME LIMIT, so of course Snake's gonna take his time! There is too much of him just strolling around, and people sitting around, and people just generally doing things around — slowly. The soundtrack isn't quite used to full effect, either, because the film is often just too quiet for my liking. Gun shots N that don't have the effect they could have, too, because they're so muffled. I guess this might be effected by the time it was made, but still, I'm sure I've heard better sound editing in films of its time.More importantly, Snake Plissken is a douche. I know that's kind of meant to be his thing, but still, and he's definitely a dude, but he could be a little less annoying and growly. He doesn't show off his fighting skills enough, either, which leads into another problem of the film. For a film with such a simple premise, a lot of action would really help the movie drive along. There just isn't enough of it. There are some great moments, and whenever there is a bit of fisticuffs, it's great fun, but it simply doesn't happen enough. It's partly made up for with its cool atmosphere, but Escape From New York can be a little boring.Most of the rest of the cast of characters ain't at all perfect, to boot. 'Brain' is a boring ass smart guy who doesn't seem all that smart. Maggie is just there for the boobs, let's face it. And Cabbie is just annoying and badly acted. The Duke knows what he's doing though. He's the big dawg. Just a shame he has about 10 minutes of screen time to his name. His right-hand man with the crazy hair is a big victim of lack of screen time, because he only gets about 5 minutes, which is a huge shame, because he's one of the only interesting characters in the whole thing.Regardless, the film's whole shtick is pretty cool, and the world creation is on point. Also, the camera-work is pretty good, with some surprisingly ambitious shots.Although Escape From New York has a spot-on and flashy 80's aesthetic and some good moments, it falls fairly flat with paper thin characters (along with some underused characters) and the fact it's just too darn slow and quiet.Mildy disappointing but never a slog – decent(ish) fun.",Escape from New York

There are some legendary actors involved, and perhaps that's where the production design went after mostly being devoured by the characature portayals which conversely leave strong impressions that more easily form a mythology of memory. In mid 2021 the idea of a city as prison actually resonates more sharply than ever before and the trick vaccine takes on even more ominous undertones. It's stranegely the kind of film one can enjoy repeat viewings of, perhaps because it doesn't ask much investment from the viewer.

The plot is so creative the way John Carpenter has took this film. It's about a cocky-looking man named Snake Plisken. He is sent on a mission to save the president after a plane crash. The Manhatten area is a prison area with no escape. Because a huge wall covers around the whole thing.But while Snake looks for the president, he notices a bunch of crazy people walking around and trying to kill Snake. It's an interesting film really. Then he meets up with Brain and Maggie and they help him. But Snake also wants to meet the Duke of New York. (A number one).Snake gets hurt by the Duke and fights against a big man. But then Brain took the president while the Duke hasn't noticed. Until someone seen Brain take him away. So Snake, Harold, and Maggie all try to save the president by waiting by the end of some wall. So then The Duke and Snake have to fight to the death. Until the president kills him.The whole film is really a thriller of a film. It is an interesting film. The streets are trashed, and crazy people walking around. Strange things are going on in this film. But the way John Carpenter has directed this is great.

Also the special effects are pretty lame like the one with the plane, using miniature models for  the crash scenes.

But now with blu Ray I have a great collection of their movies, including the 2 disc collectors edition of Escape From New York form Shout Factory. It's amazing that this movie does not look outdated and has an incredible cast. Kurt Russell was perfect for Snake Plisken. I find it funny that Donald Pleasance is British and plays the U.S. President in this movie, but he was such an incredible actor. Isaac Hayes was excellent as well by playing the bad guy The Duke. I wish this movie would be re-released into the movie theatres so I could see it on the big screen.

233,haydendeepsy,Missed the mark,7,29 March 2021,"Set in a then near future, the film revolves around New York, a once great city, and now a mere prison for the very common criminals of the world. One day, an Air Force One plane carrying the US President on an urgent campaign crashes inside the walls sorrounding the city, an area which no one dares enter, not even the police force. Forced to take evasive action, the police commissioner turns to Snake Plissken, former fighter pilot, who turned rebel and is now to be sent into New York as a prisoner. Snake is given very little time to take action and achieve the goal that will likely free him of all charges. Will he make it? Even though the movie has an intriguing story and a well flushed out protagonist, it doesn't quite reach the heights it's capable of. The causes being a series of rather stiff dialogues and forced acting. Not to mention the lack of character development, which doesn't quite come to benefit in emotional scenes involving the death of sed characters. Nevertheless, it is truly inspiring in the way it shows New York: completely dark, deserted and quiet, a sight no one ever thought possible to witness. As the story goes, the pacing does get a little slow, and considering that which was aforementioned, it tends to affect one's tension. Nevertheless, the conclusion of the film, however not the most original, does hit the spectator, for it is neither rushed, nor overhyped in it's delivery. Flawes aside, definitely worth a watch.",Escape from New York

I saw this in my 20's and it quickly became one of my all time top ten favorites. This is a truly unique film. It is pure popcorn fantasy and not to be taken too seriously, yet it has an undeniable edge. John Carpenter does not try to make the best action film ever here, but he gives us a solid film that copies no others. This movie is Kurt Russell's finest hour. He gives us an immortal character-Snake Plissken. One of the best anti-heroes to grace the screen, Snake is shrewd, tough, independent, and quite simply bad-ass to the nth degree. Two words-eye patch. His mission? To save the President, whose airplane has crashed in Manhattan which is now a Prison. Should I even have to tell you more? With a premise this ridiculous you know that it's got to be good, especially considering John Carpenter's talents. So, suspend all disbelief and just enjoy! Keep an eye out for a great turn by Lee Van Cleef and some character shadings from the always dependable Harry Dean Stanton. Adrienne Barbeau, Ernest Borgnine, Isaac Hayes and Donald Pleasance round out the rest of the cast nicely. This film was made between Halloween and The Thing, which puts it in Carpenter's master canon of films-his Golden period if you will-and his use of music, sets, and mood is excellent here.

235,JeopardyLeyton,Painfully Bad,1,13 June 2021,"I am genuinely confused about the positive ratings for this film. It is SO bad. It is slow, it has a ridiculous plot, many plot holes, bad acting (even the extras who are just there to be part of a crowd scene are bad actors!), no character development, the thinnest of storylines, the action is clumsy and not believable, the characters act in exceedingly stupid ways that just completely ruin suspension of disbelief, the set looks so bad it totally breaks immersion. There is no point to it. The music is so atrocious that at one point I literally thought an alarm clock was going off somewhere in my living room. If your seven year old child made this movie, yeah you'd maybe suffer through it but say 'oh wow well done!' at the end. But that's not saying muchI'm guessing this must be a 'cult classic' or something that's gained some sort of weird popularity due to its silliness, and that's why people like it?

238,estebangimpe,An atmosphere that can't be matched,9,9 February 2010,"In a dark time of cinema history where it seemed that the industry was transcending into a more colorful and happy era rose film legend John Carpenter to re-invent the concept of atmosphere in a movie. Fresh from making his film debut with the humble Assault from Precinct 13 and having raised himself to fame with Halloween, Carpenter continued his streak of genius (which only truly stopped in the mid 90's) by releasing the science fiction masterpiece, Escape from New York.Now don't get me wrong, 1981 was a great year for any film lover. Raiders of the Lost Ark, Tootsie and Gandhi can be considered as some of the best films in each of their genre. However, a certain void in the genre of science fiction was visible. With Blade Runner two years away and the Terminator being just a grain of sand in James Cameron's mind, the science fiction genre lacked the definitive film for that year. A film which alone could stand as a proud representative of a subject that can be explore to infinity.General conception would say that the obvious film that filled the void was Mad Max 2? Yeahthat doesn't sound right to me either. You see what I'm trying to explain? Escape from New York hit the perfect release year since it had no real blockbuster threats preventing it from attracting a main stream audience and consequently became one of the cult classics of the genre.But enough about history! Let's get down to the story: in 1988 the crime rates in New York City had raised by 400%. This forces the government to turn Manhattan into a prison by building giant walls around the island and keeping the open waters under heavy surveillance by guards. There's only one rule that must be respected when entering the Manhattan prison: once you get in, you can never get out. Soon after the prologue, we cut the year 1997. Enter Snake Plissken, a buff commando like Kurt Russell with an eye patch and not a care for the world. Snake has been sentenced to time in Manhattan for the crime of credit card robbery (I know this sounds ridiculous but in the 80's it made total sense). Fortunately, Snake is called upon by the bad..ehI mean Lee Van Cleef, the chief of the prison because the presidents plane has crashed in New York and the president (still alive of course) has been captured. If Snake manages to rescue him, his crime is pardoned.Escape from New York is one of the better examples of a ""show, don't tell"" movie. The possibilities that the setting of a Manhattan running wild helped Carpenter to write his script using nothing but his own creativity. Although no light sabers are visible in the movie, E.f.N establishes itself as a futuristic movie through the classic use of Orwell's Utopic society. The film does a brilliant job of showing how little differences there are between the power hungry Duke of New York who wants to not only be the ruler of the city but wants the prison to up rise and crush the enemy and the President of the United States, who wants to maintain peace and order at a time of conflict through the use of force and threat.The dialog is short and snappy; leaving a lot of silences for the audience to contemplate the big dark chaos that is New York. The film is not at all ambiguous and as a consequence, manages to convey a great tech-noir style which still up to this day is not only affective but also very cool.This review could go on forever but to make things short, Escape from New York is a film which achieves at everything it goes for and at the same time, remains to be one of the most entertaining and deepest movies of the science fiction genre, constructing as one re-watches the film, a more detailed brain image of its main theme: New York as a prison.9 stars out of 10Bloody Brilliant",Escape from New York
239,popnruss,Well worth another look!,9,9 May 2017,"I had not seen this film in several years but decided it was worth another look. Of course it is now outdated in so many instances but it is interesting to see how the writers perceived what New York City would be like in 1997 from the perspective of 1981. A whole lot of imagination went into that script. But then again, we are talking about the very creative and talented John Carpenter. It was sad to see that the Twin Towers were still standing. No one in 1981 would have ever thought that they would be the site of an American tragedy twenty years later. Kurt Russell was excellent as Snake Plisken, Harry Dean Stanton, Adrienne Barbeau equally good as the Brain and Maggie. I always enjoy seeing Ernest Borgnine and he didn't disappoint as Cabbie. I have always said that Manhattan can be a zoo, but a maximum security prison? Very creative, Mr. Carpenter, I also enjoyed the soundtrack!",Escape from New York
240,grolt,"""Call me Snake...""",8,13 January 2003,"""Escape From New York"" is a solid action noir by John Carpenter, although it lacks the punch of Carpenter's other three previous features (""The Fog"", ""Halloween"", ""Assault on Precinct 13"").  Kurt Russell became famous for his Snake Plissken, and rightfully so, although the character seems to be only a more gritty version of Napoeleon Wilson in ""Assault"".  What makes this film the cult classic it is is Carpenter's very apocalyptic and brash story. This is a very dark film, and it holds up especially well today when shown against the countless fluff films that Hollywood seems to be churning out.Carpenter made the most out of his meeger budget and created a very convincing New York City.  Not only is the set design fantastic, but so are the typically strong performances.  Russell, Hayes, Barbeau, Pleasence, Stanton, Atkins, Cyphers and Borgnine are all cult legends, and seeing them all work together makes Robert Altman's casts look feeble in comparison.What limits this film from greatness is surprisingly lax direction by Carpenter.  The film is not as tight as it should have been, and really fails to generate any sort of suspense during the action.  Deaths just happen out of nowhere, with little to no build up, which is a shame.  This movie could have really been amazing.  The ending is perfect though, and easily makes up for the film's faults.  See it for Kurt Russell and the great ending and you will come away a happy viewer.  Watch ""Escape From LA"" though to see what this movie should have been.",Escape from New York
241,shagya49,Just Call me Plissken,6,13 June 2007,"I've watched this flick a few times. It appeals in a vague way to the feeling that many people, particularly in North America, have about politicians. The American president is portrayed as a sniveling little twerp and Plisskin is every teenagers' dream of a ""tough but true"" anti-hero. The head crook in the Manhattan prison island strikes me as not a great deal different from the thugs on the outside and perhaps that is the point. Some of the characters like Cabby are sympathetic although I wonder what he must have done to be condemned to this place. Borgnine played a similar role as the simpleton in the original ""Flight of the Phoenix"". Others in the cast are of no great consequence unless you're ""into"" the kind of ""realism"" ie. juvenile bloodletting, that fueled most ""B"" pictures since the mid seventies. Russell shows a little bit of development in the last scene when he rejects the moniker of ""Snake"". And I really liked the tape swapping part at the end.

First of all since the movie plot happens in the future (i.e., 1997) as per the story the Art work is fantastic and the details are mind blowing . The technical expertise which have been utilized in the movie is something which is not even present in the movies with handled the same plot in the succeeding years.Kurt Russel acting is decent and his looks is awesome in the movie. Surely he has given life to the character which needs tough attitude. Since the background score has been handled by John Carpenter himself i felt the feel of HALLOWEEN at times which is unavoidable.:) The Screenplay could have been much more racier as per the requirement of the plot.

247,friedem0n2004,Escape From the Ordinary,5,1 August 2007,"I had heard about this film for what seems to be forever. Having caught the end of Escape from L.A. on TV one day, I felt that maybe it was right for me to see Escpae from New York. Well time went by and I still hadn't picked up a copy of this film. After finding out that this was in the Wal-Mart five dollar bin, I quickly decided that I should purchase it. I was excited to see what all the fuss was about or is about. Because the film still has a cult following, and after watching it I can see why. I happen to admire John Carpenter's work to a degree. I don't necessarily think that he is a good director but a decent one at best. He has a tendency to miss all the details. But when your working in the science fiction/horror genre, why bother with the details. This clearly shows throughout his body of work, with the most promising film being The Thing. That film grabbed me, and forced me on the edge of my seat. Unfortunately this film did not. Instead what it did do was give me an inside into what this film is about and why it is so popular. I think people like it because of what it says about authority in general. That a rebel, being Snake Plisken, will save the world by rescuing the president, in a apocalyptic New York City. The world in which John Carpenter has created did have me begging for a longer running time, but hey you get what you get. At first I thought this film was going to be a great film but then I clearly saw it for what it is, a good B film and nothing more. Fun, entertaining, and stupid. (But in a good way). The look of the film seemed to bother me the most, it has that bad 80's flat look to it. Where every metallic object in the world shines light off of its reflective surface. The dark landscape was lackluster in design, but the characters that occupied it were interesting. Thats what I really mean by I wanted to know more about the world in which Snake Plisken does his deeds in. The story was pretty straight forward, nothing to complex, and nothing to simple. Like I said before a solid B film and nothing more. Yes, I may be a little hard on the film by giving it five stars out of ten but hey a B movie doesn't go above seven in my book. Believe me I give most movies a low rating, below the average. Occasionally a few notches above if it is well done, but hey its when audience don't recognize them. Which seems like most of the time, (The Thin Red Line, in particular). This movie drifts somewhere between the fine line of good versus evil, and this time evil versus pure evil. Which makes for an interesting twist. But honestly we have seen all of this before, from time and memorial.",Escape from New York
248,aarondevoll,John Carpenter's Masterpiece,9,15 January 2018,"John Carpenter's film stars Kurt Russell as Snake Plissken, a rugged, one eyed man who is jettisoned into a thuggish New York City that's been taken over by a crime lord named the Duke (Issac Hayes) to rescue a president (Donald Pleasence) taken hostage. To say anymore would spoil the fun but certainly it is quite memorable.The film uses the tropes of many classic westerns. Carpenter (himself a huge fan of westerns) turns a futuristic New York into a land brimming with grimy, sleazy men. The legendary Snake Plissken resembles the man with no name (who was based on Kurosawa's Yojimbo). Speaking one sentence at a time, Russell plays him with so much macho elegance, it's hard not to be absorbed when he's on screen.Escape from New York is similar in ways to The Warriors, another cult classic, released two years earlier but it's the casting in Carpenters film (Hayes, Stanton, Van Cleef) that give it a certain edge despite its minimal plot. Carpenter would direct a sequel 15 years later with Escape from L.A. which is mostly dumb and worth watching only for a couple cool sequences with Russell.9/10. Escape from New York5/10.

Between Cabbie (Ernest Borgnine), Harold ""Brain"" Helman (Harry Dean Stanton), The Duke of New York (Issac Hayes), and every other madman in the city, you should be laughing like mad at the movie.The movie isn't perfect; there are a number of confusing and/or silly things.

251,solidchuck19,You're the Duke of New York!... A number one!,8,29 March 2007,"This will one day be a classic film, that came at maybe the height of John Carpenter's career, just before The Thing and Starman. The premise is one of the most original and exciting ideas ever, even if it is a little unrealistic and almost comic book-like. SPOILERS New York in the future, at least back then, is a maximum security prison. It has a wall all the way around Manhattan, helicopter patrols, armed guard towers, and land-mined roadways. Air Force One is hijacked and crashes in the city... the President is captured. Enter Snake Plissken (Kurt Russel). One of the original anti-heroes, and maybe the best. He cares about no one other than himself, and he is forced into going into New York to save the President, in exchange for his own life. END OF SPOILERSAlong the way, Snake meets many interesting characters, all played well in a very solid supporting cast, including Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, Donald Pleasance, Adrienne Barbeau, and Harry Dean Stanton. The actions scenes are well shot for a low budget. New York as a semi-dystopian society is convincing, and the music - especially the opening theme - is great. The film is also well-paced, with many memorable one liners and fight sequences. Kurt Russel and John Carpenter together created one of the great fictional characters of all time, placed in an engaging and highly entertaining situation. The character of Snake Plissken also inspired the characters Solid Snake and Big Boss for the series of games, Metal Gear. The film is at least very good on its own, but it deserves even further appreciation just for that. ""Call me Snake.""",Escape from New York
252,jac-44480,"A Relic of its Time, a Borderline Classic",8,28 January 2017,"A highly entertaining sci-fi action thriller, though a bit dated. It is a Classic in the weakest sense of the term. You cannot put it in the same category as all-time classics like the Terminator, Rambo, or Alien franchises, but it is not far behind. I would put EFNY on the very cusp of being a classic.There are 3 things that make this film great. First, the star of the film is Kurt Russell as the iconic anti-hero ""Snake Plissken"". Russell really nails the part down as good as any iconic action figure in movie history. He delivers plenty of classic one-liners that moviegoers will quote forever. Second, the musical score by John Carpenter is fantastic. Taking a page from 1978's ""Halloween"", Carpenter really sets the mood of an apocalyptic NYC overrun by violent criminals. Third, the dark visual city-scape of New York created by Carpenter with abandoned buildings, dumpster fires, and maniacs roaming the streets is very well done.Now this movie is very dated looking, and does not age well. EFNY debuted in 1981, but was made in the late 1970's, and it shows. The special effects are a joke by today's standards. Watching those 70's computers with red and green signals flashing, you feel like you are in a museum. The explosions that take place in the film are laughably fake. Almost like someone lit a firecracker off and a little smoke comes out. Another trademark of this late 70's-early 80's period, is we see a prominence of big American land yacht vehicles such as Cadillac Deville's and Ford LTD's. Somehow, the dated look and primitive special effects actually lend the movie a favor. It wouldn't be the same if we had modern CGI and high def graphics.The secondary characters are mostly forgettable. Donald Pleasance as President is convincing, but is given too little screen time. Isaac Hayes as ""The Duke of New York"" makes for an interesting foe at first glance, but is given no memorable dialogue. The rest of the cast are used as cannon fodder. This is fine, however, because all we care about is Snake Plissken and his mission. Everyone else is expendable.What holds this movie back is they could have done so much more. By the movie's end you feel like the writers barely scratched the surface on the movie's potential. What could have been. They could have developed the secondary characters more. They could have done a more thorough story on Snake Plissken's background. Instead, the movie rushes to the action and ends rather abruptly. Still, despite its flaws, this is a great sci-fi action flick to watch on a night at home.",Escape from New York
253,Pritchie45,Wanted to like it,6,5 October 2020,"This movie always comes up when you look up great Kurt Russel movies or action movies in general and to its credit it did launch Russel to statdom. This movie though isn't good but not bad either. It is a nice watch with a great premise and design that carries it even though the story and characters drag it down.The movie is set in the future where New York is transformes into a prison and criminals are just left there. It reminds me of Arkham City and Dredd and so I started the movie with enjoyment.The protagonist Snake Plissken wears an eye patch and the performance is based on Clint Eastwood. Remove Snake and this movie would be long forgotten. All the other characters are forgettable because they don't have any traits and substance.When Snake goes inside the prison the movie goes downhill. Snake is taken from point A to point B continuously by other characters. The prison is filled by mindless freaks running around who Snake has to avoid. Then we get to proper human beings who have captured the president and have an interesting plan and motovation. Its the exact opposite with everyone Snake encounters. The cabbie is annoying and fortunantly gets the tape the Snake needed to save his life. And the other guy who betrayed Snake before decides to trust Snake and along with his girl join Snake in rescuing the president and escaping.I see people say that this is a great B grade movie and made on a low budget to justify why this is a great movie. A cult classic which this is, is by definition a gernerally mediocre movie with a niche fanbase. I was hoping I was apart of this fanbase because of the iconic Snake character but I'm not.If you like this film then congrats, I was bored after 20 minutes.",Escape from New York

First off, the entire premise is ridiculous.  For instance, why would the ""United States Police Force"" transform an island with some of the highest real estate in the country (Manhattan) into a prison?  And, unfortunately, not much develops in the way of the action of the movie.  I was at least expecting some interesting ""underworld"" groups to be exposed in the ""prison New York,"" but instead, it's basically a bunch of shots of old buildings with a few prisoners running around in tattered clothing.  In fact, you only see about 50 prisoners at any time, which is a ridiculously low number to warrant the transformation of an entire city into a prison.

259,hiekkaroopi,Finland calling,7,31 March 2005,"Escape From New York has always been one of my favorites. I would class it as a B movie, but a good one. Kurt Russel is a young handsome anti hero, who doesn't care about anyone or anything. He has that youthful rebellion and mystery about him needed for his role. He is a criminal caught making a bank robbery and perhaps has a hardened soul, but Carpenter has still managed make him a likable rogue. Snake is forced to be a hero. The only thing that makes him take the job offered to him is because he is forced to save his own life in the process. The dark landscape and the nightmarish atmosphere adds to the suspense. I was quite young when this movie first came out and it did get my blood pumping then. Many years later (and many scary movies later) the affect has somewhat lessened, but the movie structurally is still as good as it ever was. It has stood the time where many movies haven't. I bought the DVD just last week and was disappointed. The original 99 minutes was reduced to 94 minutes, which means that a lot of the gritty stuff was removed by the Swedish\Finnsih film board.

A perfect marriage of character, actor, and writer/director of the first order. An Extremely dark '80s sci-fi classic. Coming out the same year as Mad Max 2 and one before Blade Runner, it avoids the incredibly common trap of simply copying one or the other of those movies. Its urban squalor looks impressively like 1981 extrapolated forward with technology used to compensate for that squalor rather than ironically counterpointing it, and if only because it came out so early in the '80s post-apocalypse cycle, Escape from New York manages to be one of the most unique of all the entries in that frequently derivative genre. Having maybe the best protagonist in all of the genre's history simply seals the deal that, imperfect as it can be, this is still something special.Starring: Kurt Russell, Donald Pleasence, Lee Van Cleef, Isaac Hayes, Adrienne Barbeau, Ernest Borgnine and Harry Dean Stanton",Escape from New York

Bleak, cynical & deadpan, EFNY is still refreshing, even today, compared to all these cheesy, ultra slick action movies made today. Who says all action films have to be like Die Hard or Armageddon? You don't have to fill every minute of a film with explosions, noise & action. And unfortunately, today's action films are completely overdone, marred with goofiness, dumb dialogue (yipee-kay-yay, motherf*cker? ugh. dumb,dumb,dumb....) & god awful soundtracks. Sometimes less is more. EFNY, with its exaggerated prolonged silences & odd gestures, feels more like Sergio Leone meets film noir, grade B style. An action film can still be an action film & have other qualities & nuances.Sure, the budget was limited,  but Carpenter manages to create an eerie & atmospheric vision of New York. And extremely nasty, as it would be if New York was a prison. There's a very real sense of dread & urgency about the film, even in its own , quiet way. Not from the cookie cutter school of action films, EFNY occupies its own special niche . Cartoony, you say? And the Matrix isn't? Remember, the word here is ESCAPIST. This is fantasy film-making.

He—and it's always a he—is a solitary man, rather gruff, with a mordant sense of humor. He knows how to use a gun. His moral sense is skewed, but in his heart, he's willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good. He's often the answer when the government just ain't up to snuff. Roland of Gilead, Rooster Cogburn, and the Man with No Name have brought the American anti-hero to life. Escape from New York's Snake Plissken, played with growling panache by Kurt Russell, is a memorable variation on this theme.Snake Plissken wears a black eye-patch and tight-fitting clothes. His long unwashed hair and grizzled face bespeak a his nonchalance about the world. He does crime, and because of that, he's being sent to New York, a city that now serves as America's maximum security prison. But his country first needs him for a mission that only a man of his caliber can perform. He needs to save the President of the United States, who has ironically been trapped in the imprisoned city of his own making.Escape from New York is arguably a bad movie. The plot is improbable. The sets are so dark that you strain to see the action. And the action scenes are paltry, involving a few punches and bursts of gunfire. Nevertheless, Escape from New York creates a world and characters that are deeply memorable. This is a New York permeated by darkness and crime. In this world, crazed prisoners crawl out of sewers at night and men perform bawdy musicals in dilapidated theaters. A loose hierarchy of criminals, crowned by a villainous Duke, triumphs over the city's population.Snake Plissken enters this world and fulfills his mission, albeit for his own selfish and cynical reasons. Ultimately, though, he does what is right because the President just ain't a good man. That's an American anti-hero.",Escape from New York

While the story might seem like it's been done before it, like Pulp Fiction, is presented to us in a new and original way.The basic story is that in the year 1997 a disgraced war hero, Snake Plissken, is sent to New York City which is now a maximum security prison for the criminals of the country where they are forced to survive for themselves. Terrorists hijack the President's plane and crash land it into the heart of New York. The President makes it in an escape pod but is now a prisoner of ""the duke of New York"". Snake is given the option to go in and get the President and be pardoned or serve his sentence. He goes for the first and of course complications arise and he's not told about the fine print of the deal. Still the action scenes are great and there are some real great memorable performances in here.Kurt Russell is great as a futuristic ""man with no name"" (Clint Eastwood in the Dollar's trilogy) and John Carpenter has co-written and directed yet another masterpiece with this film. Recommended for anybody looking for a good action movie, a cult film, or just some good entertainment of Russell doing an Eastwood imitation.",Escape from New York

268,aj0899,Not Much Great About It,4,9 March 2017,"I've been on a kick of watching movies from around this time period. Escape From New York is one I had never seen, but had heard a lot about. I was disappointed. It is a very low budget movie, with almost no plot. The action scenes, which would be the only selling point, are mostly bland and lack any kind of excitement or impact. The premise is kind of interesting, but with the hindsight of history, being set in 1997 with late 70s technology makes it tough to buy in. Other movies from the same time period did a much better job in the same territory (The Terminator had a small budget, but is a much better movie). Looking for positives, it has some good actors who do their best with the minimal script. Russell, Van Cleef, Borgnine and Pleasance all do their job well with what they're given. Which isn't much. Adrienne Barbeau provides ever-present cleavage to distract from the lack of plot. The music is good considering Carpenter did it himself, but it's not anything great.Overall, I can't say it was worth the time. I probably won't watch it again.",Escape from New York
269,sammyfatkitty,Escape From New York Review,5,15 August 2011,"Escape From New York is a movie with a solid premise, that's unfortunately almost entirely lost because of the bad acting, terrible script, and special effects that really haven't withstood the test of time. Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell), is an ex-army bank robber who's sent to New York City, which has been turned into a maximum security prison because of the startling rise in crime within the US. Once the President is captured within the walls of the facility, it is up to Snake to rescue him and return him to safety. As I said, the set-up is solid and intriguing. Unfortunately, I still have several problems with this movie. One major issue is that the acting doesn't nearly hold up to the potential of the premise. The actors don't convey true feelings of terror, even though they are faced with a dire situation. A major part of this problem is due to the god-awful script, which essentially consists of ""witty"" one-liners, cheesy emotion, and the attitude problem of a snarly teenager. I wasn't invested in the story because of this, nor did I have feelings for the characters, and didn't even care when anything happened to them . So the acting and script are unbearable. Another thing that really brings down the caliber of this movie is the special effects. Now I understand that this was a ""Summer Blockbuster"" in its time, and during the early 80's the amount of special effects in this movie must have been amazing. Even so, watching this movie about 30 years later is practically excruciating. The planes during the flight sequences are rarely shown, and when they are they truly look ridiculous. All of the explosions look just plain dumb in the dark and grainy way the film is shot, and don't bring any ""wow moments"" to the table. While I don't have much good to say about the film, I can say that John Carpenter's direction is as good as ever, and he really creates a spooky mood to go along with the sci-fi premise. He can also direct a good action sequence, and all the fighting that's done without the terrible special effects is good enough. Overall, this is a merely passable action ""classic"", that ultimately fails due to the terrible script and performances, as well as FX that are laughable in this day and age. I honestly can't recommend it in the least, unless you're into low-quality special effects and stupid dialog, or you're just a child of the 80's looking for a good old sense of nostalgia.",Escape from New York

I will however explain just why this movie is so darned enjoyable.The shining star of this film is Kurt Russel as Snake Plissken. He's the employment of an anti-hero if there ever was one. He's an unwilling man on a mission with a lot of attitude. He's not afraid to play dirty in order to survive yet he's still got a sideways ere of morality about him. Kurt plays this role perfectly and really make's this film worth watching.Isaac Hayes is enjoyable as the Duke of New York, and Donald Pleasance does a great job as the President. They serve their parts in the film pretty well.If you're into the negative utopia genre at all I highly recommend you watch this film. Same goes for those that enjoy a good anti-hero.The atmosphere in this movie is pretty corny by today's standards but there's still just something cool about it. I'd hate to live in the U.S in the film but man does it make a cool film.In short; this movie is definitely worth watching if you can get past how corny it is.",Escape from New York

The presidents plane crashes right into the heart of this massive jail.

There are other sci-fi cult films from this period that translate well to modern day (ie, Road Warrior, also from 81'), this one does not IMO. Carpenter had a solid premise, but it gets lost with a insufficient budget, and bad acting. I cant understand why Snake became such a iconic character off this movie alone.

Carpenter as always wrote a solid script, this time with help from his old film school buddy Nick Castle, who also was the original horror icon Michael Myers in John Carpenter's Halloween.This film stars a great all-star John Carpenter cast of Kurt Russell, Donald Pleasence, Lee Van Cleef, Harry Dean Stanton, Charles Cyphers and Carpenter's Ex-Wife Adrienne Barbeau.Great plot with great character makes this one of John Carpenter's best films, it is a shame they had to cut out the start of the movie when it was put in theaters in 1981, where Snake Plissken and his partner do the robbery and later, Snake's partner gets killed, and Snake gets caught by the United States Police Force.Also a great score by Carpenter and Alan Howarth, this film is not to be missed by any fan of John Carpenter, sci-fi, horror or film in general.",Escape from New York

If you first saw Escape from LA and now want to see this movie, you're going to be pleasantly surprised: It's better than the LA-remake.WAY WAY better. I consider the remake an insult to this movie. This movie truly brings dark, gloomy, atmospheric settings, a furiously suspenseful soundtrack, decent acting and a simple though fast-paced script together into a work of art. One of John Carpenters very best. This movie, like so many of the 80's action movies, has nothing of the yukkie commercial, sentimental and politically correct crap that so many of the 90's action movies are polluted by. If you're in for some hardcore, fast paced no holds barred action you will NEVER regret seeing this movie. And it isn't even remotely gory or unnecessarily bloody. It's just pure, well made, unsentimental action. If you like this movie (and you're going to) you should definitely see 'The Thing', which I think is even better than this one, and that's hard. This one is one of my top 10 80's Action Movies (Aliens/Terminator/The Thing/Blade Runner etc), and it should be on yours. If you want to see Kurt Russel perform well in a more recent action movie, go and rent 'Soldier' instead of the remake of this movie.This movie truly is an absolute cult classic and a very, VERY good action movie.

286,dgoodh,Career defining for both John Carpenter and Kurt Russell,9,17 December 2003,"Reading through some of the other IMDB comments here makes me wonder if some of the folks here have any sense of putting something in perspective.  John Carpenter's Escape From New York is very much a product of it's time, that when compared to other big budget movies of today, it just won't hold up (at least for the younger viewer who's really not willing to give a low budget movie a chance).  Having a sense of perspective with this film can certainly open you up to it. I was fortunate, I got to see Escape From New York when it first premiered in theatres back in 1981.  John Carpenter was building his reputation, and when Escape was announced, it certainly seemed like a novel concept and more original than anyone really gives it credit for- this sort of thing just wasn't done in 1981, and now so many things that were introduced in this movie seem more par for the course. It's a clever concept: a rising criminal population gives birth to a United States Police Force and the idea of turning the entire island of Manhattan into the largest maximum security prison in the world.  Air Force One, on it's way to an important world peace summit, has been hijacked by terrorists with the intent of crashing the plane in Manhattan and taking the President's life.  The President survives, and the United States Police Force comes up with a plan to save his life involving one very special prisoner newly transferred to Manhattan, former Special Force operative-turned-criminal S. D. ""Snake"" Plissken.Bringing proper perspective to this, one can see that John Carpenter was very much ahead of his time.  Today, many of the trappings of this movie are pretty standard, but when it was first released, there were things here that just weren't done.  One thing I really admire is just how creative a filmmaker with a very low budget can be, and John Carpenter is one of the very best with a low budget.  Sticking with a low budget, let's Carpenter come in with a pretty uncompromised vision- and it certainly comes through- action, suspense  and comic book sensitivities are all over here, and had Carpenter been working from a larger budget under greater restrictions, you just might not have the film that you have now (and moreso, other movies as they are now- this really is an influence on a lot of other filmmakers).There's a whole lot of visual style here, and again that's pretty amazing when you take into account Carpenter's limited budget.  It is a little eerie to watch it again and see the World Trade Center in such a prominent role in the film- the eerieness continues when the Air Force One is crashed into a building by terrorists.  I love the fact that Carpenter composes and performs most all of the music for his movies (I think his score for Halloween remains one of the best horror movie scores ever made), they drive them right and they're neat ""signatures"" in the end.  His score for Escape From New York is a little more varied than some of his other film music, and still just as effective.It's a great cast, with a career-making performance from Kurt Russell as Snake Plissken.  Again, putting this in the proper perspective, this was a big chance in Russell's career at the time- he was still better known for his work in Disney films, and was just starting to break that mold.  Escape From New York cracked that mold entirely and I think Russell himself would be one of the first to say that it shaped his career.  Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, Harry Dean Stanton and Carpenter-regulars like Charles Cyphers, Tom Atkins, and Frank Doubleday are all solid here- very definite character types, pretty two-dimensional, but that doesn't matter, they drive the story.  One can really see that Isaac Hayes was definitely in to his part as the Duke of New York, Donald Pleasance genuinely invested something in his performance as the President of the United States.  And it was very nice to see both Carpenter's and Russell's wives, Adrienne Barbeau and Season Hubley in this film.  Hubley's scene is brief, but very well done.  Barbeau is in this significantly more, and she was simply the stuff of dreams then (not taking anything away from her now either), and it's a very confident performance (I just love watching her face down the Duke's car at the very end). I just bought the new Special Edition DVD and it's a lovely package.  Although I haven't been able to go through all of the contents yet, one of the must-see (or in this case must-hear) features is the commentary track from John Carpenter and Kurt Russell.  I understand that this is from the original laserdisc, so while there's a certain amount of perspective in their commentary, it's not the same as it would be today (especially after the events of 9-11).  It's a very enjoyable commentary from two guys who had great memories of this film and who obviously love to work together.  Carpenter is quite specific and very telling in all aspects of the film (some of those 3D computer graphics aren't 3D computer graphics- the flythrough of New York?  Black boxes with green lines painted on them... and yet it still looks cool)-  as much as I admired his skills before, after listening to the commentary, I admire them even more. Escape From New York is a wonderful piece of work.  It's an important film in the career of a visionary filmmaker and an important film for one of today's better known leading men.  Those of us who are older and experienced this way back when, will certainly appreciate it's craft, now more than ever.  For younger viewers though, you definitely need a sense of perspective with this- trying to hold it too the same standards as you would a movie made today is hardly fair, and you're just doing yourself a disservice by not opening yourself a little further.  Escape From New York is highly, highly recommended and a proud addition to my DVD library.",Escape from New York
287,pepeksz,Solid Movie that definitely holds up.,7,4 March 2021,"Needless to say that with the amount of content out there today, it is hard to find one that actually sticks with you and consumes your thoughts. However, Carpenter's work here certainly does just that. Knowing Carpenter mostly from his pioneering within the Horror genre I thought I knew what I was signing up for when choosing my Wednesday night movie, however I was not prepared at all. It quickly turned out that this was not just a Wednesday night movie, but the highlight of the week.Genres meet in this Action-Sci-Fi-Horror, and the score by Carpenter seals the deal. Although still a bit slower in terms of today's standards, the pacing is what makes this movie keep you by the edge of your seat. This together with the small crumbs of information we get about the setting of the world and the characters makes you invested from the minute Jamie Lee Curtis speaks out those initial words. I struggle to think of Russel playing a role that fit him so well, with his face and demeanor personifying the mystique of the movie. No I do not know what fully happened with the world to create a Maximum Security prison of Manhattan. No I do not know why everyone thinks Snake is dead and are surprised to see him alive. How do they even know about him? But the thing was, that I knew just enough about him to not even care and just see what happens.

The movie was weird and I didn't get much of what was going on and who the hell these guys where. So I watched it again later and payed close attention and listened to everything, And it now ends up to be in my top 10 movies! New york, crime escalates 400 percent in the ""future"" of 1988 (lol). New york is turned into a giant prison where 3 million criminals live. The barriers around stop the people inside from coming out and has maximum security 24/7. When you go in you can't get out. The prisoners live in the world that they have created for themselves. This movie is then set in the ""future"" of 1997 where new york is still a maximum security prison. But air force one (the presidents plane) is flying over new york it is hijacked by a crazy cult member and is crashed into a building there. The president gets out into the escape pod just before it crashes carrying an important tape with him. A war hero and now a criminal Snake Plissken is sent in to recover the president and get him out of the now very dangerous new york city. He has no choice because he is implanted with tiny bombs that will blow his arteries up in 22 hours unless he gets back in time with the president and tape, when he gets back they will cure him. So he is on a race against time to escape from new york and recover the lost goods.The thing that makes this film good is because it was made with only 5 million dollars and has an excellent dark atmosphere and plot that complicates through the movie.

297,pirtyboy,Great cult movie,9,14 April 2002,You should not take this movie serious. The time has run away from this movie indeed but forget that when you see this. All I can say is that this is John Carpenter's best movie. And Kurt Russel coolest role. I think that Kurt has done only two cool guys in all of his movies. As Snake Plissken in Escape from New York and as MacReady in The Thing. And the music keeps haunting me forever. It's so great! I love it! I can't express myself how good the music is. Overall: If you haven't seen this so what are you waiting for? Go see it! And buy the soundtrack too!,Escape from New York
298,lauriesss,As good today as it was when it came out,9,27 January 2008,I am pushing 50 years old and this movie holds today as well as it did back in 1981. The story of people being oppressed by a police state and martial law is as old as time but Carpenter took it to a new place with great images and a haunting score.There is one thing everyone talks about and that is the cassette tape. I agree that some explanation about it being so important would have been a great idea but I overlooked it because the rest of the film was so well done.Another thing that is interesting about the movie even though no one could have known back then is the use of the World Trade Center. It gives me chills to watch that part now as if I am watching something unfold in a parallel universe.,Escape from New York
299,csausville,A Cult Classic!!!,9,13 February 2010,"Snake Plissken rocks!!! One of John Carpenter's best films. A visually stimulating film with a fantastic supporting cast. Kurt Russell rocks as Snake. One of his best roles. Far superior than the sequel, Escape from LA. Very good special effects for that time period. Brain, the Duke of New York, Cabbie are all memorable characters. Lee Van Cleef was also excellent. What also really worked with this film is the soundtrack. Very cool music to go along with the action. This film was great from beginning to end. The deleted bank robbery scene is also really good. A must see for all sci-fi fans!!! Long live Snake Plissken!!",Escape from New York
300,andre9000,"Indeed, Awesome.",10,13 November 2003,"Escape from new york. This is one of the essential movies of all time. I remember seeing this film for the first time in 1983 and it was a lasting impression. This is what it would be like if NY was a prison colony. A perfect anti-hero movie, and a staple for sci-fi films most certainly. Kurt Russel the perfect choice as snake plisken. Not the 'feel good' movie of the century...Warning: This is a movie may not be suitable for people who like to watch horses running on beaches and marvel at the sparkling water splashes in slo-mo.Thankyou Mr. Carpenter.",Escape from New York
301,jonbreaks,"B movie, B grade",8,7 February 2004,"Last night I watched Escape From New York. John Carpenter seems to be hit (The Thing) and miss (Ghosts of Mars) in the most extreme sense of the word. This is one of his hits.First off this is not a movie that will change you in any way, or challenge your political beliefs, yadda yadda, but it is an extremely well done action movie. Kurt Russell is the baddass to end all baddasses as Snake Plisskin. The fact that Carpenter was able to come up with such a bizarre idea and actually pull it off seems to be a testimant to his dedication. For those of you unfamiliar with the story, New York is turned into a maximum security prison for the hell of it. No guards on the inside, just prisoners living out their lives. Once you go in, you don't come out. Sadly Air Force One crashes into a building and the president is lost somewhere in a city of theives, rapists and murderers. That's where Snake comes in. Decorated war hero gone wrong, he is sent in to retrieve the president within 24 hours. What's interesting is the pseudo counter-cultureness of Snake. He doesn't give a s**t about much of anything,  saying things like ""I don't care about your war,"" in that totally bad ass voice. Carpenter also didn't have a huge budget, which means we spend more time with the charactors and less with the special effects which is almost always good. For an action movie there is a lot of subtleness, another plus. Overall it's not a perfect movie, there's tons of little stupid things that for some reason bother me, but hey, its a b movie when you break it down. and for a b movie, it does a damn good job. It doesn't pretend to be something its not, its a big dumb action movie. Except it's not that dumb, because if you really take a good look at each individual you will find that there is more than meets the eye. Eh, enough blabbing, I'm hungry. If anyone has any comments feel free to email me.",Escape from New York
302,briangetmail,low budget but exciting,8,15 June 2006,"This is a low budget movie but it's still very good. Kurt Russel goes a little overboard trying to be the tough guy, but don't be fooled he is an excellent actor. The best part is the ending, Snake may not be a very educated person but he's not stupid and he does the right thing at the end. The look and feel of this film is quite real since they filmed in a real city that had been destroyed by a fire. Lee Van Cleef is the perfect choice to play the man in charge of the Police Force. The film that followed this one, Escape from LA, was a disappointment to me. It cost a lot more to make and had some special effects that were OK it but was not as realistic.",Escape from New York
303,FriscoJoe,Worst Piece of CRAP I've seen in years,1,27 August 2013,"Really? A wall around Manhattan island? No police force and no fire department yet the place hasn't burned down? The whole premise is just plain STUPID. They land a glider on the roof of one of the World Trade Center towers. I worked in the WTC. What happened to the observation deck on top? Hmmmm? Compared to the absolutely moronic plot, though, the WTC flaws are forgivable. Notice that the female leads all have spotless, perfectly made-up faces and hair. Spoiler... sorta'... if you're waiting for Adrienne Barbeau's boobs to ""escape"", don't hold your breath: they don't. This is a ONE star movie, folks. It belongs in the hall of fame of worst movies ever made, just a shade above Ed Wood's D-Grade movies, but not nearly as unintentionally funny.",Escape from New York
304,CandyStalker,Carpenter's Best,10,12 August 2006,"John Carpenter did amazing things with little money and a lot of imagination. ""Escape From New York"" crosses almost as many genres as ""Dawn of The Dead"". It's an odyssey, a comic book, a western (in the East), a black comedy, an operatic nightmare, a sci-fi cautionary tale, an ""audience movie""... It's a showcase for underutilized talent. Utterly creepy, funny, bleak and suspenseful with rich characters, memorable dialog and stimulating visuals. Oh, and that wonderful cast! That wonderful score! This gem will never truly get the praise that it deserves. Also, are there any doubts as to where James Cameron got the inspiration for his ""tech-noir"" look for ""The Terminator""? Sure, we all know Jim worked on this movie, as we know from whence Carpenter drew many of HIS inspirations. But there's nothing wrong with giving credit where it's due. Notable standouts: Harry Dean Stanton's delivery of the greeting, ""Gentlemen. Mr. President."", as he walks into a room of the Duke's filthy, thrift-store attired goons and the camera pans over to the president adorned with a blonde wig. Frank Doubleday as Romero. (What a classic entrance/introduction!) He looks like the Heat Miser from that Christmas TV special but solidly establishes the inmates as horrific androgynous, diseased cannibals. Ernest Borgnine, successfully topping his portrayal of Mr. Rogo from ""The Poseidon Adventure"" with his performance as Cabbie; simultaneously hilarious and tragic.",Escape from New York
305,G-dog67,Why This Movie Works and Why It Never Grows Old,10,4 March 2008,"It would have been easy for John Carpenter to stay in George Romero's shadow or remain a cult figure with more ""Dark Star""-type entertainment. Instead, JC catapulted his name and franchise into history with the release of EFNY. It contains all the classic elements: a no-compromise anti-hero (Russell), a cast of misfit cohorts who work both for and against his goals (Borgnine, Barbeau, Stanton), an enemy with real dimensions (Hayes), a fantastic and depressingly realistic setting (Manhattan turned into a prison), and an authority we can both respect (van Cleef) and despise (Pleasance). And all of it works extremely well with a no-nonsense plot and storyline. No part of this is so far-fetched that we can't relate to the situation (and who hasn't pictured NYC in this condition one day?) or sympathize with Russell's character Snake Plissken. The worse thing you could say about this cult favorite is the low-key climax. No, you don't get a major battle or explosions as the finale. What you do get is absolutely true-to-form with the rest of the film: Snake walks away after successfully completing his mission (and saving his own skin) and yet can still screw the authority and the society that put him in the situation to begin with...and you find yourself grinning in approval.",Escape from New York
306,cobra-29,John Carpenters great sci-fi film,8,27 September 1999,"Part of the success of this film, was the Kurt Rusell´s performance of Snake Plisken. This is an important film on John¨s Carpenter filmography, he showns a different style in direction based on a great story that presents a new look on sci-fi films",Escape from New York
307,catadash,This movie has big flaws but I adore it,7,19 April 2019,"This movie isn't nostalgic for me. I was born in '97 and didn't see this film until recently.
Escape from New York is categorised as an Action film and I think that's why it leaves so many people disappointed. It is barely an action and I wouldn't even call it a sci-fi. It walks a fine line between the genres and is pretty mediocre as a film in general.
So why do I like it so much?The redeeming qualities of this film is definitely the atmosphere and the array of strange and wacky characters. This movie isn't even a comedy and never winks at the audience and I think that's what makes it so delightfully bizarre. The movie feels empty even for it's setting and I think that is to do with Carpenter's imagination outweighing his budget. I think what this movie does right is it subverts expectations. Especially with Snake's character. A traditional action would have a hero who tries to save everyone around them and this film really reinforces that Snake isn't a redeemable person. He is a vessel into the world much like Max is in the Mad Max franchise yet does even less. He seems more realistic that way. His motivations to even do anything in the film is all through manipulation.
This film is worth a watch if you're easy to please and appreciate tone and atmosphere in a film.
The main theme is also incredible. It's super catchy and I don't ven care for Carpenter's music outside of this and the main theme from In the Mouth of Madness.",Escape from New York
308,jjpbdywx,Another Quotable Classic from One of The Greatest,9,20 February 2021,"Director John Carpenter is nothing short than an artistic genius. And Kurt has been his leading actor of choice. Beside this flick, Kurt starred in one my absolute favorite movies ever John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". It's a unique and mind-blowing experience. If you're into music as well, like I am, then it may interest to know that John contributed heavily to the awesome, original music found in both films. They partnered together on the cult classic ""Big Trouble in Little China"". It's a fun, Sunday matinee kind of movie, worth a watch. Lastly, John directed a quotable keeper for people who love their cars: ""Christine"". I'm a bit sorry that this has been more of a review of Carpenter's brave, truly talented and notable works. You'll like it. I own it. For those who are looking for comments about this specific 9-star movie, please refer to the 360 reviews below. Trust me, I've said only what is crucial for those who are interested. And thank you",Escape from New York
309,BasketKjell,Escape from New York = Classic Cult Movie,10,4 May 2007,"The short and intense conversation between Lee Van (Hauk) Cleef and Kurt ""Snake Plissken"" Russel is exactly as much as the movie needs. The whispering Kurt does not speak if its not necessary, neither does Lee. The background soundtrack (Carpenter style, basically the same as in Assault on precinct 13 from 1976) adds an dimension to the movie.Another favorite actor is Ernest Borgnine. His Cabbie character is perfect for the movie and his performance is fantastic.I really hope that all youngsters takes a look at this classic movie, especially as Isaac Hayes, who is the perfect ""Duke of New York"", today probably more known for the kids as chef in South Park and possibly as Tolok in Stargate SG-1.",Escape from New York

He powered up the elevator and got on, when the elevator door closed, you can see on the right side of the door, a hand pushing it shut. Am I the only one that has seen this? This was a great movie for its time. Unfortunately Escape from L. A. was a joke compared to this one. Even so, it was fun to watch because of the characters. John Carpenter and Kurt Russel have done a lot of good work together. The Thing was most excellent. Notice the similarity in the background music in all of the Carpenter/Russel movies.",Escape from New York

Great story, masterful directing and writing, terrific acting. It's impeccable on all technical levels. From cinematography to editing and from soundtrack to sound design. But the most crucial aspect that makes this movie so fantastic, is that it contains the most badass movie character of all time by far. And that is, of course, Snake Plissken, portrayed marvelously by Kurt Russell. There are also other great cast members, such as Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, Donald Pleasence and Harry Dean Stanton. All in all, Escape from New York is amazing.

315,andreio94,This has not aged well. There are some great things in here but at times it just feels like a lazy B-movie,6,30 June 2019,"I don't want to be too harsh on this movie because its old and maybe at the time that's how things were, as well as the fact that the budget was relatively limited. But the sound design is horrible, it's edited awfully, at times I feel there's just lazy lazy moviemaking and there is almost no writing. Every line everyone says is exposition. Everything that you think will happen, happens. Every character is a cardboard version of whoever they are supposed to be. Snake sounds like a parody of action (anti-)heroes with the way that he speaks and acts.But still, l this movie has its merits. You can't deny the atmosphere it has, the production design and some really cool and sweet moments like the song in the theatre, the Snake being dead joke, etc.Overall if you have no expectations and you're in for a goofy old movie that maybe takes itself a bit too seriously that has some cool escapist moments, you'll like it. If you want something more sophisticated, you probably won't enjoy this.",Escape from New York

The movie was made in the 80's long before the game was made. but if your a snake fan (talking of the game here"" you will notice snake doesn't have an eye-patch, no problem my friends, as in the 3rd game Pliskin gets shot in the eye right? I know its his other eye but how similar! All the snake from the film needs is a bandanna! both stealthy slithers are identical!

It's about a hardened criminal who is sent in to rescue the President after his plane crashes in New York, now a massive prison. I found this movie to be a perfect storm of 80's nostalgia with bad CGI, a gritty color palette, gratuitous violence, and a strong lead action hero. Kurt Russel pulls off a fantastic Snake Plissken, the character becoming an icon for years to come. It's not the best movie ever made, but an enjoyable and fun experience nonetheless. 7/10",Escape from New York
318,socialjusticeexpress,Don't believe the idiots,10,22 June 2017,"Ah, older movies. There should be an age restriction for reviews on IMDb. You can tell who the young people are by the idiotic things they write about older movies. For some reason, young people just don't understand what FICTION means. Hence, the numerous one-star reviews in which the premise of Escape from New York is reviewed as opposed to the film itself. God love the youth, because I sure don't!Escape from New York is a great example of stretching a budget as far as it will go. For its time, it had a much bigger budget look to it. That explains why it inspired so many artists, including William Gibson. As much as I love Blade Runner, Escape from New York, essentially, beat Blade Runner to the punch with respect to the dark look that Blade Runner would eventually get credit for inspiring.The premise, that New York City would be turned into a giant prison, is actually not that absurd, though, for a work of fiction, that shouldn't even matter. In 1981, New York City was a giant toilet. It makes perfect sense that a totalitarian, post WWIII government might send all its criminals there to, pardon the pun, duke it out.Several of the kiddies here have complained about the script. They are not taking into account that all the Bibles of scriptwriting we know of today (Story, Save the Cat, etc.) were not published until well after this film was made. Regardless, if you actually take the story apart, you'll see it meets all the demands of traditional, storytelling structure.So you kids really have nothing to complain about, other than the fact that your poor generation has been deprived of the joys of REAL fiction. Stop looking for reality in fiction and stop using social media to make your reality a fiction!End of lecture. Now get off my lawn!",Escape from New York

The whole film is based on the character Snake Plissken (brillantly played by American actor Kurt Russell) in the settings of a apocalyptic New York city. This film-noir action adventure film will make you want to watch it over and over again !! The storyline is great, The dialog is not to cheesy nor exaggerated, the main music theme is really cool, and the rhythm of the movie is progressive. You will simply love the attitude of anti-hero Snake Plissken...this character has been yet underrated !! So as the movie !! I suggest this movie to all the sci-fi action thriller fans !

320,jpochop,Call me Snake,9,20 July 2018,"""Call me Snake,"" Kurt Russell utters to legendary Spaghetti Western actor Lee Van Cleef, as the latter attempts to make a deal with Kurt Russell's character, Lt. Snake Plissken, a decorated war hero-turned-anarchist. Van Cleef's character, another former war hero named Bob Hauk, tells Plissken that only a few hours earlier the President of the United States (Donald Pleasance) was the victim of a terrorist plane hijacking, forcing the President to abandon the plane in an escape vessel destined to crash land in New York City-now the nation's largest, and most dangerous, federal penitentiary.Hauk tells Plissken that, unless he wants to spend the rest of his life behind bars, he better get his ass in there and save the President. ""The name's Plissken!"" Kurt Russel utters rebelliously. The rest of the movie is pretty much exactly what you'd want out of a stylized sci-fi action piece set in a year that now, in 2018, is already 20 years in the dust. Kurt Russell delivers a 110% Kurt Russell performance, but plays a much grittier character in relation to Big Trouble in Little China's Jack Burton or even his role in The Thing. Carpenter's soundtrack kicks major ass, riding one long synth motif straight through the movie. Isaac Hayes delivers as The Bad Guy, and Donald Pleasance plays a unique version of the hostage, let alone the President of the United States. What can be said...if you love John Carpenter, you should have already seen this movie! And if you love 80s action gems, pop this baby in and enjoy the ride.",Escape from New York

Snake Blisken is the classic anti-hero, and is a constant character in John Carpenter's film. I like this. It's one way of making sure you identify with a character before you begin the the true drama of the film. I mean all of us have a little Bad-a$$ in us, or at least a part that thinks it might be cool. It contains clever writing that is a good continuation of the character set up in previous Carpenter films, like ""Assault on precinct 13""(i want the soundtrack to that too).Technically, i think the soundtrack is actually very good for it's time. The cinematography is quite dark, and that effects you understanding of the film. Though in essence, it is just a good Sci-fi action adventure.",Escape from New York
