0,TheLittleSongbird,Not as bad as I thought it would be,6,10 November 2009,"I did fear that I would hate A Cinderella Story. I honestly it would be predictable and contrived, problems I have had with some of the Mary Kate and Ashley movies. Actually, while by no means perfect, but as an update of the fairytale this exceeded my expectations. I have heard and read complaints that the film is very unoriginal. I don't think it is. While I like films to be original, I don't like it being too original. The film does follow the skeletal premise of the timeless fairytale, that I grew up reading, as well as loving the Disney film and Ever After with Drew Barrymore and Anjelica Huston.A Cinderella Story does have its flaws. There are a lot of over-familiar elements in the script, and the plot falls into the oft-danger of being predictable. There are one or two pacing problems and the odd clichéd character, and while there are some mildly funny moments with the stepsisters especially(ie. the scene in the swimming pool) there is nothing uproariously funny. I liked the idea of the two lead characters being internet pals, somewhat reminded me of You've Got Mail. On the plus side, there are some things I really did like about this film. While they had some in general superficial material to work with, the entire acting ensemble did more than adequately. Hilary Duff does a good job in the lead as Sam, she is definitely not the best actress ever, far from it, but she is better than Miley Cyrus. Plus I thought she looks lovely here. While he looks like 5 years older, Chad Michael Murray is an appealing love interest. And Jennifer Coolidge makes the most out of the role of the wicked stepmother here. The camera work is decent, and the sets are colourful. And I have to mention Sam's dress, it was gorgeous! The film's finish is satisfying too, and the soundtrack is cool.Overall, one may dismiss this film as a silly piece of predictable fluff. While it is definitely not perfect, it is watchable, and good undemanding fun for teenagers. 6/10 Bethany Cox",A Cinderella Story
1,bkoganbing,Disney loves Cinderella,6,16 January 2017,"Ever since Walt Disney put out that full length animated version of Cinderella back in the middle of the last century they can't seem to get away from the story. It seems like every young girl pop star associated with the Magic Kingdom gets a crack at some kind of Cinderella type role. In A Cinderella Story it was Hillary Duff's turn.In this instance though Cinderella's universal tale was mixed with a bit Duff's own Lizzie McGuire character and series and a great deal was taken from The Shop Around The Corner and it's musical remake In The Good Old Summertime. Duff has an e-mail relationship with her prince charming Chad Michael Murray under pseudonyms. In this version we see a bit of dad played by Whip Hubley in the story. Hillary loses her father in an earthquake and he apparently died in testate and self absorbed stepmother Jennifer Coolidge and her two daughters from her first marriage treat Duff like the matchstick girl.But she's got friends, her diner employers like Viola Davis, Paul Rodriguez and Mary Pat Gleason. She also has a boy confidante like she has Gordo in Lizzie McGuire in Dan Byrd. She gets by with a lot of help from her friends.This is a nice version of Cinderella with generous helpings from other story sources. Hillary Duff is a most appealing Cinderella and the supporting cast does well in their roles.",A Cinderella Story
2,SnoopyStyle,Harmless useless,5,16 November 2013,"Samantha Montgomery (Hilary Duff) loses her father to an earthquake when she's 8 and leaves her to toil away at their diner under the thumb of her evil stepmother Fiona (Jennifer Coolidge) and stepsisters Gabriella (Andrea Avery) and Brianna (Madeline Zima). She's loved by the diner staff and her best friend Carter (Dan Byrd). She has an online relationship but doesn't know it's with the most popular boy in her school Austin (Chad Michael Murray).In this Cinderella adaptation, a cell phone is the glass slipper. It was unrealistic to not see through her disguise. That's a case of style ignoring substance. Then there's the evil reveal of her identity at the prep rally. The emotions and the motivations are all forced and illogical. Although I like all the actors in this movie, it has too much juvenile silliness. Ultimately it's a harmless piece of fluff.",A Cinderella Story
3,lee_eisenberg,How's Howard supposed to explain this to Bernadette?,2,28 March 2015,"The Cinderella motif has gotten used so much that it's become a blur. To be certain, Kenneth Branagh's live-action version of Disney's 1950 movie comes across as less interesting since Cinderella was a character in the recent anti-fairy tale ""Into the Woods"".Anyway, ""A Cinderella Story"" is what Charles Perrault's fairy tale would be were it set in the San Fernando Valley. The abused stepdaughter (Hilary Duff) is surrounded by empty-headed people. There's every SoCal stereotype: Botox, mass consumption, and overusing water.So why take any interest in this movie? I watched it because I wanted to see the early appearance of Simon Helberg, now known as Howard on ""The Big Bang Theory""*. Every time that his character appeared, I threw out a comment in the persona of Howard's shrill, overbearing mom.So, you might take an interest in the movie for that reason, but no other. A more interesting movie from 2004 based on Perrault's story is ""Ella Enchanted"", starring Anne Hathaway.It's too bad that Carol Ann Susi died. Now we'll never know what Howard's mom looks like.*More recently, Christine Baranski (Leonard's mom on ""The Big Bang Theory"") played the cruel stepmother in ""Into the Woods"".",A Cinderella Story
4,jboothmillard,A Cinderella Story,4,22 April 2009,"It's a simple concept, take a popular fairytale and make into a modern day teen flick, and the result, well in this case, not a completely brilliant idea. Basically Samantha 'Sam' Montgomery (Razzie nominated Hilary Duff) lost her father in an earthquake aged 8, and she lives in the attic with nasty stepmother Fiona (Jennifer Coolidge) and stepsisters Gabriella (Andrea Avery) and Brianna (Madeline Zima). Sam is not so popular at school, and besides her co-workers at her Dad's diner, and Carter Farrell (Heroes' Dan Byrd), her only friend, as Diner Girl is internet pen-pal Zomad, who unknown to her is Austin Ames (Chad Michael Murray). He invites his unknown friend to the big school Halloween party, where he is dressed as Prince Charming, and Sam is in a beautiful white near-wedding dress with matching mask. Instead of dropping a glass slipper before the stroke of midnight, Sam drops her cell phone, and Austin is placing posters asking ""Who Is Cinderella?"", and even after an embarrassing reveal with a read-out of their emails, they get their happy ending. Also starring Jerry Maguire's Regina King as Rhonda, Julie Gonzalo as Shelby Cummings, Lin Shaye as Mrs. Wells, Mary Pat Gleason as Eleanor and Rat Race's Paul Rodriguez as Bobby. Duff and Murray may look like a cute couple, but for it was Coolidge as the real bitch stepmother that added at least a little humour and zing to an otherwise slightly drab teen romantic comedy. Okay!",A Cinderella Story
5,studioAT,The 1st Cinderella Story,4,1 December 2019,"It's since spawned many a straight to DVD spin-off, but this is the original 'Cinderella Story' starring Hillary Duff.It's a decent enough tween film, with a good central performance by Duff as the modern day (well, 2004 modern) Cinderella.Of course the whole film is completely stolen by Jennifer Coolidge, who is playing a character not dissimilar to her Bobbie character on the much maligned but great 'Joey'.Overall, decent enough.",A Cinderella Story
6,sunwarrior13,Bad Update Of Charles Perrault's Story,3,17 July 2015,"This is a basically a modern update of the fairy tale.Samantha Martin is faced with the situation with the untimely death of his father.This leaves the diner that he owns and her care under her stepmother Fiona.Her stepmother asked her to do all the menial tasks such as dishwashing,cleaning and mopping floors.At school,she is treated badly as well by Shelby,who happens to be a spoiled,wealthy and popular.Things change after a misplaced cellphone and a series of coincidence happen which led to a romance developed between her and a Prince Charming through constant text messaging and emails.Later,they promise to meet face-to-face on the biggest school dance and later realizes that that her prince happens to be Austin,the most popular student in school.Too bad that this film was simply generic,unfunny and undemanding there very limited thinking required.Added to that,there is nothing refreshing at all as the stereotype characters are simply brought back.No question about it that this was an insult to Charles Perrault's classic story.",A Cinderella Story
7,Calicodreamin,Perfectly Cliche,8,17 February 2020,"A Cinderella story is one of those movies that is perfect in its absolute predictability. It doesn't need to be anything more than it is.

8,neil-476,"Adequate, inoffensive",7,18 December 2010,"This is a satisfactory retelling of the Cinderella story in a California high school setting, brought to life by Jennifer Coolidge's funny modern wicked stepmother.You'll be left pleased at the end by a film which is suitable for family viewing, albeit you never get that involved that the satisfactory resolution brings a lump to the throat - it doesn't.Hilary Duff as Sam, the Cinderella character, is one of a number of young American actresses who I find absolutely indistinguishable. They do the job, and they do it perfectly adequately, but they don't bring anything to it which means that six months later I can say ""Ah, that was Hilary Duff!""Subsequent addition: Eight months later, in August 2011, I can remember nothing about this film whatsoever. Utterly forgettable, obviously.",A Cinderella Story
9,anaconda-40658,Cinderella's Story Just Got Boring.,3,29 July 2015,"A Cinderella Story (2004): Dir: Mark Rosman / Cast: Hilary Duff, Chad Michael Murray, Jennifer Coolidge, Regina King, Dan Byrd: Yet another take on Cinderella although processed more as a teen targeted satire than Ever After. Hilary Duff is under the ruling of her wicked stepmother and her spoiled stepsisters after her father died in an earthquake. She slaves in a diner but secretly chats with a guy via Internet. As simple plots go they will narrowly avoid each other without knowing it. Screenplay is rubbish although young girls may enjoy its clean wholesome charm. Director Mark Rosman brings a modern day reality to it. Duff has charm but at the mercy of lame writing. Chad Michael Murray plays football captain whom communicates with her through Internet chat sites. When she wears an eye mask at the dance he seems not to know who she is so when she loses her slipper he is at a loss that no intelligent person would be fooled by. Jennifer Coolidge is the one casting that steals in her portrayal of the wicked stepmother who slaves Duff yet becomes the ultimate foil. Regina King is cardboard as Duff's diner friend whom looks out for her. Dan Byrd plays Duff's irritating friend who occupies scenes on the basis of being like a kid needing attention. Unlike Ever After the modern day elements are replaced by dreary teen clichés and foolish fantasy references. Score: 3 ½ / 10",A Cinderella Story
10,JamesHitchcock,A high school movie that reminds you of every other high school movie you've ever seen,5,17 June 2015,"Recent years have seen a number of attempts to film traditional fairy tales in a ""darker"", more ""adult"" style, often influenced by fantasy epics like Peter Jackson's Tolkien adaptations, examples being ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" and ""Maleficent"", based upon the Sleeping Beauty legend. ""A Cinderella Story"", from just over a decade ago, is another fairy tale adaptation, but made in a very different style. The story is updated to the modern San Fernando Valley, California, the heroine is named Samantha, and the film is made as a traditional high school romantic comedy. That seems appropriate; American high school comedies are generally about as realistic as fairy tales- indeed, in some cases rather less so. (Samantha's surname is ""Montgomery"", possibly a reference to Elizabeth Montgomery who played a character named Samantha in the popular TV show ""Bewitched""). One thing which always used to baffle me about the traditional legend of Cinderella is why her father did not intervene more decisively to prevent her from being mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters. If paternal affection had not motivated him to do so, surely social pride would have done; if there is one thing no aristocrat- however financially embarrassed or mild-mannered he might be- could bear, it would be seeing his daughter treated like a skivvy. The makers of this film seem to have had similar thoughts because Sam's kindly father Hal, the owner of a diner, is killed off (in an earthquake) before the end of the opening credits. This leaves Sam to the less-than-tender mercies of her unpleasant stepmother Fiona and her ugly stepsisters Brianna and Gabriella. (The adjective ""ugly"" in this context refers less to the girls' looks than to their obnoxious personalities). Fiona not only forces Sam to work as her unpaid domestic servant but also makes her work in the diner.Sam's problems are not confined to the home. It is a standard cliché in all high school comedies that every American high school is dominated by a clique of upper-class girls (invariably cheerleaders) and their athletic boyfriends (invariably football players; it would seem that prowess in other sports such as basketball, soccer or track-and-field does not confer the same social prestige). The members of this clique are always described as ""popular"", even though they invariably possess personality traits- snobbishness, vanity, arrogance and bitchiness- which in real life would doubtless make them extremely unpopular. Sam falls foul of this clique, particularly their leader Shelby, who mercilessly mock her for her working-class origins.The film tells the story, parallelling the original tale of Cinderella, of Sam's romance with Shelby's ex-boyfriend Austin, the handsome, popular star player of the school football team, who is the Prince Charming of this story. Sam's Fairy Godmother-equivalent is Rhonda, the kind-hearted manager of the diner, and the buttons figure is Carter, the bespectacled class geek. The school dance is the equivalent of the Prince's ball and a mobile phone stands in for the glass slipper.""A Cinderella Story"" did well at the box-office, but was not a hit with the critics. Roger Ebert, for example, called it ""a lame, stupid movie"", and I can see where he was coming from. It doesn't score highly for originality; turning an old, old fairy tale into a high school movie doesn't require much in the way of artistic inspiration. The characters are all stereotypes, and the male lead Chad Michael Murray is more Prince Charmless than Prince Charming. At one point the film seems to be moving to an ending in which Sam ends up with Carter, who seems to be much more sincerely in love with her than the rather shallow Austin. That would have been much more original, but the film-makers dared not break one of the oldest rules of the cinema. (The one which states that boys who wear glasses can be a girl's platonic best friend but never her love interest). The decision to follow the Cinderella story so closely leads to some plot-holes; is it, for example, plausible that her flimsy cardboard mask would have prevented Austin, or any of her other classmates, from recognising Sam, especially as she never tries to disguise her voice? (I mean, she's a girl in his year at school, not a complete stranger). On the plus side, there is some occasionally witty dialogue, and Jennifer Coolidge is amusingly nasty as Fiona, as is Julie Gonzalo as Shelby. Hilary Duff, a rising Disney star at the time, makes a sweet and personable heroine. (Her popularity was probably the main reason for the film's box-office success). It helps that at seventeen Hilary was the same age as the character she was playing, a departure from the normal movie convention whereby high school students are often played by actors in their twenties or even thirties. Overall, however, this is little more than a high school movie that reminds you of every other high school movie you've ever seen. 5/10",A Cinderella Story
11,StevePulaski,Overflowing with charm and likability,8,22 July 2014,"A Cinderella Story is a charming reiteration of the timeless animated Disney film, featuring a charming performance by Hillary Duff, who always looks charming with her smiley charisma and beautiful blonde hair, boasting a charming story about a charming girl who is cursed with hell and highwater between her not-so charming stepmother and stepdaughters, with her only vice being the charming boy she keeps texting and instant messaging in hopes to lead a life like the charming fantasies her charming father used to read her. In short, the whole entire movie is pretty charming.Hillary Duff's character is Sam, who works at her father's diner, which is now owned by her stepmother from hell (Jennifer Coolidge). Regardless of the kind of endless grief the woman causes her, Sam must obey each and every order given to her by her stepmother for any hope of getting the money to go to Princeton University (her father told her that's the college princesses go to in order to find their prince). Sam slogs away at the diner, while finding the time to text and IM a guy by the username of ""Nomad,"" who goes to the same school she does. Sam doesn't know, however, that this person just so happens to be the all-star football jock Austin Ames (Chad Michael Murray), a kid whose exterior shows a tough, attractive, popular kid but whose interior lies a closeted poet, silenced by his domineering father, who has Austin's life preprogrammed for him.Austin wants to get together with Sam at the Halloween homecoming dance, where he requests that Sam meet him in the center of the dance floor at the stroke of 11:00pm. When the two meet, Sam is boasting a Phantom-mask, with a gorgeous ballgown, while Austin just so happened to dress like Prince Charming personified. The two exchange more deep, intimate talks, like the ones they held over the phone and computer, all the while Sam can't believe she is talking to Austin, who may not like her when he sees who she really is - just an ordinary girl. This complicates the relationship between the two as, after the dance, Austin can't track down his Cinderella and Sam is neurotic and inert about the whole entire event.I'm aware how frothy A Cinderella Story sounds, and here's where you expect me to say that, if one looks deeper into the material, they'll find a pleasant, winning film. That's simply not true; what you see is what you get with A Cinderella Story, but what you see is certainly acceptable. As incredulous as it is and as silly as the whole thing can be, one must not forget it's a live-action, reimagining of the classic fairytale Cinderella, which is, essentially, as incredulous and as silly as it sounds too. The modern reimagining features pleasant updates, such as the differences in communication, a more suburban setting, providing for more close-to-home features, and a more recognizable cast of characters in addition.Then there's Duff, who has the ability to light up the dreariest screenplay and detract from its shortcomings if she sucks up and lets out one of her many illuminating smiles. The film was directed by Mark Rosman, who has worked with Duff on numerous projects and really knows how to position her and make her versatile in her emotions, to boot, with Duff showing about the same level of acceptable emotional range as she did in Raise Your Voice. In addition, there's Murray, who, aside from being labeled as someone ""who made standards way to high for young girls,"" according to my friend Katie, can convey multiple different personalities nicely, as if he is really playing dual roles in his life as well. Then there's Coolidge, who goes from playing the most desirable mom in America to the most loathsome in an unexpectedly devious and enjoyable performance as one of the most dastardly mothers in recent memory.A Cinderella Story won't break any particularly new ground, nor will it captivate those disillusioned by the lackluster market of teen films. However, I applaud the fact that it takes a more human approach to fairy tales, in the sense that they're modernizing them and incorporating stories with actual human beings and not decorating them with expensive sets, detailed makeup, and forgetting everything in the way of character and development. Unlike Duff's previous efforts, like Raise Your Voice, that were so, so close at developing a functional story about teenage life but falling short, A Cinderella Story rebounds with more under its sleeve than the average film of the genre, making for a warmhearted family affair.Starring: Hillary Duff, Chad Michael Murray, Jennifer Coolidge, and Regina King.

12,Buddy-51,utterly lame teen comedy,3,15 November 2005,"""A Cinderella Story"" is yet another instance of Hollywood taking a classic fairy tale from the Middle Ages and doing it up in modern dress. This one is set in the ""Valley Girl"" world of snooty bitches and pimply-faced teens, where love blooms in internet chat rooms, and romantic encounters are reduced to an endless exchange of poorly spelled and ungrammatical text messages.The story begins in the 1994 San Fernando Valley when Sam's deliriously happy childhood is shattered by the sudden death of her father in the Northridge earthquake of all things (I wish I were kidding about this, but I'm not), leaving her to suffer under the iron fists of a wicked stepmother and two equally repulsive stepsisters. (One wonders what Sam's lights-out time must have been, since the quake in the film occurs while her father is reading her a bedtime story - a bit odd considering that the actual shaker took place at 4:35 in the morning). The film quickly moves to the present day, where we encounter a teenaged Sam living a life of sheer, unadulterated drudgery, while still yearning for that fairy tale prince to ride into the scene and take her away from it all.To more comfortably accommodate the contemporary setting, all the magical elements of the story have been effectively eliminated and only the romantic clichés remain. Thus, the fairy godmother has been converted into a sassy waitress who watches over Sam and provides her with the gown she needs at that crucial Cinderella moment; the ball has become a high school Halloween dance; the glass slipper has morphed into a left-behind cell phone (though little is actually ever done with that); and Prince Charming is no longer the heir to an entire kingdom but rather a hunky quarterback with dreams of going to Princeton (ha ha) against his father's expressed wishes.Hilary Duff doesn't exactly embarrass herself in the role of Cinderella, but she is forced to struggle with a screenplay overflowing with annoying, over-the-top stereotypes and teen romance banalities. And the movie boasts a penultimate scene at the big championship football game that will have the girls in the audience sighing with satisfaction - and the boys groaning in pain.With one preposterous scene after another, this lame and insipid, by-the-numbers concoction is an insult to thinking teens everywhere.",A Cinderella Story
13,Robert_duder,Modernized for a new fairy tale generation!,7,19 October 2004,"I have said before and I will confess again, I am just a sucker for the Disney cutesy live action movies. Princess Diaries, Freaky Friday, Parent Trap. They are predictable but always fun and light hearted and humorous. It's a recipe for film that has worked for Disney far longer than any of us care to think about. In saying that I am not a Hillary Duff fan, although she seems multi talented, her characters never change and her scope as an actress will seemingly be limited to Lizzie McGuire for the rest of her career. A Cinderella Story is exactly what one would expect. It's a retelling of the old classic fairy tale with the modern day twist but director Mark Rosman, who has really nothing to claim fame to does a terrific job at truly modernizing the story without coming across as stupid or blatantly obvious. Duff plays Sam, a girl who's father is tragically taken from her after marrying a wicked woman played perfectly hideously by Jennifer Coolidge, you can't help but despise her in this role. She is accompanied by her two daughters, Brianna and Gabriella who are spoiled little brats that like to make Sam's life a living hell. Sam's ""wicked stepmother"" takes over Sam's father's pride of joy, his diner and turns into her own little cash cow while keeping her late husband's staff on to torture them. She always makes Sam grind her fingers to the bone in between school classes working in the diner. Sam has an online boyfriend whom she's never met, there is a school dance in which he wants to meet her, he turns out to be Mr. Popular, she sneaks out having to be back at the diner for twelve before her stepmother finds out. The rest of the story unfolds as you might expect. As with all live action cutesy Disney type films, the cast shines...yes even Duff. She's too goody for her own good which works in this case as you feel sorry for her. Her surrogate family, the diner staff are delightful and funny and they help us root for the underdog. Rhonda played by Regina King, who has been some great family movies ie: Mighty Joe Young, and Daddy Day Care is perfect as Sam's protector and Fairy Godmother you might say?? And Chad Michael Murray is great as her Saviour and Prince Charming. The best part of this film is the way the retelling is handled. It's not done in such a way that you are blatantly watching another rehashing of an old fairy tale but rather handled delicately and done in such a modern way that you think to yourself ""Hey that's almost like Cinderella."" You actually feel for each character the way you are supposed to feel, and you want to see each and every one get what they deserve and incidentally they all do which leaves you satisfied and happy with the film.This movie won't rake in any critical acclaim but it's fun and you'll enjoy it if you like this style of movie. I suggest checking it out!! 7/10",A Cinderella Story
14,MLDinTN,Jennifer Coolidge makes this fun,6,17 May 2005,"I don't really think much of Hillary Duff and in this film, she does nothing to change that. As the title suggests, the movie follows the plot of Cinderella. A young girl, Sam, has two snotty step-sisters and stepmom who uses her as a slave. She goes to a dance and meets the boy who's fallen for her over email. But he doesn't recognize her behind the mask. She must leave before midnight and leaves her cell phone behind rather than a slipper. So her guy searches for her. And everything works out in the end.What I didn't get was how could anyone believe Austin wouldn't recognize Sam. Her voice is very distinguished and he goes to the diner a lot. Plus I hate it when they have the supposed ugly duckings with the best hair and make-up one can have.But Jennifer Coolidge was great as the evil stepmom. She was very funny. From her salmon diets to always talking about liposuction. Without her, I think the movie would have been a lot more boring.FINAL VERDICT: If you're into teen movies, then you should catch this one. At least Freddie Prince Jr isn't in it. It's fairly entertaining and short.",A Cinderella Story

It has all the essential elements with enough changes to make it feel different. It is, however, very locked in the early 2000s.

You're not missing anything, but you won't regret it either",6,2 January 2014,"Sam Montgomery loses her father during an earthquake when she is eight years old, leaving her with the domineering stepmother Fiona, and her meddling step sisters. Sam becomes a slave to Fiona's needs, which includes working at a diner, and making sure Fiona gets whatever she wants. Sam doesn't have much of a social life because of Fiona. The only people who care about her is her best friend Carter, and a girl she works with, Rhonda. She's also interacting with a mysterious pal online named Nomad through texts and emails. They both deal with family issues, both want to get into Princeton, though Sam is a bit reluctant to show her true self to him because Sam doesn't realize Nomad is Austin Ames. Austin doesn't realize the girl of his dreams is Sam. Despite being ordered to work that night by Fiona, Sam heads to the dance, thanks to Rhoda lending her a beautiful white dress. Sam finds out that Nomad is actually Austin Ames. Sam leaves abruptly because she doesn't want Fiona to find out she is at the dance. Austin is left wondering who his ""Cinderella"" is. He becomes adamant about finding who she is. They both had a night they'll never forget, but will their respective family issues keep them apart?I love Hilary Duff. She's gorgeous, genuine, and a great role model. She's also two years younger than me. My crush on her aside, I thought this was a fun movie for what it was. It's innocuous for kids and teens alike, and even adults will get a few smiles out of it. I thought the way they set the story up was very clever. It takes an old fashioned fantasy like Cinderella, and sets the story in a contemporary setting. It throws in some fantasy aspects, while keeping it real with everyday life. They didn't complicate it, and it worked out well. Maybe i'm just a sucker for some cute romance, but I found this movie to be quite romantic. It's a typical story with your usual clichés of good overcoming all evil. The heroine is considered an outsider by the popular people, the school hunk dumps the vixen he's dating for the less fortunate heroine. It's not entirely original, but it's worked many times before, and the formula works again in this movie. It helps that it is a bit more innovative than most with how they pull it off. Hilary Duff is as cute as a button as Sam. She is incredibly charming, very likable, and conveys the proper emotions when necessary. It's not much of a stretch for her, but I thought she was terrific. Anyone that doesn't rally behind her character has no soul. Chad Michael Murray is above average as the love interest. I wouldn't say he blew me away, but he is charming enough to make the role work. He had great chemistry with Duff as well. Jennifer Coolidge steals many scenes as the evil stepmother. She had some terrific lines. I couldn't help but love her. Dan Byrd is a hoot as Duff's best friend, Carter. His nerdy persona was fun to watch. Regina King is great as well as Rhonda. I did think the ending was a tad too convenient. It seemed a little too neat and conventional for me, but it was the right way to end things. You need a happy ending for movies like these. As predictable and clichéd as the ending is, I dare you not to smile. Final Thoughts: It's nothing earth shattering, but it'll pass the time very nicely. If you want some smiles, chuckles, and a movie that will make you feel good after it's over, this is a decent pick. 6/10",A Cinderella Story
17,tabuno,A Commendable Effort,7,24 January 2019,"13 November 2004. I enjoyed this movie and I was particularly impressed by the un-Cinderella approach taken by the director and script. Against type and expectation, there is no magic here, no real fairy-god mothers - this really is a no-nonsense juvenile, growing up teen movie that uses Cinderella themes. In a much more consistent and serious manner, this movie explores the typical problems of bullying and teasing and it really does hit home on being one's own person, going forward with one's own dream. While not original in most of its script, the use of the Cinderella context with the wicked stepmother and two step-sisters and the irony of unknown identities are used to good effect. The biggest drag of the movie was the over the top acting and stereotypical, foolish characterization of Jennifer Coolidge and her two daughters in the movie. Hillary Duff and Chad Michael Murray did excellent jobs in their respective roles. This year has seen better quality teen movies and people just don't seem to be realizing it. This movie unfortunately probably disappointed a lot of people because it didn't meet the initial expectations of those going in to see it. Regardless of the quality of a movie, dashed expectations usually can never safe how people react and feel about the movie afterwards. Cinderella-fans will be truly disappointed while those interested in a more modest female-teen movie about secret identities, teen rivalries, and just a fun movie won't be disappointed on the otherhand.",A Cinderella Story

It's a great take on Cinderella with modern themes and it's just wonderful.In this movie, a young girl loses her father and her mean step-mother now has control over her life. With two wicked step-sisters to boss her around, Samantha is just sick of being treated this way. She starts having an online relationship with a guy from her school. She doesn't know who he is and he doesn't know who she is. It turns out that he's one of the most popular guys in school. When he asks her to meet her at the masquerade ball, they meet, connect, and even have a kiss. But since ""Cinderella"" wasn't supposed to be at the ball, she must run away before midnight, so she can get home to great her terrible family. She drops her cellphone and ""Prince Charming"" uses it to find out who the girl is.

20,lisafordeay,A cute teenage romantic comedy based on the Cinderella tale,8,1 October 2010,I got this on DVD and I used to be obsessed with it as I watched it every day but my DVD of it broke so now I have it on VHS and I really liked it.Hilary Duff plays Sam Montgomery a girl who's dad died in the earthquake and she lives with her Barbie plastic stepmother from hell Fiona(Jennifer Coolidge) and her two bratty step sisters Brianna & Gabriella.She meets a guy online who she doesn't even know and they decide to meet at the Halloween dance. The thing is that the secret admirer is no other than Austin Ames(Chad Micheal Murray) who is the school's quarter backer and he is dating Shelby Cummings who Sam's best friend Carter secretly fancies.Of course she goes as Cinderella and meets Austin Ames who she becomes smitten with.But will he love her if he finds out that she is the diner girl??.The cast was cute especially Chad Micheal Murray who was adorable and Hilary Duff who was a great actress. The music is grand and the whole plot is a teenage version of Cinderella.A great film to watch on a lazy afternoon with your mates or if you want something to watch by yourself.I'll give it an 8/10,A Cinderella Story
21,davispittman,"A cute, charming and funny update of Disney classic",8,4 March 2017,"A Cinderella Story (2004) is a very cute/charming and sometimes funny teenage update of the 1950s classic Disney cartoon. Hilary Duff is good in the lead role, and so is her love interest Chad Michael Murray. Jennifer Coolidge was wonderfully cast as the wicked stepmother. Also Regina King is one of my favorite parts of the whole movie, she has some hilarious one liners and pieces of dialogue. The movie isn't something to hold up as one of the greatest movies ever made, but it's sweet, enjoyable and fun. I'd suggest this one as a good fit for a family movie night. The mix between the sweet endearing moments and the funny moments are nice and balanced, and the humor isn't 100% slapstick, which I was thankful for because that really isn't that funny to me and it gets old and tiresome. 8/10 overall for A Cinderella Story.",A Cinderella Story
22,TOMNEL,Ugh...this film is mind numbingly bad.,1,29 December 2010,"Ugh. That's the only reaction that can be had to nearly every scene of this putrid, idiotic family film. Ugh!!! Sure, this thing is meant for kids, but there are a lot of films out there made to appeal to children, but also are intelligent enough to entertain the adults. This movie was not going for that. Children, mainly little girls, will eat up this unoriginal material, and laugh at the horribly acted slapstick, and enjoy Hillary Duff's nice character. But adults, the poor adults who happened to go to see this with their children, meanwhile will be cringing in their seats, wondering what life would be like if they didn't have kids, and contemplating suicide right then and there. This is just awful, sappy kiddie fluff, with no redeeming qualities.So basically, as the title would suggest, this is just a modern day, non-fantasy retelling of the classic Cinderella story. Hillary Duff plays Sam, a teenage girl who used to be happy when her father was alive, before he perished in an earthquake. Unfortunately, her father didn't have a will, and all of his belongings went to Sam's step-mother, and Sam was moved in the attic to make room for the step-mother and her two idiot step-sisters. Sam works at her father's old diner (now owned by her step-mother) and is a huge nerd at school. So, the most popular guy in school, Austin (Chad Michael Murray), and Sam are internet chat buddies, but neither of them no who their texting buddies are. They meet at a school dance, where Hillary Duff is disguised in her eye mask that certainly makes her unrecognizable. She has to leave at midnight to work, and Austin looks for his true love, while Sam tries to build up the courage to tell him. Predictability ensues.So, what good things can be said of this film? Hmmm, well, Hilary Duff isn't a great actress, but she does fine in this role, and so does Chad Michael Murray. And really, Jennifer Coolidge is fine as the wicked step-mother too. The movie was competently filmed and looked fine on an aesthetic level. So what's so bad about the movie? Everything else. The step-sister's were complete idiots, and their performances were so over the top it's actually hard to watch. Any jokes that are made by them is ridiculous and unfunny. Dan Byrd, who plays Carter, Sam's best friend, gives an alright performance, but when we are first introduced to him, he is like a wannabe rapper. Why? He's not like this for any more of the film, so was this character trait considered just too stupid and/or stereotypical to continue with, so they dropped it? Who knows, but it's odd and takes away continuity from the character. To add to stupid character traits, despite that this movie often tries to be a comedy, not one funny thing happens in this entire 90 minute film. Not one laugh, not one smile, not one smirk. This movie also raises many questions. How does Chad Michael Murray not recognize Hillary Duff in her costume? Why does her try to find who she is by holding an audition, instead of first asking her? Why does it start raining on a cloudless night when Hillary Duff and Mr. Murray start kissing? Why is the only clique at school the popular kids (consisting of 6 people) and the nerds (consisting of Sam, Carter and this weirdo Matrix obsessed fellow)? The answer to all these questions...this movie runs on clichés and is like a quilt stitched together from all the worst qualities of teen and kid movies that preceded it. This thing even has one of those horrible 80's clichéd montages where the character tries on clothing, and the other characters shake their head in disapproval, until they find just the right thing. It's just so bad!!!Little girls might enjoy this one, but everyone else will hate it. It's awful, even for a kid movie, and should not be viewed by anyone over 7. It's not cute, it's just really, really dumb.My rating: BOMB out of ****. 95 mins. PG for crude humor and mild language.",A Cinderella Story
23,rbverhoef,For Duff fans maybe,4,2 May 2005,"I can't help myself smiling near the end of romantic comedies, when the two people made for each other finally have their first real kiss. 'A Cinderella Story' brought that smile to my face, on the way it made me laugh a couple of times, but to be honest the film itself is not good. I should say terrible I guess, but since I always find amusing things in this genre I personally would not agree with myself even though I know I am right.The film follows the Cinderella story. We have Hilary Duff as Cinderella, here named Sam, Jennifer Coolidge as the evil stepmother named Fiona, and two evil stepsisters named Brianna (Madeline Zima) and Gabriella (Andrea Avery). The boy Sam likes is Austin (Chad Michael Murray), although she doesn't know she likes him since she has felt in love with him through e-mail conversations. I guess part of the inspiration came from 'You've Got Mail' too. Of course we have the dance where she learns who he is. Since her eyes are covered with a mask he does not who she is. (When this rule is applied to Superman, it should be applied to Hilary Duff.) Instead of losing a glass slipper near the end she loses her phone. The search for Cinderella starts.This is the main story. Sub-plots involve Sam's good friend Carter (Dan Byrd) and their friendship and a diner that used to belong to Sam's father including the people working there, most notably Rhonda (Regina King). These little stories are almost more interesting than the main story. Duff is able to make the film watchable. She really is sweet and it is too bad for her she has to do it with this material. Since the comparison is always made: Lindsay Lohan's 'Mean Girls' is a much better film. That film seems to know something about high schools and the people attending them. It's way more intelligent and contains a lot more real laughs. In 'A Cinderella Story' everything, and I mean every little thing, goes by the book. I understand the film is based on one of the most famous fairy tales out there, but even stories like that can be made original in one way or another.Is there some joy in this film? Yes, for some. You have to love romantic comedies as much as I do for starters. Like I said, Duff is really sweet and Chad Michael Murray has his moments even though he is six years older. You might give it a try if you can a film for those qualities alone, but I would say you better spend your time on something better. 'Mean Girls' is a nice one to start, or how about the good old Disney-animated 'Cinderella'?",A Cinderella Story

25,triple8,It was actually better then I thought it would be.,6,23 May 2005,"SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: Man do people hate this movie!!!! I guess I could See why. Oscar winner it ain't. But there are so many movies that are worse then this. I gave this a 6 which normally means OK maybe but not really that great. In this case, though, I guess my review will Be a Mostly positive one-because this was actually many points better then I ever dreamed it would be.First off I watched this when I was sick-now I have done that, in the past with other movies and they've put me to sleep. Cinderella Story kept my attention nicely. This movie, to me, didn't seem bad or dreadful-just unoriginal. There was not a lot of creativity that went into this, it's just basically the retelling of Cinderella high school style. But I moderately enjoyed it. I was aware, when I was watching it, that I wasn't watching anything particularly new or different, just a sweet little movie. And I can say I even liked this a bit.People have complained this isn't original but I actually think that's a plus. My fear was that they'd turn the story of Cinderella into an action movie. I mean Hollywood lately especially, HAS been known to do things like that. But the story's basically the same and although I'd have not originally thought of Duff for this role she's actually pretty good in it. Chad Michael Murray, who played Austin was good as well, although he looked about 5 or 10 years older then Duff but he was good in the role.The movie does contain a few laugh out loud funny lines and best of all, you know what's gonna happen before it happens so you can relax and enjoy yet another version of a timeless classic. This movie is nowhere near at the level of a movie like Ever After, and I honestly could not give it above a 6, but it's very much fun to watch at times and clearly not made with the makers expecting Oscars. I'd say if your in the right mood, give it a chance. My vote's 6 of 10.",A Cinderella Story

27,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A modern take on the Cinderella story,9,18 June 2012,"There are many ways to tell a story, but only a few of them work as an original piece. It's an odd saying, but it's possible. This version of Cinderella does perform well with updating the material. Yet, every part was still predictable. I don't see the connection. The scenes were original but the order that they came in, were too obvious. How did writer Leigh Dunlap miss that?The story of this movie runs fairly parallel to its predecessors. An attractive female is bullied and annoyed by her stepfamily and ""more popular"" people in high school. That is, until she runs into the guy of her dreams. Playing the ""Cinderella"" character (Sam Montgomery), who works constantly at her father's diner, is Hilary Duff. Duff was a great choice because of her girly figure and innocent voice. Her prince charming is Chad Michael Murray and he's also a good choice because of his masculine build and gentle voice. Not to mention, both Duff and Murray look lovely together.The rest of the co-stars are wonderful additions too. Dan Byrd is funny as Sam's close friend due to how prone he is at getting himself in awkward situations. Even Sam's diner co-workers have their great moments too. And it's great to see that they are there to support her as well. Jennifer Coolidge was an accurate choice for Sam's stepmother. One of the best parts is when she's swerving on the road and can't show an upset face because her botox treatment did not wear off yet. How embarrassing! And the stepsisters are no better either.The whole idea of having the original story modernized was an ample touch. Instead of having a fairy godmother and being magically given a dress, she's given a gorgeous dress from a close friend at work. Rather than having the magic spell dissipate, Sam had a timer of when to let her know that she had to leave the dance. And in place of the glass slipper that was left behind, was her cell phone. All the substitutions were amusing to see because they made Sam have an exact ""Cinderella"" story but without the magic.The music by Christophe Beck was a nice addition as well. His ability to create the feelings for when they are needed is done pleasingly. One other thing I didn't see possible though was how Murray's character was able to set up search and rescue fliers for the ""Cinderella"" character that he danced with. Doesn't he have classes? I mean he is a teenager and he's looking for his date but schools don't allow match findings to become public on school walls. How did he get away with that? Is that he that good looking?The transitions between scenes are quite obvious but the direction is great as a modernized rendition. The characters are welcoming, as is the way the plot follows through.",A Cinderella Story
28,BrandtSponseller,Great as a Cinderella story; just so-so as a high school rom-com,7,13 August 2006,"I haven't looked at other reviews of A Cinderella Story yet, but especially because it's a Hilary Duff film, I'd expect there to be a lot of scathing comments. That's because Hilary Duff is, or was, at least, popular with tweens and teens, and lots of slightly older folks have a tendency to hate commercial or popular stuff just because it's commercial or popular. Of course, they find other ways to justify their effectively institutional hatred of this stuff, and I'd guess that the main complaint would be the clichéd and predictable nature of the material here.And that's true. A Cinderella Story is clichéd and predictable, but that's not a great reason to dislike it. It is a Cinderella story, after all--it tells you right there in the title--retooled as a contemporary Los Angeles-area high school romance-comedy. We all know the Cinderella story fairly well. And any film fan at least old enough to almost be through with high school is surely familiar with the clichés of rom-coms and high school films. Most of us could write the basics of A Cinderella Story's plot without even seeing the film's trailer. So for adults, at least, A Cinderella Story is going to be successful or not dependent on how well it hikes its well-trodden path.For me, the best material was the more traditional Cinderella-based stuff. Jennifer Coolidge (voluptuously) fills the role of the wicked stepmother. I like Coolidge a lot. She has tremendous charisma and performs her infamous, quirky sarcastic act here with verve. I also like Duff. The two actresses playing Duff's stepsisters were new to me, but just as charismatic as Coolidge. Director Mark Rosman quotes some of the cartoonish visual gags of Disney's Cinderella (1950) more than I expected, and it works amazingly well. It's one element that pushes the film into a welcomed, absurd-surreal territory.What didn't work as well for me was the material when Rosman and credited writer Leigh Dunlap forgot about doing a pumped up remake of Cinderella. Too much of A Cinderella Story deals with Sam's (Duff) budding cyber-romance, her typical high school problems and the caricatured, stereotypical high school cliques. It's not that these other segments are bad, exactly, but they just don't have the spark or humor that the Cinderella material has, and especially for something like the cliques, we've seen this tens of times before. These scenes would be right at home if we edited them into any of those other films or television shows--sometimes I had to remind myself that I wasn't watching, say, a Cordelia scene from the first season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (1997).So A Cinderella Story has a bit of a split personality--as a funny and wacky remake of Cinderella and as a far less humorous, pretty generic ""getting through adolescence and finding yourself"" message film. That After-School-Special-styled message may be a worthy one, but intercut with a great version of Cinderella, it doesn't quite fit, even though Rosman does finally start to find a unique and admirable groove while still alternating modes towards the end of the film.",A Cinderella Story

They are both amazing in this as well as the side characters. Hilary Duff gives the best performance when she regains confidence and goes to Chad at the end.

He is far too bland to be Prince Charming. The funniest scenes are with Jennifer Coolidge as Fiona, the wicked stepmother. She has had too many plastic surgeries and botox injections.A lot of the humour is the sort somebody falls into a cake. This use of clichés dilutes the good stuff.My favourite running gag of the movie is an elderly lady on roller skates who has worked at a roller-diner all her life, but still not learned to skate.This is a squeaky clean movie, without a trace of sex or innuendo, peppered with good looking teens.",A Cinderella Story
33,departed07,A Fun Film,7,4 August 2005,"I saw ""Cinderella Story"" on Cinemax and I'll admit that it's a fun film. I'm not a fan of Hilary Duff's past works with the exception of Lizzie McGuire in which in this movie, she plays the role perfectly. Hilary's character is Samantha, a smart student going to high school in which she lost her father during her early childhood and is in the hands of her stepmother (Jennifer Coolidge) and her two wicked sisters; she is also a total loser with her peers as her best friend is a shy geeky kid named Carter (Dan Byrd) who wants to get the girl of his dreams. While Samantha's has dreams of going to Princeton University and getting the man of her dreams, she works at a diner owned by her late father in which is in controlled of her evil step family while the employees (Regina King, Paul Rodriguez) try to help Sam out. She has online chats with a guy name Austin (Chad Michael Murray) who has the same ambition as Samantha's and that is to go to Princeton, but what these two people have in common is that their parents are taking over their lives; Sam's stepmother and her daughters want her to work at the diner forever while Austin's dad wants him to go to USC where after he plays college football and graduates, the dad wants him to take over the car shop. Like Cinderella, the female meets her prince charming at a ball, but wait, this time it's at a Halloween ball and there are no magic slippers this time, but a cell phone in which she has to be back by midnight or else the step family will be furious. Samantha in disguise, finally meets with Austin as they dance and talk to each other and like the story, something interrupts them. If you have read the book, then you will figure how the film ends. To end my review, this was a fun and watchable film to watch, nonetheless, more interesting than ""Raise Your Voice.""",A Cinderella Story
34,christian123,Good but Predictable,5,28 December 2004,"Hilary Duff stars in a modern remake of the popular fairy tale, except her Cinderella is a high school senior dealing with a self-obsessed stepmother ( Jennifer Coolidge) and two wicked stepsisters. When she meets her ""prince charming"" online at a Halloween dance, she has to leave their date in a hurry, leaving him her cell phone as the only clue to her true identity.A Cinderella Story tells the oldest story in the book and it's actually not that bad. Sure, it's unoriginal and lame but there are some original lines and fun characters. Hilary Duff is the star and she gives a good performance. She isn't about to win an Oscar or anything but it was a convincing performance. Chad Michael Murray plays her love interest and he gives an okay performance. There is a problem between Chad and Hilary though, they don't really have chemistry together. If they had more chemistry then the film would have been better but they both play likable characters so it's not all bad. The supporting actors are the real reason why this film works so well. Jennifer Coolidge steals the movie as the botox evil stepmother and she gives a pretty funny performance. Regina King is also pretty good as Rhonda and she offers a decent amount of laughs.Once you get by the good looking, mildly charming cast there isn't much else. Mark Rosman does a terrible job at directing the film, keeping it simple yet very dull. There may be a few original lines here or there but the film is pretty bland. The movie is only 95 minutes long so it's not too much of a pain to watch but it does drag during a few scenes. It is also unrealistic which is kind of surprising because this is a modern update of the story so you would expect it to be a lot more believable. Despite these flaws, the film was still mildly enjoyable and it was pretty harmless as well. It was also a lot better than Chasing Liberty and New York Minute.

We have the usual teen movie characters, and the movie is not funny, sometimes it is painfully unfunny.But it's more about Duff and Murray, and how they look when they smile. Duff is believable in her role, though I still think she should look for better work, and Murray is likable as the popular jock who thinks a little more deeply than his peers.The evil step mother is played by Jennifer Coolidge, who is funny, but not here, or in movies like ""Legally Blonde"". She could be doing better, too. Regina King is wasted, and a young actor plays Duff's best friend, and he has energy, but has to grow into his abilities a bit more.""A Cinderella Story"" is a movie made to keep the careers of Duff, Murray, Coolidge and King up and running (see King at her best in ""Ray"" or ""Jerry Maguire""), and it works.

36,Hunky Stud,Where are the Asians?,5,17 March 2007,"Ever since I watched the film ""Minority report,"" I started to notice about the lack of Asian actors in Hollywood film. So I will try to write comments about films that are lack of Asian actors. As one of my professor quoted me this Chinese saying one time, ""a journey of thousands of kilometers starts with a single step."" Hopefully, more and more people will realize that, and hopefully Hollywood casting directors and directors will begin to hire more Asian actors.I am not saying that every movie should have Asian actors as the protagonists. This film is about a high school in San Fernando Valley in Southern California where there are plenty of Asian students. This film has black and Hispanic actors, however, I did not see a single Asian actor in this movie. It had a costume dancing party, there were over 300 students, but i didn't see a single Asian face. This is just not right. First of all, it did not reflect the reality of the student population in SF valley; second, why they chose not to hire any Asian actors? In the year of 2007, has anyone seen any Asian jocks in any of the Hollywood films? Has Hollywood ever made a film about an Asian male loving a Caucasian female whether in high school or as adults? This is of course a fantasy movie, young people are instilled by those Hollywood fantasy movies as if only white girls can find love such as this movie and the princess diaries, etc. I don't think that I have ever seen a movie about an Asian or black girl becoming a princess and finding love with a prince of anywhere.It didn't make sense no one called Sam's cell phone after she lost it. The guy could easily find out who the owner is checking her phone number, caller ID, etc. There was certainly no need to post the wanted AD on campus, etc. Girls at her age are self-conscious, can they really walk into boy's locker room with so much confidence, and none of the guys was naked?

41,jantoniou,Eminently predictable but fun...,7,1 January 2007,"This movie is full of wild improbabilities, but most Cinderella stories are. For example, the basic premise of all Cinderella movies is that adult (or near-adult) girls for some reason actually put up with the wicked stepmother for some unholy number of years.And yet these Cinderellas are always brilliant (in Duff's case a Princeton-bound uberbrain who finds the time to slave away at the selfsame Stepmom's restaurant, write her stepsister's term papers, and woo a dreamy jock who is concealing his poet-but-didn't-know-it side from his lunkhead pigskin obsessed father and buddies) who can't seem to find some way to circumvent the utter stupidity of both the stepmother and stepsisters - and in this movie boy they're REALLY stupid. Like, oh, I don't know: Leave them in the lurch you friggin' genius! Anyway, wild improbabilities aside, this teenage angst version of the Cinderella story is quite likable. Post-Lizzie pre-heroin-chic Duff carries off her Cindy quite well.Teen 'throb Chad Michael Murray has the emotional range of a bag of nails (actually a bag of nails may have mad skillz over Murray) but he's a natch as the jock playing the clueless Socal surfer dude-cum-Lord Byron.Littered with modernisms such as IMs, texts, and emails, the cell phone now replaces the glass slipper of yore (after all, what idiot would wear glass slippers?!?).Who needs to give away the ending when, after all, this is a Cinderella Story and a Disney movie? This movie is surprisingly fun and funny while being unsurprisingly bad. Aside from the whirlwind that is Jennifer Coolidge, Duff's friend Carter is the best character in the movie. Given the predictability invested in the Cinderella character, Duff out of necessity cannot really be given the meaty part in a mostly bone and gristle type movie.

I think if the film had come out a year earlier, or later, it would've been fine - but there had already been Ella Enchanted with the same storyline in 2005.But to the positives - Hilary Duff is a brilliant actress, and the role fitted her really well. Equally, Chad-Michael Murray is a brilliant actor, and the two had so much on-screen chemistry, it was brilliant to watch. Shame that it was such a weak, overused storyline.",A Cinderella Story
43,Sanou_san,Heartily congenial teen movie,8,3 April 2007,"Cinderella story, what could you tell about it? A wistful story of a girl, abused by her stepmother and sisters. The film was indeed a pleasant threat to anyone, Hilary Duff do match the individuality of becoming a contemporary resemblance of Cinderella, like what mentioned the story is about a girl who lost his father and her life was taken over by her gradually vindictive stepmother (played by Jennifer Coolidge) and worsen by the presence of her stepsisters. The setting of the story was cool, the plot wasn't feeble, the characters are ideal and the adversaries were appropriately chosen as well. Although some younger teen viewers may fail their expectation of some magic scenery the film is just a right blend of wits, drama and romance.I even notice that my sister3 years older than me had have already watched the movie more than 15 timesI was delighted as well with the movie, but not as much as my sister do, to consider sometimes that my sister has a distinctiveness of being a punk style girl",A Cinderella Story

I don't like that sort of lovey-dovey romance types of movies, I prefer action and horror films, like Star Wars (my favorite) and Alien V.S. Predator. Anyway, I liked the humour though, it was pretty funny. I'd say if you're a romance fan, don't watch it! LOL! Just kidding, there's not too much love in this film, but, like high school love. I'd say don't follow the Fabulous review, because Sam is a tomboy(like me) for all of the film, but Shelby Commings is a cheerleader with a really sharp attitude, who used to date Austin Ames and is always trying to take him away from Sam. I think shes a real jerk. But, I'd say, the movie was OKAY.",A Cinderella Story

47,rscampb,This is a classic,1,16 July 2004,"This is a classic disappointment.  There is minimal character development and, even allowing for the fairy tale aspect, wholly implausible plot points, like a popular football player needing to find a girl on the internet. Hilary Duff plays a whining moaning character that is put upon by having to help support her family while she is looking forward to going to one of the most expensive schools in the U.S. The acting only barely kept the movie alive. Jennifer Coolidge, Regina King and Madeline Zima make this movie bearable, but only just.  Hilary Duff's character is more annoying than endearing. This is an easily forgettable character that is poorly played by a mediocre actress. Chad Michael Murray either did not read the script or they offered him a truckload of money to play Austin.Aside from Coolidge, King and Zima the most enjoyable part of this movie was getting to the theatre just as they finished making a fresh batch of popcorn.Rating ---- 0/10.",A Cinderella Story
48,Emphinix,It ain't that bad,6,6 April 2006,"Well, what can I say? I think that this movie wasn't bad even if nobody liked the idea of Murray and Duff as the movie's couple. This is a typical Cinderella story as it's titled in this film.It's not so bad as they say. The movie, may be flawed but it teaches a good lesson such as: If you believe in yourself, you will achieve what you want in this world.Chad Michael Murray plays as the popular Austin Ames a varsity quarterback of high school, while Hilary Duff plays as the loser but sweet Sam Montgomery. I was shocked by this character because she taught everyone that if no one supports you in hard times, you have yourself or your best friend. But the point is that you have to believe in yourself. Because if you don't you have vanity in the end, and you don't believe in nothing, not even yourself.So for this movie. In my opinion this deserves a 6 out of 10",A Cinderella Story

A minute later father dies in an earthquake, than we jump 8 years and see Sam living under the menace of Fiona and the two girls. Then the story gets quite predictable, hidden nice girl becomes beauty hero of the local ball, school handsome prince falls in love with her with the unavoidable happy-end. Actor performance is weak throughout the movie, the story line jumps a few times, dialogues are mostly silly. However the sweet atmosphere of the overall movie is charming for everyone under 14, it is brutality and sex safe, so perfect to watch it with the kids on a Sunday afternoon and this is why it gets 6/10.",A Cinderella Story
50,bth2004,"Contrived, forgettable, boring",5,10 October 2016,"There really is nothing noteworthy or commendable about this movie. The plot is a straight-ahead take on the Cinderella classic; only instead of a dilapidated manor, it's the suburbs, high school, and a diner. The Fiona and stepsister characters are despicable but not in a fun way. Some characters are meant to be hated and you have a good time doing so. Some characters are hated and you just want them off the screen as quickly as possible. This film is overflowing with the latter.Hillary Duff and Chad Murray are boring. I could not care less about anything Duff said, and I could not care less about Murray in any sense.The story points are all contrived and unoriginal.The only character that approaches likability is Rhonda. She's nice and supportive of Sam and all; we'll keep her. Paul Rodriguez is wasted on this movie. Overall, just a boring waste of time. Total fluff. If you want a Cinderella-type story, go watch the classic Disney animation and get the real thing. This is a sorry knock-off.",A Cinderella Story

What makes it an average teen flick is the normal slut pack, the crude jocks, and the famous jock falling for the unpopular girl. The reason that it's not is the surprise great characters that pop up, especially Regina King's role, and Jennifer ""Stifler's Mom"" Coolidge. The plot is just like the fairy tale except for some minor glitz. Hilary Duff is actually great for role that we seen her play in ever movie & T.V. show. Chad Michael Murray is actually one of my favorite up & coming actors. Watching him chew bubble gum is cool I bet. Regina King is the highlight of the film. Putting a whole new twist on fairy-godmother with attitude. And if that's not enough, they have Stifler's Mom, Stifler's Mom. That's says it all!!!!",A Cinderella Story
52,pedrosmgfan,"This time Cinderella doesn't lose her shoe,she loses her mobile phone",7,22 June 2006,"""A Cinderella Story"" turns out to be an entertainment, attractive and funny revision of the famous fairy tale. This modern adaptation is carried out by the young Hilary Duff, who is normally acting in these types of roles for teen comedies. The truth: she does not do a good job, because in fact I prefer to see her singing that acting. The rest of the distribution completes Jennifer Coolidge, Chad Michael Murray and Regina King.This film tells the history of Sam, an teenager who every day is exploited by his evil stepmother Fiona and his two twin daughters. But soon everything changes when she meets in a chat her prince, who is the most popular boy in the institute, Austin Ames. ""A Cinderella Story"" is good, funny and a perfect romantic comedy, but simultaneously it's predictable, all the story you know very well.

53,aleusong,fortunately for this film...I've seen worse,5,8 June 2005,"A Cinderella Story turned out to be exactly how I envisioned it in my mind mentally. It would be a waste to pay $5 to see a movie that tells itself. You'd think that it should be getting really really low marks for being cheesy, stereotypical, and clichéd (some of which seem off the wall). But then there are other tween targeted films like this one and when I saw those films I pretty much flipped. I'm talking about films like ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen"" ""Raise Your Voice"" and ""Sleepover"".Parents, please take my advice: if you are gonna show your daughters at least one badly written and overly clichéd teen film where the underdog girl gets her man...by all means make it this one. Yes I mean it. Despite how stupid this film may seem, it is the only one that stands out from the other teen films...mainly in the heroine. Sam is honest and brave and nothing like the other girls in those other films. You actually feel sorry for Sam when she is ridiculed by others (becuase YOU KNOW she didn't deserve it unlike the other teen flick heroines).And of course every character you expect to see in a teen flick makes an appearance here. There are actually more snobby rich-bitch characters in this film compared to the others, but other than that you can expect every character and even ""cliche moments by characters in a teen flick"" to be found. If you have seen other teen flicks you would spot these moments right away. I did enjoy that one really nerdy character (Terry?). Although, I wished he had more of an actual part in the actual story (but then again it's normal to see half of a cast in a teen movie to have no actual part in the story. They're just there to represent their stereotype.) Oh yeah RNMorton does make a good point: If a teen flick is set in California, this kind of cruelty towards others is bound to flourish.And you know sometimes is good to see a badly clichéd film and make fun of it. A Cinderella Story is perfect for that too. Drinking game, anybody? ;)",A Cinderella Story
54,thiu,pathetic,2,22 August 2004,"*spoilers*i can't believe this movie was actually made. this movie did not need a script. there's no plot or anything resembling a story. this film depended on duff's star power to attract audiences with her again lizzie-like character but failed. Why? because this film was useless and stupid. i mean chad why don't you call the people on sam's cell phone to know who she is? and sam, you're cell phone is missing and you don't even care.and suddenly they fell in love. right? when did that happen? through the e-mails? you really can't believe by the way they're both acting that they're in love. their dilemma is just who's the mystery girl(which is so obvious) and how do i tell him? there's nothing there to indicate that they actually care for each other. the sisters here try to be the comic relief but instead you feel sorry for them as actresses because they actually sank this low to look stupid without any reason. both chad and hilary act minimally here since that is what's needed. no one shines through here. it's just a waste of time to watch. btw, hilary here is very thin.",A Cinderella Story
55,stephen_thanabalan_fans,Does something meaningful for Teens the world over...,7,13 November 2005,"Disney clichés, predictable plot tales, cutesy stylistics surrounding prince charmings and closet babe sweetie pies aside, this movie works because it does do something meaningful for teens the world over. Though laced with all the candy-stand gimmicks and necessarily inevitable teenybopper trappings (it needed it in order to keep its target audience satisfied), the film did carry some actual weight behind it in terms of a message. No doubt the underdog and silently suffering element was intrinsic to it being a fairytale called quite literally- A 'Cinderella' Story, but, it could have easily been taken on and scripted/directed in a much more shallow way. The part where Hilary Duff's character does not get rescued per se (e.g. if they had gotten the leading male to run after her in the Pep Rally humiliation scene), and where she runs away emotionally attacked, was a crucially good move. That the plot delved into a period of emotional anguish that any teenager (un-gender biased too in a way) can relate to even if it was not at the level of pain that the character was going through enhanced the credibility in the film and upped its anti-cheesiness factor by a quotient. It got better too as the point where Duff's character fights back and then realizes she needs to believe in herself (especially after reading a great nostalgic slogan placed by ex-Top Gun fly-boy Whip Hubley's character) was also edited and backed by a good teenage angst filled soundtrack to a level of uplifting emotion. The best part though was when the character showed women's strength (even Germaine Greer would have liked this one) and that she could instead be bigger than the sphere of her emotional anguish and despair filled hole, and believe in herself for one, but more importantly, in turn, 'rescue' the male lead with a gripping truth be told face to face reality speech in the (ironically) male testosterone charged hellhole of a locker room (as compared to her shy/demure character) was a gem of a move script-wise for first time writer Leigh (forgot her surname).Furthermore, this movie, as compared to a lot of its genre counterparts and contemporaries, will do loads more positives in terms of affirmation, identity awareness, eradication of stereotypical behavior as well as superficiality than a lot of lonely, self-discovering teens who might otherwise write this genre and hence, entire movie off, realize. In fact, without going so far as to suggest that this is the very epitome of all the movie seeks to upend - superficiality, I would say that it does surprise in this respect of depth with its themes of enhancing the importance of true elements of friendship (e.g Duff and Byrd's relationship), appreciation of one's parents and the motivation that love can bring, as well as the main theme of stardust romantic love being more than just physical attraction but a real emotional connection. The fact that this movie (on top of being aided with a well cast main pairing that share a strong on screen chemistry in Duff and C.Michael Murray-put aside the teen queen business minded Olsen-twins like innuendoes associated with Hilary Duff for the moment- she really is quite talented given she did the soundtrack too) and one will notice the movie's pacing is also strong (it gets straight into the characters and the elusive Cinderella 'ball') and this in turn ensures the plot moves over any irrationalities and plot gaps and the possibility of 100% predictability, all this whilst the message of challenging someone to look out of the box of their set expectations; despair; loneliness and to keep their dreams alive and to be bold still remains, holding strong focus. It's not often, in fact, very rarely, that you get to say a movie labeled as 'romantic comedy teen chick flick' gets to tie all these elements. I believe it does challenge teenagers to think, and to remember it's not over until they're struck out. Cinderella already is a beautiful story, add that element of fighting for what you believe and yourself in, and it really is powerfully moving too, and can be made very relevant and real to each teen out there; and ironically, far from a fairytale dream they can't achieve.I give it: 6/10",A Cinderella Story

62,edblask04,Good for teenage and younger girls,5,21 July 2004,This movie seemed good for teenage and younger girls. It has a wholesome overall message to it but is not so full of stereotypes as to bore some of the more demanding teens and tweens and younger kids. There are a few funny scenes in the movie and the acting is OK for the age and level of training for the lead actress and actor. It is a good addition to the growing video library of movies by Hilary Duff. It seems to address the concerns of its target audience quite well and plays to them. Probably would not be all that fun for 15 or older male teens but certainly appeals to 15 and younger girls. Some of the jokes were quite stale and seem like something you would see in any Fox or other prime time sitcom but the hits in the joke area seemed to out number the misses,A Cinderella Story

You are probably assuming I'm going to start slamming A Cinderella Story. Well, you assumed wrong.I love movies like this, not only because they are clean enough for me to enjoy with my mom or little sister, but also because they are fun, sweet, and the ultimate cheerer-upper. A Cinderella Story is based off your cliché...well, Cinderella story! Except for its modern day setting in the San Fernando Valley of California.Sam (Hilary Duff) spends her days cleaning floors and serving food while rollerskating around her dad's old diner, which has been fixed up into a pink paradise by his wife, Sam's stepmother, whom he married not long before his death during an earthquake. Sam was left fatherless at a very young age, and then condemned to living with her affluent, Botox-addict stepmother Fiona (Jennifer Coolidge) and her evil, twin stepsisters Brianna (Madeline Zima) and Gabriella (Andrea Avery).Years later, we see Sam again. She blends into existence, just an invisible, forgettable senior girl at North Valley High School. Her only allies are her best friend Carter (Dan Byrd) and her mysterious Internet lover Nomad, who she talks to late into the night about her deepest thoughts and feelings, despite the fact that she doesn't even know his true identity.They agree to meet up at the Halloween homecoming dance at school, and reveal themselves to each other. Sam is somewhat disappointed to learn that Nomad, who has always made himself out to be the romantic poet type, is Austin Ames (Chad Michael Murray), the most popular guy in school and the star quarterback. They have a magical evening under the stars, yet Austin never learns who his Cinderella girl is; he still knows her by her IM name, Princetongirl818.If you've seen the original Cinderella, you can figure the ending. But this wonderful, humorous take on the classic scenario brings you to love it so much more. (Though nothing will ever QUITE live up to our favored 1950 Cinderella cartoon version.) Twists and turns towards the ending scene leave you questioning what will happen, but not on the edge of your seat by any means, and you'll be rooting for Sam as she comes out of her shell. I recommend this movie 100%. Give it a chance. We see Hilary Duff in some of her last glory days (A.K.A. still in her Lizzie McGuire phase and not about 90 pounds), plus her and CMM have great chemistry. :)",A Cinderella Story

Chad Michael Murray was the perfect choice for Austin Aimes as he well fit and he looks like he has a sensitive side so this helped me to believe there was another side to him in the film... I have watched this film so many times and in the first day of having it i must have watched it about 3 times... I love this film sooo much and Sam(Hilary duff) and Austin(chad Michael Murray) made the perfect on screen couple as there was great chemistry..

70,pranayet_writer,this movie's the best,10,16 April 2005,"may be minor SPOILERS ahead : this is the best movie i've ever seen. in fact, it's so good that i had to wait for three days before i could comment on it a little more impartially. sam (played enchantingly by hilary duff) was the happiest girl in the world, living with her father in an L.A suburb, but then not only did her father get married to a stepmother from hell but he died in an earthquake. years down the line, she's scrubbing in a diner whose workers are her only family, and she's suffering torment from not just her stepfolks (her wannabe-popular stepsisters follow mom's lead) but also the kids at school, who pick on her and her best friend because they're both complete nerds. but sam's one refuge is her anonymous e-mail buddy, who's completely in love with her and dreams about going to princeton like she does. but when they meet at the homecoming dance (sam is dressed as Cinderella) he turns out to be the most popular guy in school. i totally started crying when the kids at school picked on sam and then i was practically bathed in tears at the end, when the popular guy kisses her in the football stands. (any teenage girls out there??? have you SEEN a guy hotter than chad michael murray???) a must-see movie for kids who dream of fulfilling their dreams. a beautiful movie that speaks up for being yourself and making your dreams come true. watch it - you'll miss something if you don't!",A Cinderella Story

Most movies these days are made purely for entertainment and often have a lot of junk in them (course language, nudity, etc), but A Cinderella Story taught me something valuable: to believe in myself and be who I really am, and not who others want me to be. I have taken this to heart and I hope it reflects in my actions in the many years I have ahead of me. I'm going to start being myself. I hope and pray that I will soon get a girlfriend who will accept me as I am (and maybe be as beautiful as Hilary Duff. Lol). I also hope that I will do the same whenever I meet new people.

There wasn't much to watch over the Thanksgiving Holiday. So for me it was boring. But I do have to say the the guy Chad Michael Murry was pretty good and in time may become a good actor.

77,lauriesavage8,"The best chick flick I've ever watched, ever",10,1 June 2006,"I really was surprised by how enjoyable this movie was. It is based on the Disney story of Cinderella but in modern times in a high school with Hilary Duff and Chad Michael Murray. She is 'diner girl', as the harsh popular girls at school call her, and he is head of the football team. Hilary lives with her evil and selfish stepmom and her two daughters who are always wanting to cause trouble for Hilary. During the film we learn of an internet romance between Princestongirl(hilary) and nomad(chad). They text each other and talk online for hours on end, then Chad asks princestongirl if she will meet him in the middle of the dancefloor at a certain time, she goes without her stepmother knowing and she dresses up like Cinderella and he like prince charming. They dance, the kiss but he doesn't know who she is because she wore a mask over her face and she had to go back to the diner to work before her wicked stepmother notices shes not there. She has to leave him. The film continues as the secret gets out to the cheerleaders the story of princestongirl and nomad and they perform a skit in celebration of the upcoming football championship. They make it blatantly obvious who these two characters are and the whole school laugh in hilary's face. In then end everything works out. Hilary finds the will her dead father left her and the house and everything in it becomes hers and she makes her stepmother and her daughters scrub the floors at the diner that she also now owns. Hilary and Chad go to the same college together and live happily ever after...The End.",A Cinderella Story
78,delly-4,Awesome!,10,23 November 2006,"This movie had the bright feel of a teen romance movie. Hilary Duff & Chad Michael Murray are a great pair! I was overly impressed with Jennifer Coolidge,playing the Stepmother. Regina King & Dan Byrd also had great supporting performances. This would definitely have to be the best Hilary Duff film to date. If you are a teenager stuck at home, then pop down to your Video/DVD rental shop to rent this beauty of a film. I strongly recommend to Hilary Duff fans,and even people who aren't keen on her! This sure is a great film,no matter which way anybody puts it. The movie is so good, I watched it twice in one day! This is definitely a film on my Top 10 list.",A Cinderella Story

My guy friend bought me the ticket to get in and the ticket taker LAUGHED at him and she had good reason. Hilary Duff was absolutely horrible and she makes the same facial expressions in everything she acts in. Chad Michael Murray couldn't even carry the movie, although his acting was a LITTLE better than Duff's. When it was supposed to be serious, I laughed, and when it was supposed to be funny, I stared. I can't believe this even made it to theaters. ""Waiting for you is like waiting for rain in a drought"" OH MY GOD! I would not recommend this movie AT ALL!",A Cinderella Story
80,sportsman2031,Perfect romantic comedy,8,2 March 2005,"I thought this movie was a funny and a romantic chick flick. Hilary Duff is one of my favorite actresses and she plays a perfect Sam in this movie. This movie is pretty predictable but still fun to watch. If your bored one day go to the video store and check this movie out. It is very interesting to watch from beginning to end. Chad Micheal Murray is a great Austin for this movie and has what it takes.I never get sick of watching this movie.Every character in this movie was the right pick.I'm so glad Hilary played Sam instead of somebody else.If you are not interested in this movie, at least give it a chance! From a scale 1-10 i give this movie a 8. Two thumbs up!",A Cinderella Story

(as in a movie you can watch over and over and never get sick of)  Well I just did! This is the BEST modern adaptation of modern the Cinderella Story to date. Dan Byrd, Jennifer Coolidge, as well as Regina King make this movie! Duff and Tatum are great front runners, but the supporting characters pack all the punch! Let's not forget the Big Bang Theory's Howard aka Simon Helberg before he was famous. A great comic relief!",A Cinderella Story
82,hockey-girl228,Totally predictable,5,20 February 2006,"This movie is predictable and has the same tone that my brother sometimes adopts when bored. Now that doesn't mean that i didn't like it, in fact this movie is the one to watch when you really don't want to think about what you're watching. That's what i always do. A Cinderella Story is safe to watch if your not interested in the storyline, because, honestly, it doesn't take rocket science to figure out whats going to happen. The Cinderella part in the title is kind of a give away. The acting is pretty average if you ask me. I am a fan of Hilary Duff and i have never thought that she was an exceptional actress, but having said that i do think that she is refreshing, in a way that she brings reality to the character. I have always thought that she manages to make her characters real, in some aspects anyway. I do think that she did pretty well with this character though. Chad Michael Murray is pretty ordinary in this film, a forgettable performance. Regina King was good in this although i think that it's another forgettable performance. Jennifer Coolidge brought most of the humor into this film, although Hilary did have a funny line in the movie. I must mention Hilary Duff's dress, it was GORGEOUS. I have never been interested in dresses but it had fairytale written all over it. Mask, twenty-first century, mask, twenty-first century. That doesn't work, especially if she goes to your school. What about the voice and the hair colour? I mean you can't see her and than not know who she is, that is the major flaw with this film. Apart from that, i think that A Cinderella Story is a movie that you could fall asleep through and wake up at the end and still know what's going on. That is how predictable it is.",A Cinderella Story
83,shesanopenbook,"Seen with an open mind, this can be an enjoyable film for the whole family.",6,14 July 2004,"Once upon a time there was a girl that Disney made a superstar. She was given the keys to the kingdom And a record deal, a TV show, a movie or two and a clothing line. She had it all long before she ever got her driver's license. Her name was Hilary Duff and she is now playing a revamped Cinderella in her new film, aptly titled, A Cinderella Story.High school senior, Samantha Montgomery (Duff, Cheaper by the Dozen and TVs Lizzie McGuire), is a good girl whose father dies when she was very young. Since he left no will, Sam must live at the beck and call of her wicked step-mother, Fiona (Jennifer Coolidge, American Pie), and step-sisters, Brianna (Madeline Zima, TVs The Nanny) and Gabriella (Andrea Avery, Soul to Take ). Sam's life consists of studying day and night, running errands for her step-family and working at Fiona's diner which, because of Fiona's obsession with the 'salmon diet,' serves a sushi and doughnut meal among other disgusting delicacies. The only sunshine in her busy life is the thought of going to Princeton and her friends; Carter (Dan Byrd, Firestarter 2: Rekindled ), a geeky aspiring actor, and Rhonda (Regina King, Daddy Day Care ), a sassy waitress at the diner. Life gets a bit more bearable when she meets and falls for a guy on the internet that goes to her school. When the mystery boy asks to meet her at the Halloween dance, life gets complicated again.When Fiona insists that Sam work at the diner on the night of the dance, Rhonda plays the role of her fairy godmother, getting her a dress and covering for her while she's away. At the dance, Sam comes face to face with her secret admirer, a super-popular football player, Austin (Chad Michael Murray, TV's One Tree Hill). Just when things are about to work out for the two star-crossed lovers, the clock creeps near midnight and Sam must leave or be busted by Fiona. Leaving behind the her soul mate and her cell phone, Sam heads back to reality, resolving to leave well enough alone and never reveal her identity to Austin. But, Austin is a pretty persistent guy and will stop at nothing to find his Cinderella.A Cinderella Story is directed by Mark Rosman, best known for the TV movie Life-Size. The soundtrack includes songs by Jimmy Eat World, Mya, MxPx and (who else) Hilary Duff. The film is rated PG for some mild language and innuendo and will open in theaters everywhere on Friday.A Cinderella Story, while dripping with saccharine at times, is actually a pretty decent rendition of the original. Duff and Murray worked well together, though their characters are not much different from the ones they play on their TV shows. The wicked trio's slap-stick comic relief will get a few laughs, mostly from the younger audience. The best thing about this film, though, was not the acting, but the story. The modern twist on the classic truly worked and it really is as original as a well-known fairy tale can be. This film is best watched with no expectations. If you go in thinking you're about to see the best romantic comedy of the year, you will leave disappointed. But, seen with an open mind, this can be an enjoyable film for the whole family.",A Cinderella Story
84,LFotF,Fantastic retelling!,10,21 December 2004,"Hilary Duff, Jennifer Coolidge, and Chad Michael Murray lead a stellar cast in this outstanding update of the classic tale. Great performances all around! Despite a few corny moments, the film does a great job of being genuinely funny. Chad does a good job, even better than in Freaky Friday! Jennifer's kooky humor adds to the merriment as do the excellent supporting roles by Dan Byrd and Regina King.Hilary is fantastic. She steals every scene! A truly remarkable, and talented young lady! The soundtrack is absolutely amazing! Including Hilary's fantastic renderings of Crash World, The Girl Can Rock, Now You Know, and Anywhere But Here; Haylie Duff's One In This World; and the smash hit Our Lips Are Sealed by Hilary Duff and Haylie Duff.A great movie for any age group. Absolutely hilarious!",A Cinderella Story
85,mysterygirl609,My all time favorite movie,10,21 December 2006,"No other movie can compare to this one. The acting is great and you can tell that the cast has great chemistry. Hilary Duff (Sam) did an amazing job at her part. She made me feel what her character was feeling, and when one can do that, one has talent. Parents, you don't have to worry at all about letting your kids see this. Everyone will love it because it's impossible not to. A Cinderella Story is a fun movie and a great version of the classic film Cinderella. It made me laugh and cry and even though I've watched so many times that I can quote it backwards and forwards, I'll never tire of it. It's my favorite movie of all times, and I know that once you watch it A Cinderella Story will be one of yours too.",A Cinderella Story
86,KaileyLady,"New Twist On ""Cinderella""",10,5 October 2011,"I didn't expect to like this film, but whenever it's on television, I'll watch it. It has most of the elements in the original tale, but Sam (Cinderella) actually has a brain and personality. I'm an English major and have experience in analyzing Children's Lit, so this intrigued me.The original portrays Cinderella as a naive slave who attracts a rich guy and in the end gets her dream guy by being a stereotypical submissive female. In this version, however, Sam and Austin (the prince) both have similar goals which actually involve going against society's expectations of them. Austin is supposed to play the role of the sporty son of a business man, but his wish is to go to college and embrace his natural talent for writing. Meanwhile, Sam is supposed to have an unending life of servitude to her step-mother, but ends up getting into college (the same one as Austin).One could interpret the college as the palace, but Sam is not permanently tied to Austin, as she ends the movie expressing that she's still young; therefore, this version could also be seen as feminist compared to its original. This story allows the Cinderella character to have her cake and eat it too.",A Cinderella Story
87,katiebug6143,grasping at straws...,1,14 July 2004,"Did we really need one more ""cinderella type"" story this decade? Between ""Chasing Liberty"", "" The PRince and Me"", and ""The Princess Diaries"" I believe that we may have that genre sufficiently covered. Like the rash of teenybopper horror movies from the late 1990's , this movie continues to beat the dead horse of an increasingly younger and more immature teen scene flick epidemic. Aside from all that, this has to be the least oscarworthy screen jaunt that I have even encountered. Hilary Duff has managed to play Lizzie Mc Guire in every movie she has been in. Her over the top valley girlesque persona is, at best, flat and lifeless. Chad Michael Murray, as cute as the boy is, has stooped to new lows. It is obvious that he is far too old for the movie, plus this is a complete departure of anything that Murray is qualified to play. The football player is a stretch for someone who is so in tune with his bad boy image. Overall, I would not recommend this movie for anyone over the age of ten. Ignorance comes with youth, and in this case ignorance to decent movie making is,without a doubt, bliss.",A Cinderella Story

This is one of the best romantic films I've ever seen. Great cast, great story, great directing ! I can only recommend it - go and see it !

Hilary Duff acted true and beautiful throughout the whole movie which makes her Cinderella. This movie was also really creative in the way where it focused on more than one conflict which improved the status of the movie. Another thing that impressed my and the audience was the cast of the movie. The cast did a GREAT job and I'm pretty sure that they really enjoyed making this production. As for someone who is confused to see this movie, I would advise them to gather their family, get some popcorn, buy a drink, get some yummy gummy candies, and go watch this wonderful family movie.",A Cinderella Story
90,tartysheep,a bit iffy,7,12 January 2005,"OK so i saw this movie a while ago and thought it was quite good but what was with the whole earthquake thing- that was weird and the thing with the fairy tale book near the end. Also if she was so neglected all the time and stuff how come she had a really new mobile phone a computer in her bedroom(!!!) perfectly straightened and coloured hair everyday (her hair colour really doesn't look natural) and her own car. That is so not the correct Cinderella image. And did anyone else care about the whole none existent glass slipper!! that was a great disappointment, the glass slipper is Cinderella's trademark, it's like Red Riding hood without the hood- Buffy with out a stake. It just doesn't happen. And if anyone has seen Charmed the episode ""Happily ever after"" they will see that the creators managed to make Phoebe loose her glass slipper- so why couldn't Sam loose hers? Though Chad Michael Murray's appearance as Prince Charming did bring the movie up a bit. The film is worth watching because all does end happily ever after.",A Cinderella Story
91,tkn2005lp,Predictable and Boring,2,28 February 2005,"This is your ordinary Hilary Duff movie. Overwhelmed with innocent, cutesy-cutesy, girlie-ness. The plot is simple. Sam (Hilary Duff) is miserable. Her father died in an earthquake when she was little (wow! real creative!) Her stepmothers and stepsisters make her work. She falls in love with a football jock, Austin Ames (Chad Michael Murray) by instant messaging, and he doesn't know it's her. They meet at the school dance, and she has to leave by the stroke of midnight so her stepmother won't find out that she wasn't working at the diner...then she drops her cell phone on her way (which is a replacement for a glass slipper...cute), and Austin tries to find her, and blah blah blah, you know the story.That's just how the whole story went. SO unbelievably, disgustingly predictable. Of course, the beautiful blonde Miss Hilary Duff HAS to go out with the handsome blonde Chad Michael Murray. It's meant to be. And then there are the ""popular"" crew...the guys are all big dumb jerks, and the girls are all beautiful, snobby, bitches. And then Austin Ames, who's supposed to be the MOST popular guy in the whole school, is this totally nice, down to earth guy. Of course, it's always the popular people who are so mean and evil. Every cheap tween movie has that. And it's weird, really, any bozo can see that Sam is just as beautiful as those girls in the popular crowd. And with a likable personality. Maybe they could've made it a great movie, by casting an ugly, weird girl as the part of Sam. That would've made it at least realistic. The stepmother and stepsisters are overly done. No one like those people exist. Especially the evil stepsisters. Seriously, fans, I ask you, are there people who really act like that? Come on, they're just there to make Hilary Duff look good.The reason why I gave this movie a 2 (pretty generous of me, huh?) is because, I guess for Hilary Duff's fans, and some little girls under 10, it is an enjoyable movie. Normal, cute, predictable, plot with a normal, cute, predictable ending, I guess. If you're looking for that kind of movie, then Hilary Duff would be a good Sam. She's normal, cute, and predictable. Maybe not with the best acting, but not embarrassing either. She recorded some songs on the Soundtrack, and anyone can see she's no singer (if I hear that helium whiny voice again, I'm seriously gonna snap), but she's likable, because in every movie, she plays the good part. The innocent part. But if you ask me, it was a cheap, boring, tween movie, that made me laugh SO much (though not intentionally) with all the worn-out stereotypes.",A Cinderella Story
92,dramaqueen4968-1,Great Great Movie for kids and adults!,10,29 May 2005,"A Cinderella Story is a great feel good movie that is not just for girls aged 8-16. This movie is almost stereotypical as a nothing teen flick, but by all means its the best Cinderella adaptation I have seen in quite some time. Using more modern things, such as a cellphone instead of a shoe and a convertable instead of a chariot, it makes it much easier to relate too. Cast does very well holding up the movie. Hilary Duff is like-able to kids and adults alike, as Chad Michael Murray will have kids and adults crushing on him. Big Time. Regina King does a great job as the Fairy Godmother type and Dan Byrd is a great comedic energy on the screen. Jennifer Coolidge, Andrea Avery and Madeline Zima do amazing as the villains and add some great comedy to the script! All in All, this movie was very good and all the characters had great chemistry.

94,marylandflower,Recommend this movie,10,24 September 2017,"A Cinderella Story is an excellent film. It has excellent casting such as Hilary Duff as Sam Montgomery, Chad Michael Murray as Austin Ames, and Jennifer Coolidge as Fiona Montgomery. The way they tell the Cinderella story is very close to how modern age teenagers deal with things like love. Some of the ways they portray the Cinderella elements are not like love. Most of the love stuff like them chatting online is how teenagers flirt and or talk to each other. The loss of the father takes a bigger toll on this new Cinderella then the old animated Disney one. The stepmother is a little more wicked and vindictive in this version of the Cinderella story then in the original animated one. She makes her work at the diner long hours, tells her how ugly and not talented she is. She puts all of the wonderful things on her daughters. At the end Sam gets fed up with Austin and goes into the locker room before the big game to tell him off. She had enough people let her down she was not going to let him be one of them. Then having just stood up to both him and the stepmother Fiona, she wants to go home and just forget about everything that happened. But then Austin runs off the field and right as the kiss rains falls signaling the end of the drought. Because she said ""Waiting for you is like waiting for rain in the drought useless and disappointing"". I like how in the diner scene Sam sees the words on the wall when the guitar falls (They had been teasing it was going to fall during the whole movie, whenever the door closed they would show it shaking). ""Never let the fear of striking our keep you from playing the game"" and am reminded that she should not be afraid to stand up to her, because she won't take it anymore. Definitely recommend making this a must see.",A Cinderella Story

Teen dramas with the simple plot Boy meets girl, boy loosed girl, boy gets girl back - with a bunch of weird persons on the side! The mean High School girls, the geek, and the the wonderful friends surrounding the main-character. This movie is a typical teen movie, and nothing more. Hillary Duff is not a good actor, at least I don't think so.And what is up with her singing? Four songs on the soundtrack?Chad Michael Murray is great (and cute) and therefore it ends with a total of 4 stars.",A Cinderella Story
96,lunam217,I was not expecting this,6,26 February 2007,"I was almost obligated to see this film - you see, my best friend loves Hilary Duff and romantic comedies, so I couldn't escape. I don't like romantic comedies, because the end is almost always the same (a happy ending with lots of kisses and a stupid lesson to learn, like ""follow your heart"" or ""love comes when we less expect it""). I don't like Hilary Duff very much either, because she only acts in romantic comedies (sorry if I'm wrong), so I can't see if she is a good actress or not. I was expecting that kind of film - it has that type of end indeed -, but I liked it A LOT. Yes, it was like an ordinary romantic comedy, but I had a good time. I think that's because every girl wants to be Cinderella (or, in this case, Sam), and have an happy ending like that. The way the romance develops is very fun - Hilary Duff acts like herself - no different from the other movies she did; Chad Michael Murray is a good Austin, very sexy and sweet. The perfect couple, prince and princess. I really liked a lot.",A Cinderella Story
97,ebayandersen,"Predictable, formulaic, but not a total loss",6,20 August 2004,"This is the type of film which, from having seen the trailer, you can pretty much guess the entire story and all the characters. Okay, let's get the bad stuff out of the way (of which there is sadly quite a lot): the story is formulaic and predictable (which is I guess, unavoidable, seeing as it's a modern day version of a well-known fairy tale) the secondary characters are unfunny stereotypes and clichés - like the eccentric best friend who is trying to a more interesting version of Gordo from Lizzie McGuire, and failing, or the airhead egotistical cheerleaders (if you want a good movie about ""the popular girls are evil"", go see the excellent Mean Girls.)However, you must remember, this is not a movie aimed at 18-year-old guys like me; this is intended for kids and teenage girls. For them, the cheap jokes and the annoying slapstick will probably work. I admit I only went to see the film because of the angel that is Hilary Duff, and it is purely because of her and her lead male Chad Michael Murray, that I am giving this film the generous mark that I have. Their on-screen chemistry, their individual charm, decent acting talents, and incredible attractiveness save this film. They even take some appallingly saccharine lines ""You must believe in yourself blah blah blah"" and make them non-cringe worthy, which is a feat in itself. It makes you wonder what they could do with good material.The two major plot holes are: no way would someone as beautiful as Hilary Duff not be accepted amongst the ""popular group"" in any school in the world, ever. Even if she is the smart kid. Plot Hole Two: what kind of recognise a girl having seen her whole face except her eyes? That's a biggie - try your best to overlook it.Their performances carry this film, which goes with a tried and tested formula, which they use because it works for this type of film. If you are realistic about what type of film this is, and adjust your expectations accordingly, chances are you enjoy it all the more for it. Not great, but not terrible.

The critics are just saying that its bad because its not completely realistic but if it was realistic then it would be boring and not at all what A Cinderella Story should be. People buy the tickets so that they can escape from real life for a while and enjoy a movie.This movie starts when Sam is little and she grows up and there is an evil stepmother Fiona,Jennifer Coolidge(she is hysterical!). Hilary plays an unpopular teen in this movie and she meets a guy on the internet and meets him at the halloween dance. Then she has to leave at midnight,he looks for her for a while and there's some really great qualities to this movie. I am 13 and I am a guy and i watched it with my dad.

This movie should only be seen by girls that are 13 and under. The evil stepmother was the only funny person in this film because of her pure evilness and bias toward her other daughters. Hilary Duff does not have much acting talent, but that is okay as this is really a children's film. Duff is still young and hopefully soon her acting skills will develop. Chad Michael Murray was emotionless throughout the entire movie and acting robotic at times - making the same expression on his face throughout the entire movie.

In the new tradition of films like ""Clueless,"" ""10 Things I Hate About You"" and ""She's All That,"" ""A Cinderella Story"" is a fun, teeny-bopper retelling of a story we all know so well. Hilary Duff is charming, though at times a little too Lizzie McGuire, and it is a little hard to buy her as a plain Jane girl nobody notices. Even so, the chemistry between Duff and her beyond adorable ""prince"" Chad Michael Murray is thoroughly believable. And the film has the benefit of the comedic stylings of Jennifer Coolidge (as the stepmom, Fiona) and Regina King, who plays the ""fairy godmother"" role with some serious attitude. The film's got hints of ""You've Got Mail"" and some modern twists, and, of course sports the standard teeny-bopper flick message: Learn to be yourself. Despite the clichés, though, it's fun from start to finish and Duff's usual following will thoroughly enjoy it.",A Cinderella Story

A modern day Cinderella story, It will keep you smiling, and send your heart soaring all the way to the end. Don't let the critics,or mindless bozos with their special order coffees in one hand and their modern day philosophy in the other tell you what to like, or what to watch.

102,hallam-953-739700,Get me some salmon stat,10,18 May 2014,"This movie left a fishy taste in my mouth. A fishy taste of joy, because I was salivating from the moment Hilary Duff's pubescent face graced the screen. Hilary's best friend is a quirky dork who can't drive. I found him deeply arousing throughout and his impression of Zorro left me in a writhing state of ecstasy. He can point his sword at me any day. Onto the plot, which made little to no sense. There were frequent references to an unknown place called Norwegia which may hold potential for my next overseas holiday. It seems to be home to a large quantity of Atlantic Salmon, which appeals to my insatiable appetite for fishy flavours. Hilary Duff-induced or otherwise.Apparently putting a small piece of fabric over your eyes is enough to serve as a foolproof disguise. Hilary Duff was unrecognisable after donning her white eye-mask, with her grating voice, flowing blonde tresses and caked-on makeup holding no clue as to her true, sordid identity. Not even a hint! She was completely transformed.Jennifer Coolidge was a revelation as the botoxed step-mother. Her breast implants were like small planets to which I gladly orbited. I have since become an air-borne satellite, rising each evening to salute these silicon-filled beacons of hope. Even now I feel my frail body being sucked in by their gravitational pull. I succumb willingly.The two step sisters' synchronised swimming routine brought me considerable joy. The enormous fart Gracie unleashes upon the swimming pool - spewed forth from her so- called ""spastic colon"" - stood out as a particular highlight of comic perfection.In conclusion, wear a mask and engage in a sordid online relationship and you'll end up with a prince charming read: sexual predator to call your own.",A Cinderella Story

It contains everything that could possibly needed to make it a perfect, yet typically simple chick flick! I don't know any girls who have watched it and haven't loved it, I say give it a chance and let yourself fall away into the romance.

105,supersarah149,The cutest film ever,10,27 December 2005,"From reading other peoples comments on this film, in all honesty i must say i am very disappointed. In my opinion A Cinderella Story is a fabulous film. The setting is really good, and be transferring it to a modern setting, it made the original story even better. Hilary Duff as Sam 'Cinderella' was brilliant but the only problem was that Hilary is very pretty so how could none of the guys at school except that freaky drama guy never have noticed her before?

It made all the girls watching jealous of Hilary when she got her kiss. Chad and Hilary were the perfect couple, as the boys would fantasise about Hilary and the girls about Chad.

106,escape_from_hellview,Hard-done-by Cinderella finds a prince,5,16 August 2005,"This film would be entertaining for little children because its like a fairytale i guess. Although anyone above 13 must be warned. The film was a big disappointment. Firstly Sam(Hilary duff) acts as if shes so hard-done-by. She has a mobile (cell phone) a car, her own room, a computer and a job. A lot of young people would actually be glad to have these things. Yes, OK she has to do her step-moms, bidding and wait on her but she acts like shes so hard done by. The character was badly written. ALso the whole Austin/Sam thing made me cringe, don't really have a reason but it was all just SO soppy for young kids. Also the audience is required to think that our 'cinderella' and her 'prince' would find true love and frolic in the hills. However any teenager would know that this would never happen therefore making the love plot pointless. Highlights of the film were Jennifer Coolidge and the step sisters and Sam's best friend. They were absolutely funny, they stole the film because they actually made the film worth watching (well so did Chad Michael Murray but for a whole different reason) Acting in this film was OK, wasn't as good as some may think but what could you expect the characters were badly written and the whole plot was exaggerated to make people feel sorry for Sam. But it failed. *By the way i am in my late teens which obviously makes the film less appealing. Younger kids like 10-13 year olds might enjoy it more.*",A Cinderella Story

I would never had picked it out on the movie store, specially considering the movie store i have access to. One look at the cover of the DVD and i was certain it was a joke or something - this little blond girl on this guys back... However, as the suggestion had come from a dear friend, i took a deep breath and said to my self 'i will watch this with all my respect'. It was a good decision. I could go ahead and describe piece by piece of the movie, its cinematography, acting, editing, sound and such, for that is my job. I will spare you from this though. I rather hope that right here i can do what my friend did to me and suggest that if you really like cinema and stories and things like this, that you watch it.

It's a simple story with a happy ending? What more can you ask for?The movie is about Sam. She isn't one of the ""cool kids"" in school and at her spare time she works at a diner for her evil stepmother and dreams about going to Princeton. She is a member of a Princeton chatroom and in that chat she has found someone to talk to. She knows that they go to the same school but she has no idea of the fact that he is Austin Ames, the most popular guy in school. Austin has troubles of his own, his father want's him to become a footballpro. Austin himself want's to go to Princeton and write. Austin doesn't know who Sam is either. But after hours and hours of chatting and writing sms they decide to meet at the school's halloween party.Austin is played by eyecandy Chad Michael Murray, Sam by Hillary Duff.

Itwas because how many guys would just not play football and just walk off the Field to get a girl theirs none i can think of. Chad Michael Murray played the perfect role of the character he was supposed to be Austin Ames. That name sounds like a real athletes name. The part i liked about the most was when Hillary Duff went in the boys locker room just to tell him that he was a jerk doing her like that. It was an awesome movie and everybody that voted should have gave it a 10. Another good part in the movie was when she told her step mother that she was tired of her telling her what to do. I can fully relate to what she was saying to her step mom. You, just don't let someone take you over like that and enough is enough.",A Cinderella Story
110,jishera,Surprisingly Pretty Solid (6/10 Stars),6,3 August 2004,"When my mom and I decided to see A Cinderella Story, we didn't expect it to be that great. After seeing the movie, however, our viewpoints changed. The movie is actually pretty well done. It isn't going to win any Oscars or be a big movie at the box office, but it IS a wonderful family film. Hilary Duff (the Cinderella in the story) is not her usual ""cutesy"" self. Her role is more serious this time, and she handles her new lines with more skill than seen on Lizzie McGuire. All of the acting is well done, with the usual stereotypes stressed appropriately. Jennifer Coolidge is great as Fiona, the evil stepmother, and Chad Michael Murray is well casted as Hilary's prince. The story and dialogue suits the movie perfectly. Many of the one liners are pretty funny. (""You don't look angry."" ""It's the botox, I can't show emotion for another hour and a half""). As with most family movies though, there are a few stupid lines and scenes just there for the kids. I felt that ""Cinderella"" moved along a nice pace, and there are no plot holes or pointless scenes that many movies have today. Everything seemed to belong in the movie from the characters to the dialogue. If you feel like going to a well done family movie then look no further. My mom and I thoroughly enjoyed it more than we thought we would. If you go in not expecting much, you might just be pleasantly surprised. 6/10 starsNote: I think the average score would probably be a little higher if so many people hadn't bashed the movie and given it a score of 1--then again, maybe I just don't know a good movie from a bad one. I can tell you though that I normally agree exactly with the score given for movies on IMDb; this is one of those rare times that I do not agree. I think the movie deserves at least a 5/10.",A Cinderella Story

Well don't worry because this one is ACTUALLY GOOD. The lead part of Sam actually suits Hilary Duff and Chad Michael Murray ain't half bad himself.The only downer about this movie is its a bit too obvious what's gonna happen. Girl goes to ball, sees prince, likes him, 12 o'clock comes, she legs it, losses shoe, he finds her and they all live HAPPILY EVER AFTER! Roughly speaking this is what happens in the movie, what WOULD have been nice is if sam thinks prince charming (who in this case is popular boy charming)is a dud and goes out with his best friend instead. Now that would have been a smack in the face huh? Don't get me wrong, the classic characters where the same with personalities but different names. The Evil stepmother is played by Jennifer Coolidge who's obsessed with being just like star socialists and the airhead step sisters who want to be associated with the popular kids at school.But because it IS a Cinderella story it ends the way Cinderella does. Now there aren't any fairy godmothers around or mystical magic but it is a truly beautiful tale, i nearly almost found myself shedding a tear for the poor girl.

114,music_rawks,Very bad taste.,2,11 March 2007,"I must admit, I was very attracted to this movie at the beginning. But from the moment I saw it, I was sadly disappointed. Every aspect of it screams BAD TASTE! This is only my opinion of course. Please do not get offended. The main plot is simply a remake of the original fairy tale: Cinderella. Sam, (Duff) is a smart, pretty and hardworking orphan girl, who aspires to go to a prestigious university. She is, however, prevented from doing her best in school and enjoying her life freely by her deceased father's wife, and her 2 daughters.(Evil step-mother and sisters...) She meets her prince charming on a chat-room, (played by Murray) and as the story goes along, complications arise, finally resulting in a very happy, happy ending.So, in conclusion: I DO NOT recommend this movie, simply for the reason that too much rest for the brain is not good. I found the acting to be awkward, the theme to be over-exaggerated, and the city, (L.A.) to be a bad place for a fairy-tale. But if you you are a fan of chick-flick romance movies, this just might be suited for you. In general, though, better go outside, and breath some fresh air. Or read a book. It would be a wiser choice for a healthier occupation.",A Cinderella Story
115,x-pinksparkle-x,Best film ever!!,10,26 April 2008,"A Cinderella story is the best film ever!! The ending is the most perfect and it makes you believe that everyone can find their 'true love'. I think the 'never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game' message is a crucial element and such a great motto. I think the film also shows how someone can go through so much and come out the other side. Sam loses her mum, dad and is forced into a life of slavery by her step mum. She also gets made fun of at school but she shrugs it off. This is a great message. Sam and Austin are so perfect for one another and a very believable couple. The music choice in this film is of a very high standard. It has 'hear you me' and 'ill be' in it; to AMAZING songs which i didn't even know before i started watching a Cinderella story but now they are two of my all time fave songs ever!! There are also some comedy moments which always make me laugh such as 'call me girlfriend one more time!', 'a devastating blow' and even a bit where Sam bashes Her head into a locker and this random guy who's locker it is says' thanks' looking very chuffed with himself that she shut his locker for him. Its deffo a film to watch for children, teenagers and adults and its a feel-good movie that NEVER gets boring!

Cinderellas best friend plays the part fantastically. He adds the humour and the style to the movie.

Yet another rehashing and modernizing of the classic ""Cinderella"", our heroine must battle all odds (evil stepmother and wicked stepsisters, etc.) to win her ""prince"". The setting this time however, is modern day high school, complete with the nerds and the Barbie-doll cheerleaders who taunt them.

I knew what I was in for before watching this, and that is why I watched it. I knew the story was going to be the story of Cinderella in a modern setting. The title of this movie is a Cinderela Story, what else is there to expect?I knew the character's would be the same as in any other high school movie.. They always are.I knew the obstacles' the lead character's would have to face before coming together would be nonexistent in the real world. Movies have a knack for making things that are simple in the real world look complicated, and things that are complicated in the real world look simple..And that I would have to grind my teeth because of the lessons it would try to teach, after all, this is a Hollywood movie. I knew this from the start. And therefore would not, and will not bash it for doing what it does, dish out all those things without shame. I loved this movie, it delivers all I expect and want from a movie like this. It's not complicated, it's charming, I genuinely wanted the leads to get together. Everyone gets what they deserve in the end. And at the end of it all I had a big smile on my face..Sure it could have been a lot better, the script could have been sharper, the editing is a mess, the cinematography is the level of a T.V. movie.. But all that did not bother me that much because, I did not expect it to go beyond what it delivers. This is a 19 million dollar budget, Hillary Duff vehicle. It delivers everything that anyone could reasonably expect from it. If that is not enough for you, don't watch this movie. If it is, this movie could just be for you.With that in mind I give it 8 out of 10.",A Cinderella Story
123,cinemaddiction,"Good Movie, Depends On Personality",6,25 July 2004,"-Spoilers-From hearing it's title, you know this movie will be predictable, as far as the plot goes. You also expect it to be a dumb teen movie, just because it is a romance story featuring Hilary Duff. I went into the theater with both of those expectations, but I learned I was wrong.A Cinderella Story follows the life of a young girl named Sam who lost her dad due to an earthquake and is forced to move in with her mean stepmother and two stepsisters. Her father supposedly did not leave a will, so the evil stepmother, Fiona, gets everything. Sam, in turn, acts like Fiona's slave so that she has the money to get into Princeton, her dream college.Sam also has a secret admirer, per se, who she contacts using the internet and her cell phone's 'text messaging' feature. The admirer wants to meet at the Halloween dance, but Sam is not so sure she wants to come out of the fantasy relationship and meet her admirer.She finds that her admirer is the lead quarterback and student body president Austin Ames. She talks with Austin for a short time until her cell phone's timer goes off and she must leave before she tells him who she really is.The entire movie may have a pretty predictable plot, but it is infused with comedy and a modern flair that I think many people will enjoy.It doesn't matter what your initial perceptions of this movie are; I invite you to take the chance, and see if you are enchanted by the magical spell this movie leaves.I won't go before saying that this movie isn't for everyone. Obviously if you are someone who hates any kind of teen movie and loves gory action flicks this movie is not for you. But if you are someone who enjoys comedy, drama, and romance, give this movie a shot, no matter how old you are or what gender you are.Final Rating: Four out of five stars. ****Author's Note: Just to show you that anyone can enjoy this movie, I am a 14 year old perfectly straight guy.",A Cinderella Story

I cringed throughout. The stepsisters were ridiculously stupid and the ""pep rally"" skit about how rich boys shouldn't date girls as ugly as Hilary Duff was completely absurd. She was without a doubt the prettiest girl in the school, not to mention stylish, so that whole aspect of her being poor and plain was unbelievable. A Princeton bound boy like Chad's character... was he really stupid enough not to recognize her face and voice behind the ""mask""? I'll give it some credit, it WAS stupid enough to laugh at in parts, but only in certain parts. I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe very young Hilary fans would like it.

130,cksblackbelt,"A movie with a lot of potential, but ultimately, it comes up empty.",5,25 June 2005,"The idea is cute - a present-day Cinderella. A teenage girl who's forced to work at her stepmother's diner day in and day out, all the while dreaming of going to Princeton, falls in love with the most popular guy in school, who's father is forcing him into a football career... but really, he wants to be a writer.They meet in a chat room (before the beginning of the movie) and exchange e-mails and text messages for a few months. Eventually, he convinces her to meet him at the Halloween dance. She's masked, but she sees that he's the incredible Austin Ames, and becomes very unsure of herself. She leaves him at the stroke of midnight, dropping her cell phone on the way out. He embarks on a search to find her, filling the school with fliers and examining every girl he can find. The rest of the film is a) her trying to get up the courage to reveal herself, and b) the two trying to find their respective places in the world.Of course, the straight-A future Princeton students is stupid enough to leave her e-mail up and leave her stepsister alone in her room. At this point, I decided that she deserved whatever she got. The girls first try to take advantage of it, and upon failing, choose to make Sam pay by letting everyone know what's been happening. The truth is revealed to the entire school at a pep rally where the cheerleaders make up a skit satirizing the entire debacle. This is also where Austin finds out and doesn't respond, leaving Sam in tears.The writing is what I would expect from a high school writer, not someone getting paid to do it. Few, if any, of the lines are even chuckle worthy. The actors (of course, the jealous girlfriend/head cheerleader, evil stepsisters, Austin's ""jerk guy friends"") are unremarkable and - there's no other word for it - boring. I expected good things from the evil stepmother, played by the manicurist who marries the UPS guy from ""Legally Blonde"", but even she was a dud.Hillary Duff is cute as a button, but incredibly forgettable. She shines when given a decent shot at doing so - standing up to her stepmother, telling off Austin - but the rest of the movie is spent is perky submission. Chad Michael Murray is nice looking, but made me roll my eyes more than anything. He's an athletic, handsome, incredibly sweet guy who quotes the classics and wants to be a poet. His lines to Sam are not only corny, they're beyond the ""bad romance novel"" notch on the gag reflex-o-meter. A certain amount of ""suspension of disbelief"" is usually necessary at the movies, but his lines are just as likely to make you laugh as not. He's so COMPLEX, so CONFLICTED, almost like he's too SEPARATE PEOPLE. That's the whole crux of the movie: finding yourself and staying true to yourself. I for one found it impossible to reconcile Murray's part, and honestly not interested enough to try very hard. He's charming and he's got nice eyes, but lovey-dovey lines don't make for emotional depth. I enjoyed his performance whenever he wasn't trying too hard to be all CONFLICTED and EMOTIONAL - his reactions to his father's pushing and the revelation of who Sam is are artful and well-done, but for most of the movie, he's just plain annoying.There are two bright spots (relative to the rest of the film) in this movie: Sam's best friend, Carter, and her ""big sister"" role model, Rhonda. Carter is a quirky, geeky boy who's also an outcast at the school but is a great friend to Sam. (Most of the time, I kept thinking, ""Why don't you go for HIM, for God's sake?) His acting is not overly emotive and incredibly likable. Rhonda also works at the diner, mostly to watch over Sam, and steps in between her and her stepmother when things get too rough. (Rhonda is played by Regina King, from Legally Blonde 2, Miss Congeniality 2, Daddy Day Care, etc.) A facet of the movie I enjoyed was the commentary on the setting, California's beautiful San Fernando Valley. (Ghostbusters II references, galore) There is mention of a huge drought once or twice during the movie, until Sam and Austin kiss, and it magically ends. The end of the drought could have been a really cute plot device, but the set-up was pathetic and it just ended up as another contrived cliché, or an attempt to bring in male viewers with a soaked Hillary Duff. Sam also jokes about the smog and how she thought it was her ""kingdom"" growing up.There are some kinks in the plot, as well. At first, Sam thinks Austin is stuck-up and a jerk. Our only evidence of this is him taking her parking spot, and the idiots he hangs out with. So the audience is either left thinking that Sam is way too judgmental, or that Austin is one giant hangnail... in which case, why does she like him, anyway? Moreover, why is Sam such an outcast? It's plausible that the popular girls have it in for her, but she dresses like she stepped out of a Gap commercial, is incredibly smart, friendly, and quite pretty. It doesn't make sense that she only has one friend, out of ""a school of 3500 kids"".This movie could've been wonderful - with different actors and better writing. I'm thinking a Julia Stiles/Sandra Bullock type as Sam, and a non-crazy Tom Cruise type as Austin. Perhaps the two actors could remake this movie in a few years, after they've gained some experience and a few lessons in subtlety.My recommendation: buy it if you see it for $5.00, like I did at Best Buy.

Besides, this movie also brings forth many messages that would be useful to youth nowadays and I consider it to be very educational. The most important message in this movie I personally think is 'nothing is impossible if you just believe' and 'the fear of being rejected' as these messages are vital in the life as a teenager nowadays. Overall, this movie fulfill most of the important aspects that one movie should have. It has a good plot and well-acted by the casts. The casts managed to express their character well and this is quite remarkable as most of them are young actors like Hilary Duff and Chad Michael Murray. This movie also has an appropriate soundtrack to go with it. One more thing, this movie is surely hilarious and I think most of the people will like it. With all the mentioned features, one will remain seated until the entire movie ends. Quite a good movie!!!",A Cinderella Story

133,amandakaren4,A Cinderella Story=Excellent,10,2 May 2006,"This film is one of my favourite. People may think I am sad having watched this teen chick flick over 20 times and sometimes watching it up to 5 times a day, but in a way I can relate to this film and when I watch it I kinda escape from reality and am in the film.I am a teenager and being unpopular isn't uncommon. Well it wasn't with me in high school. I wasn't exactly the most popular girl in high school and this is probably why I love this film so much. I am a born dreamer and so when this girl that is unpopular with the popular kids in school falls for the most popular guy in school and these feelings are reciprocated it had me hooked. Many teen rom-coms are like this, but I love Hilary Duff and Chad Michael Murray. Jennifer Coolidge also plays a fantastic part in this film as the wicked step-mother.This modern day Cinderella Story is funky and hip and uses modern day technology to help create the story. The glass slipper - a cell phone etc. I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie, especially if you have a broad imagination and are a dreamer. 10/10",A Cinderella Story

The film is wonderfully done, i think it is brilliant that the story of Cinderella has been turned into a modern movie. This movie was done extremely well and although some parts were a bit cheesy or unrealistic it is a touching film. Chad Micheal Murray, was a brilliant actor as was Hilary Duff. It has such a happy ending. I would recommend this movie to mainly Hilary Duff fans (some other people may not be fond of her acting skills) and tweens and teenagers. It brings back many fairytale memories and has to be one of my favorite Hilary Duff films! go Hilary!",A Cinderella Story

This kind of reminds me of my school football team because we won both of our ""big"" this year and we even won the state championships...anyway back to the movie... some parts brought tears to my eyes and others i coudn't stop laughing. This movie also taught me that if you just believe in yourself anything in life can happen. Hilary Duff is one of my favorite actresses.

This was way too boring and cliché (no creativity as mentioned above).And no offence to duff (it's not personal) but they could have had someone more suitable for prince charming. He was tall and skinny, but she was too short and had pudgy arms. Her acting was also not believable. They did not look good together.Overall it was OK (3/10 stars), though I wouldn't call this great. It is mostly for little girls who wear pink tiaras.",A Cinderella Story

When i first watched this movie i was dying to have it. This movie shows that even though life can be bad you always have the chance to stand up for yourself and become something great and achieve your dreams. I would recommend this movie to all girls because of these reasons. Not many guys would want to watch this movie, even though my best friend (who is a guy) loves this movie. Before you run out and buy this movie though you might want to rent it first depending on your taste. So all-in-all if you like comedies and teen romance then this is the movie for you!

We hope that she had build further her own castle too, her own kingdom. The movie was really good made, kept a part of the original Cinderella story but added new things that made the movie much interested.

However, that doesn't mean it's a good movie. It's entertaining and the perfect movie to watch when you don't want to think. However, this movie is FILLED with plot holes, one-dimensional characters, and less-than-believable acting. Duff is the perfect actress for a tween movie, but believing that she is an outcast because she works at her family's diner is ridiculous. Chad Michael Murray is ideal for the heart-throb male lead, but there is no apparent chemistry between his character and Duff's.

There were some funny moments throughout but I don't think that there was enough romance between the main characters. What I mean is that there were not enough one on one with Hilary and Chad. I wanted to see the chemistry between them a lot more. It was very disappointing in that respect.It would have been more enjoyable if he had got to know her during school time also. Once in a while these old story lines need to have some kind of twist whereby the story revolves mostly around the interactions of the main characters.Directors need to take this into consideration. We all know the old story, give it a new twist so that it seems as if you are hearing/seeing this story from a fresh new perspective. The movie that Drew Barrymore starred in, Ever After, had a little bit more interaction between the main characters, but I still didn't think it was enough.

149,ahyellahskunk,Is this even classified as a movie?,1,2 August 2008,"This movie seriously sucks. For one thing, Hilary Duff couldn't act to save her life. So for producers to even cast her in this movie is ridiculous. If as this film projects hot=popular, then shouldn't Hilary Duff AKA Sam, be like Queen Bee. I may be a chick, but she is pretty darn sexy. I think, personally, the best actor was the little girl playing a young Sam at the beginning. In which her father dies FROM AN EARTHQUAKE. What the heck? We find he owns a diner, but marries a lady with a fetish for plastic surgery. The producers are trying to sell us on the idea that her dad was a great, ernest man. So how, HOW? would he fall for a lady with boobs as fake as my little sister's imaginary friend? Then, the lady gets all bossy, and makes the kid live in the attic. CALL CHILD WELFARE! Then she forces her to work for her, yada yada, but there is a gem in the rough!! The fellow workers at her dad's diner are very compassionate. Yipee ki yay! What is that? But! Aside from all that crap, she manages to fall in love with none other than Austin Ames! A hot popular guy. Of course. I was hoping she'd kick Austin in the balls, and start making out with the nerdy, theatrical best friend. She then begins receiving mysterious messages on the computer. They tell her to meet this mysterious sender on the center of the dance floor at the school Halloween dance. So she goes. BUT SHE HAS NOTHING TO WEAR!! Call the National Guard. Luckily, some lady from the diner helps her by finding her a mask and a gown. So she goes. Then she hears this creepy voice saying, ""You're in the center of the dance floor."" She turns around to see Mr. Styerotypical Nerd Guy standing there. The rest of the movie is a mockery, the acgting poor the plot worse. Of course it ends happily ever after.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS!! 1/10",A Cinderella Story
150,thomasc4,A Must Watch Movie!,8,15 October 2008,"Personally from my experience in watching the Cinderella Story, I have actually come to love this movie. This story has a lot of depth, if you watch the movie a few times you will notice that some of the scenes sometimes happen in real life today. The Cinderella Story also shows that do not let one thing that goes bad in your life keep you from moving on an having a great time. It also shows that you need to stand up for yourself, even to an adult when you know they have crossed the line and went to far in taking advantage of you trying to help out with the family business. This movie also helps when you an your boyfriend have gotten into a fight or have broken up, it will give you a good cry. In the movie it also shows that if you believe in something an work hard enough to get that wish you want it will come true in a matter of some time.",A Cinderella Story

When she was 8 years old, her father remarried, to a wicked woman, named Fiona, who has two daughters, Brianna and Gabriella. Sam's father dies in an earthquake and Sam is left with Fiona and her daughters. 8 years later, Sam is getting ready for college, hoping to attend Princeton. She is very smart, earning straight A's and taking AP classes. She has an email/text relationship with a boy she has never met, ""Nomad"". When he tells her to meet him at the dance, she finds out that he is Austin Ames (Chad Michael Murray) the most popular guy in school. He is the football star, class president, and secretly a closet poet hoping to attend Princeton too. Sam is wearing a mask, so he doesn't know who she is. After the dance, Austin tries to find out who this ""Cinderella"" was because he really liked her. Sam doesn't want to tell him because she is afraid that he will be disappointed. Meanwhile, Fiona is making Sam work really hard and throws away her Princeton acceptance letter. Austin's ex-girlfriend, Shelby is a popular cheerleader and finds out who ""Cinderella"" is and makes fun of Sam in front of the whole school. Sam gets mad at Austin and tells him off. When Austin is playing in his football game, he realizes that he wants to be with Sam, so during the last 10 seconds, he runs to the bleachers to stop Sam from leaving. Then they end up together, which upsets Shelby. After high school, they go to Princeton together.""A Cinderella Story"" is such a cute movie. It is definitely worth watching. It's just a really cute love story. I guess I like it so much because I'm a lot like Sam and my crush is a lot like Austin, but anyway, I think any girl will enjoy this film. And I guess you should keep in mind that I'm a 16 year old girl. But it has a great story about never giving up and following your dreams.

152,pirates_lover,Film critics normally aren't teenagers..,10,20 July 2004,"I loved this movie! Yesterday when I went with a bunch of friends I was expecting another movie where I could guess the ending, it would be filled with a poor little rich girl named Cinderella and a hot looking jock.Well, I came out pleasantly surprised. Yes there was an extremely hot jock but they showed a different sensitive side to him, that he couldn't let show around his friends or father. Cinderella was a girl who I did feel bad for a parts of the movie;Hilary Duff did an extremely good job portraying Sam. And you probably still can guess the ending of the movie, but not without a twist or two of mean girl rivalry at near the end.I would also be extremely happy to point out that most film critics aren't teenagers. They probably can't relate to this movie as most young people. School life today (or my school) is almost exactly as portrayed in A Cinderella Story. You look good, play lots of sports and act just like everybody else your good to go. This may have not been the case 15:20 years ago when critics went to school. They're giving it the worst reviews ever such as "" ruining the classic Cinderella story"" and ""Duff and Murrays pathetic attempts."" Maybe this is just because they can't relate to the movie as well as teenagers.A Cinderella Story was cute, funny and make-you-smile at the romantic situation going on that every girl wishes she could have.10 stars out of 10 for sure!",A Cinderella Story

I took my little sister to see it and she loved it. Of course her opinion could be predictable considering Hilary Duff is all over her bedroom walls. Then I took my sister,who is the same age as Hilary, to see it and we both agreed ""It's Really Cute!""No doubt it is unbearably predictable (come on it is ""Cinderella Story"" so what do you think is gonna happen in the end)! However it was nice to see Hilary have to do some acting. She showed us that she does have some acting talents and that she is ready to take on more mature roles which she is going to do in the near future (see Heart of Summer). She is taking that leap into Mature roles slowly though so that she can still please her younger audience. I look forward to seeing what she can do next.Now onto Chad. I think this was a step back for him. Yes, he and Hilary have very good chemistry on screen but he can act so I would like to see him in roles that actually require, well acting. Although, I did like seeing him in the Prince Charming costume. It was a very funny looking costume.Anyways, very long story short...not the best movie in the world but cute enough for us girls that like cutesy stuff.",A Cinderella Story

If you consider yourself a romantic you will find the movie adorable and charming. If you consider yourself a realist you will find it annoying and predictable. Myself, I consider it a clever twist on an age old classic. Hilary does a great job playing the typical stepped-on, under-appreciated teen who just wants her dreams to come true. The step-sisters are a little over the top and probably would have made the movie better had they been evil, instead of ditz's. However, the movie can inspire those who never thought of stepping back from a situation and freeing themselves to make their own choices (I say this in regard to ignoring the ""socially oppressive"" groups of people and not in regard to authority).

Lindsay Lohan is talented and a much better actress and can act circles around Hilary duff anytime. Go watch ""mean girls"" instead, fantastic movie!!!Basically, this movie is nothing more than a typical cheesy teen movie (starring Hilary Duff, which makes it exponentially worse), stereotyping ""popular"" girls, jocks, dorks, dweebs, losers, wannabe's, and nerds, none of which would ever come close to how people would act in real life. Hilary Duff's character is too clingy, oversensitive, overreacting, and under-rebellious. I honestly hope no one is like that in real life. The only reason why I didn't give the turkey a 0 was because of the humor and believability of their stereotypical nerd. ""He's in his own world,"" Hilary Duff remarks as he walks down the hallway, sporting his gadgets, nerd paraphernalia, and whatnot. Dude, he is THE MAN!!

There's more to the plot then just that. Before I went to the movie, one of my friends told me that it was good, but predictable, but I had to see for myself. Some elements to the movie are a given: an evil stepmother, two evil stepsisters, ""cinderella"" and her ""prince"". if you go to see the movie and expect it to be totally different from the cartoon ""Cinderella"", think again. Similar things happen in both movies. But there are some different things. I don't want to give very much away if you haven't seen the movie yet, but in this movie Cinderella tells off the prince and her evil stepmother and stepsisters, that's not like the cartoon!

It tries so hard to be a ""loose"" adaptation, but they can't stop saying the name of the movie. It also reinforces the stereotype that in order to be a happy female in high school, you need to date the popular guy. Even though they try to press on us the effect that Austin is struggling inside and hates his place in life, he is a pretty boy that every girl wants, and he really wouldn't care if he ended up with Ms. Duff. You and your children will be dumber for watching this movie, I assure you.

But when I watched this one, I was incredibly disappointed.A completely cheesy, unrealistic plot mixed with too-supposed-to-be real life characters, plus some factory burnt romanticism and dull jokes, make this film a huge loss. Ms. Duff's acting did not convince me one bit, due to its fakeness.To put it in short, this movie is a fraud filled with supposed to be hip happenings, extreme naivety, and half-hearted performances. It is awful to see how Mark Rosman, his team and Hilary Duff completely ruined one of my favorite stories of all time. Want a really good movie? Try 'The Princess Diaries'",A Cinderella Story

I recommend going to see it. There are some comical parts and some for the females who like the romantic aspect of it. Definitely a movie worth seeing at some point, even if you just rent it for the heck of it. You know the story and you pretty much know the end result, but how it gets from point a to point b is great.",A Cinderella Story
165,beeskiss2000,love it or hate it,10,18 July 2004,"I loved it and so did my friends! If you like those fun girlie girl movies then this one is for you. Hillary Duff who plays (Sam) is great, she really makes the movies interesting. And Chad Murry is so cute! Having a crush on someone who goes to your school but not even knowing who he is. Thats what Sam had to go through till the homecoming dance. but thats not all the movie is about. Moms or Dads who have girls who are about 11-13 should take them to go see it. I know they will love it.When i voted this movie i gave it a ten, thats how much i loved it!I also think any age would like it if you like cute fun movies. I can't wait to purchase it when it comes out. Go and see it its a Great Movie!",A Cinderella Story
166,littlemonkeystar,Great Movie,10,18 July 2004,"Ever since I first heard about A Cinderella Story I couldn't wait to see it and I knew I'd love it. I saw it opening day and I was right, it was a great movie. It has Cinderella basics but is very modern and the characters have been made over just like the plot. It has something for everyone but teen girls are most likely to enjoy it. It was so cute, funny and a times sad. Hilary did a great job and I consider this to be her best movie yet. She does such a good job you feel very sorry for her character Sam. The best scenes involved Sam (Hilary Duff) and Austin (Chad Michael Murray) they had great chemistry and it was very obvious. You will leave the movie feeling good.",A Cinderella Story

I really love Chad Michael Murray and his acting. I thought it was a cute movie. It was a good movie because it took the old cinderella story and put a twist on it to make it seem more like today. It made it more for a teenage crowd and it made seem more ""real"". The movie teaches you to do what you want to do even if your parents don't support you in what you want to do and this is why i believe it's a good movie cause it teaches you to go on and do what you want to do in life. I also enjoyed this movie because Chad Michael Murray is in it. :) Also Hilary Duff is someone who i look up to because she's not like the teen stars today and that's good.",A Cinderella Story

171,HanBigMovieFan,"Fluff, but good fluff",10,24 August 2004,"What really annoys me these days is the expectations held for any film. Can movie fans not just accept the some movies are destined to change the world whereas others such as ,the Cinderella story, are meant to entertain and for romance.I believe this movie fulfills its purpose. Hilary wins my vote as best USA teen queen against the olsens and lindsay lohan, at 16 she acts professionally and with a convincing technique. Chad Murray helps the film move along, and both the leads looks does at time overtake the lines but i had fun viewing this.So, to sum up, a Cinderella story is full of stereotypes-the geeky best mate, the popular trio,(mean girls,she's all that- what is with 3 popular girls??),the slapstick jokes and the puky ending.But if you go and see this film,want to laugh and dream, you wont be disappointed,xx",A Cinderella Story

I didn't think it was predictable because there were so many twist.When they were up to the halloween dance i thought that was the end of the show. I honestly love this movie. I do come from New Zealand and the movie was just released this month. I know USA has it on DVD already. I want to watch it over and over again but i guess i'll just buy it on DVD when it comes out.,A Cinderella Story
173,roxydramaqueen69,A great movie for people 9 to 16,10,13 October 2004,I'm 13 years of age and think this was a great Hilary Duff movie she showed great acting and of course the movie was better with Chad Micheal Murray in it. The stepsisters were great one of them was Gracie from the Nanny. Jennifer was great and funny. I loved the movie and the soundtrack is great. The only thing that brought the movie down was that of course we all knew what was going to happen. The mean girls were good but the side kicks could have been a little better. The trailer was great but in the actual movie things weren't set up as well. Regina King was a great fairy god mother and seemed very caring. I thought the younger version of Sam was great too. Overall the movie was great and inspirational to follow your dreams.,A Cinderella Story

It really makes Hilary Duff look like a skilled actress, unlike some of her other movies. Plus, Chad Michael Murray is totally hot!!! Even though you can easily tell that this movie will end with Austin and Sam together, it is great how they transferred the original Cinderella story into a more current story about teens today. Most people look at the trailer and see that Hilary Duff is in it and thinks it will be a horrible movie. Even I thought this before I saw it, but know that I have seen it, I think it is a super fun movie, and I hope people don't judge it based on the fact that they don't just like Hilary Duff, because before I saw this movie, I also thought she was a horrible actress. But this movie really shows her acting skills.",A Cinderella Story

Two thumbs up for Dan Byrd (Carter Ferrel) He made the movie funny and is one of the best young actors i've ever seen. (based on the Actor Commentary and screen plays.) He is best for the part. I love his acting. I love Hillary Duff shes so sweet and her acting talent is great. She made a perfect addition to the movie along with the handsome Chad Michel Murray. They were all good. Not to mention the dress. It was so beautiful. SHe should have been excited to wear that dress on the big screen. And the costume designers did a very good job on Dan Byrd, making him look like Zorro. He was totally Hott when I first saw him enter the dinner in a black mask and hat.

I was thinking OK I'll check it out and see if I can at least tolerate it. Well it was my surprise when I actually ended up watching this movie about 8 times! It's not the best movie in the world but it's not the worst either. I'd rate it at least 6 out of 10. I loved Hilary Duff in this movie, it's definitely her best movie so far. Some of her scenes in the movie had me about ready to jerk a tear. She does a terrific job and brings the character of Cinderella to a whole new level. I'd also like to applaud Chad Michael Murray he does an excellent portrayal of the modern day prince caught up in his ""popular world"" wanting to reveal his true self. Having Chad on screen really had me tuning in. I won't lie this movie is sorta predictable but in my point of view it's totally worth having a look at. It has its laughs, it has its cries and it has with me a grade B for an all around good movie!",A Cinderella Story
178,rockchicka109,Really about what people go through in high school,10,9 January 2005,"Amazingly enough i actually liked this move. Yeah everyone knows that Chad is freaking hot but thats besides the point. The point is that being cool in high school doesn't matter b/c after you graduate chances are that you won't ever see those people again. And you just need to be yourself. There's no point in being someone you're not. I also really liked how they took the fairy tale that every little girl hears and turned it into a modern day story. It was a pretty good movie. The sound track is awesome. And Hillary Duff isn't to bad either. Most people judge actors, and they really shouldn't b/c they have no idea who they really are. This movie is a good example of standing up for what you want and what you think is right.",A Cinderella Story
179,dvadinga,This movie is awesome!!!,10,2 July 2005,"This movie is fantastic. It is the classic Cinderella that we all know and love with a modern twist. You do not have to like Hilary Duff to see this movie, but her amazing acting skills help. She adds so much life to the screen that you would not have had if the lead role was played by someone like Lindsay Lohan. (nothing against Lindsay) Jennifer Cooliage is also very funny is this movie. And Chad Michael Murray just scored another gig. Hilary and Chad had great chemistry on screen. But Hilary Duff shined the most. She is untouchable in this movie as she always is. This movie has a great message. (not that it needed one) And it's a great family film. Not that I would want to watch it with my family. I prefer to watch a lot of movies by myself so I cannot be influenced.

There were tense's sadness, anger and happiness during this film and shows that you can stand up to anyone and everyone who doesn't treat you as nice, as the one who plays the wicked step mother. It helps you realise you can do this too. Sometimes you could forget who you really are until something clicks. This is the most one film I'm waiting for to come out DVD and VHS so i can buy it.

I also was blown away by the costumes used in the Halloween dance ... especially Hilary Duff's dress it was basically a ball gown or a dream girls dress ... but what was the best was the appearance Hilary Duff doing to the role of Samantha Montgomery,a depressed young teenager, living in a misery with her stepmother... and Chad Michael Murray as Austin Ames a closet poet , living his father dream .... being popular ,playing football and getting into USC football . can these two very different people come together and make a good couple.....?",A Cinderella Story

At this point, one of my friends starts getting upset. We all think Chad Micheal Murray is really hot and all, and my friend thinks that Hilary Duff was holding back. I mean,you see Austin being way into it, and then Sam is almost trying to get out of it or something.

187,CelesteCanada,Great Movie,8,8 April 2005,"I'm surprised that people criticize this movie for being a typical Hillary Duff style movie. I must admit even coming out of the cinema after having watched the film people were complaining about what a waste of money it had been but i have to say that i disagree. The story was not altered(from the original fairytale)which I believe was fitting for the overall feel-good reaction that you get from the movie. One of the things that made this film so good in my view was the casting. Casting the gorgeous Chad Michael Murray as Prince Charming was a brilliant move and no matter what your feelings for Hillary Duff are, she seemed to pull off the part of the modern-day Cinderella with ease. Casting Jennifer Coolidge as the evil step mother and Regina King as the fairy godmother also helped this film blossom into a fabulous modern day fairytale. Admitedly, substituting the glass slipper for a cell phone, the ancient kingdom for LA, prince charming from royalty to captain of the high school football team and Cinderella to Sam Montgomery (high school unknown) was a little cheesy, it did help blend the fairytale story into the 21st Century. Add in brilliant costumes (That Dress and the Prince Charming suit not to mention the Siamease cat costume) and a great soundtrack and you have a great feel-good movie.",A Cinderella Story

If you're looking for serious acting, then i wouldn't recommend this, but if you're a fan of Hilary Duff or Chad Michael Murray, and/or want an entertaining, fun, safe film, then i'd definitely recommend A Cinderella Story. The plot line is fairly predictable, but then again it would be, it's a typical American modernised fairytale, with a happy ending. I might watch it again, but i wouldn't really want to buy it on DVD. It's one of those films where you watch it once or twice, then you don't really feel you want to watch it again.

Her father was rich and owned a diner, but when he passed away, he had no will and so his money and diner went to his new wife, and Sam's step mom, Fiona. Fiona takes all this money for herself (and her 2 daughters) and makes a deal with Sam that in order for Sam to live in the house, and in order for Fiona to pay for Sam's education, Sam must be a full time slave pretty much. (Although Fiona is NOT willing to pay for Sam's education, she thinks Sam is too overwhelmed in work and too stupid to get in to collage!) What Sam's step family doesn't know, is that she has an internet realationship with someone called Nomad. They have no idea who each other are, and want to. So this mysterious guy Nomad asks her to meet him at the school dance (he dumps his cool, ""hot"" girl friend for it), she accepts, until her evil step mom makes her work at the diner.

My favorite part was when Sam was dancing with Austin away from everyone else!!! And if Sam stayed a little longer she could have been named Queen and Austin was named King!!!! I really liked that they made them talking so close to each other even thought they didn't know it was them! I wonder how Austin thought of the name Momad or was Bomad?

203,j_goal,great,10,22 November 2005,"i saw this film because i want to see how Hilary duff acted in this movie,, but i was very surprised that i found the chief actor ----chad Michael Murray was extremely handsome and cool in this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i really fall in love with him* (only the character in the film.....) chad acted nearly perfect in this movie!! he made the character lively~ this is much much better than his acting in the house of wax,,,,, maybe it is because house of wax is a horror film and acting is not as important as in ""a Cindarella story""~ so i like this movie more** besides,,Hilary's poor situation made me have passion to her story,,,, what a romantic story,, Hilary was beautiful in the film,, not as i saw before.....",A Cinderella Story
204,ken_148,Great Viewing Experience,10,13 December 2005,"As an ""old"" fan of the Parent Trap, both editions but liked the modern version the best, I found this movie captivating and a must have for my limited movie collection. I love the modern story and the use of the ""you have mail"" symbolism. I am still emotionally high on the experience and I am watching parts of it daily for spurts of energy, romance and fantasy into my otherwise interesting but routine life. My granddaughters are laughing at me because I even bought the sound track and played it in the car when I picked them up at school. ""You don't even like that kind of music"", is all I hear from them through their laughter. I am determined to ""like"" the music at least half as much as I love the movie. Wish there would have been more buildup, ie, details of the instant message relationship and more focus on the Prince and Cinderella, their feeling and emotions before and after the ball. If your parents, grandparents or other ""old"" people you know, were fans of the Parent Trap, or Ever After, please find a way to get them to watch this movie. Tell them an old retired Army Colonel recommended it.",A Cinderella Story
205,eomeoni-07379,Love the movie!,9,2 September 2018,"I love the movie, it is one of my favorites. However the issue I have is not with the movie, but with the cast list on this site... Why are Emily Perkins (Britt) and Katherine Isabelle (Bree) not listed in the cast? I mean they are part of the movie, they played the evil step sisters after all. I had to go to their Ginger Snap movie cast just to look them up. I would like to put this on the FAQ, but they don't have it implemented yet so, I am kind of stuck putting it here.",A Cinderella Story
206,just_dance,Why isn't it a hollow comedy!,8,8 January 2006,"Everybody already know this is quite a predictable movie, but for a teen like me, searching her place in the world and wondering what to do with her life and who she is, it's really useful. It's one of my favorite movies, I've seen it million times and every time I learn something new. You may laugh at this fact, but it is true. I'm not saying you should search for something deep and useful in this title, but there's a chance to feel it so close to you, so that this deep and useful something will find you. If you think about it, people my age (who are actually the wanted audience) should learn an important fact, which is not pointed in the original story - Why being yourself is the right way to find worthwhile people in your life. And how could being yourself (it sound so simple isn't it) change your life for good. Chek it out!",A Cinderella Story
207,kj161988,not as bad as expected,7,23 January 2006,"I found this to be not as bad as expected, it's easy to label all teen films together but I think this is different,I have to admit, I actually enjoyed watching A Cinderella Story. Hilary Duff is perfect for the role of shy awkward ""Cinderella"" Sam and Chad Michael Murray as her Prince Charming, even better. This was both funny but watchable the entire way through. It was nice watching an adaptation of the classic Cinderella that was made with teenagers in mind. Possibly not as enjoyable once you are older than 19, good for a girls night in or watching with little sisters. A very sweet and innocent teen film that could easily be watched over and over again. The only problem I would have with this is that you do have a far idea what is going to happen.",A Cinderella Story
208,rocknkali,good teen movie,10,26 January 2006,"i personally think the movie is a good teen movie.i saw it and its almost a perfect description on what teens do theses days.months later , when i met my bf i found that that his parents own the diner it was filmed in ( George's 50's diner)its located in Long Beach, Ca on Atlantic and San Antonio drive.yup yup.they made it look really different in the movie though,but its a really neat family run place.the movie has a good teen spunk .its recommended. nice modern twist to the original Cinderella tale.",A Cinderella Story
209,megagob2004,it is great,10,26 February 2006,"It is a wonderful film. And if you are like me and think that Chad Michael is fit (which he is) then you will like it. It is funny and a good film to watch. I have watched it over 20 times and i normally won't watch i film more that twice. So i would say if you like funny, romantic, girlie film then you will enjoy it. I don't think many boys would enjoy it though. It is easy to understand and is well written. I think that it is a bit to like Cinderella though. But otherwise i think that every girl should see it.:) I hope if you get it that you enjoy like i have. So have fun watching it. Sorry if this review is not that good, i am not good with reviews",A Cinderella Story
210,Wildcherry805,Not Such A Good Movie!,3,7 July 2006,"This movie was clearly not the best. Perhaps if another actress, besides Hilary Duff portrayed Sam(Cinderella) then the movie would be more enjoyable. However, Hilary's acting skills are quite poor and her ""tween dream"" image ruined the merit of her supposedly being an outcast. Every moment watching her act almost made me choke, I was disgusted with her ""talent"". However, the story I suppose was OK. Excluding the fact that a real hot high school jock would not be interested in Princeton, and especially not interested in a girl like Sam. Sure, they attempted to prove to the world that high school rankings don't matter, and theirs more to people than meets the eye, but I sure didn't buy it, and I don't think anyone else did.So readers, If you haven't seen this movie, consider yourself lucky. The only part of this film I found enjoyable was JD Pardo, who played Ryan, one of Austin's friends. He is extremely attractive, talented and charming, and although his role was small, he gave me a reason to actually continue watching this movie.",A Cinderella Story
