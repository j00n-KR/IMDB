0,MartinHafer,Potentially traumatizing...be careful with this one.,7,21 September 2010,"I am not particularly a fan of vampire movies and the only reason I watched ""Let the Right One In"" was because my oldest daughter was visiting and wanted to see it. Well, considering I am a sucker for a foreign film, I decided to watch along with her.I know she liked it--mostly because the film was unique and incorporated a lot of folklore about vampires--stuff you often don't see in other movies. As for me, I just appreciated that the film was different--not just a retelling of some old Dracula story or some modern sparkly sort of vampire tale. I could say more about the film and why I thought it was a pretty good film, but I think it's more important I point out that this film is NOT for everyone. It is very, very bloody and vicious--and highly disturbing...seriously disturbing. Not all of this is because of the very vivid killings but because of a deeper part of the story involving genital mutilation and well as a twisted relationship between the two main characters! Yes, this is NOT your granddaddy's vampire movie. So, if you want to see it, just be forewarned...and don't rent it for your kids (unless you WANT to be a horrible parent and traumatize your kids).",Let the Right One In
1,Leofwine_draca,Typically classy Swedish vampire story,8,17 August 2016,"This is one of those little European horror films that seem to come out of nowhere every now and then to blow the world away. LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is a Swedish effort that tackles the overdone vampire genre in a unique, subtle way that falls some way between the two main types of vampire film at the moment: the teen-friendly romances a la TWILIGHT and the ultra-gory thrills a la 30 DAYS OF NIGHT. It's far better than either of those films, a lyrical, touching and often haunting exploration of adolescence that just happens to feature one of the main characters as a vampire. Thankfully, the bloodsucking antics are kept low key, but even so I thought they were sometimes a little over the top (the bit where Eli climbs a tree has some obvious wire work that took me straight out of the film).The film's at its best when it's a touching portrait of puberty, including all the usual staples: evil bullies at school, unloving parents, the sense of being an outsider, and overwhelming loneliness. The young cast are fine, with Kare Hedebrant particularly good as the beleaguered boy and Lina Leandersson as the put-upon vampire girl. I found the scene in which they innocently shared a bed to be the best in the whole movie. Otherwise, there's romance here and some bloodletting, including a wonderful set-piece climax in a swimming pool of all places that finishes the film superbly. It may not be an effects-filled bonanza or a movie that blows you away, but LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is instead a mature and reflective exploration of some very dark themes.",Let the Right One In
2,SnoopyStyle,fresh vampire movie,8,1 January 2016,Oskar is a 12 year old boy living in a Stockholm project. He's slight and gets bullied. He befriends strange girl Eli who he finds hanging around at night in the courtyard. She never goes out in the day. She has caretaker Håkan who kills and drains the blood for Eli to drink. She is left alone and develops a relationship with Oskar. Oskar wants revenge on his tormentors and Eli needs blood.It's a great idea of these two lonely kids forming a friendship. It's a vampire movie and a coming-of-age movie. It is a bit slow with a good moodiness. Eli is haunting. There are a couple of visually compelling scenes. The burning body is terrific and the swimming pool is memorable. The Scandinavian landscape gives a nice icy feel. This is a fresh new vampire movie.,Let the Right One In
3,Hitchcoc,Quite Shocking,8,11 June 2010,"I had not heard of this film. It looked intriguing. I didn't know what to expect. What I saw was an atmospheric along the same lines, for me, as Don't Look Now. It is a film of incredible grimness and sadness. The characters don't seem to have a chance and must carry out their unfortunate roles. Now that could be said of Dracula as well, but there is so much more here. We have the fact that there is a tug of humanity, but ultimately the primal instincts of the ""species"" comes to the fore. The relationship is doomed for both parties and anyone who is victimized. There is an element of love, but it is a hopeless love. I was greatly impressed by the matter-of-fact nature of this film. It has the coldest sense about it. It is a completely humorless film which wears a bit, but, then, I don't know if it would have been possible.",Let the Right One In
4,claudio_carvalho,Stylish and One of the Best Vampire Movies Ever,9,1 January 2010,"In the suburb of Blackeberg in Stockholm, the twelve year-old Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant) is a lonely and outcast boy bullied in school by Conny (Patrik Rydmark) and two other classroom mates; at home, Oskar dreams on revenging the trio of bullies. He befriends his twelve year-old next door neighbor Eli (Lina Leandersson) that only appears during the night in the playground of their building. Meanwhile, Eli's father is a wanted serial-killer that drains the blood of his victims to supply Eli, who is actually an ancient vampire. Eli advises Oskar to react to Conny fighting back; however, soon he discovers that she is a vampire and he feels fear and love for the girl. ""Låt den Rätte Komma in"" a.k.a. ""Let the Right One In"" is a stylish vampire movie, developed in a slow pace like most European movies. The original story is very well constructed, and the crew is very careful in the details. For example, when Oskar is hit on his face, the wound is gradually healed every day. The performances are top-notch and the soundtrack is classy and adequate for this feature. I believe this is the first Swedish vampire movie that I have seen and I consider it one of the best vampire movie ever. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): Not AvailableNote: On 11 June 2011, I saw this mesmerizing film again to compare it with the American remake.On 03 October 2012, I saw this film again",Let the Right One In
5,kosmasp,Just don't expect too much horror,7,11 October 2008,"I'd actually put it in the drama corner. Of course it has it's horror moments and maybe some readers here will give me a ""not useful"" after the first line, but that's how I felt about the movie. It has a fairy tale feel to it, which of course elevates certain aspects of the movie (like relationships, between the characters etc. etc.) and help you overlook some of the mistakes.Some might not even bother, but a movie with a theme like this should be careful about the rules it sets ... and once they're set, they should be followed as good as possible. The ""invitation rule"" for example get's ripped apart just to give us a flashy exciting scene. It's a shame, but that actually does bother me while I watch a movie. There are small things all over the movie and they're the reason why I only gave this movie an 7 (which is still pretty good). Great (child) performances and an atmosphere to ""die for"" (no pun intended), make a beautiful looking movie",Let the Right One In
6,classicsoncall,"""To flee is life, to linger death.""",6,20 February 2018,"The DVD cover states that it's 'the best vampire movie ever'. Reviewers on this board call it the best vampire movie ever. Even vampires the world over call it the best vampire movie ever.For this viewer, something got lost in translation along the way. Maybe my problem, if I have one, is that I'm way beyond the average age this picture most likely appeals to, which I presume to be a primarily teenage and young adult crowd. Even though the story isn't really hard to follow, abrupt scene changes in the picture manage to disrupt continuity, thereby presenting a choppy narrative. There are the prerequisite nods to previous vampire lore which I was thankful for, like Virginia (Ika Nord) turning into a vampire after being bitten by Eli (Lina Leandersson), and then bursting into flames in the presence of sunlight. But then there was the whole thing with the cats going all feral at one point in the presence of an infected person. What's the deal there? Never heard of that before.If you want to go head to head with the best vampire movie ever, you'll have to reach all the way back to 1922 and the original - Max Schreck's ""Nosferatu"". That's the one I judge all vampire flicks against and very few even come close, though Bela Lugosi's turn as ""Dracula"" in 1931 is pretty respectable. I know those classics don't hold the same fascination for the blood and gore fans of present day, but sometimes more scares are achieved by suggestion than seeing it splattered all over the place. That's my take at least, and I'm sticking with it.",Let the Right One In
7,gavin6942,"Although Only Two Years Old, Already Recognized As Classic",8,30 December 2010,"Oscar, an overlooked, pale, puny and bullied boy, finds love and revenge through Eli, a beautiful but peculiar girl who turns out to be a vampire.No other horror film in the last twenty years has had praises thrown on it like this one. All the critics love it, it sits firmly in the Top 250 on IMDb, and it was pushed through as an American remake in no time... a decent remake, at that (unlike what they did to ""Rec"").The film takes place in the Soviet era in Sweden, possibly the early 1980s. Trying to pinpoint an exact year is a bit tough, but it does add an element to the film that would be missing today. By placing it then, you do not have to deal with cell phones and other technology and can present a world where children were more innocent. In this way, they succeeded.I find the film's exploration of underage sexuality fascinating, including but not limited to the kids naked in bed. You must be careful not to tread too closely to child pornography, but at the same time there is such a thing as child sexuality, and to not explore it when it is relevant is a detriment. Here the envelope is pushed, maybe a bit too much, maybe just right... but it brings in an adult aspect to a childhood romance that is more innocent than disturbing.There are decent gore effects, such as the man without a face. For a film that revolves around a blood-drinking child, there is not an overabundance of blood. Now, that is not to say there is not enough -- in fact, I feel they did a good job keeping it to a minimum, and when it does show, it has a grisly and dark appearance that makes the picture seem darker than your average vampire film.One really interesting subplot is Eli's assertion that she is ""not a girl"". She hints at this repeatedly, but what does she mean? Are vampires not people? Because she is much older than she appears, is she a woman and not a girl? The book covers this more than the film, but it is an interesting part of the story that really throws off the whole dynamic.A must-see film! Sure, you might not like subtitles. But if that is the only thing keeping you away, please suck it up and give this one a chance. One of the best horror films I have ever seen, and unfortunately underrated by too many... this is not just a horror film, but a romance.",Let the Right One In
8,lee_eisenberg,Sweden's vampires,8,31 December 2009,"The recent vampire-mania seems to have gotten created by ""Twilight"" (which I'd never heard of until the movie came out). But a really impressive vampire-themed film is the Swedish ""Lat den ratte komma in"" (""Let the Right One In"" in English). It tells the story of Oskar, a bullied boy in 1982 Stockholm who befriends vampire girl Eli. The film reminds me of Lasse Hallstrom's ""My Life as a Dog"", the way that the boy is pretty much rejected by everyone around him until he finds his way.This isn't really a horror movie. It's sort of a coming-of-age story that just happens to have vampires. Eli is a most thought-provoking vampire. Far from Bela Lugosi's campy Dracula or the maniacal bloodsuckers seen in some movies, Eli is merely seeking her place in the world, while having to drink blood in the process. An almost ethereal character.All in all, I definitely recommend this movie.",Let the Right One In
9,jboothmillard,Let the Right One In,7,16 June 2011,"This Swedish film was focused a little in Film 2008 with Jonathan Ross, and obviously it was following the big trend of vampire based films and TV shows, like Twilight and True Blood, I heard it was really popular so I was interested in it eventually. Basically set in the suburbs of Blackeberg, Stockholm, Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant) is a lonely twelve year old living with his single mother Yvonne (Karin Bergquist) who constantly gets bullied at school by Conny (Patrik Rydmark) and two other classmates. He dreams of getting revenge against the three bullies who have made his life a misery for a long while, and one snowy night he befriends a mysterious young girl, his twelve year old neighbour Eli (Lina Leandersson). At first she is not comfortable with a friendship, but after discovering the Rubik's cube and getting to know each other better she is happy to be his friend. Meanwhile her father Håkan (Per Ragnar) is a serial killer draining blood from his victims and having the blood poor into tubs, but one night he is almost caught and is forced to hide the body in the nearby lake. It soon become apparent that Eli is not all that she seems, and this blood being collected serves a purpose, she is a vampire, and collected blood stops her from killing. Unaware for the moment of her secret, Oskar gets advised by her to stand up to his bullies, and one day he takes this advice and hits bully Conny before he can, and it seems to work. Håkan her father one night has a bad car accident, and to stop people identifying him he pours hydrochloric acid on his own face, and he allows Eli to suck his neck before he throws himself out of the hospital window and dies instantly. After seeing her reaction to the sight of blood, Oskar of course discovers her dark secret, and there is also a point when we see the horrific consequences of not inviting her into the room like vampires need to be. The police start investigating the spree of bodies turning up, and after Eli did not finish a draining causing a woman to become a vampire herself and burn to death with the ray of sunlight, it looks like she may in danger of being caught. After killing another victim that will blow her cover, Eli knows it is no longer to stay and tells Oskar she will have to go away, and he is devastated. In the end however she returns after saving his life from the returning bullies trying to drown him, she kills them all and the final scenes are of Oskar travelling somewhere by train, and he has a trunk that Eli is inside as protection from sunlight, communicating by Morse code. Also starring Henrik Dahl as Erik, Peter Carlberg as Lacke, Ika Nord as Virginia, Mikael Rahm as Jocke, Karl-Robert Lindgren as Gösta and Anders T. Peedu as Morgan. Hedebrant is really good as the young outcast boy who needs friendship, and of course Leandersson is marvellous as the mysterious girl with the deadly secret and a sensitive side, it is a film with some good shocks, and also an appealing story, a most watchable horror. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language. Very good!",Let the Right One In
10,Woodyanders,Injects fresh blood and startling emotion into the vampire horror genre,9,20 September 2017,"Bullied misfit teenager Oskar (a fine and affecting performance by Karle Hedebrant) befriends new neighbor Eli (a haunting and deeply moving portrayal by Lina Leandersson), who's a pallid and enigmatic young lass who only comes out at night. Could Eli be responsible for a spate of disappearances in the area? Director Tomas Alfredson, working from a thoughtful and original script by John Ajvide Lindqvist, relates the engrossing story at a deliberate pace, ably crafts a potently unsettling gloom-doom atmosphere, makes excellent use of the bleak wintry landscape, and grounds the fantastic premise in a plausibly drab mundane reality. Moreover, Alfredson warrants additional praise for keeping the graphic gore to a refreshing minimum and eschewing cheap jump scares in favor of creating and sustaining a quietly discomfiting melancholy tone instead. Better still, the touching friendship between the two oddball main characters gives this picture a surprisingly substantial amount of poignancy and resonance complete with a strong central message on the basic human need for companionship and the bitter lonely price one must pay for immortality. Kudos are also for both Johan Soderquist's spare moody score and Hoyte Van Hoytema's striking widescreen cinematography. An absolute corker.",Let the Right One In
11,Tweekums,A beautiful film about a young vampire and her friend,10,6 August 2009,"I'd heard lots of good things about about this film so ordered the DVD as soon as it was listed, when it arrived I was not disappointed. ""Let the Right One In"" is different to any other vampire film I've seen; instead of the vampire appearing to be superhuman she appears to be a vulnerable young girl, there are no ""transformation scenes"" where her fangs grow, in fact we never see her looking anything other than like a young girl.Oskar is a young boy who is being bullied by a group of boys at school, his life changes when Eli, a girl of about his age, moves in next door. There is something different about Eli, even though there is snow all around she doesn't wear warm clothes and doesn't appear to feel the cold and is only out at night. As the film progresses a friendship develops and Oskar learns that Eli isn't the same as other girls but he doesn't seem to mind. While they are getting closer the local population is understandably starting to get concerned about the increasing number of strange deaths in the area.Kåre Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson perform brilliantly as Oskar and Eli their make difficult roles seem completely natural and very tender. They really make the viewer care for their characters. The supporting cast are good too, it is nice to see a film that is populated by real people, none of them are the beautiful people one would have expected if this were a Hollywood production. The opening was fairly slow and I feared it might be boring but as the film progressed I realised that the slow start had in fact served to draw me in and care for the characters so when the action increased and they were endangered I cared for them more than I may have done otherwise.I'd strongly recommend this film to anybody who isn't disturbed by the sight of blood, it is a beautiful and tender story which doesn't rely on excessive CGI and explosions.",Let the Right One In

13,BA_Harrison,A very twisted love story.,8,2 April 2012,"Let The Right One In is an impeccably directed coming-of-age vampire tale from Sweden that deals with pre-adolescent angst and young love in a delicate, dreamlike manner—hardly the sort of horror movie I usually opt for, but one that I decided to watch on account of the many rave reviews it has garnered. Fortunately, this ain't Scandinavia's answer to the sappy Twilight series as I feared it might be: it IS a poetic movie that deals sensitively with tender emotional issues, but it's one that also does so in a surprisingly brutal and disturbing way.12-year-old loner Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant), the movie's central character, harbours violent vengeful thoughts against the thugs who have been tormenting him at school. One evening, while playing in the snowy courtyard outside his mother's apartment, he befriends a girl named Eli (Lina Leandersson), a kindred melancholy spirit who successfully encourages him to fight back against his persecutors.Misfits Eli and Oskar gradually develop feelings for each other, feelings that continue even when Oskar discovers that, not only is Eli a vampire destined to spend eternity as a 12-year-old, but 'she' isn't a she after all, but rather a boy masquerading as a girl (possibly because he will be perceived as less threatening as a female, although the fact that Eli has castrated himself suggests to me that he was frustrated knowing that he could never become a man and decided to hack off his redundant equipment. Either way, it's pretty f**ked up).This tragic, touching, and twisted love story proves uncomfortable viewing due to the leads' tender age and the film's freaky gender revelation (an unexpected close-up of Eli's genital scars driving home the point), and the film is made all the more shocking thanks to several sudden explosive acts of violence that belie the film's 15 certificate status: we get a young lad suspended by his feet before having his throat cut; savage vampire attacks that result in a very bloody Eli; a man with his face melted by acid; a female victim bursting into flames in front of her husband; and a gruesome finale in a swimming pool that sees severed body parts turn the water turn bright red. All this and not a sparkly vampire in sight!",Let the Right One In
14,Coventry,"You are twelve, forever going on thirteen, baby it's time to drink  blood",7,3 May 2009,"""Let the Right one in"" was one of my most anticipated viewings at the most recent Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Films, mainly due to the incredibly praising reviews all over the internet and the truckload of awards and recognitions this Swedish production already received since it first hit the global festival circuit less than one year ago. I expected a genuine masterpiece and, even though from many viewpoints that is exactly what I received, I can't help feeling a little bit disappointed with the outcome. Don't get me wrong, I was rooting for a slow-paced, emotional and unconventional vampire movie, but honestly didn't expect it to be this slow & melancholic toned. When you're watching this movie it might take a little while before you can make the mental switch in your head; acknowledging the vampire and horror themes represent only a very small part in what is primarily a 'Coming of Age' story and an allegory on how children in their earliest stage of puberty deal with loneliness, rejection, tender friendship and developing hormones. Much more than a captivating story, this is a beautiful and stunningly accomplished production with a unique personality. Tomas Alfredson's direction is balanced and skillful throughout, and he could rely on a highly professional team of crew members like Hoyte from Hoytema (what's in a name) for the superb cinematography and Johan Söderqvist to deliver a marvelously enchanting musical score. The depressing Swedish weather conditions and the spot-on depiction of typical suburban mentality also contribute a great deal in making ""Let the Right One in"" a truly absorbing and hypnotizing yet nevertheless laborious viewing experience. Twelve year old Oskar righteously feels alone in the world. He's the target of mockery at school and doesn't even find parental shelter at home, since his parents are divorced and neither of them foresees much quality time with him. When Oskar finally finds the courage to approach the newly moved in girl next door, a special and tantalizing friendship slowly unfolds. But the girl – Eli – has even far more troublesome issues than Oskar, as she's a roaming vampire with an indispensable need for human blood and the eternal struggles to obtain it. I won't go into too much detail regarding the plot, as it might raise the wrong expectations. The events as they further occur might sound boring and mundane, but they definitely aren't. ""Let the Right One in"" is just an indescribable and strangely unsettling film because you can't possibly predict what will happen next at any given point throughout the film. It's compelling and mentally challenging. Those qualities will unquestionably be lost in the already scheduled American remake, so do yourself a favor and catch the Swedish original as soon as you can. It might not turn out to be what you expect or hope to see, but it will nevertheless remain a worthwhile and unforgettable experience.",Let the Right One In
15,michaelRokeefe,A very strange relationship.,4,5 August 2009,"Dark and cold atmosphere. A bit slow, but well filmed. Oskar(Kare Hedebrant)is a 12 year-old boy that seems weak, anxious and afraid to face each day. He is daily abused, bullied by the much stronger of his classmates and he can only contemplate how to strike back. Suddenly circumstances start to change when the lonely boy's wish for a friend comes true. A pale girl named Eli(Lina Leandersson)moves into the apartment next door. Very peculiar, overly serious, she only comes out at night and the near freezing weather doesn't effect her. Unexplained disappearances and gruesome murders begin to happen. The introverted Oscar has entered a odd romantic relationship with Eli that has mysteriously given him the power to confront his aggressors. Life becomes more confusing for Oskar as he finally must face the facts about his strange girlfriend. Expect bloody violence and disturbing images; and all that comes with an R rating.",Let the Right One In
16,sunwarrior13,A Classic Swedish Film,10,22 October 2012,"Let the Right One In is a horror film directed by Tomas Alfredson and it is based on the novel of the same title by John Ajvide Lindqvist, who also wrote the screenplay.It features Kåre Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson together with Per Ragnar,Henrik Dahl,Karin Bergquist,Peter Carlberg,Ika Nord and Mikael Rahm. The movie tells the story of a bullied 12-year-old boy who develops a friendship with a vampire child in Blackeberg, a suburb of Stockholm, in the early 1980's. Alfredson, unconcerned with the horror and vampire conventions, decided to tone down many elements of the novel and focus primarily on the relationship between the two main characters. A 12-year-old boy befriends a mysterious young girl whose appearance in town suspiciously coincides with a horrifying series of murders. Oskar is a young boy who can't seem to shake off the local bullies, but all of that begins to change when a new neighbor moves in next door. After striking up an innocent friendship with his eccentric next-door neighbor, Oskar realizes that she is the vampire responsible for the recent rash of deaths around town. Despite the danger, however, Oskar's friendship with the girl ultimately takes precedence over his fear of her. Calling to mind the work of Anne Rice and Stephen King, atmospheric adaptation of Swedish author John Ajvide Lindqvist's bestseller is well directed by his countryman Tomas Alfredson as he reinvigorates the seemingly tired vampire genre by effectively mixing scares with intelligent storytelling.Beautifully shot, moving yet unsentimental, restrained in tone and consummately performed, it is a horror film of near universal appeal, and already has the feel of a classic about it.",Let the Right One In
17,Scarecrow-88,Let the Right One In,8,15 March 2009,"I often read how the horror genre has no hope and that it's practically dead or on life-support, then a movie like LET THE RIGHT ONE IN comes along and dispels such nonsense. It has the traditional vampire traits we're accustomed to, yet is presented in an unconventional, low-key way that's refreshing and spellbinding..partially due to the wintry, depressing setting, while also hypnotic in it's visual presentation. Director Tomas Alfredson deliberately paces this movie, allowing the young leads and their stories to captivate and grip you. The blossoming romance of lonely scrawny Oskar(Kåre Hedebrant), a quiet, reserved boy whose bullied by a mean little turd named Conny(Patrik Rydmark), who, of course, runs with a couple of droogs allowing him to gang up on the kid, just mistreating him for giggles. Oskar, brimming with calm anger, imitates, with his knife, Conny in a victim's position, longing to pay him back for his aggravating antics day in and day out. Oskar befriends a new neighbor, a vampire ""girl"" named Eli(Lina Leandersson, whose face will become an iconic image in horror for years to come)who uses an older gentleman to get her a blood supply..hunting humans around the surrounding area of the small city, the man uses an anesthetic to drop victims, stringing them upside, slitting their throat as the blood drains in a funnel into a jug. But Eli's serial killing supplier has become sloppy(..he fails in one attempt to gather blood in an isolated forest due to a dog which got away from it's owner, and unfortunately selects a basketball playing student whose awaiting friends in a gym room)and is soon caught right before slicing a victim's throat, pouring acid over his face in a suicide attempt. As the film continues, Eli will forge a bond with Oskar while her predatory instincts leads to a series of events which will put her in danger. As far as Oskar's situation with Conny, he agrees to fight back thanks in part to a pact with Eli..if his situation becomes difficult due to a strength in numbers scenario, she has promised to help him.I was thoroughly impressed with the central performances of Hedebrant and Leandersson who are the featured characters all the way through. What might frustrate some more impatient horror fans is the way the film is methodically paced paying special attention to Oskar and Eli, and their developing relationship and how these two become indebted to one another. While the film is off-beat in it's approach to vampirism, Eli is shown feeding on locals, her hunger causing great agony(..we actually hear a guttural growl when Eli is needing blood, and her face becomes discolored and drained of life)as well as her amazing abilities to climb, not needing the same kind of winter wardrobe Oskar does(..it's rather amusing how she often walks barefoot with short-sleeve shirts, even moving around at times with no pants). The film pays careful attention to Oskar's reactions to his new friend and her unusual nature..and their conversations are warm without being sugary, which is a difficult feat accomplished with skill. A very fluid camera, director Alfredson often shoots characters from afar, letting the events transpire from a distance, allowing the atmosphere and mood of the setting to make as much impact as the story itself. The entire environment, the characters and their home, achieves the same tone throughout..bewitching but sad. At it's core, I felt the power of friendship is what makes this movie as appealing and alarming in equal measure..appealing because of two lonely hearts finding a love for one another, but alarming in that their friendship is forged through blood and death. The ending, as Oskar's life is threatened, is a powerful yet horrifying scene because we in fact see what Eli meant by having the ability to help him if he could not defend himself. Kudos to the filmmakers for allowing this story a chance to work it's spell over us, but without the beautiful performances from the two young leads, it could only work to a certain extent, if at all.",Let the Right One In
18,preppy-3,Boring and silly coming of age story...with vampires!,1,29 November 2008,"Terrible Scandanavian film. 12 year old Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is bullied at school. 12 year old Eli (Lina Leandersson) moves next door to him. She tells Oskar that they can't be friends...or lovers. It turns out she's a vampire. Naturally they DO fall in love and some ridiculous complications ensure.This seems to have a lot of admirers but I can't figure out why. The movie moves at a snails pace (I considered leaving a few times), is incredibly boring (I was fighting to stay awake) and the two young actors are pretty dreadful. The movie does a few things right--you never SEE the killings but hear them (making them even more disturbing) and there is a nice music score. But this movie is just plain dull. I saw every single plot point coming from a mile away. The only somewhat original bit was what happens when Oskar DOESN'T invite Eli into his house. It fails as a horror film and a coming of age film--it adds nothing new to either genre! Slow movies CAN work but not in this case. I saw this at an art cinema where most films are applauded when they end. This was met with dead silence. Boring and pointless. A 1 all the way.",Let the Right One In

A young girl named Eli (Lina Leandersson) & a man named Håkan (Per Ragnar), soon after a dead body is found nearby & it turns out that Håkan kills for Eli who is actually a Vampire & needs fresh human blood to survive. Oskar & Eli form a close a friendship & Eli helps Oskar cope with school bullies while Oskar learns to accept Eli for who & what she is...This Sweedish production was directed by Tomas Alfredson & was based upon a book called Let the Right One In first published in 2004 by Sweedish author John Ajvide Lindqvist who also wrote the screenplay for this adaptation, Let the Right One In has a glowing reputation as some sort of masterpiece but contrary to popular opinion I didn't like it that much at all. At one hour & fifty four minutes long it felt like Let the Right One In went on for days, I found the whole thing very tedious & I just couldn't get into it at all. The central theme of the film is more about friendship rather than Gothic Vampirie horror, from the setting to the tender & close friendship that forms & develops throughout the film to an ending where the two main character's have forged a strong bond Let the Right One In is more of a sentimental drama than a horror film. It's never even made clear whether Eli's actions were manipulative to get Oskar to be her new helper or whether it was just the result of two lonely children's friendship for each other, the script goes to great lengths to show the tenderness & bond between Eli & Oskar & maybe because it's so heartfelt that's why many like it but that type of film just isn't my cup of tea. I am sure many will use the intellectual argument here & say it's an intelligent film rather than a shallow Hollywood horror but so what? If I don't like the thing & find myself bored who cares that manages to convey a somewhat tragic relationship? Dialogue is minimal & a fair amount of the film is ambiguous & left to the viewer to decide, some may like it that way while other's won't.Let the Right One In is nicely shot, director Alfredson lingers on shots for ages, it's a very quiet film with little music or noise although he does try to inject a few shock moments into it like the ending, a woman burning up & a man being hung upside down & bled. Shot mainly at night in a snow covered town the whole film feels drab & ordinary which I am sure was intentional, I am sure the makers wanted a very average & realistic feel to the film. The film uses various classic Vampire clichés like a Vampire having to be invited in, flying Vampires, neck biting & burning when exposed to sunlight. There's a bit of gore, there's some blood splatter, a guy has a melted face & there's a severed arm. Stylishly shot & even maybe a little artsy at times Let the Right One In needs to be seen in widescreen, Alfredson deliberately frames a lot of his shots with distinct images & objects at the far edges of the frame & usually there is something to look at or take note of.With an estimated budget roughly amounting to about $4,000,000 this is very well made with nice clean, simple yet clever & effective photography but if the pace was any slower Let the Right One In would go backwards. The acting is good, the subtitles are alright although one can never quite be sure if they are exact translations.Let the Right One In is a film I keep hearing people cream themselves over & I just can't see why. The two leads were dull, the story slightly depressing & off-putting & the pace is as slow as they come. I can respect it for what it is but Let the Right One In definitely didn't float my boat. The American remake Let Me In (2010) is in the can & will be released shortly.",Let the Right One In
20,Bunuel1976,"LET THE RIGHT ONE IN (Tomas Alfredson, 2008) ***1/2",8,15 March 2010,"I was instantly intrigued by this modern vampire 'classic', so I opted to check it out when the first opportunity arose; however, I made the mistake of reading about the film beforehand, so that many of its remarkable scenes did not surprise me – though I could still appreciate their visceral impact. Lina Leandersson makes for one of the most memorable screen bloodsuckers, all the more effective for being a mere 13 year-old! Still, I would venture to say that that the film's greatest quality is not for any radical re-imagining of the vampire myth but rather because it has one of the most tender love stories ever depicted at its core! In this respect, the performances of the two leads are extremely appealing – with the sexual tension at work (also relating to the vampire's real gender!) recalling the similar, albeit period-set, VALERIE AND HER WEEK OF WONDERS (1970). Being a Scandinavian production, the look and approach is typically austere (complete with moody underscoring) – which may not please hardcore genre buffs, but there are certainly any number of classic horror sequences along the way: a middle-aged man siphoning the blood of a young male victim he has hung upside down in the woods; later, caught at the same task, he destroys his own face by acid; however, when the vampire girl visits him in hospital, he gives his neck willingly to her, after which she nonchalantly drops him out the window; a man is attacked in a tunnel; a passing woman falls victim to the silent predator underneath a bridge; having survived, the former is subsequently assaulted by a bunch of cats (made to look more ferocious by discreet use of CGI); rejecting her newly-acquired vampire legacy, she perishes in a spontaneous daytime combustion; when the boy innocently proposes a blood pact with the girl, she feverishly licks the drops of blood off the floor!; when a man who has lost two close acquaintances to the vampire attempts to get even, the boy saves her skin; she returns the favor by eliminating the kids who had bullied him all through the picture in a subtle but brilliantly-conceived (and crowd-pleasing) climax, after which he becomes her protector. Even so, confusion is not avoided throughout: in a couple of instances, the girl visibly ages (for which no explanation is given); towards the end, the boy takes in the girl (or he goes to live with her, it is not clear) but we are never told where his parents had gone to in the interim; then, after the girl's brush with death, the mother suddenly re-appears and she chastises the boy for something or other (the scene is presented M.O.S. from outside the window). While the film amply demonstrates that there is life in the horror genre yet, the same enthusiasm cannot be addressed towards its inevitable upcoming Americanization (even if it is to be helmed by the ground-breaking CLOVERFIELD [2008]'s Matt Reeves)",Let the Right One In

I found it slow to get into its stride and initially all the characters seemed as cold as the Swedish locale but gradually it warmed up. At its heart is a burgeoning relationship between two twelve-year olds - or one twelve-year-old and one of indeterminate age. Even at such tender years both have problems, not least hunger in more than one sense of the word. They nurture their relationship against a background of murders which seem hardly to impinge on the community of which they are a part. No one is questioned, no one is even followed by police and the fact that the viewer is privy to the killings is neither here nor there. There are scenes that could be construed as horrific but they verge very close to the risible, provoking mirth rather than terror. The two central performances are exceptional but may be one-offs, not unlike that of Bobby Henrey in The Fallen Idol, rather than the beginnings of fine careers.",Let the Right One In

23,zardoz-13,Squeal Little Piggy!,10,5 October 2010,"""Let The Right One In"" is an atmospheric Swedish vampire thriller about a harmless, skinny, little, 12-year old blond boy named Oskar (KÃ¥re Hedebrant) who gets picked on at his elementary school by three classmates that love to bully him. Director Tomas Alfredson has a keen, sensitive eye for details and uses the stark, snow-swept landscape to his benefit in manufacturing chills. The best thing about this vampire saga is that subtlety with which Alfredson depicts the violence. What sets this vampire saga apart from most is it unusual vampire, a little girl, who as she says is ""twelve, more or less,"" but she has been twelve for 200 years True, ""Interview with a Vampire"" contained a little girl vampire, but the focus in ""Let The Right One In"" is strictly on the little girl and her odd relationships with not only the protagonist Oskar but also with older men. Oskar lives with his mom in an apartment complex. One of the new tenants, who only comes out at night, turns out to be a little brunette girl, Eli (Lina Leandersson), and she wants to be his friend. Initially, Eli warns Oskar that she cannot be his friend, but things change after a while. Repeatedly, Eli warns Oskar that she is not a female. Oskar has no idea what Eli means because she is a female. Nevertheless, an older man who searches for prey for Eli has to abandon a fresh corpse that he has just strung by the heels so he can drain it of its blood for Eli. She ventures out and attacks a man under a bridge. Later, the guardian drags the corpse off to a lake. Meantime, Oskar dreams about revenge on the bullies, and he has a knife, but he is too much of a coward to do anything more than dream. Eli urges him to stand up for himself so Oskar embarks on a weight-lifting course. Oskar finally stands up for himself and strikes the bully on the side of the face, tearing open an ear with a stick. Of course, mom is none too pleased with this behavior and pop calls Oskar up. The guardian of Eli tries to drain another corpse, but the authorites arrest him, and he disfigures himself by pouring acid onto his face. Later, Eli shows up at the hospital and rescues him; however, it is rescue by death. Anyway, Oskar and Eli become close friends. One evening Eli attacks Virginia (Ika Nord) on her way home from a diner. She does not get a chance to finish the job, and Virginia turns into a vampire. Naturally, Virginia has no idea what has happened to her. She visits her boyfriend and the roommate of her boyfriend is shocked when the three cats that they own attack Virginia. The cats latch on to her shoulder and legs, sinking their claws and fangs in, as she scrambles out of the apartment. The next day Virginia asks an orderly to open the drapes to her room and she promptly vanishes in a blaze. The bullies attack Oskar near the end. An older bully forces Oskar to hold his breath for three minutes. We are in the pool watching bubbles of air dribble out of Oskar when the forearm of the bully detaches itself as a bloody stump.""Let The Right One In"" refers to the seldom observed vampire dictum that a fangster has to obtain permission from the occupant of a room before it can enter. Oskar and Eli become close friends. At one point, an intruder invades the apartment where the ageless 12-year sleeps snugly in bundles of blankets in the bathtub, but Oskar thwarts him. Slow-moving yarn brims with atmosphere and good performances, but you need to watch it with the subtitles on because LET THE RIGHT ONE IN has been atrociously dubbed so that the words do not match the lips. A minor classic that is worth watching.",Let the Right One In
24,Boba_Fett1138,"Horror for all generations, that treats its audience, both you and old, seriously.",8,11 August 2012,"Sweden always have been at the top of the game when it comes down to movies directed toward children. What makes Swedish movies great is the fact that they aren't holding back and shows things how they really are. They are often realistic movies that takes its audience serious and doesn't belittle them by putting in any fluffy stuff.Let me just say that this probably was a movie I would have loved seeing as a 12-year old. People too easily think that horror scares or even damages children, while in fact lots of kids are really into it, without any of them becoming serial killers, or anything like that, later on in life. It's just a form of escapism and fantasy if you will and I applaud this movie for combining a typical Swedish movie about youth with horror elements.It in fact feels like a very realistic movie while watching. It's because it's a about real kids, with real average kid like problems and wishes. It's really not necessarily being a vampire movie. It's just something that plays a role in the movie but not just the one main thing the movie focuses on. There is a whole lot more going on in it, which has everything to do with being young and growing up.And this movie is all about its kids really. The camera also mostly focuses just on them, even in the scenes that also involved adults. Kind of reminded me of the approach ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"" used, in which no adult's faces are ever shown, except for it's most important supporting characters.There constantly is a great atmosphere present throughout this movie, which is dark and gritty. I believe this was something that truly added to the movie and the story it was telling, as well as to its overall realism. Besides, it's all great looking! This is definitely a capably made movie, in which a lot of time and effort went in to.It actually is a pretty subtle made movie. It doesn't ever overly explains anything and it takes its time as well to setup- and tell things. It's definitely a slower type of movie, without it ever becoming a boring one.And don't just think that because the movie is about- and features kids in the leading roles it's being a movie for kids only as well. The movie takes its audience, both young and old, very seriously and has plenty of elements for every age group in it to enjoy. It never gets too childish for adults and it never gets too heavy for kids. It's being a somewhat gory movie but it all serves a purpose in the movie its story, so it's not put in to just shock or scare its audience. Saying that this is a horror movie more has to do with the movie its themes and atmosphere, rather than any scary or gory moments that are in it.

25,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,See how smart a vampire story can be?,10,7 February 2010,"They really do not have to be exploitative and formulaic. This is like no other film about the mythical being that I've seen in my life. I have not read the novel, but I understand that a lot of it is semi-auto-biographical, and that, as is to be expected, it had to be condensed as well as censored for this adaptation(the essence of the book, I hear, is intact). Oskar is a social outcast. Then one day, he meets Eli. The main focus of this is their friendship, and as has most likely already been said countless times, they are unbelievably cute together. Seriously, if it doesn't put a smile on your face and bring warmth to your heart, you must be very cynical and/or be put off by the presence of something that doesn't exist in the real world. Every acting performance in this is excellent, and the children are absolutely stunning. No matter the challenge or requirement, and even in the least forgiving close-ups, they come through and do not cease to be convincing for a single frame of this. The characters are well-written, layered and credible. Every relationship and bit of dialog, including for the kids, is entirely realistic. Simply put, this is compelling and engaging, and my eyes were glued to the screen for all of it. The editing and cinematography are amazing, and this at no point shows too much or not enough. I would say that those looking for a horror film, at least if that's their primary reason for watching this, may find themselves disappointed. It's not meant to be, though there is thick tension and suspense in several portions of it. This isn't for everyone, and the squeamish or easily offended should especially think twice. Is it wish fulfillment, composed by someone who maybe didn't love their pre-teen years? To an extent, arguably. However, it's got more than enough substance to make up for it. There is plenty of disturbing content, a moderate amount of brutal, bloody violence, a little strong language(apparently; I don't understand a ton of Swedish) and extremely brief nudity. The DVD contains a funny and interesting commentary track(with one instance of swearing) with the author and the director(in English, thank god), 5 minutes of deleted scenes and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to anyone who can imagine liking it from what I have described here; anyone who has ever felt like an outsider should definitely try a viewing.

The young boy, Oskar (Kare Hedebrant), is a bullied kid and Eli (Lina Leandersson) is a recluse. Although there is not much to Oskar there is a lot more than meets the eye to Eli. The two of them meet and slowly grow upon one another.This is my challenge to you: watch the movie and not adore the two of them. Watch it and not have your heart gravitate to the both of them.

He's horribly bullied at school and sees his dad only once in a while. He has no friends that we see. He seems to have an unhealthy and unleashed propensity for violence, and he keeps a scrapbook full of clippings about grisly murders. Maybe it's for all of those reasons that he's willing to so quickly accept the friendship of Eli, a little girl who also happens to be a vampire.""Let the Right One In"" is not a vampire movie in the traditional sense, but given that I was surprised at the amount of vampire horror the movie contains. We see vampire attacks, we see Eli scaling walls, we see vampires attacked by cats and bursting into flames at the sight of sunlight. However, at the heart of the film is an aching, wistful story about two outcasts who find each other, and the fact that one of them is a vampire becomes almost incidental. Eli could just be an awkward little 12-year-old nerd like Oskar and the story wouldn't have to be much different.The movie is dazzlingly filmed. Hardly a scene goes by without some sort of striking image or composition, most notably a climactic scene set in a swimming pool. The scene ends in a moment of shocking violence, but it also manages to be eerily beautiful.And a word about the whole ""is Eli really a castrated boy"" argument swirling around this film. Apparently the book makes it explicitly clear that this is the case. But there is simply not enough evidence in the film to allow the viewer to make this intuitive leap if he/she hasn't read the book, so I believe that the director and writer left it ambiguous on purpose, so that you can take away what you want depending on whether or not you've read the source material.

The extremely long takes of silence or simply focusing on one specific image, the lack of energy in many of the scenes, the maddening way it takes forever to get everyone clued in to what's really happening despite it being plainly obvious from the start due to the type of attack a vampire initiates, it just really drags out and doesn't really have a lot of interesting things going on. The few attacks are awesome, including the cat attack and the resulting aftermath in the hospital, and the film does do a rather good job of employing a rather unused mode of vampire lore here, but it just can't help make up how boring it is.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Language, Brief Nudity, violence-against-animals and continuous themes of children-in-jeopardy.",Let the Right One In

The film is about a 12 year-old boy, Oskar, who suffers the brutality of bullies at school every day. He has no friends until one day he meets a strange girl who has just moved into his building. Her name is Eli, and she is a vampire. Much of the film is made up of the two kids bonding. They are both very interesting characters, and I've seen very few movies about tweens that understand their psychology quite as well as this one does. Unfortunately, whenever the film wanders from the intimacy between Eli and Oskar, it stumbles. While sating her hunger, Eli causes a huge mess with a group of boneheads at the edge of town. These characters exist solely to move the plot along (otherwise, frankly, the film wouldn't have one). At one point, a woman from this group becomes a vampire after Eli bites her. When she is exposed to sunlight, she bursts into flames. This doesn't seem to effect anyone else in the town save her husband.

31,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Let The Right One In,9,12 February 2009,"The cinematic vampires I've seen to date in cinemas recently have usually been the ramped up sexy versions, where it's either black leather on lithe female frames, or dreamy hunks to whom teenage girls would sacrifice their necks to in order to live with their lover boy forever.While the release of Twilight had made a lot of noise in the commercial theatres last year and raking in an obscene amount of money sending fan-girls into a frenzy, one vampire movie has been making its rounds very successfully in the film festival circuit, and the accolades garnered thus far have been nothing less than stellar. Come next week, you too will know why, as Let The Right One In (LTROI) gets its deserved commercial release here.LTROI is pared down to the very basics, and that in itself is a refreshing take thanks to John Ajvide Lindqvist's story and Tomas Alfredson's assured direction, both confident that there's absolutely no need for artificial spices to spruce up the film. We have the need for plasma for survival, the human type and not cherry ade from animals and tomatoes. Sunlight kills immediately and fiercely, not to introduce some industrial light and magic moments to glitter with sparkle dust. And their condition forces them to be in isolation, because killing sprees bring unwanted attention, but weakness from dawn to dusk means a caretaker is never far. Find out too what the title means, as I believe it's probably a step boldly taken to define certain consequences.The emotions of their two leads were relied on heavily to bring the narrative forward in what essentially is a very quiet film until feasting time. Eli (Lina Leandersson) arrives in a small town with her minder Hakan (Per Ragnar), who provides for a number moments filled with dark humour no thanks to the unfortunate situations he finds himself stuck in while preparing meals. Their neighbour is a timid boy Oskar (Kare Hedebrant), who has school playground politics problems because of the constant taunting from schoolmates, thus coasting through his existence imagining himself fighting back for some respect, but afraid to translate his bravado for real with that knife he carries around.Children are such that, with a certain degree of confidence, putting two-two together, you're likely to see a friendship being struck with little or no prejudice. Coming from lonely backgrounds, both strike an almost immediate friendship, despite Eli being able to come out only at night, and some very obvious hints of her nocturnal prowess. To Oskar, Eli is his first real friend who through love, gives him the courage and encouragement to face up to his demons. It's a tender love story between the two even after Oskar's discovery of the true identity of his best friend. But like best friends, such are secrets between themselves, and nothing in the world is going to change that.It's kinda terrifying knowing that the Oskar in a way condones the killings that Eli commits, and the direction here to show that is unflinching. Given the atmospherically quiet moments, it magnifies every point when the hunter snacks on its prey, with the patches of warm blood staining the pale white face of a child, thanks also to some nifty make up, and special effects where it mattered. The noisy violence is in stark contrast to its more touching moments, especially if one thinks that Hakan's life is a suggestion to what Oskar's would eventually be if he so decides to follow down the same slippery slope. The toning down of pedophilia, as does Eli's sexual ambiguity, allows for this thought to fester.I hate to do a comparison here between a truly great genre film and one that aspired to reach its heights, but I guess since many would be familiar with Twilight, allow me to indulge then why LTROI makes Twilight eat sparkle dust. For starters, the latter is your typical Hollywood blockbuster treatment where everything has to be explicitly shown and in verbatim. LTROI leaves it to the greatest tool you possess - your imaginative mind, and that in itself accentuates the level of horror that goes unseen, and giving that all round creepy feeling to it too.Twilight had a teenage angst romance that was quite childish. LTROI shows how the innocence of love could be miles more mature, with its tender moments here making Bella Swan and Edward Cullen look like adults with bored sex lives. Gone too are (what I deem now as) nonsensical pop and rock tunes peppering the aural track, and the clever use of silence (i.e. knowing when to shut up) served only to highlight genuine tension and impending doom. Yes LTROI is less showy, but miles more effective in its storytelling craft and technique.For a genuinely satisfying vampire movie, Let The Right One In nails it and deserves being Highly Recommended.P.S. Hollywood now wants to remake this. Now that's a truly terrifying thought!",Let the Right One In

It is, by all means, a story about love. Everything else is secondary.

And don't wait for the remake to come up, watch this one, because I can already imagine the overblown high-school drama and swept under the carpet blood scenes in the US remake.",Let the Right One In
35,Smells_Like_Cheese,Nothing else needs to be said: See this movie!,10,19 March 2012,"In the past few years we've had almost a dozen vampire movies come out. Some good and some bad, but nothing that was outstanding and could bring the seriousness back into the vampire mythology. Then came out a magnificent masterpiece called Let the Right One In. I have to admit something which I'm sure I'll get a lot of flack for, I did see the remake Let Me In first. I had the opportunity to see Let Me In before the original and absolutely fell in love with it. I heard that the original was much better though and without even thinking about it, I bought Let the Right One In. I watched it over the weekend and am in total awe of this movie. The story of two awkward dark young souls who find solace in each other and in some way complete one another is just so darkly beautiful. Oskar, a 12-year-old boy, resides with his single mother in the countryside. Oskar's classmates regularly bully him, and he spends his evenings imagining revenge. One night, he meets Eli, who appears to be a pale girl of his age. Eli has recently moved into the next-door apartment to Oskar with an older man, Håkan. Eli initially informs Oskar that they cannot be friends. However, over time, they begin to form a close relationship, and the two exchanging Morse code messages through their wall. Håkan requests that Eli stop seeing Oskar. After questioning Oskar about a cut on his cheek, Eli learns from Oskar about his being bullied by schoolmates and encourages him to stand up for himself. Eli goes to Oskar's apartment and spends the night with him, during which time they agree to ""go steady"". Eli says, ""I'm not a girl"", but Oskar ignores it. Oskar shows Eli a private place he knows. Unaware that Eli is a vampire, Oskar suggests that they form a blood bond, and cuts his hand, asking Eli to do the same. Eli, thirsting for blood but not wanting to harm Oskar, laps up his spilt blood before running away. But now Oskar wonders if he should leave or protect Eli.The actors are just outstanding and I applaud our two young lead actors: Kåre Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson. They took on these difficult roles that many older actors could never grasp the depth that these two young adults gave the characters. Their chemistry is amazing and keep you guessing on what their relationship is about. Is Eli using Oskar for protection? Is Oskar using Eli to gain the self esteem that he needed to become stronger against his bullies? Maybe both, or maybe they do genuinely love each other. I found Eli to be a much stronger and more menacing character than in Let Me In where Abby played it more human, Eli was a monster who had no regard for human life. That's what I was missing as no matter what way you look at her, Eli is a vampire, a demon. The vampires in this film are not ""pity me, we know not what we do"" vampires. They are vampires trying to survive as if they did exist in the real world. They don't have a ton of money, they aren't gorgeous, they are not even that charming. Let the Right One In shows that being a vampire isn't romantic, it's rough, it's about survival.This is easily one of the best horror movies of all time and I'm grateful to the makers of this film and the writer of the book for bring scary back to vampires. This story is dramatic, dark, romantic and ultimately heart breaking when you think of the characters and their back stories. The cinematography is astounding, instead of darker rooms, they're bright and ironically alive with the color of red standing for what Eli needs to eat to live. The direction of the film was wonderful and consistent. I really did love the remake Let Me In, but something about Let the Right One In seemed to be more on top of the story and knew how to tell it perfectly. It's one of the best vampire films of the past decade and really set the bar high. Not since Interview with the Vampire have we had such a great movie about vampires where we are invited into their world and discover the excitement and pain of living forever.10/10",Let the Right One In
36,Red-Barracuda,A great combination of a coming-of-age drama with a visceral vampire tale,9,15 August 2016,"Set in the 80's in the Stockholm suburbs, a socially outcast adolescent boy called Oskar befriends a new neighbour, an enigmatic teenage girl called Eli. Her arrival in town coincides with a series of violent murders. Before long Oskar realises this girl is in fact a vampire. This Swedish entry in the vampire genre has been rightly praised as one of the best. One of the main reasons for this is that it modernises the sub-genre while still playing the vampire myth completely straight. To this end we have a vampire who cannot enter a house without being invited in and who cannot go out in daylight. But these traditional ideas are rendered in newly brilliant ways here, with blood pouring out of Eli's eyes when she enters a house without permission and a vampire bursting into flames when hit by sunbeams. While the various vampire attacks are pretty visceral but accompanied by great effects work showing the vampire leap around in inhuman ways. By playing the horror elements straight and being respectful to vampire lore, the film is more successful as a whole.Aside from the horror element, this is a coming-of-age drama. It focuses on themes of alienation and bullying. It works so very well because the two young actors at its centre are excellent. Kåre Hedebrant plays the ostracised Oskar perfectly, while Lina Leandersson as the vampire Eli is even more impressive in a performance where she elicits wisdom well beyond her years. The film is interesting in that it portrays these characters as clearly sympathetic, yet we still know perfectly well that they both are engaging in some atrocious acts. This gives the film an unusual dramatic dynamic. Let the Right One In is certainly a lot more character-driven than horror films usually are and it works just as strongly as a drama as it does a horror movie, something it shares with the classic movie Carrie (1976).Technically it's very good with very well rendered effects and fine cinematography. It also benefits considerably from its unusual snowy environment which adds quite a bit of atmosphere in itself. The night time vampire attacks are notable for happening in such a quiet, snow-bound, suburban landscape. It's quite a contrast to the types of places we generally see vampires operating. The film is quite deliberately paced and this may be an issue for some viewers but it does not disappoint once it gets to its climax at a swimming pool; a scene executed extremely cleverly and one which is very hard to forget in its inventiveness. The scene after that has Oskar happily travelling away on a train oblivious to the fact that he is starting a new life as Eli's caretaker. It seems tragically inevitable that he will grow old murdering people in order to supply Eli with blood. He has been deliberately chosen to replace the old man Eli arrived with at the start of the film, an old man that you now realise was once a troubled young boy like Oskar who one night met a mysterious 12 year old girl",Let the Right One In
37,KineticSeoul,It did so much with so little,9,8 October 2009,"Some people compare this movie as being a ""Twilight"" double, but I highly disagree. This movie is a artistic masterpiece, it may not have a lot of action going on but it still gets to you in a good way. This is a thought provoking movie that should be viewed more than once and I rarely watch movies more than once, but I couldn't help but watch this movie again. This is not just another vampire flick, it is a original and very dark and the style and cinematography is beautifully done. This movie may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I still highly recommend everyone to check it out never the less. I just wish it stayed a bit closer to the novel, but besides that this film did so much with so little.9.2/10",Let the Right One In
38,Buddy-51,atmospheric horror romance,7,22 March 2009,"What do you get when you cross a vampire story with a tender tale of impossible love? If you answered ""Twilight,"" then you haven't seen ""Let the Right One In,"" a Swedish horror movie with an art-house sheen.Oskar (the excellent Kare Hedebrant) is the twelve-year-old schoolboy who's the perpetual target of a trio of bullies; Eli (the equally fine Lina Leandersson) is the fetching young vampire who moves into the apartment next door. Together, these two social outcasts form a powerful emotional bond, with Eli hiding the truth about herself from Oskar till the point where she no longer can.Written by John Ajvide Lindqvist (who adapted his own novel) and directed by Tomas Alfredson, ""Let the Right One In"" is less concerned with the blood-and-guts aspects of the scenario than with the pain and remorse each of the main characters experiences throughout the course of the drama. Though obviously craving a ""normal"" life, Eli is hopelessly trapped by her own nature, forced to endure a life of loneliness and killing simply to survive in the world. Oskar is equally alone, though for more prosaic reasons. In addition to the constant bullying, Oskar is a product of a broken home, and like Eli, he too may finally have to resort to violence to ensure his existence. Then there's Eli's father who numbly and methodically performs the gruesome bloodletting rituals he knows he must if his daughter is to survive.There's a genuine poignancy in the fact that Eli knows that she can never give herself fully to Oskar for fear of consigning him to the same murderous fate she herself must endure. A similar sense of twisted pathos pervades Eli's relationship with her father, who carries paternalistic duty to a whole new, genuinely disturbing level.All of this is played out against stark, sparsely-furnished, minimalist settings that provide an appropriately atmospheric backdrop for the story being told.As ""art"" horror films go, this one is not quite as bone-chilling or as memorable as the truly diabolical ""Funny Games,"" but it still provides a welcome respite from all those inane, studio-manufactured products we're forced to endure on a regular basis when Hollywood sets its sights on terror.",Let the Right One In
39,thesar-2,Let this one into your home,9,22 March 2009,"Ah, it's great to be back with the old Vampire rules  can't enter a residence without an invite, sunlight actually does harm, you stay the age you're at when transformed, they can fly! they can fly! they can fly! and yes, vampires do feed off of human blood. Though somewhat a slow-moving picture, 'Let the Right One In' strongly delivers if followed through to the closing and is quite possibly one of the most original and real-life vampire movies I've ever seen. It was also a touching coming-of-age film with real-life problems facing a 12-year-old boy, as I was once. I've read complaints of the dubbing and once I placed the DVD in, it certainly did have its fair share of bad dubbing. In fact, I originally thought this was in subtitles and 35 minutes into it, I checked the menu and changed it to the subtitles. Take note: do that first to fully enjoy the feature. Though it creeps at times, it always seems to turn brutally graphic, as if to remind the audience the real nature of the vampire and what movie they're watching. Though I have little patience for movies that drag, I appreciated when the film had something to say or show, it made a huge impact  i.e. the swimming pool in the closing (though that was predictable, I loved how it was shot and the reminder on not to get too comfortable, as unlike 'Twilight,' it's not all about just love and people starring at each other for hours.) Highly recommended, especially to stick through the end as it all ties in. Many unanswered plot points came to light after my viewing and I admire them not just stopping throughout to tell us the storyline or twists. They respect us enough to figure them out ourselves.",Let the Right One In

41,ElMaruecan82,"Trust the Swedish to beautifully and smartly reinvent the ""vampire"" genre...",9,12 January 2020,"I was reluctant to use ""vampire"" in the title for I thought the film was better left without any specific knowledge of its main theme... but then how could I properly review Tomas Alfredson's ""Let The Right One In"" without mentioning what it's all about?But let's not beat around the bush: the film is a vampire movie and one of the best of its genres because it subverts every known archetype without averting any and that's only one of the facets of a multi-layered but not complex and surprisingly easy-to-follow movie, set in the early 80s.Oskar is a young boy, 12 or 13, effeminate looking, the son of divorced parents, constantly bullied by a pint-sized kid named Conny and a few other followers who call him ""pig"" and make ""squealing"" noises and rude contacts whenever they have a chance. The film opens with the line ""I bet you can squeal like a pig"", that indicates how nightmarish Oskar's life is and makes us hope for a 'deliverance'. Watching him half-naked and reaching the window with his hand, I was reminded of that opening scene in ""Persona"" but Ebert rightfully recalls a similar moment in ""The Silence"" and I guess Bergman could have made that film, the hand to the window conveying the Bergmanian entrapment in a meaningless life.Indeed, Oskar spends his time between his separated parents, neither of them appearing to be helpful or understanding, and his solo actions consists on imagining the right comeuppance to his bullies, which any kid in that situation might relate to. Now, why having a bullied kid in a vampire movie? The answer is in the question.We don't see Eli before she meets Oskar and her peculiarity for some reason doesn't provide obvious clues about her nature. She doesn't dress warm, only appears at night and she shares her life with an adult named Hakan, who could be his father. She grows an immediate liking on Oskar, maybe because she feels as an outcast too, though she's far from the 'victim' type. Their relationships start as a strange puppy romance between a badass girl and a timid boy. Meanwhile, we see Hakan killing a man at night and hanging him upside down to drawn blood from his neck only to be interrupted by a dog. He's later reprimanded by a voice that seems to belong to an adult woman.It's interesting how the mystery is kept until the second killing... that doesn't come too late after the first failed attempt when Eli decides to handle the matter herself and collect the blood through natural means, by killing one of the locals. Hakan's job Is to dispose the body and the ice helps.So the narrative is divided into three separate parts: first, the viewer's discovery about Eli. Then, it's for Oskar to understand who ""she"" is and I say ""she"" because, as the romance grows, Eli reveals that she's not exactly a girl and being a vampire is beside the consideration of her gender. Finally, it's how the romance ties the bullying subplot together. Both are deeply connected anyway.Consider the fact that we have two acts of gratuitous and horrific violence in the beginning, one isn't lethal but evil lies in both and so does blood. After all, Oskar imagines getting even with his tormentors not exactly in diplomatic ways. Bullying can either provoke, lead to, or make you fantasize about bloodshed.Then we understand why Eli needs blood and the murders, while horrific and graphic, take a whole new perspective. It's a violence with reasons that asserts the bestial nature of vampires in a way that ""Interview With the Vampire"" expressed through Louis, a vampire who doesn't enjoy his ordeal but is left with no choice. The horror is the same and yet we're more affected by the bullying endured by Oskar for a simple reason: it has none. And the film draws the line between human nature and animals: the latter kill for survival and the former destroy for fun, for the sake of it. The film doesn't exactly take side by sugarcoating the killings as Eli's victims are all innocent people and we're also given some insights about the ordeal of being a vampire, like what happens when they enter a room uninvited or what a mortal decides to do when she turns into one. Anyway, let's get to the final pivot which is the reveal.When Oskar understands what Eli is, he doesn't change his mind, being an outcast made him empathize even more with her and being in love sure helps. Finally, the director anticipates the viewer' expectations and gets a closure on both the bullying and the romance, if all Eli's victims are innocent, it's not like the film is deprived of villains (the book from John Ajvide Lindqvist had even more) that could make the ""killings"" enjoyable to a pervert degree.For instance, Oskar tries to improve physically and defend himself, in a key scene, he does get the upper hand on Conny and I almost felt sorry for the little brat, especially when Oskar is taking delight from the blood on Conny's ear like Cartman with Scott Tenerman's tears, as if bullying had already started to plant the bad seeds, as if the coming-of-age aspect of the story was to be sealed in bloody letters.I have just completed a ""bullying"" chapter in my English courses (I'm a teacher) and among the consequences of bullying, like moving, depression and suicide, I wish I could be more complete and have ""violence"" as one of them or maybe the sheer enjoyment of violence. If the film avoids the cliché of making the victim a bully, the way the two plots converge in the climax left me both shocked and satisfied, which was quite disturbing.Trust the Swedish school to make a horror film that toys with the notions of villain and victim, and makes violence understandable and satisfying without it being pleasurable or entertaining.",Let the Right One In
42,paul2001sw-1,Blood and belonging,9,13 February 2012,"Vampire bats, which feed off blood, have inspired straightforward horror films, sexually-charged Gothic romps, and most ludicrously, films in which earnest vampires agonise about the ethics of eating people. One of my favourites is 'Shadow of the Vampire', which amusingly posits that the star of some early vampire movies was actually not just an actor, but a real vampire. 'Let the Right One In' has it's own feel, which reminded me more than anything else not of another vampire movie, but of 'Edward Scissorhands'; it's vampire is simply lonely, a girl destined forever to be an outsider, who befriends a bullied boy who is similarly not part of anyone's gang. Meanwhile, a collection of misfits, living in a grim new town in 1980s Sweden, successively fall prey to their unwelcome visitor. The movie has a lovely, poetic feel, and finesses its moments of extreme gore: although it's never explicitly suggested, one might even wonder if the vampire is an imaginary friend of the hapless hero. It's the sense of belonging, and what it means not to belong, that drives this movie, carried off with a grotesque metaphor but a wonderfully light touch. One might note that there's a touch of humour even in Bergman's 'The Seventh Seal'; this is another great Swedish film about life and death.",Let the Right One In
43,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Subtly plays with the tropes of its genre to deliver a subversive story of outsider romance.,7,4 July 2018,"'Let The Right One In (2008)' plays with the conventions of its genre, and sub-genre, in a subtle way, ultimately becoming quite a touching and subversive story of outsider romance in more ways than one. The 'vampiric' elements of its narrative, which are all aptly rendered with proper reverence, serve both as literal and allegorical counter-points to the 'misfit' motifs found within essentially every character, including the 'blood-sucker' themself. The piece's dark, pseudo-destructive relationships are never easy, with essentially all except that of our protagonist and his mother being shown as quite disastrous, but its central dynamic is somehow quite sweet despite its sometimes slightly insidious implications (or interpretations, at least). It ends up being refreshingly accepting and inclusive without shying away from its more dangerous and blood-thirsty sides, becoming quite endearing without ever watering down the feature's darkest of moments - which, by the way, sometimes result in a genuine fear of its generally sympathetic creature of the night. 7/10",Let the Right One In

45,bowmanblue,Nice take on the whole 'vampire myth',8,24 February 2017,"Sometimes you may wonder if every different version of those infamous blood-suckers hasn't already been done to death. The big screen has had every incarnation from a planet run by vampires (Daybreakers) to vampires that came from space (Lifeforce) and twinkling vampires (that franchise that cannot be named). So, here we have a Swedish offering based on the book of the same name – 'Let the Right One in.' It's set in the eighties if you're wondering where the 'bad' haircuts came from and we're introduced to a young lad who is being bullied at school (Oskar). Now, rather than tell a responsible adult about his troubles, he enlists the help of the 'new kid on the block' (Eli). And, it just so happens that the little girl who has moved into the flat next door is full of secrets – mainly associated with the blood-thirsty deaths that have been happening in the community ever since the girl moved into the neighbourhood.I can't compare the big screen adaptation to the book as I haven't read it, but it certainly is an 'earthy' take on vampires. By that I mean that if you can suspend your disbelief to appreciate immortal bloodsuckers living among us, then you will be able to believe that this is probably how it would go.It's a pretty bleak film, not just in content (killer-child vampires are hardly happy-go-lucky types), but also in look and feel. The snowy setting is quiet and eerie and also used to perfection to create a look and feel for the film. There's plenty of great shots that are brilliantly-framed and even have a slight 'Kubrick-feel' to them (my opinion, anyway).'Let the Right One in' won't be for everyone. It's hardly fast-paced and you'll have to put up with the subtitles (those foreign films, eh?). Plus there is a decent amount of gore and red stuff flying here and there. I noticed a couple of slightly cheap-looking CGI effects in there, but I'm guessing the film didn't have the budget to do any better and I can forgive those on account of the overall story and feel.There is an American remake out there and it's not that bad either, however it's so similar that if you like the sound of this sort of deep, slow, arty vampire tale then you might as well just watch the original.",Let the Right One In

48,secondtake,"Deeply Romantic, Beautiful and Engrossing--and a vampire movie, too",9,2 October 2009,"Let the Right One in (2008)This might be the most convincing vampire movie ever made, and it's one of the best movies of the year, period. Tod Browning's 1931 classic is creaky, even for 1931, and this, at the other end of the sound era in vampire movies, is exactly the opposite--slick, smooth, nearly flawless. Its taut airy cold veneer is its glory. Everything, from drunks to vampire attacks, is shown and felt as if through glass, or suspended in glass. Very clear, glossy, intriguing glass.Within its own world it's really great journey, in snowy Sweden (or so we assume--it's a Swedish movie, directed by Tomas Alfredson). The young vampire evokes pity, and her/its relationship with the boy is touching and rather believable, even including his acceptance of her. This is the core of the movie's success, for me, whatever disturbing twists it also has. The very end makes you revisit the vampire's motives, but it seems that the boy, at least, is okay with it all. His broken world at last has the support it needs. And the vampire, it seems, got what she needed, a replacement human guardian. A nice trade, if not the kind of relationship most of us are looking for.There is calmness throughout--a kind of spare Ikea-ish set design. Even outside, in the woods, the trees all parallel and orderly. The bloody scenes are slightly (slightly) restrained--the violence is not shown directly, even if the aftermath is clear--and the worst of this happens within this spare, gliding backdrop of the slick, open scenes, and the stately, elegant filming. Even having a white (snowy) world to shoot against was an aesthetic choice, simplifying the textures. It's not a busy frenetic film, even though a vampire is loose in a little town in the countryside. Instead it the opposite of Gothic, and that's daring enough right there. It also focuses our fascination on the events and not a clichéd aura of dark rooms, creaking doors, and sudden flashes of gore.Let the Right One in offers one new twist to the vampire ""rules"" as far as I know, and that comes from the title: if a vampire asks to be let in, you have the power to say yes or no. It isn't clear if this is only applies to humans they want as friends or anyone, but saying no has terrible consequences. Ultimately, the vulnerability of the vampire, even with all her/its power, is the source of pathos that makes the movie stirring and beautiful. Yes, it's still ""just"" a vampire movie, but a significant film, too. Just read the detailed, almost obsessive Wikipedia entry for it--the casting and filming in particular--and you'll be convinced to take it seriously. But then, just sit back and watch it, patiently, and it'll impress you in it's own irresistible Scandi-transylvanian way.",Let the Right One In

56,johnnyboyz,"For the love of God, Let the Right One In.",7,2 June 2013,"Let the Right One In is a very subtle film about content that's often disgusting and ideas that are often both quite personal and confrontive. Unfolded on an apartment block estate and set amidst a group of people sharing this building and general area, the film might have acted as a perfectly viable drama depicting bullied children and their struggles; relationships kids have with their parents and/or guardians as well as much older people who go back years meeting up in bars and so forth. This is, of course, were it not for the fact certain supernatural elements push it down certain alleys rendering it an altogether different experience. While those elements arrive in the form of vampirism, the film is anything but about vampires and we've come a long way from castle dwelling; cape-clad monsters who seek some sort of wider domination. Moreover, the film is about something quite humane in spite of this non-human element; a tale about isolation, about coming of age and about feelings.Oskar (Hedebrant) is a young boy living in the Swedish city of Stockholm, furthermore on one of the upper storeys of an apartment block, during the early 1980s. With trouble between his parents having already led to their separation and suffering a rough time of things at school, the boy is fairly miserable. Oskar's troubles result in a fixation of death preoccupying him, a morbid curiosity which is evident in the various newspaper clippings of murder and whatnot that he keeps along with the knife he hides in his room for whatever motive. At school, a local police officer is taken aback at Oskar's knowledge of murder deduction while it later becomes obvious that a bully problem is the source for all this anger. In living the bad life, we witness him share a glance with a new occupant of one of the flats. Indeed, the opening scene is constructed from Oskar's gaze as a young girl of around his age named Eli (Leandersson) steps out of a taxi with her lone parent and a mixture of both curiosity and attraction seems to fill him.When both Eli and Oskar come to meet, we witness their bond born out of a real lack of being able to integrate into a patriarchy dominated by people of their age. Respectively bullied at school as well as being stuck in a state of indefinite social exile out of her condition, Oskar and Eli hit it off through what is essentially a process of elimination in that neither have anybody else to whom they can interact. This is on top of the fact their guardians might just as well be invisible. Doubly so, Eli arrives as this optimisation of blood, death and so forth: all the things in which Oskar has garnered an interest. These things are omnipresent out of the fact Eli is a centuries old vampire whose physical form is not yet beyond that of a child human being. Eli's problem is that she needs human beings upon which to feed, but requires the help of that of the adult guardian with whom she travels to attain such a thing. His process; a grizzly, halal inspired method of stringing the victim up and doing what needs to be done, is required to quench Eli's need for human blood.What transpires between the two isn't necessarily a love story per se, merely a tale of two people too young to be teenagers and too old to be merely children coming together born out of their binary traits. The director, Tomas Alfredson, combines this very Western preoccupation with that of sex and death into one large dramatic cauldron which is furthermore set far enough back into the past to give it a fabled feel and in a locale drenched in heavy snow lending to an atmosphere of 'the mythical'. Around the core pairing, Alfredson weaves in a series of vignettes driven by all of a woman who's been bitten, but cannot quite believe she is transforming into a vampire; that of an elderly man whose best friend was slaughtered so as to feed Eli as well as that of Eli's own guardian, whose quite disturbing tale of not wanting to do for Eli anymore what he's been doing his whole life cannot even be put into words as to what the man might be thinking and going through.This is one of those films that is about kids but almost certainly unsuitable for kids, a middle class estate set drama about old timers who enjoy an evening at the pub and kids who are struggling with all manner of things in their lives which happens to have codes of the uncanny dropped head first into proceedings. It's a calm, patient film with aspirations to burst into something more blood soaked and more aggressive; a film which finds it difficult to put many feet wrong despite working within a genre wherein it's very easy to misstep and with a premise that is crying out for errors of mismanagement. Regardless of one's fondness for horror, foreign language dramas or whatnot, you cannot go very far wrong with Let the Right One In.",Let the Right One In
57,howard.schumann,Sends disturbing messages about violence,8,15 March 2009,"Cherubic-faced Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is a lonely, withdrawn pre-teen who is unable to strike back at school bullies who make his life miserable. As an outlet for his pent-up rage, he collects news clips of violent crimes and repeatedly stabs a tree with his pocket knife as if it is one of his tormentors. Neither of his estranged parents provides much in the way of support and life is dismal until Eli (Lina Leandersson), a strange new girl moves in next door with an older man (Per Ragnar).who appears to be her father. Directed by Tomas Alfredson from a novel of the same name by Jon Ajvide Lindqvist, Let the Right One In brings the horror genre to the ice and snow of a bleak working class Swedish suburb, attempting to merge traditional vampire lore with a sweet love story about two innocents drawn together out of mutual need.The new girl, Eli, is dark-complected in marked contrast to Oskar's soft pale skin and blond hair. Their first meeting is in the courtyard of their housing complex, a setting so still that it feels as if it is miles away from anything resembling civilization. Eli tells Oskar that she cannot be his friend without saying exactly why but he still allows her to play with his Rubik's Cube which she figures out with little effort. When he asks her how old she is, she responds enigmatically that she's about twelve but says she's been twelve for a very long time and incidentally is not a girl. Though Oskar becomes aware that Eli is not affected by the cold, does not go to school, walks barefoot in the snow, and only comes out at night, he does not connect the dots even when a series of brutal murders take place in the area in which the victim's blood has been drained by the adult procurer she lives with - with enough available for leftovers.When Oskar cuts his hand with a knife and Eli shows unusual interest in the blood dripping on the floor, he finds out that his new girl friend is a vampire, but since she is the only one around who treats him decently, he overlooks her dietary habits. As the blood flows and the victims pile up, usually in the streets because the film has no use for policeman or parents or any adult authority for that matter, Oskar looks to Eli not only for friendship but for help in getting revenge against the school bullies who threaten him, at one point holding him underwater at the school swimming pool for several agonizing minutes. While Let the Right One In is a highly imaginative and riveting film experience that is impeccably acted, it left me feeling unsettled and unsatisfied.The film never questions the efficacy of violence to solve Oskar's problems, in fact, implying that it is only solution. While we understand that films about vampires will include a certain amount of killing, the fact that the murders are dramatized in such a matter-of-fact style without any emotion or interest in the victim recalls chilling headlines about teens roaming the corridors of our high schools reeking revenge on their tormentors without any trace of human feeling. Taken as an allegory on the fantasies of a lonely adolescent, Let the Right One In has considerable appeal. Taken on face value, however, it is a beautiful looking but gore-filled exercise wrapped in a poetic veneer that sends disturbing messages about how killing is acceptable if done in the name of friendship, survival, or getting even. That, rather than creepy cats or dissolving faces, is the scariest part of the film.",Let the Right One In
58,insomniac_rod,Tender and dark.,7,23 May 2011,"Romantic love stories between vampires do not necessary mean clichés, mellow dialogs, and ""cool"" moments. This movie displays the beautiful story of a lonely boy who befriends a let's call her a ""girl"", who is indeed a bloodsucker. This relationship permits the audience to explore the mental condition of a boy who feels alone, gets bullied at school, and overall has a mediocre life. Through Eli, this boy learns about the burdens of being a pubert and how the simple things make life easier. This is not a typical vampire movie because it doesn't focuses on violence, gore, rituals, etc. Sure! There are pretty violent moments involving bloodsucking, burned bodies, disfigured faces, and brutal beatings.But the message of the movie goes deeper and deals with pure, innocent love between young people. It's not my cup of tea but I can admit that the movie is very well filmed, directed, and the story is told in such a delightful way that you can't help but feel what the characters have to display. P.S. Should I feel ashamed because I felt aroused by Eli's legs?. Recommended for those who can take an almost artistic horror-romantic feature.",Let the Right One In
59,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Everyone should let this one in,9,31 October 2010,"Foreign language films lose out on a wider audience for two reasons: limited distribution and subtitles. Most audiences view subtitles as a hurdle to their enjoyment of a film, but regardless of whether that's a founded argument, it's inconsequential for ""Let the Right One In,"" a Swedish film that reminds us that imagery is the universal language (sorry math nerds).Tomas Alfredson's film based on the John Ajvide Lindqvist book is haunting, touching, moving, creepy and so forth; the mood goes wherever he takes us and despite the generally quiet vibe of the film, ""Right One"" intrigues from start to finish.A story of self-preservation and young love (in more the fondness sense of love), ""Let the Right One In"" certainly doesn't tread typical 21st Century vampire movie territory, which might be enough in itself to warrant the film heaps of praise. Digression aside, the film centers around Oskar (Kare Hedebrant), a 12-year-old boy being bullied at school and enacting revenge fantasies in his spare time and his encounter with your anything-but- typical ""girl next door."" Yes, Eli (Lina Leandersson) lives next door, but she's not a girl so much as a blood-thirsty vampiric creature. Eli lives with her ""father"" (Per Ragnar) whose life exists solely to keep her alive by bringing home fresh blood, something he hasn't been so good at lately.Like any relationship between 12-year-olds, Eli and Oskar bond over simple things (a Rubix Cube for starters) and are mostly feeling each other out, especially Eli, whose never had interaction with a peer in so far as we can tell. She inspires confidence in Oskar to stand up to his bullies and the two find a tenderness on which the rest of the story builds. ""Let the Right One In"" has plenty of cringing moments to warrant being tagged in the horror genre, but it's this story of simplistic love that makes it a cut and several puncture wounds above the rest.Adolescent relationships (anything with kids or actors clearly not at least 16) can be a touchy area, but Alfredson plays it nicely and avoids any discomfort. His strength remains mostly in the dramatic elements of the film and in working with Hedebrant and Leandersson. Considering the film focuses on this burgeoning relationship, it requires a lot of maturity from the actors and they live up the test without sacrificing their youthful innocence (and insecurity).As far as horror goes, while ""Right One"" is not genuinely scary, the climactic moments of vampire attacks and such are striking and surprisingly memorable. Alfredson finds compelling and non-traditional ways to frame these key moments, especially the end, that engrave the film in your brain. They deliver such an impressive punch to the viewer that any wandering off done during a lull in the action instantly disappears.To cap it off, all this is told with visual prowess. Alfredson demonstrates clear mastery in terms of understanding how what's not seen on camera can be just as powerful as what is and can turn a moment of medium-level interest to high-level and high-level to instantly memorable. The way scenes materialize despite a lack of traditional framing of faces and focusing on certain objects impresses. The symbolism, namely of hands reaching out to walls and windows toward others, rarely receives better execution as well. Even the more bizarre events in the film have a powerfully surreal quality to them. Something with the lens being used or some subtly change brought a rare energy to those climactic moments.""Right One"" might never get due recognition outside the foreign-film appreciators community, but certainly not for any fault of its own -- just the bias of specific people. It combines the best of visual storytelling and human-to-human drama all in combination with a familiar and beloved sub-genre of vampire stories. It's a winning combination and one that just about anyone is capable of appreciating regardless of the vampire expectation.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",Let the Right One In
60,funkyfry,He's not a zombie! He's my brother!,4,29 March 2009,"I didn't much care for this bleak Swedish tale of prepubescent vampire first love. Of course the one thing I would really say for it, is that I've never really seen another movie like it. So that's some points for that in my book. But I didn't really like what I saw. Sometimes you can have a drab color scheme that adds up to a very beautiful film, but in this case the film just bored me visually for the most part. Child actors are notoriously risky, and these two did a good job. But the adult actors did not impress me.There are a lot of moments in the film that strike me as needlessly violent, a sort of graphic intrusion into the more romantic or bucolic theme of the movie. As a horror movie it's a complete failure. As a strange sort of Gothic romance, it's all right but I imagine there are better out there. There isn't much to the relationship between these two, except a Rubic's cube and a bunch of empty space. The idea of the movie as I take it is that the two children have nothing else in their lives so of course they were drawn to each other. We're supposed to be filled with anger as the adorable little boy is abused horribly by the cruel bullies, and then cheer when he fights back. It reminded me of a lot of generic after-school movies that I've seen. The whole thing ends in a grotesque revenge scenario worthy of Tarantino, and just as stylishly and pointlessly conveyed for its own graphic sake.",Let the Right One In
61,jzappa,"The Artistry of Sorrow, the Agony of Growing Up and the Inextricability of Violence",9,21 April 2009,"Ample masses of blank area occupy the academic widescreen arrangements comprising suburban Swedish story about romance and vampirism. Then there are the sounds: a heartbeat, aggravating lip-chewing, breathing. All these things bring us closer to the characters and help make our experience theirs. Oskar is an outcast. His parents have divorced. Neither one wants him. He is often alone. He loiters outside in the snowy Swedish night. One night, he meets a kid named Eli who is about his age. Eli is lonely, too, and they become friends. Oskar is at that age when he takes stock in stupefying facts without excitement, because life has exhausted its endeavors to take him aback. Eli walks through the snow without shoes.Oskar is relentlessly victimized at school by a sadistic bully, who rolls with a throng of two smaller flanks. At a time like this, it is advantageous to have a vampire as your best pal. A girl vampire or a boy vampire, it makes no considerable difference. This discreet Swedish contribution is ablaze with restraint, immeasurable yearning conjugated by bloody murder. What a refreshment, and a pleasure, it is to be able to applaud a horror film without an echelon of conditional justifications. But, alas, it is indeed merely marketed as one. It is more in the vein of dark Brothers Grimm fantasy, but to subjugate it into any genre, to subjectively compress it into the horror or fantasy pigeonholes, is to fail to notice a rare and arresting movie.I have not even started to characterize director Tomas Alfredson and writer John Ajvide Lindqvist's Swedish art house ritual recourse to Twilight. It's a fixed, frozen little film that uses its glacial setting to natural benefit with visuals of an uncommon sort of allure. I will not go into the relationship Eli has with a rank middle-age man aptly named Hakan. Perhaps he is his accustomed, perhaps he just likes blood. Nor will I talk about the iron rod and the knife, or Oskar's selfish parents. It's a smoothly uncertain film that intimates that the heart that supports us, the monstrous influences we conceal from the world, and the fears that apprehend us in the dark might all be mutations of a single animal. As Oskar and Eli glare into the apparent reflections of one another's faces, their mouths spattered with the victim's blood, their eyes mute and they look, finally, attached, their predestinations corkscrewed together in ways they can't foretell.The best fantasy stories take precedence because they give freshly invented frame of reference to genuine concerns of reality through the objective spectacles of the mythological or the paranormal, and Alfredson's cautiously Gothic piece uses vampirism to undertake growing up in all its noble anguish. Virtually spiritual and minutely shaded, eliminate the vampire elements and this is the story of two forsaken and purely inconsolable kids able to carry out sinister feats without evident feeling. Yet I believe this film is bare of every element or nicety that could possibly be considered extraneous. Even Alfredson's range is thoroughly dry of warm colors. The young actors are intense in wearying roles. We hold them dear more than they hold their own lives dear, and we can't blame them. We catch on that a vampire must be invited into a room before it can enter. Now the title bears significance. Let the Right One In is a rhythmic opus that will address not just a good deal of the doubtful slot marketplace of bottom-line horror fans, as much as any viewer astute enough to understand the artistry of sorrow, the agony of growing up, and the inextricability of violence.This pared-down picture may seem rather clipped, which is to say unresolved in part, but the film is too deliberate to have been rushed. The art of Let the Right One In is found in the way the horror stays cemented in a mournful scenario of love. Note that it is a film about children. And it is a fantasy. And it unravels in the most earnest way a 12-year-old's vindictive dream could.",Let the Right One In
62,Turfseer,Clueless critics drop the ball again,2,3 April 2011,"It doesn't astound me at all that the majority of mainstream film critics gave ""Let the Right One In"" a free pass! They have been suckered in by so many pretentious 'art' films these days, why can't an ordinary horror film be included in their pantheon? The critics' level of self-deception is so high on this film that there were zero negative reviews, only one mixed and 29 positive reviews on Metacritic (the mixed one was by Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly; unfortunately, it's only a capsule blurb).For the majority of internet posters with dissenting opinions, their main objection was that the film was too slow-paced to be worthwhile. There are plenty of films that are slow-paced but they still hit the mark, so to criticize the film merely on the grounds that it's tedious, misses the point as to why 'The Right One' is so reprehensible.It begins in a Stockholm suburb and it looks like this is going to be another tired serial killer retread. The killer (Hakan) has slit the throat of a young man walking in a park, hangs him upside down, dangling from a tree, and then attempts to collect the blood into a gasoline can as it drips from the victim's neck. Soon, however, we learn that Hakan is actually a vampire (or rather an assistant to a vampire who appears to be 12 years old). The 12 year old 'female', named Eli, actually has been alive since the middle ages (the book that the film is based on includes more graphic details on Eli's origins—that she, rather he, was castrated by a sadistic vampire nobleman).Some critics (such as Roger Ebert) became enamored with the relationship angle between Oskar, the lonely 12 year old protagonist, and his new found vampire friend. Oskar already has a fascination with crime to begin with, cutting out articles from the local newspapers detailing sordid murders occurring in nearby localities. While Oskar seems to have a nose for crime, the local police in 'Let the Right One In"" seem to be oddly absent during the investigation into the killings initiated by Hakan and his juvenile master, Eli.One wonders why Eli suddenly takes a liking to little Oskar since she has no guilt feelings about draining the blood out of various other upstanding members of the community. Since those community members all seem to depicted as a bunch of louts or buffoons, I guess it's okay that Hakan and Eli can do whatever they want to them with impunity. Eli further displays her 'sensitive side' when she advises Oskar to strike back at the local bullies who have been harassing him.There are very few films that will feature a murderous monster who is depicted as not being so bad after all. Somehow it doesn't bother Oskar that his gal pal goes around dispatching whoever she feels like it. Not only is Oskar's acquiescence condoned, but the film's scenarists have no guilt feelings about promoting the idea that it's good for a 12 year old to take the law into his own hands. Even worse is the idea that it's okay for a boy who's been bullied, to take revenge, acting just as sadistically as his tormentors did toward him (Recall how Oskar takes delight in whipping the school bully across the face with a pole).I suppose the reason why Eli is supposed to get a free pass here is because somehow she can't help herself (after all, she got bitten back in the Middle Ages). The moral of the story is that you can commit all the horrific murders you want but as long as you counsel a 12 year old boy as to the proper etiquette in dealing with a group of stick figure, cardboard cut out bullies, then you can continue traipsing around Scandinavia, committing additional atrocious crimes.As for those of you still looking for true scenes of horror, 'The Right One' offers only slim pickings. In addition to the aforementioned opening scene where Hakan does his blood draining bit, you also get (hold on to your seats!): Eli (channeling Spiderman) scurrying up the side of a hospital building, Hakan disfiguring himself by pouring hydrochloric acid over his face, in order to escape being identified by the police and Eli returning to rip off the heads and arms of the school bullies who are about to make mince meat of Oskar at the school swimming pool.Nothing really makes sense in 'Let the Right Thing In' including the blood sucking vampires and morally challenged 12 year olds. One can't really blame John Lindqvist, author of the book the film was based on, as well as its screenwriter, for the ultimate successful promotion of this claptrap. That honor goes to the film critics, always seeking their next great 'work of art' along with the teenage audience that went to the movie theaters in droves and (unfortunately) bought all those tickets.",Let the Right One In
63,Chris Knipp,Varieties of vampire experience,8,22 November 2008,"Say you're feeling like a misfit in school. How about finding a vampire to be your boyfriend or girlfriend? Vampires, after all, are misfits too--big time--but their alienation is offset by special powers you lack, such as superhuman strength and the ability to live for centuries. A friend like that sets you apart from the crowd. The rich possibilities of teenage vampire romance are illustrated by two new movies, Twilight and Let the Right One In. Different as they are, they satisfy similar adolescent fantasies. Maybe for different adolescents.'Twilight,' directed by Catherine Hardwicke, of 'Thirteen' and 'Lords of Dogtown,' is a pop phenom mainly of interest to teenage girls, based on Stephanie Meyer's bestsellers about the relationship that develops at a Washington State high school between a new girl in junior class named Bella (Kristen Stewart) and a devastatingly handsome, or as the high girls unnecessarily spell it out to Bella, ""totally gorgeous"" undead teenager Edward Cullen. He's a student; so are several of his siblings. The other students don't know the Cullens are vampires; Bella finds out after she falls for Edward. Meyer has published three sequels, so if the movie opener does well this could be a franchise on the order of Harry Potter.'Twilight' glamorizes and softens vampire-hood and makes it upper middle class. Edward's foster father's the Washington State town's main doctor. The family drives cool late-model cars and lives in a splendid airy pad up in the misty hills. None of the old lugubrious Addams Family heavy-curtained look. The Cullens are hip, PC vampires.they don't even drink human blood; and sunlight doesn't make them burn, it only shows they to be ""different."" Bella and Edward avoid the danger of too close contact: they don't even kiss on the mouth till the end. Edward's concerned because he doesn't want to get involved with Bella--it could cause them both a world of harm (like premarital intercourse?).The prim, nobly suffering Edward is like a superhero, a pale, romantically high-cheek-boned version of a blockbuster cliché. He can jump across a parking lot to stop a skidding SUV from injuring Bella. In one of the movie's most whimsical sequences, he takes Bella flying up in the trees near his family's house to admire the river and the mist. Trouble comes when it turns a rival vampire family of the old-fashioned homicidal kind has invaded the region.Bella has all kinds of conflicts--and Kristen Stewart is reasonably good at making them seem real. She's left her remarried mother in Arizona and gone back to live with dad, Forks, WA's lonely, rather boring town sheriff. Her regular human classmates are jealous or disapproving of her liaison with Edward. Edward, noble creature that he is, doesn't want Bella to get involved with him. But in a cliff-hanger at the film's end, she begs him to ""turn"" her, and he refuses--at the high school prom! This is glossy, somehow conventional and kitschy stuff, but Twilight isn't so bad, really.The ""Twilight' stories are an interesting pop phenomenon that it's no use fighting.Tomas Alfredson's 'Let the Right One In' is at the opposite pole. It's dark and down-and-dirty and surprisingly realistic--and at the same time more authentically strange. The supernatural effects are simple and understated. One vampire, a newly-turned who doesn't at all like who she's become, commits suicide by having her husband open the shade and let the sun in: she explodes into flames and is burnt away. Alfredson doesn't mess with or tone down the harsh rules of vampire life.'Let the Right One In' is Swedish, after all--from a country that's all twilight. This is a complex, ironic tale of a small blond 12-year-old boy names Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant) living in the outskirts of Stockholm who gets cruelly picked on by classmates and fantasizes revenge, standing in his room fondling a small dagger, as we first see him. Soon he's befriended by a mysterious new neighbor, Eli (Lina Leandersson), a lanky-haired girl who hangs around outdoors in the cold without needing a coat. She likes him, and he asks her to be his girlfriend. Over time, he realizes she's a vampire, but he doesn't care. There's nothing glamorous about Eli's life. When Oskar sees her flat, he says, ""You're like poor, right?"" Her dad is a loser and knows it. His efforts to kill people and get their blood are practical and utilitarian, but also fumbled failures. She may be able to help Oskar--and she does, both physically, at a crucial moment, and psychologically, by encouraging him to fight back. But she herself is doomed. No sequels planned.Oskar's problems are real problems. This film doesn't glamorize; it humanizes. Not only the bully boys but nearly all the adults are aliens as far as he is concerned. Unlike an American high school flick with actors near their twenties, he's just a kid. And Eli, who isn't pretty, looks old, but haggard in the way you might be if you've been 12 for several centuries. She may have been aged by her miserable life. When Oskar gives her some candy she tries to eat it, to be nice, and then throws up. Oskar's real father, whom he goes to visit on the train, seems cool and fun, till he turns out to be an alcoholic. The sinking feeling that quiet revelation gives you comes from how well Swedes know this disease. And the adult friends--what a grungy, lost bunch! Sometimes the scenes in 'Let the Right One In' evoke the world of the Finnish director, Aki Kaurismäki. This is a world no kid would really want to be a part of, yet there Oskar is in the midst of it.'Twilight' glamorizes and softens being a vampire, while Alfredson's film takes us down a darker road toward more authentic daytime nightmares.",Let the Right One In

Although the quality of the acting and script are hard to evaluate in the clumsily dubbed version I watched, the child stars are quite good, especially Lina Leandersson as Eli. The slow buildup of her unearthliness is very well done (I especially liked the quick scene where her eyes shine like a cat's in the dark) and the icy Swedish landscape is a stark deviation from the usual vampire haunts (Gothic castles, foggy London streets and, more recently, American high schools). The ending is a bit predictable but satisfying and the final scene makes for an excellent closure.

Ah Vampires!",10,9 June 2010,"After the positive critical reaction to John Ajvide Lindqvist's debut novel the film rights were quickly brought by Swedish producer John Nordling and his company EFTI, with Lindqvist writing the script. The initial reaction was extremely positive and buzz quickly built up, with the film winning big name supporters like Guillermo del Toro and Mark Kermode. The film did very well internationally as well as Sweden and an American remake is now in the middle of Post-Production.Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant) was a small 12-year-old boy living in the suburbs of Stockholm. He was bullied at school and at night he acts like Travis Bickle, fantasying about revenge with a knife and following murder stories in the newspaper. Oskar befriends his new neighbour, Eli (Lina Leandersson), a 12-year-old girl, who acts very strangely, such as wearing light clothes in the middle of winter. Eli lives with her 'father' Håkan (Per Ragnar) and the Eli and Oskar start to become very close, with Eli giving Oskar more confidence. But there are strange and bloody murders in the suburb, with the locals investigating them. Eli too harbours a dark secret, her thirst blood.In recent years the vampire myth has regarded popularity, the biggest example being Twilight. There are other examples like Underworld, Blade, Buffy, etc But whilst those films and TV series are either very action based or Twilight was romance based, Let the Right One In is made as a horror film. They are effective moments throughout as Eli and Håkan stalk their victims and the filmmakers did not hold back on the violence. Yet the director Tomas Alfredson did not just make a simple horror film. The real power of the film is the relationship between the two young outcasts. His direction was perfect: soft and tender, with great cinematography and fitting music to add to the tone. The urban winter setting added to the atmosphere in a film that was dark and moody. It was touching how Oskar and Eli become close and are both Hedebrant and Leadnderssen were wonderful in their roles. Hopefully those two will have long and successful careers. Alfredson also knows the basic rule that all writers and directors should follow: have compelling characters. A horror film can only work if you are interested in the characters. The vampire story line was effective, with Eli seeming to be the only one of her species and shows her as a outcast. She is a very dark and ruthless character when hunting, with Oskar being the only person she cares about. This film was a character drama.As well as the vampire storyline there were some good sub-plot: the main one being the bullying. It was well captured as the bullies shown as nasty boys whom behaviour gets worst throughout the film. Other story lines include Oskar's relationship with his divorced parents, as he struggles to balance the two.Let the Right One In is clearly one of the best horror films that been made in recent years. It is as Shane Meadows said: this was what Twilight should have been.",Let the Right One In
68,Polaris_DiB,Not driven by bravura but silence...,8,6 January 2009,"A lot of sassy culture-enthusiasts are calling this one ""the perfect counterpoint to Twilight"", but like all things vampire, zombie, and werewolf, it's more useful to recognize the ways in which these movies entirely create their own monster. For one thing, the heavy, heady atmosphere in this movie isn't just bravado, it also comes from a statement on Communism (written into the dialog) and the impressionistic viewpoint of a young boy slowly going postal in his own right. What drives a lot of this movie where it's going isn't the fact that it's a vampire flick, but that the vampire fits in so well with the cold, snow-blanketed surroundings inhabited by sadistic bullies, broken families, poor drunks, and other generally unattractive people. A vampire in this community is about as matter-of-fact as any serial killer, and the real fear invoked by this movie is over whether or not the characters are going to get hurt. It's interesting that in this movie, a man getting drained of blood is horrible, but the anticipation of a young boy getting nicked with a knife or drowning is even worse.The director or cinematographer or both seems absolutely obsessed with perspective shots. A lot of what happens in this movie is blocked as if the camera is looking for some other way of exiting the scene in desperation. In quite a lot of shots, absolutely nothing happens, and its that uncertainty that provides tension. In most of the shots where something does happen, it's so matter-of-fact that it almost doesn't seem like there are any special effects (except there are--darned Uncanny Valley). Whatever, it's really believable.What this movie could have done without is the score. For such a sober and cold, pastiche viewpoint, a overly dramatic, Romantic score really doesn't help anything. I think this movie would have been even better without any score at all, as the absence of obvious emotional cues is what causes most of the imagery to become effective because everything is so uncertain. Looking back on this movie afterward, a lot of what happens is actually quite predictable, but when you're in the movie with nothing to guide your emotions, every decision has its own horrible outcome to anticipate. This is one of those movies that gives you the impression that had any single thing happened differently, a whole different movie would have come from it.--PolarisDiB",Let the Right One In
69,Stevieboy666,A perfect winter night's movie,9,23 December 2020,"Twelve year old Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) lives with his mother in an apartment block, at school he is called Piggy and is relentlessly bullied by three other boys. Then he meets his neighour Eli (Lina Leandersson), who tells him ""I am twelve, but I have been twelve for a long time"" - brilliant! Oskar is a bright kid, a series of murders in which victims are drained of blood and Eli's ability to climb walls combined with her nocturnal lifestyle leads him to ask if she is a vampire.
Let the Right One In is a vampire movie, but it is more than just horror, it is also a coming of age drama and indeed a love story. The two leads are amazing, two of the best child performances that I have seen. One other thing that impressed me was the snow covered Swedish landscape, not only does it look wonderful but it gives the film a cold, bleak look.Red blood on snow, very effective. This movie isn't for everyone - if you don't speak fluent Swedish then it means subtitles, and at almost two hours it may prove too long for viewers who become impatient with slow burners. This was my second viewing, both times during Winter as I think watching it during warmer months may lessen the impact. Essential viewing for lovers of European horror and contemporary vampires.",Let the Right One In
70,dee.reid,A brave new vampire film,10,10 March 2009,"The new Swedish horror-drama ""Let the Right One In"" is squarely one of the best foreign-language films I've ever seen. The movie is dark and haunting, poetic and heartfelt, touching and horrifying. It's a horror film, a revenge movie, a school drama, and a love story. But at its basest, it's a horror movie, and a damn good one at that. 12-year-old Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is a bullied and tortured schoolboy whose days at school are marked by having his pants stuffed into urinals and being the target of his own personal trio of devoted schoolyard bullies. His home life isn't much better; although it's obvious his mother loves him, she is absent most of the time and Oskar has a habit of masking the injuries he receives from the bullies as schoolyard incidents. Things brighten up for him when he meets Eli (Lina Leandersson), a peculiar and mysterious young girl who moves in next door to him and his mother. The two strike up a friendship that later tentatively blossoms into a romance, perhaps the pangs of first love for both. It also just so happens that Eli's arrival coincides with a string of brutal murders in Oskar's hometown, and he makes a startling discovery about Eli's true nature: she's a vampire. Directed by Tomas Alfredson and adapted from the acclaimed 2004 novel of the same name written by John Ajvide Lindqvist (also the film's screenwriter), cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema gives this film a deep, blue-tinted, and haunting look. The acting is perfect from the two young leads, who both give their characters a realistic sense of youthful tragedy. Both hope and weep for more, and that things would be different, but it seems that by film's end that they're willing to settle for things just the way they are. Since ""Let the Right One In"" is a vampire movie, it is in fact a very bloody one, so it will satisfy fans of vampire movies (it's also instructive in the ways that it plays with well-known vampire lore, so you can watch it for that too). At the end of the day, ""Let the Right One In"" is a beautiful and horrifying tale on the pains of adolescence, expertly presented by filmmakers dedicated to their film and carried out by two young leads who know the hard truths about their youth.10/10",Let the Right One In

I've generally gotten burned out on vampire stories, I've just seen it too many times. But this as good as it gets. Beautifully shot (and great looking on blu-ray), moody, mysterious, emotional. This is as much a touching and complex pre-adolescent love story, as anything.An outsider boy, fragile, picked on, and harboring violent fantasies of revenge is befriended by a strange, pale young girl who doesn't seem to feel the Swedish cold.It's a strange and fascinating mix of tones; bloody, gory killings, very sweet, well acted pre-teen romance, and occasional black comedy. There's also an interesting, complicated morality here. Both our young heroes have deeply violent, sadistic streaks within them. Yet we root for them, even though some off her victims are truly innocent, and he collects stories about murder like a nascent serial killer. It grew even deeper emotionally on 2nd viewing.Not quite like anything else. That's a high compliment.",Let the Right One In

She's into some ghastly stuff, obviously, but the glimmer of friendship these kids nurture is sweet and pure, a complete antithesis to all the dark acts that, by necessity, she gets up to when they're apart. Two lost souls who finally find comfort in the vast, dark expanse.There's a lot left unspoken in Let the RIght One In; subtle hints about how these relationships have worked for her in the past, a broad sense of penitence and a reluctance to let it happen again. She knows what she is, tries to warn him away, but they both feel the connection and he's persistent about getting closer. Being around her gives him the strength to take command of his own life and make meaningful changes. There's inherent conflict here - she's good for him AND bad for him - that causes a melancholic sense of imminence to loom like a specter over both lives. By the story's end, one conflict is resolved (a more up-front plot involving those school bullies) but the greater issue is left open-ended. Does the cycle continue?

73,estebangonzalez10,Let the Right One In makes Twilight look like Childplay,9,16 September 2010,"¨ Oscar, listen. Hit back! You've never hit back, have you? So do it! Hit back hard! ¨ Låt Den Rätte Komma In is a great Swedish film directed by Tomas Alfredson based on the novel from John Ajvide Lindqvist of the same name which translated means Let The Right One In. Lindqvist also wrote the screenplay for this film so he helped Alfredson with the adaptation of his own novel which is based on a twelve year old girl (who actually has been a vampire for over two hundred years and hasn't changed her physical appearance) and her relationship with a young kid named Oscar. The title of the film has to do with the vampire legend that they have to ask for permission before entering anyone's home, they just can't come in on their own free will. The atmosphere in this movie is great; the director quickly sets us in a very suspenseful state by locating us in a quiet and cold small Swedish town. The scenery is just beautiful with a lot of snow contrasting the dark town and contributing to the overall horror and suspense. I really loved how this movie was filmed. This is probably one of the best vampire movies I have seen because it is so different from the others and stands out alone in its genre. The violence is disturbing, but in a different way because it doesn't actually show you everything that is going on. You are left imagining a lot of the violent acts because you see it from a distance or someone is in the way so you actually don't see all the blood or the throat slicing, and the film really plays with your sensory senses because sometimes just imagining it is worse than seeing the violence. Interesting enough the vampire isn't actually seen as a villain either because the director wants us to see things through her eyes.At the beginning of the movie we are introduced to Oscar (Kare Hedebrant), a twelve year old boy who is bullied at school by three of his classmates. He is a very quiet kid, but is also very smart. At home he lives alone with his mother and is constantly dreaming of getting revenge. He plays with a knife and constantly repeats the words ¨squeal, squeal like a pig¨ probably making reference to the fact that in school they call him a pig and constantly make fun of him. He also seems to collect clips from the newspapers of violent acts. Oscar is a quiet and sweet kid, but he does have these violent daydreams. It is during one of these daydreams that Oscar sees a man and a young girl move into the apartment complex where Oscar lives. The girl's name is Eli (Lina Leandersson) and he quickly becomes friends with her although she only goes out at night and dresses very lightly considering the freezing weather (all details which capture Oscar's attention). Eli and Oscar become friends and she tells him not to allow the other kids to treat him that way, and that he must fight back and hit harder in order to gain their respect. Since Eli lives in the apartment next door to his, Oscar figures out how to communicate with Eli with Morse code and their relationship continues to build. What he doesn't know is that Eli is actually a two hundred year old vampire and that the man that lives with her is not actually her father, but a serial killer who is in charge of bringing her fresh blood from his victims. His name is Hakan (Per Ragnar) and he doesn't like Oscar very much. Soon Oscar discovers Eli's real identity and will have to choose if he wants to continue with her friendship or judge her actions.This is without a doubt a movie that will be remade in Hollywood because the story is original and gripping. Hollywood has run out of ideas and is actually remaking a lot of foreign film. My advice is go see the original versions because they are much better. It will be very difficult for any vampire movie to top this one because the mood and suspense of the film capture your attention from the very beginning. Also the chemistry between Hedebrant and Leandersson will be very hard to equal because their performances are just brilliant despite their young ages. The movie is very unique and beautifully shot, the scenery is captivating, and the mystery mixed with the romance works well. If you disliked the Twilight saga (which wasn't my case), don't worry you will probably love this film because it has a completely different tone and mood. Please go see this film in its original version because it is worth your time. The final ten minutes of the film are very intense. Brilliant movie!",Let the Right One In
74,iquine,Refreshing Twist On Vampires,7,18 July 2017,"(Flash Review)This is the most calm and subtle approach to the vampire genre I have seen. While it lacks the over the top expected vampire blood-filled scenes of typical movies, the gruesome scenes are impactful and eye- opening by themselves. Especially, as they contrast with the tone of film. The heart of the film is an unusual romance between a bullied boy and an older vampire girl as she helps him stand up to the bullies. Her father has other 'serious' issues. The cinematography and pacing are minimal and subtle. Overall, I felt there could have been a bit more story to chew on or a few more details included. The DVD I had only had crappy dubbing; no subtitles so I felt that lightly cheapened some of the emotional scenes as the voice-overs lacked true passion. Intriguing and slightly disturbing piece of cinema.",Let the Right One In

I believe the relationship between Oskar and Eli is one of the most beautiful, pure, genuine love stories that will ever be told. The ice-cold chilling, lonely atmosphere that dominates this film is countered completely by the emotional warmth that emanates from this relationship. The film somehow invokes sympathy with these killers and hatred for the innocent grievers and makes you never question this allegiance. It's absolutely devastating and if it doesn't tear you up, you're dead inside. The cinematography is excellent and the two child actors do a spectacular job.",Let the Right One In

I was happy to see the original film last year and watching again this year before seeing the ""Matt Reeves' remake of Let Me In"". Which Reeves' version is also well received by the film critics but the movie is an box office disappointment.

78,3xHCCH,Great To Finally See Euro-Horror,6,16 February 2009,"This is a Swedish movie with a lot of internet buzz. Before I watched, I only knew this film puts its own spin on the current vampire trend. I found it interesting to see a European take on the subject, as the Hollywood interpretation of the vampire is getting to be very predictable. The title refers to the legend (which I have not really heard before) that a vampire cannot enter a residential house without being invited in.This tells the story of Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant), a pale blond 12-year old boy, a loner who is constantly picked on by bullies in school. He was befriended by his similarly lonely new neighbor, a pretty dark-haired 12-year old girl named Eli (a sublime Lina Leandersson). Their friendship develops in the dead of a snowy winter in a Swedish town, while a series of unexplained bloody murders were taking place in the neighborhood. Maybe that is all you need to know about the main plot. The rest is for you to discover while watching this movie.The European style of film making is there. The slow pace. The straightforward storytelling. The stark sets. The quiet music. The natural actors. It all works for the benefit of this film. The atmosphere is very eerie. The violence while mostly hidden and off-screen was still frank and brutal in execution. The build-up to the actual scene of violence was replete with tension. There were many memorably scary images I have not seen before in other horror films, particularly that scene with the cats, and the climactic scene at the pool.I think this is only the second Swedish movie I have seen after the classic yet (for me) woefully boring and over-rated Bergman opus ""The Seventh Seal"". This is a novel experience to watch a European horror film, after getting our fill of Asian horror a few years back. There are already plans to make a Hollywood version of this, and I dread how that would look like (like what they did to ""The Ring"" or ""The Grudge."") Though ineligible for the Oscar for a Best Foreign Film nomination due to release date problems, ""Let The Right One In"" has also earned its share of awards. Recently in the Online Film Critics Awards, this film won four awards for foreign film, adapted screenplay (for John Ajvide Lindqvist who adapted his own best-selling novel), breakthrough actor (for Lina Leandersson) and breakthrough director (for Thomas Alfredson).",Let the Right One In

81,fertilecelluloid,Exceptional adult fairytale writ in deepest crimson,9,25 October 2008,"Tomas Alfredson's ""Let The Right One In"" is an exceptional horror movie about friendship and acceptance. Eschewing traditional genre conventions, its influences are clearly not limited to the horror genre. Having more in common with ""My Life As A Dog"" than ""The Lost Boys"", it ignores the needs of the ADD-ridden idiots I referred to in a previous review and returns us to the type of cinema where we get to know, love, and care for characters. Although it explores vampirism, its focus is on the alienating aspects of being a vampire, treating it like a disease. There are some expertly directed suspense sequences and plenty of bloodletting when there needs to be. A sequence set in a swimming pool is both humorous and shocking. Other aspects, such as when the vampire girl scales a building, have a sensuous, poetic quality. The performances -- in particular, Kåre Hedebrant as Oskar and Lina Leandersson as Eli -- are magnificent, and imbued with enormous subtlety and humanity. Ultimately, this is a powerful adult fairy tale writ in deepest crimson.",Let the Right One In
82,ferbs54,Bye-Bye Blackeberg,8,27 March 2012,"The winner of at least 50 international film awards and a popular and critical favorite, the 2008 Swedish film ""Let the Right One In"" is, as it turns out, highly deserving of all the many accolades it has received. Adapted by John Ajvide Lindqvist from his best-selling novel of 2004, the film introduces us to a 12-year-old boy named Oskar, who lives with his mother in a suburb of Stockholm, and who is more than effectively played by newcomer Kare Hedebrant. Oskar's life as a friendless soul who is helplessly bullied at school takes a turn for the better when some new neighbors move into his apartment complex. Eli, who is apparently his age, initially tells Oskar ""I can't be friends with you...that's just how it is,"" but the two ultimately DO bond, although Eli later reveals that she has been 12 ""for a long time."" In point of fact, Eli is nothing less than a vampire...and a particularly ravenous one, to boot! And before long, the sleepy suburb of Blackeberg is roused by a string of shockingly bloody, nighttime slayings....Beautifully shot by Hoyte van Hoytema and sensitively directed by Tomas Alfredson (who would go on to helm 2011's ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy""), ""LTROI"" showcases some nice wintry settings that go far in abetting the film's chilly mood. Stockholm, of course, is a fairly unique setting for a vampire film, and offhand I cannot recall another Scandinavian picture dealing with this horror subject, at least not since Carl Dreyer's Danish classic ""Vampyr,"" of 1932. The film features a fairly restrained use of violence, but at the same time does not shy away when the occasion calls for it; the gorehounds in the audience should be well satisfied, with the picture's climactic swimming pool sequence already a horror-fan favorite. Other good scenes include Virginia (a middle-aged woman whom Eli ""infects"" at one point) having the blinds opened in her hospital room, her boyfriend Lacke hunting Eli down, and Oskar's literally ear-splitting vengeance on the bully Conny. But the best scenes of all, of course, are between Eli and Oskar themselves, as this film is more about their sweet and evolving relationship than anything else. Lonely outsiders with apparently no other friends to speak of, it is perhaps inevitable that the two should be drawn to each other, and their interactions here are both fascinating and touching. Over the course of the film, each manages to save the life of the other, with Eli becoming Oskar's avenging angel/fairy godmother of sorts, and Oskar becoming Eli's protector and (as suggested by the film's ambiguous ending, which could almost have set up a wonderful sequel) possible blood procurer. In the two leads, Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson are quite marvelous, especially given that these were the first film roles for both children. It took the filmmakers an entire year of searching before opting for these two, but I would have to say that the search was well worth the time invested. Baby-faced Hedebrant's reaction shots are often remarkable to behold (just look at his face after he realizes that Eli has successfully mastered the Rubik's Cube), while Leandersson manages the tricky task of appearing at once innocent, childlike, ancient and deadly. Although perhaps not quite as pretty as Chloe Grace Moretz, who portrayed the character in the 2010 American remake ""Let Me In,"" her performance is flawless and memorable, and her Eli is a very special addition to the vampire subgenre. An understandable worldwide smash, ""LTROI"" is a bona fide treat for the sophisticated horror buff, and from what I hear, its source novel is even better. Guess I'm going to have to place that title on my ""must-read"" list....",Let the Right One In

85,valleyjohn,Quite stunning,10,11 May 2009,"There have been countless movies about vampires. All with their own rules and guidelines on what constitutes being a vampire. Ever since Bram Stoker wrote the Count Dracula story we have been fascinated with the blood ravenous monster who has materialised in many different guises. But It's the child vampires that have spooked me. Who can forget the young brother hovering at the bedroom window in ""Salem's lot"" or Kirsten Dunst as the blood sucking Claudia in "" Interview with a Vampire"" ? Both very haunting characters that have stuck in the mind , but now there is a child Vampire to rival both of those and that is the beautiful but terrifying ""Eli"" . A fragile, anxious boy, 12-year-old Oskar is regularly bullied by his stronger classmates but never strikes back. The lonely boy's wish for a friend seems to come true when he meets Eli, also 12, who moves in next door to him with her father. A pale, serious young girl, she only comes out at night and doesn't seem affected by the freezing temperatures. Coinciding with Eli's arrival is a series of inexplicable disappearances and murders. One man is found tied to a tree, another frozen in the lake, a woman bitten in the neck. Blood seems to be the common denominator – and for an introverted boy like Oskar, who is fascinated by gruesome stories, it doesn't take long before he figures out that Eli is a vampire. But by now a subtle romance has blossomed between Oskar and Eli, and she gives him the strength to fight back against his aggressors. Oskar becomes increasingly aware of the tragic, inhuman dimension of Eli's plight, but cannot bring himself to forsake her. Frozen forever in a twelve-year-old's body, with all the burgeoning feelings and confused emotions of a young adolescent, Eli knows that she can only continue to live if she keeps on moving. But when Oskar faces his darkest hour, Eli returns to defend him the only way she can... Without sounding like a scratched record i have repeatedly said on my blog how great the Horror Movie scene is in Europe is at the moment. As good as the Europeans are at making scary flicks - Stateside is the opposite. ""Let the right one in"" is a stunning movie that is directed by Tomas Alfredson. It is beautifully shot , the acting is as good as anything you will see all year and the best of all , it's bloody scary! What i love about this movie is it's subtlety. There are no axes in the head , no stakes in the heart , no blindingly obvious and predictable Hollywood nonsense. This movie is as fresh as blood young Eli craves and it is a refreshing slant at a very old story. There are three or four scenes that are truly horrific. They don't involve blood or gore but are almost missable scenes that you cant help but rewind to check that you weren't imagining things and that your mind wasn't playing tricks with you ! ""Let the right one in"" is the a gem of a movie that must be seen by anyone who is brave enough to broaden their horizons and look beyond the regurgitated trash that is served up in the US at the moment. I have no doubt at some stage this will be remade for a Subtitle phobic American audience and if that happens it will be a complete shame.

86,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Haunting Tale of Finding One's Place,10,18 March 2019,"Now I have to admit, I saw the remake before seeing this original one. I knew at the time of seeing the other one that this did exist and all I ever heard about this film was how good it was. I liked the remake so I really wanted to see this one for awhile. I finally got a chance when I decided to watch winter based horror in December. I have now seen this for a second time as it was on the list for 2008 in the Summer Challenge Series over on the Podcast Under the Stairs I'm participating in. The official synopsis is Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant), an overlooked and bullied boy, finds love and revenge through Eli (Lina Leandersson), a beautiful, but peculiar girl.This film kicks off introducing us to Oskar. He's practicing with a knife, almost rehearsing what he would say. We learn the reason for this is that he is being bullied at school. The one leading that is Conny (Patrik Rydmark). There are some really cruel things that are done to Oskar.Moving into his building is Eli and her father, Håkan (Per Ragner). They are an odd duo and the moment they move in, things are put up in the window. One night while Oskar is practicing outside, Eli comes to talk to him.We then realize that Eli is a vampire. Håkan tries to protect and keep her safe. He has a way to murder people and drain them of their blood. What I really like about this though is he interrupted the times we see him trying to do this. I read this as he is older so if he was good in the past, he's losing his touch. Also that killing someone isn't as easy as it seems.There is then a night that Eli goes hunting alone, since blood was not brought to her that day. She attacks Jocke (Mikael Rahm), but she is seen by Gösta and his cat. He goes to tell a local man and his crew about what he saw. This other guy is Lacke (Peter Carlberg) and they are out to figure out what is going on. They know that a kid is the one that killed their friend. This crew goes to a local café, I'm assuming every day. They noticed that Håkan is there and not being friendly. Lacke tries to sit with him and he leaves, making them suspicious of him.During this, Oskar and Eli become friends. She is trying to keep him at a distance, but something happens to Håkan. The closer they become, the more she is trying to help him with his bullying situation. She wants him to become a little like her, where he will defend himself. Things take quite the turn when Oskar learns the truth about his friend and when he does stand up to the bullies.There's where I'm going to leave my recap. Something that really struck me about this was the depth of the story. Oskar doesn't have a lot of friends. He is quite lonely and he is bullied. He is an outcast. His parents are also divorced or just no longer together, so there's the aspect of growing up in a broken home. Meeting Eli changes all of that. He decides to take a work out in a class they have to get stronger. She actually inspires some confidence in him.On the other side of this we have Eli, who is an outcast for a different reason. She has been alive a long time and knows that she can't have friends in the normal sense. When Oskar wants to be with her, she has to warn him that it can't be. What actually I wonder about was her relationship with Håkan. How old was he when they came in contact. Oskar sees her more as mate where Håkan saw her as a child.Before moving on though, we also have Oskar's mother. He is an interesting boy in that he reads newspapers and is fascinated by it. He befriends Eli who is behind the murders that have sprung up. His mother is worried about him being out and this causes rifts between them. There's also another when he gets in trouble in school. He does the normal thing of protecting the bullies when he gets a cut on his face from them, but they don't reciprocate. They really can't, but they do decide to get even.There's also the interesting dynamic of Lacke and his crew of people. They come off almost like gangsters, but I really just think it is a group of people that have lived in the same area for awhile and protect their own. Lacke's girlfriend Virginia (Ika Nord) actually gets bit by Eli, but they interrupt her. This causes him to want to hunt her down even more. On top of that, it shows us more of the vampire rules of the film.That's where I want to take this next. The rules of the vampire in this film are traditional. We see that sunlight burns them and there is a great scene of what happens when they are bathed in it. I also love seeing what happens when a vampire comes in without being invited. This is a scene I knew about prior to seeing this and I have to say it was quite iconic.As to the pacing of the film, I have to say that I didn't mind it. The film does have more a slow-burn type feel and I think a lot of that comes from the almost 2 hour running time. I do think there could have been some stuff trimmed from the film which would have made it tighter, but that's not necessarily. This second viewing re-affirms that for me. I do have to say that I loved the climax scene of the film. It was definitely was satisfying to see. The only thing that I think could have been added was a little bit more bullying of Oskar.For a film that was acted by mostly children, I thought it was solid. I thought Hedebrant was pretty solid. He plays the role quite subdued, but I think that fits the role. He is a product of divorce so he keeps to himself. Because he is a little bit off, he is picked on and I think that influences the way he is. He is searching for someone who will accept him. I was really impressed by Leandersson though. Playing a vampire that has been alive for as long as she has is tough to do as a child. I like the move that the film dubbed over her voice for someone older. That adds a dimension to the character. I think she did a solid job as portraying someone much older than what we see, but longing for the same companionship this boy is. Ragner was solid in the supporting role he has. I'd say overall the rest of the cast round out the film for what was needed.Effects for the film I thought were good as well. Interesting we really don't see any physical changes in Eli as a vampire. I like think subtle approach to it. There is a fair amount of blood and I thought that looked good. It has a good color and consistency. The attack scenes are all done practically and looked quite real as well. The scene where Eli comes into Oskar's apartment was great. I also really like the scene showing what these vampires do when hit with direct sunlight as well. The only drawback I've seen is the cats. There's a scene that they attack and it is done with CGI. I wasn't the biggest fan there, but it doesn't ruin it. I should also say the cinematography is on point with how they frame shots as well. The use of mirrors I'm a big fan of.Now with that said, I was really blown away how good this film is. As I stated above, I had seen the remake first, so I had an idea of where this story was going. I really just liked the depth of the story as well as the characters. For being as long as it was, I thought it was paced well and I never got bored. The acting despite mostly children I thought was solid. The effects were really good. The score of the film really didn't stand out or hurt the film to me. If you are into vampire films I would definitely recommend this one. I also would recommend it if you want to see something with a relevant and powerful story of finding one's self and a companion. I do have to warn you, I watched this film in its native language of Swedish with subtitles on. I know there is a dubbed with English, but that's not the original language as a warning.",Let the Right One In
87,Seraphion,Too bad I saw the Hollywood remake before I saw this,7,5 November 2015,"Well, as the title said, I was kind of unfortunate to have seen the Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Grace Moretz Hollywood remake Let Me In. Now, having been enlightened after seeing the original, I can now say that the original Swedish version is even better. The mood is less darker, therefore enabling the movie to put itself the art-house style empty mood. The movie nicely created a great story that the whole Hollywood remake didn't even bother to insert a new thing, therefore depriving me from any surprise since I've already known the whole story. Yet I notice that this original version gets it even better in the character depth and relationships between them, since the Hollywood remake really felt that the characters are just copycats from this movie's. The acting overall feels nice. Kare Hedebrand is really convincing as the insecure and outcast Oskar, while Lina Leandersson played out the cold and timid vampire to take the audience into the story depth.",Let the Right One In

Based on the 2004 book by John Ajvide Lindqvist (never heard a thing of the book before but I will get it as soon as I can) Alfredson's film has conventional things but overall it is a pretty impressive and unique vampire film. And is full of young talent, the acting is superb from everyone but of course the young talent steals the film. Both were born in 1995, both have with Let the Right One In their very first film credit, both play the main characters, he, Kåre Hedebrant, plays Oskar and she, Lina Leandersson, plays Eli.

She is very pale and doesn't seem to freeze, although it's in the middle of the winter. She is twelve years old and has been so for a long while.It's not the story which makes this a good one. It's the environment, the day-to-day life, the dirty white colors, which sometimes turn into red. It's a story about revenge, which means it's a little conventional.

91,Foutainoflife,Guess I Need To Read The Book Now,8,20 July 2018,"This is an interesting take on a adolescent vampire. It starts to get a little confusing once you realize that Eli is a boy because this movie is about love. Love comes in all shapes, forms, sexualities and creatures and just because it is about love doesn't mean it has to be a sexually involved love. Love really comes down to a heartfelt desire to bond with someone regardless of their opposing or even negative attributes. It is touching when you take the time to look at it from that standpoint. 
After watching both movie adaptations of the book, I can't really say that I prefer one over the other even though may folks seem to believe this is the standout. I do know that there is a lot that is left unexplained and that means, at least for me, that I will have to read the book to answer some of my lingering questions. 
Overall, this movie works for me. I like the pace of it, the look of it and the care taken to show the bond developing between Oskar and Eli. I personally want my vampire movies to have an element of fear present and this just doesn't meet the mark and that is a bummer for me. Eli has the beauty and allure of a gothic vampire, especially in those eyes, but the danger he has the ability to impose is never really played up enough for me. I was so disappointed that the one scene that could have really shown his viciousness was only a shot of the aftermath. 
It is a good film. No doubt but the horror lover in me wanted more horror.",Let the Right One In

I didn't watch it with subtitles but rather with the dubbing in English. This movie was all set in 1982 and the two main characters were 12. I was 12 in 1982. The movie was about this 12 year old girl who was basically a vampire and drank blood. I am not sure why that one guy she lives with did all of her bidding. This was never explain. Neither was why he poured acid on his face and then let her kill him? Also, it was never explained who that one bully was that kept picking on Oskar. Why did the OLDER bully get involved. The ending scene was really great. I wish there would have been more explanation into the background of the vampire girl and why they decided to show Oskar catching a glimpse of the fact that she obviously had some kind of scar on her pelvis. I liked how she climbed up the building like a spider and also how that one lady burst into flames. Also, it was funny when all those cats attacked the lady.",Let the Right One In
93,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,A story about finding friendship in a very dreary world,10,5 January 2015,"Oskar is a twelve-year-old boy living in an apartment complex with his mom. He's having a rough time in life; his parents are getting a divorce, kids constantly beat him up and call him a girl at school and his only friend is a strange and quiet girl his age named Eli, new to the building - but she says they can never truly be friends.Nevertheless, Owen begins falling for Eli after a trip to the local mall to buy candy together. But Oskar does not know exactly who - what - Eli is. Why is her father so reclusive? Why is there always yelling coming from the walls? And Eli herself is starting to get closer to Oskar, despite the fact that she's probably the most dangerous thing in his life.Let The Right One In takes place in a Swedish suburb where nothing ever happens, in 1982, when anti-bullying rules just weren't as strict as they are now and bullies could easily get to kids when teachers weren't looking (which still happens in school more than schools care to admit). It's a story about love, about friendship and about survival. I had already read the book Let The Right One In (I got it in a box with Smog City, Bridge to Terabithia and Harold & Maude) and seen the English adapted version of the film, retitled 'Let Me In' and Starring United States actors. After watching this version, the original version, I've got to say that this one really beats the English remake in many ways.Let The Right One In stays true to the book, the plot and characters were exactly as I pictured them when I was reading the novel. The acting was excellent, especially from children, and I loved the soundtrack, it was melancholy and creepy and beautiful all at once. I'm also glad that Eli's character was kept true to the novel, because it explains a lot more than the 2010 remake. If you get the chance to watch Let The Right One In, chances are it'll have English subtitles and be Swedish, but that's the more accurate version so try to find the subtitled one if you can. It's really a movie worth watching and it deserves more than 10/10 stars.",Let the Right One In

The story is touching and hopeful, though many elements are dark, dirty and secretive... and pretty bloody at times. But all is done in such a natural manner that even the unnatural aspects (to me at least) seem to perfectly serve a higher planwithout the horrors this would have been a straight forward teen film regarding coming of age). I didn't read the book, but this script is a gem, that much I can say. Furthermore I could say a lot of other things about it, but this was only the second the time I saw it, and trying to reason with what I just saw, just doesn't feel right.The only things I must admit is that the special effects with the cats are, though very well done, not perfect, and the final attack of Eli ('under water') was, this second time around, a little - just a little - disappointing.

This tales the story of a blonde Swedish boy/loner named Oskar who befriends a strange girl named Eli who moves in next door. He wonders why she doesn't need a jacket in the Swedish winters nor why he never sees her in the daytime... hmmm... He soon finds out her secret, and a somewhat beautiful love story takes place. But don't get me wrong, this is one hell of a bloody movie. Definitely not for the squeamish for sure. I really did like how the director took some of the vampire folklore, and invented some new ones (to me that is) (Cats! arrrgrh) Simply a must see for horror film buffs, and easily one of the best films I've seen this year.

97,Terrell-4,"""I'm 12, and have been for a long time."" This is a wonderful film, poignant, restrained, a little bloody and one to talk about",9,8 December 2008,"Let the Right One In is poignant, sad, weird, different, elusive, as well as being a fine movie. Oskar is a blond 12-year-old who lives with his divorced mother in an apartment complex in Stockholm. He's bullied incessantly at school. Neither his mother nor his father seems to have much time for him. He's a quiet kid who dreams of getting back at his tormentors. He doesn't seem to have any friends. Then an older man and a child move into the apartment building. Her name, we learn, is Eli. She's 12 years old, too, pale, and at times looks haggard. Oskar meets her one evening in the playground in front of the apartment complex. Snow is deep on the ground. The weather is freezing. The cold doesn't bother Eli. By now we know Eli is a vampire. Oscar realizes this later. Let The Right One In is a strange fusion of coming-of-age and horror, but the result is something else. Don't ask me what. It doesn't fit in any film genre I'm familiar with. Calling it 'horror"" is too facile. Calling it ""coming of age"" is too shallow. In the course of the movie people will die, drained of their blood. Eli's...what?...protector?...partner?...the older man named Hakan she lives with...will kill for the blood he and Eli must have to survive. He'll die a terrible death himself. Eli will tell Oskar that they can't be friends, yet Oskar yearns for friendship. He asks Eli to be his girl friend before he knows she is a vampire and she asks him if he would like her if she weren't a girl. When he asks her age, she tells him she is 12 and has been for a long time. Oskar's innocence may be part of his protection. Eli is not innocent, but at times she seems as fragile as Oskar. Like the man she lives with, Eli will kill for blood. She must. Kare Hedebrant plays Oskar and Lina Leandersson plays Eli. I understand that at the time of filming Hedebrant was 12 and Leandersson was 11. Both were nonprofessionals. They are unnervingly natural. Neither makes a single false step. Hedebrant is exactly what a lonely, bullied 12-year-old could be. Leandersson is able to imply things we may not want to know just be being still. I wound up hoping for the best for both Oskar and Eli...but what the best might be could go in a number of directions. This is a film, adapted from his novel by John Ajvide Linqvist, which invites discussion and interpretation. Not everything is kept clear, and, for me, that increases the sense of elusiveness. Lat Den Ratte Komma is a wonderful film.",Let the Right One In
98,mstomaso,See the Right One,9,31 January 2012,"Oskar is a smart, if somewhat desensitized young teen from a broken home. Persecuted by his peers, he presents stoicism to the world and inwardly fantasizes about killing his persecutors as he becomes increasingly alienated from his parents. Kåre Hedebrant breathes a great depth into Oskar, creating a highly sympathetic, entirely believable and yet quite edgy protagonist. When a strange little girl, Elli (Lina Leandersson) bonds with him by announcing, out of nowhere, that they can not be friends, an intense Platonic love story begins. Elli, who may not be entirely human, and Oskar, a perennial victim, learn to defend each other in the only ways they can and in ways only they can. The story is quite touching, but, unsurprisingly, will leave you wondering how something so 'off' could be so delightfully moving. With a budget around $4,000,000.00, veteran director Alfredson has clearly gotten a great deal of art out of comparatively few resources. Adapted from a John Ajvide Lindqvist novel, Let the Right One In is a movie worth seeing at least once. It features exceptionally good acting, superb character development, straightforward but appropriate cinematography, and a memorably twisted love story. Accept no big-budget low quality imitations. This is the one you need to see.",Let the Right One In
99,gizmomogwai,Right on!,10,18 May 2013,"At first glance Swedish cinema got a little twisted after the death of Bergman, in a wonderful way- Let the Right One In is easily the best film I've seen from 2008, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was probably the best film I've seen from 2009. In particular, Let the Right One In is nothing short of a masterpiece- the greatest vampire film ever, easily eclipsing Nosferatu, Interview with the Vampire and the Hammer films.The movie centres on a lonely 12-year-old boy named Oskar who is tormented by the bullies at school, and their oppressiveness tends to fuel violent fantasies in Oskar himself. Then a girl moves into the same apartment building as Oskar; Eli mysteriously is only seen at night and is immune to freezing temperatures. She's accompanied by an adult named Hakan who's killing people and bringing back the blood to Eli. When about to be caught at the scene of a crime, Hakan burns his own face off with acid, and later Eli comes by the hospital to finish him off. How upset Eli is by the loss of her ""Renfield"" is up for debate- it could be her need for a companion that makes her turn to Oskar. When she crawls naked into Oskar's bed, Oskar concludes there's no better time to ask Eli to be his girlfriend- to which she strangely replies she is not a girl. From there, there are more revelations and deaths.Let the Right One In is a grotesquely beautiful film that sparkles on Blu-ray. But more importantly, the story is everything a vampire film needs to be- dark, atmospheric, resonating and scary. They absolutely nailed it. On the back of the Blu-ray is a quote from Guillermo del Toro- ""A chilling fairy tale. As delicate, haunting and poetic a film as you're ever bound to see."" It's that, indeed- but when I first saw the quote, my reaction was, who is Guillermo del Toro? I now know he's the director of Pan's Labyrinth (2006)- and on reflection, it's not surprising he'd approve. Let the Right One In and Pan's Labyrinth are spiritual twins- a gritty look at the world through the eyes of the child, along with a parallel supernatural story (in one, vampires, in the other, a faun and fairies). Both films succeed gloriously- in a way, they're carrying on a tradition that goes back at least as far as 1957, when The Seventh Seal gave us a dismal look at the Black Death, mixed with the symbolism of a knight playing chess with Death.Originally I rated this film as very good, and then on repeat viewings re-rated it as a masterpiece. I couldn't think of any reason not to- the most that can be said against it is that the title is a little long and awkward, and sounds more like a Spike Lee movie than a vampire story (Do the Right Thing!). I don't much care for the revelation that Eli was born male and castrated, but I appreciate others feel it adds a layer to the story- the love between Oskar and Eli is asexual. (Because Eli has obviously made the choice to live as a girl, I still tend to refer to the character as ""she"" and ""her""). All things considered, Let the Right One In is a spellbinding, compelling film, and it's highly unfortunate that it's dropped off the top 250, and was snubbed at the Oscars.",Let the Right One In
100,jaredmobarak,Squeal like a piggy  Låt den rätte komma in,9,12 January 2009,"I still have no idea what has made vampires so in fashion this year, but I am kind of glad they are. Sure you'll get the mainstream, watered-down stuff like Twilight, but along with that are the surprises like HBO's ""True Blood"". Let's go ahead and put Sweden on the list of fresh takes as Tomas Alfredson's Låt den rätte komma in (Let the Right One In), adapted by John Ajvide Lindqvist from his own novel, is quite unforgettable. Not since the Russian supernaturally inclined Night Watch have I seen this subject matter brought to life in such a seemingly unique and original way. It is the sheer realism that makes the film so unnervingly tough to watch, especially since our leads are only twelve years oldmore or less. The atmosphere is starkly bleak, the pacing and composition methodically precise, and the complete whole just beautiful to set your eyes upon. You'll feel as though the chill has entered your room, all oxygen sucked out as in a vacuum, but you will not be able to turn away.The story consists of your usual, bullied middle-schooler, taking the abuse and acting out his revenge in the confines of his own solitude. Without friends, young Oskar finds himself talking to the air, or a tree, wielding a hunting knife and doing to his imaginary counterparts that which the real miscreants do to him. It is his revenge-induced speech that catches the attention of a young girl, just moved next-door, named Eli. She knows the rage he feels only too well, except, when it comes to her bloodlust, it is necessity and not desire. This vampire is made to kill, something her guardian, (is it her father? Her uncle? An old friend that has aged while she has not?), attempts to protect her from by killing and gathering blood while she stays safe indoors. Alive for so long, feeding on the dead to survive, she finally finds a friend, someone much like heran outsider that will not be understoodthat she can possibly be herself with, that she can help to realize he does not want to become a killer.What sticks with you most, after watching, is the amazing sense of detail throughout. Right down to the mucus on Oskar's mouth from the cold weather, everything is thought of, letting you enter this world as though it's right in front of you despite the fact vampires exist. When it comes to that mythical creature too, though, you can't fault the three-dimensionality. All the things you may wonder about: What happens when one goes into sunlight? What happens if it enters without being invited? How does a bite affect its victim if not killed as a result? They will be touched upon and answered. Supernatural strength, inhuman speed, and the ability of flight? Just keep your eyes open because it's all here, displayed in a way that you could almost believe is ture. Alfredson creates a world much like our own, same rules and same emotions, you just have to worry a bit more about who you let into your house.But don't think of this as a vampire story; it is so much more than that. The performances by Kåre Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson as Oskar and Eli respectively vault it into a tale about humanity and love. The bond these two misfits create is stronger than anything you can imagine, as they will do anything to keep the other safe. Eli asks at one point if Oskar would like her if she wasn't a girl and he says sure. It is a query that intrigues on the basis that you believe her being a vampire means she is dead and no longer human, yet, as a short scene shows us, the question of gender may be more than that, especially since she says that she is not dead, she just feeds on blood. Watching her puke when trying to digest just one piece of candy, or what happens when she enters her friend's apartment uninvited, shows the unglamorous lifestyle she lives. This is not the immortallive without consequencesriot you may have seen before. Being a vampire is a curse, but one that has its advantages, as you will see.That leads into the question of the title and whether it regards Oskar or Eli. Does the boy let the right vampire into his life, the person he can relate to and enlist to help him, or does the girl let the right human in, someone she can allow herself to love and care about despite the monster she knows she is? These two become inseparable on a very spiritual level, one that puts them to the ledge of killing in order to protect the other. However, the ability to commit murder is much different than the desire to. As you will see at the end, vengeance can be both brutal and rewarding. In what could be the single best take all year, a static shot, underwater in the school pool, an angle so meticulously positioned that the artistry leaves you just as speechless as what occurs in the frame, you will be hard-pressed to forget what retribution looks likeand the smile will haunt you.A piece of art, through and through, this carefully paced tale of friendship and love between two worlds is not to be missed. Nor is it to be disregarded and thrown to the side as another horror film. It is a tale of humanity that only the naïveté of children can show. Complete with cinematography that could be freeze-framed at any moment and hung in a gallery, Låt den rätte komma in grabs ahold and doesn't let go.",Let the Right One In
101,hall895,Sink your teeth into this one,7,3 December 2010,"Oskar is a meek, rather lonely 12-year old Swedish boy. His parents have separated, he's constantly bullied at school and he seems to have no friends at all. Then a young girl, Eli, moves into the apartment next door. Oskar takes a liking to her but there's something strange about this girl. Actually there are a lot of strange things about this girl. She has an almost impossibly pale complexion. She only comes out at night. She never seems to eat anything. She walks around barefoot in the snow, not feeling the cold. And she's got a funny smell to her, kind of like...a corpse? Yep, she's a vampire. Sigh, there's always something.Oskar is not initially clear on exactly who or what Eli really is but even as the truth comes into focus he doesn't seem particularly fazed by it. The poor boy will take any kind of friend he can get. So Oskar and Eli's friendship blossoms and there's more than a hint of romance. Or at least as much romance as there can be between a 12-year old boy and whatever it is Eli actually is. Even when we, and Oskar, think we know Eli maybe we don't. This girl's got plenty of secrets. There's no denying that Eli is good for Oskar. She helps him to learn to stand up for himself. And should he find himself in any real trouble having a vampire as a best friend is bound to come in handy.Now this movie has gotten a lot of ""best vampire movie ever"" hype. That's probably a stretch. It's a good vampire movie though, certainly an unusual and compelling one. The two young performers playing the main roles, Kåre Hedebrant as Oskar and Lina Leandersson as Eli, had to be excellent in order for this movie to work and they are both up to the task. Hedebrant creates a wonderfully sympathetic character, capturing the shyness and overall meek nature of this simple little boy wonderfully. And Leandersson is the true standout, giving a performance which shows a maturity well beyond her years which of course works perfectly for the character she is playing. From the moment we first meet Eli it is obvious there's so much more to this character than can be seen at first glance. There's depth and weight there, so much life has been lived behind those eyes. And Leandersson brings all that out perfectly. The two young performers, and their characters, have great chemistry. It's a sweet little love story about a love which cannot be. Eli provides us with a few frights but if you're looking for a lot of bloodsucking you've probably come to the wrong vampire movie. This movie keeps a lot under wraps, mostly only hinting at what Eli is capable of. Which gives the moments she lets loose that much more impact. You could call it a thinking person's vampire movie. It's slowly paced, content to build steadily towards...well, towards what exactly? As you watch the movie you may at times find yourself wondering if this movie is ever really going to pay itself off. You may be looking for some more thrills and chills.

102,MrGKB,Remarkably well done for what it is...,7,8 August 2009,"...""Let the Right One In"" was not at all what I expected (for which I am thankful), although I can't say it truly deserves its current lofty ranking here on the IMDb. Perhaps, though, I'm simply too jaded. No matter; it's still a superb indie and definitely one of the more outré genre films I've seen in a good while. That it originated in Sweden will come as no surprise to those who watch it.As scores, if not hundreds, of scribes here have mentioned, it's essentially a coming-of-age film. Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant) , a 12-year-old put-upon little dweeb (by almost anyone's definition), who immediately reminded this viewer of Edgar Winter, meets Eli (Lina Leandersson), the new girl in town, who only seems to come out at night, appears to be impervious to cold weather, and for whatever reason (that becomes plain enough by film's end) takes an instant liking to Oskar. It's very basic boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-wins-girl romance, only at a prepubescent, non-sexual level. And, of course, with a very peculiar twist, which Eli reveals to Oskar very early on: ""I'm not a girl."" Eli is, in fact, a vampire. Anyone reading this blurb already knows that, and I'm not going to reveal anything else, character-wise or plot-wise.Adapted to the screen from the author's own novel, ""Let the Right One In"" moves at a somewhat glacial pace that befits its locale. The camera-work by Hoyte Van Hoytema is thoroughly assured, if somewhat static. Many shots maintain a certain distance, conferring a certain matter-of-factness that sinks into the viewer like an advancing chill; in some cases it works wonderfully (I'm thinking the under-the- bridge attack), while in others it doesn't so much. There are any number of lovely 2d-unit shots that do nothing to advance the story, but seem to be there to pad the running time. It's not a big deal, but my Americanized brain would have liked a bit more movement, and a bit more connection to the characters at times. Ymmv. The score is apt, building mood and tension when the visual storytelling sometimes seems to be going in the opposite direction, which works well. Production values are very good.The child leads are excellent, very well cast. Ms. Leandersson has the more difficult role, and handles it with an assurance that absolutely belies her age. Mr. Hedebrant is no slouch, either; his delicate, somewhat androgynous wimp is winningly delineated, if perhaps a shade too inexpressive at times, though I must admit that I realize I am influenced by my own very American perceptions of what good acting is. The supporting cast, despite being virtual unknowns outside of Sweden, acquit themselves well, though again the difference in acting styles may put off melodramatic American audiences.I don't know that I agree with the pundits who write things like, ""Best. Vampire. Movie. Ever,"" but I still liked it a lot. Certain antecedents were apparent, like ""Near Dark,"" ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,"" ""Funny Games,"" and even ""The Crying Game."" Believe it or not, I'm actually interested in seeing what Follywood does with the supposedly greenlighted remake. It'll be revealing to see what elements of the story get excised and which ones don't. I'm also extremely interested to see who gets cast; whoever the kids end up being, they've got some mighty big shoes to fill.Highly recommended to genre fans, with the caveat that this is not standard film fare, at least for American audiences. It's much, much better than that ""other"" Sweden vampire film, ""Frostbiten.""",Let the Right One In
103,rockman182,Let The Right One In (2008),7,7 February 2017,"Vampires in film have been so saturated these days so its nice to see an effective film. I've been meaning to watch this for a while. I saw the American remake a few years back and thought it was solid but now I can see the source material was very good. There's a few moments where the film is uneven but overall the imagery and relationship between the protagonists really make this film work.The film is about a young boy who is bullied at school, who befriends a mysterious little girl who is actually a vampire. While its easy to grasp whats going on with her character there's still a longing to know exactly what her past was. I think the connection with the characters are great and is probably the strongest point of the film. This is a vampire film that revolves on a young friendship, this is not something that we see very often.There are some real evil characters in the film (namely the bullies). Its balanced real well with a vampire who feeds on and kills other but shes actually a hero at the end. You feel connected to Eli and Oskar because the filmmaker but their relationship first and the film really builds itself on that. There are horrific moments in the film that occur so quickly and suddenly, that it leaves a lasting impression. The film doesn't focus too much on gore but what we see is done very well.I don't always watch foreign films unless they get rave but here's one I'm glad I saw. Its definitely better than the American counterpart and I feel like this film is probably one of the best foreign depictions of vampire culture. If I ever get a chance I may check out more of Swedish cinema because I already loved the original Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (Millennium) trilogy. Sweden knocks another one out of the park.7.5/10",Let the Right One In
104,fwomp,Sticks With You,7,16 October 2009,"It's taken me a long time to write a review of this film after seeing it. The delay came not from the daunting praise that's been heaped upon it (well over 60 international award nominations/wins), but by the film itself. It also has ...something ...about it that lingers in the mind; something that I'll try to hit upon while writing this review.First let's talk about the movie's genre. It has often been mislabeled as horror. It isn't. It has very few horror elements and should never be cast into that bloody pool (those who've seen the film will get my pun ...I hope). Yes, there's the vampire construct from the beginning, but this vampire film is far different than those that've come before. It is touching in the adolescent sense and numbing in the way the story unfolds and is filmed.So let's talk a moment about the filming. Shot on-location in Sweden during the winter months, the color film is often muted by the black and white of snow and buildings. This gives the film a unique feel and a connection to the main characters (as they live in a black-and-white world full of knowns ...for a while), but it also makes the eyes of the viewer tired of seeing the same drabness. This is why I gave the film a bit lower rating than most. Although I know where and why writer/director Alfredson did what he did — for the sake of his art — I don't think it translated completely to the big screen.The story, however, is pretty magical in that it takes an old genre (vampire films) and puts a new spin on it. The main characters aren't just young, they're REALLY young. Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is just 12 years old. Battling toward adolescence, he is small for his age and is ridiculed and tortured by fellow classmates. One can only imagine the amount of anger bottled up inside him. But we don't have to imagine it ...because it shows up in the form of a 12-year-old girl named Eli (Lina Leandersson), an aged vampire forever locked in a young body. The two form a friendship based on puzzles (Rubik's Cube) and their need to connect with someone their own age. For Eli, the connection is a much greater need (as we see by the end of the film). But for Oskar, it must feel just as great.And speaking of the end, there's a surprise waiting for those who make it through the film. A big one. The ending, when spoken about in movie circles, is often said to present more questions than answers. Was Oskar just a pawn for Eli? Something she needed to survive? Was Eli even real? Or was she a dark figment of Oskar's personality that manifested itself via murder? It is a dichotomy that will not be easily un-puzzled.And herein lay the reason it took me so long to review LET THE RIGHT ONE IN after seeing it: I didn't know how to respond (myself) to that ending. But one things for sure, it stuck with me. I remember every word the two main characters spoke and recall all of the mixed angst and beauty they represented. It definitely sank a fang into me.",Let the Right One In

I have now seen both of them twice, and much to my surprise I may SLIGHTLY prefer the English language version. mainly because cuts down some of the dull secondary characters, and changes the murder scenes so they become more dramatic, without sacrificing the subtle beauty behind the gore.Don't get me wrong, (GREAT PRETENDERS SONG) I still rate this one immensely. But have you ever written a brilliant novel which nevertheless had a few minor 'niggles' in which you wanted to correct just before publication? Well maybe, LTROI was the rough draft, and LMI is the final product. But it REALLY doesn't matter one iato.

107,bob998,Some funny Swedes,6,17 January 2009,"The users over 45 have given it an average 6.2 rating, so I will too. It has some jokes, some moving scenes and a couple of good performances, but no more than that. If you are looking for a masterpiece in the vampire genre, try Bram Stoker's Dracula or Interview with the Vampire.I found the story a bit silly at times: why does Oskar spend his spare time lifting weights? it doesn't seem to help him. The three bullies are an embarrassment to the film: they have no sinister weight to them. The scene at Oskar's father's house is nicely ambiguous, turning around excessive drinking--it is one of a few scenes that really work to flesh out the story. Kare Hedebrant as Oskar is wooden sometimes; the director may have told him to slow down his delivery for greater effect but I found it tiresome. Lina Leanderssohn is magnetic: walking around in the snow in her bare feet, ratty-looking and smelly (according to Oskar), she is always compelling.",Let the Right One In
108,ajs-10,"Beautifully made, atmospheric Swedish horror... Truly excellent!",10,30 May 2010,"I've heard a lot of praise about this film and so I thought I'd better check it out. I wasn't disappointed; it's a truly excellent film. Very original in its approach and very well executed, I find it hard to find a fault with it! But I digress; it's made in Swedish with subtitles, but believe me its well worth battling with the text. Here's a short summary before a bit more praise.As I've already said, the film is Swedish, and as you'd expect the setting is a small town in Sweden. It's winter, unless it snows all year round there, and twelve year old Oskar, a bit of a loner, makes a new friend, Eli, when she moves into the apartment next door. Oskar has a problem with bullies at school and Eli teaches him to stand up for himself, but this causes further complications along the line. Meanwhile, there are several unexplained deaths occurring across the town that nobody seems to be able to solve. As Oskar and Eli's friendship deepens, he discovers her secret, she's a vampire, and as such it may not be possible for her to stay for much longer. I won't say any more, don't want to give too much away.This is the best film I've seen so far this year. Beautifully shot with a really atmospheric soundtrack and brilliant performances from the two main actors, Kåre Hedebrant as Oskar and Lina Leandersson as Eli. Notable mentions must also go to Per Ragnar as Håkan, Henrik Dahl as Erik, Karin Bergquist as Yvonne, Peter Carlberg as Lacke and Patrik Rydmark as Conny.This is how a vampire movie should be made in my opinion, it's understated and quite beautifully shot. The soundtrack fits the pictures perfectly and it's a really touching tale. I really identified with the main characters and found it easy to feel for them as their lives are turned inside out. A truly excellent film and very very highly recommended! My score: 9.5/10",Let the Right One In
109,mitsubishizero,Tragic yet hauntingly beautiful,8,18 March 2021,"This was an interesting movie to watch. Both it and the remake. The story's based off the book it was adapted from. A bullied boy befriends a mysterious girl who despite warning him they can't be friends, slowly and slowly become that the more time they spend with each other. Around this time, a series of grisly murders begin to pop up. And they may involve the girl.The acting's pretty well done. There's a huge sense of isolation and loneliness that prevails throughout the story. The pacing is slow and eerie at times which really drives the point of how isolating many of these characters are. The friendship between the two kids is nice but at the same time, you know something's up.Eli's sweet, but also has an obvious dark and mysterious side she seems to struggle to hide at times. Her life is even stranger when you realize her caretaker's not her father. He's not blood related at all. His role is pretty grim.Let the Right One In is a great Horror film.

110,charlytully,Not a rodent in sight!!!,8,20 December 2009,"Being fans of such rodent classics as Willard, Ben, Charly, Scratch, etc., we felt no qualms when the Rosebush Bloody Thorn Film Club delegated us to rent something from the local disc-o-bob for our annual Gnaw Night. When we surfed the internet, the first result neither of us had previously viewed was this show, LAT DEN RATTE KOMMA IN. Well, we're not fluent in Jibberarian, but since the letters were from our alphabet we figured a rough translation of this title had to be something such as ""SEND IN THE RATS."" Anyway, that night the whole gang was gathered in our clubhouse--the former Rosebush Rialto--when we fired up the so-called ""rattes."" The flick turned out to be about some wimpy middle school kid who spent his time listening to his bedroom wall in an attempt to spy on the new girl next door, whose father is some sort of serial killer. Even after the girl pushes him out of a seventh floor window, he somehow survives and snuffs three of the boy's friends at his school swimming pool. Fortunately for the wimpy boy, the girl uses some money she stole from the killer to buy a couple train tickets, so the movie ends with the two youngsters fleeing to safety in the train.

112,EijnarAmadeus,Look closer...,8,18 May 2009,"Reviewing a film of such caliber as Tomas Alfredson's 'Låt den rätte komma in"" is almost useless, because as any masterwork of cinematic art it's got layers and elements that goes so deep, and are so full of so incredibly powerful emotion and spirit that I felt like I was ruining the experience just by simplifying it with my own words - placing my profound feelings that arose during the watch into certain ""categories"" and known stalls, and suddenly I had started picking the film apart. 'Låt den rätte komma in' is such a beautiful film that it's hard to find words to describe it; it's a tale of the unknown, of loneliness and embedded desperation, about a flair of light in the darkest of places that forms into the truest of things. The story is so detailed with incredibly interesting characters, their society and its atmosphere in their snowy, cold hometown - and the entering outsider is a compelling figure of mythological mystery; apprehensive and stirring, terrifying and lovely. Shot masterfully by Hoyte van Hoytema who's eye for innovative camera angels and enigmatic light & shadow pulsates the film, composed beautifully by Johan Söderqvist, impressive acting by youngsters Kåre Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson who play the two main characters, and all the other priceless members of the crew involved in such a masterpiece, under the brilliant direction of Tomas Alfredson of John A.

My first ever Swedish film. Not a bad introduction. Forget Swedish band Abba. Director Thomas Alfredson crafted a great critically lauded film in 2008.It basically follows the story of Oskar, a bullied 12 year old boy in a suburb near Stockholm.
He fantasized about gaining revenge on his bullies. Practicing with a knife and reading the details of murders.He lives an isolated life in some block of flats.
However one day he meet a a new next door neighbour Eli. Now we learn that Eli hides a bloody secret. She is a vampire!
Where as Oskar dreams of bloody revenge
She needs to kill to survive basically.Now the film doesn't just go of on a bloodthirsty tangent. The relationship between the two is developed.Director Thomas Alfredson created one of his best films before Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy came along in 2010.Every now and then a foreign language film has to be tried.

114,Prichards12345,Fine but a bit overrated,7,17 August 2010,"Hmmm, I must be an ""Intellectually challenged IMDb reviewer"" because I enjoyed this film; I like its style and look - snowscapes and drab urban apartments, although some of acting is pretty sub-standard and the plot seems like pieces of a jig saw puzzle which don't quite fit. At least it isn't the usual Hollywood teenage vampire mooning that is all the rage these days...The story concerns 12 year old Oskar, bullied at school and alienated at home befriending Eli, a girl who's just moved in next door. The movie tips its hat that she's a vampire almost immediately, her slave/helper gutting a local youth in the park but being interrupted and leaving his blood, which he has siphoned off, behind. It's never explained why he's helping Eli in the first place, but the movie plays its vampire lore quite straight and traditional - vampires are destroyed by sunlight, and cannot cross a threshold without being invited. They are also repulsed by human food and appear to have atrophied sex-organs.Punctuating the slow pace is a series of killings and vampire attacks, some of which are extremely effective. I particularly liked the scene with the cats (won't spoil it by explaining) and the friendship between boy and vampire is rather affecting and warm, in contrast to the snow- bound landscape. However the movie is rather illogical in it's plot development and doesn't really go anywhere in particular. The ending made me wonder if Eli is simply using Oskar as another helper - was her middle-aged slave at the beginning once a young boy? This is a good movie on the whole, with a sort of crisply anaemic atmosphere, but the post MTV generation will be rather bored and it IS overrated.",Let the Right One In
115,Superunknovvn,"Pretty slow (bear with me, I didn't miss the point)",6,14 December 2008,"I am going to give you a very subjective view on this much praised Swedish vampire movie. Objectively, there's nothing wrong with it. It's a coming of age story with vampire elements that takes its time to unfold. The direction is tasteful, the acting is good (as far as I can tell, speaking not one word Swedish) and the movie is certainly one of a kind.Still, personally I didn't enjoy ""Låt den rätte komma in"" too much and had to fight my way through it. It's just so damn slow, which I'm aware is intentional. Life in this middle-of-nowhere-town, where the characters of ""Låt den rätte komma in"" live, is damn slow. I did like that new approach to horror. It's not as fairy tale-like as Guillermo del Toro's work, it's not spiced with a forced twist at the end like M. Night Shyamalan's movies and it sure as hell isn't your everyday Hollywood slasher or Asian ghost story. It's just a drama anchored in real life with a few horror elements thrown in. So, yeah, as I've said, this is an original movie. Only problem is, as a horror movie it's neither shocking, nor spooky. As a drama ""Låt den rätte komma in"" is okay, but the horror elements are just a bit out of place.A lot of people will love the movie for exactly the same reasons that I was pretty much bored throughout the entire 120 minutes running time. Let's say that ""Låt den rätte komma in"" is good, but not for everyone, and certainly not for every horror buff. You might wanna give it a try to find out which category of people you belong in. If you don't like the movie after the first 15 minutes, though, you might as well turn it off, as it doesn't get any different from then on.",Let the Right One In
116,RJBurke1942,Where we learn how vampire movies sometimes get a bad rap....,4,20 February 2015,"I like horror movies viz. Audition (1999), Funny Games (2007), Blindness (2008), Perfect Sense (2011) and a few others. I also like terror movies e.g. Silence of the Lambs (1991), Alien (1979), The Thing (1982), Terminator (1984) and many, many more. What I abhor, though, are movies which are, at best, mediocre, fantastic dramas and which tout themselves as horror stories also.Not by any metric can LTROI be considered horror; compare Audition or Funny Games if you disagree. The best this movie can achieve is a few gruesome scenes designed to titillate viewers' expectations. The plot is boringly predictable, there is nothing much terrifying, and suspense is equally lacking. Moreover, any story that uses the vampire theme is just fantasy; and such stories are usually simple, or simply banal. Only when the vampire theme is satirized e.g. in the recent (2012) Abraham Lincoln outings, can viewers get their money's worth, perhaps, and a few laughs.Generally, the pacing of this One is slow to the point of soporific; the acting, for the most part, has all the life of, well, dead people, I'd say; there are annoying plot holes; the final scene between the victim and the bullies is outrageously, unbelievably bizarre; and the aftermath, which features only the - now triumphant - victim, is truly ludicrous. On the other hand, the photography is good - even occasionally innovative; the frigid setting is appropriate and effective; the special effects (blood and gore) are adequate to carry the story; and, finally, the soundtrack is okay.On balance, I can understand how this movie would entertain today's young movie-goers, particularly teens and young adults. It appeals to all those who've been bullied, physically and psychologically, at school; it satisfies the fantasy of getting revenge upon enemies; it soothes emotions ravaged by an uncaring family; and it provides hope for those who desperately want to be accepted, warts and all. Unfortunately, it explicitly advocates inhuman violence as a viable solution for personal problems; implicitly, it suggests the dissolution of the difference between right and wrong is morally acceptable; it distorts the concept of true love between humans; and, worst of all, it explicitly suggests pre-teens rarely, if ever, need adult advice.So this One certainly isn't a horror movie - it's just a horror of a movie....But, as I said, I'm not anti-horror or anti-terror in movies per se. To exploit child actors, though, simply to ""expose"" school bullying within an inane fantasy is obviously a ploy to just get tongues wagging and more money than it deserves at the box office. As a counterpoint, Tom Brown's Schooldays (1951), for example, did a much better job of denouncing school bullying and exposing that type of horror.LTROI gets a point for each of the above technical aspects discussed - a total of four; nothing more. And I wouldn't advise paying any money to see this One: get a loan of the DVD from a buddy instead, if you really want to waste your time.February 20, 2015",Let the Right One In

Although not a particularly scary film it is pretty gory with some intense scenes. It is a better film than the USA remake Let Me In.I liked the performances of the two young leads. Kare Hedebrant is effective as the young bullied schoolboy and Lina Leandersson is perfect as the vampire. I can't really understand why some people find the story slow as there are plenty of memorable scenes and at times macabre scenes throughout the whole film.

120,Imdbidia,Terrifc and refreshing approach to the vampire genre,9,13 February 2011,"A Swedish romance and horror film based on the eponymous novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist, who also wrote the script. It tells the story of the friendship between Oskar, a 12y.o. weak and sweet boy bullied at school, and Eli, a 12y.o. strong lonely vampire girl who moves to Oskar's building in Stockholm.The appeal and success of the movie are indebted in equal parts to the script and the terrific performances of the leading young actors Kåre Hedebrant as Oskar, Lina Leandersson as Elis, and Patrik Rydmark as the leader of the bullies. The leading couple has a great chemistry on camera, and they are really well chosen as they complement each other physically, and both have an allure of innocence and strength at the same time.If vampires existed in the modern world, how would they live? Most probably as they are portrayed in this movie. It is the believability of the story what will appeal to people who usually hate vampire movies, like me. It is not the gory part, but the soul of the vampire, the physical and emotional needs to survive and how to achieve it, what we are presented with here. At the same time, the vampire theme glues well to a story that is already good without it, which approaches with honesty the sins of modern urban society: isolation, loneliness, craving for affection, miscommunication and friendship/love as redemption. The struggle of Oskar at school, his alienation from his divorced parents, the struggle of Eli to be loved and have a normal life, her guilt at having to kill to survive, are equally believable and intriguing.The atmosphere is fantastic - peaceful and menacing at the same time. One of the best points of the cinematography is that it is rarely ""dark"", but virginal white or very luminous, even the night shots, so most of the clichés of the genre are turned over and revamped, leaving those strictly necessary for the genre to work in the 21st century. The movie has some funny and shocking scenes, too, the one with the cats and the burning in hospital among the most memorable.An excellent romantic horror film, with a terrific script, good performances and a great atmosphere, which will captivate both lovers and haters of the genre.

121,doctorsmoothlove,An essential vampire film,10,20 December 2008,"When I was a high school student, I traveled to Central America to study Spanish. I am not a social person, so I sat in my room and read most days. One novel I read during the trip was The Vampire Lestat. It is the sequel to Anne Rice's seminal work Interview with the Vampire, and, in my opinion, a better novel than its predecessor. I love that book because it described Lestat's experience being a vampire.When I watched Let the Right One In, I was reminded of my experience reading Anne Rice's books. The stories both involve vampires but concern greater topics. This film uses vampirism to explore loneliness and acceptance. The story is about a young boy who befriends a girl vampire. Both of them are ostracized and introverted people. The boy, Oskar, is marginalized from his peers by bullies and has no bond with his divorced parents. Eli is an ageless entity who destroys nearly everyone she encounters, even her trusted servant. They meet and develop a platonic friendship.Oskar is naïve for his age and fails to realize Eli's nature even after multiple bodies are discovered. She plays along until Oskar openly asks her if she is a vampire. She says ""I live on blood yes"" and continues talking to him. Oskar isn't affected by it. He even asks her to be his girlfriend, but Eli tells him ""I'm not a girl,"" to which Oskar responds, ""Do you still want to go steady?"" I was intrigued to learn that Eli's character is male in the original novel but maintains female characteristics. In the movie version, I was unable to distinguish if Eli's ""I'm not a girl"" refers to her gender identity or her status as a vampire. It's irrelevant because the screenplay focuses on the children's relationship as friends not lovers. Oskar is right when he tells Eli that ""going steady"" is no different from hanging out.There is a beautiful ambiguity to this movie. There are many ways to interpret what occurs on screen. I was never certain that Eli had any affection for Oskar as anything other than a future assistant. Her previous human helper disfigures himself to prevent her discovery and offers himself to her as final service. Eli, unlike Edward Cullen, is remorseful about killing some people but nonchalant with others. She cries when she devours a man who mistakes her for an injured child but tears apart Oskar's bullies. Though its protagonists are children, the film's target audience is adults. Its brutality is compensated with a unique sentimentality its child characters provide. The violence is presented as unfortunate and is associated with negativity. Eli prefers not to kill her victims and only once does so without any reason or regret. She also scolds Oskar for his wish to kill others like she does.Let me admit now: Let the Right One In isn't a genre horror movie. It's more an uneasy drama about two lonely people. Even previous films like Bram Stoker's Dracula were satisfied with ""being"" a vampire film and conforming to audience expectations. There is no fanservice in this movie, at least not until the ending. Tomas Alfredson is a skilled director and has a focus in this piece. Several efforts are made to limit gore visibility. He focuses the screenplay on the two children while adding in enough lines for us to develop some sympathy for Eli's victims. All of them are related, in some odd way, and miniature mystery subplot is the result.The film is set in Stockholm during the 1980's and has a desolate, indeterminate look. Snow covers every location and becomes thicker as the film progresses. Most scenes occur indoors or near a building which is well-lighted. This isn't going to scare you but force you to look directly at Oskar and Eli. Alfredson knows this and adds several Easter eggs. When Eli attacks her first victim, a car passes by overhead. When Oskar is being held underwater by his tormentors, a severed head appears behind him. Both of these scenes keep the film from falling too far into one genre and restore its ambiguity.Vampires are one of the few beings present in all stages of cinematic history. In that span of over a century, there are about twenty movies which are recognized as influential and significant. No, I've not seen all of them. The last one was arguably Shadow of the Vampire but Let the Right One In will join that sacred list. It's a magnificent film and a must-view for fans of the genre and disgruntled haters of Twilight.",Let the Right One In
122,ruby_fff,The extraordinary friendship of Oskar and Eli - a tender vampire story poetically directed by Swedish filmmaker Tomas Alfredson,8,4 May 2009,"I did delay in seeing this film as I am not readily motivated to go see horror/vampire movies unless they are worthwhile. Noticed it had 'staying' power at the local Landmark indie theaters, and I am absolutely glad I finally saw it. It is highly recommended as everyone says.The two young leads in LET THE RIGHT ONE IN are godsend pairing: Kåre Hedebrant as Oskar and Lina Leandersson as Eli, both delivered strong integral performances in their debut feature film appearance. The story is remarkable in itself, based on the best-selling novel of author John Ajvide Lindqvists, who also wrote the screenplay for the film. Cinematography, especially the snow & snowing ""in-between"" scenes are stunning. I appreciate the use of silence with no dialog nor music - enhanced the storytelling with viewers focus. There is a lyrical film score by Johan Söderqvist that subtly brings out the teen angst and ethereal moods of Oskar and Eli scenes with guitars and strings. The piece at the end credits roll gave a sense of after the storm when sky is clear and all things are calm and in harmony again. (It also reminds me of Stravinsky's ""The Rite of Spring"".) There is horror, but since I went in with 'this is a vampire story' in mind, accepted the assumptions that vampires need to 'feed' on blood to stay alive, need darkness by day with no sunlight, can 'move' around with agility including flying and possess certain 'power' beyond humans - the 'bloody' scenes and imagery were not so terrifying after all. The story does cover subplots and supporting characters to enable Oskar and Eli's friendship to develop and bond with love and caring between the two. The human frailties of mistrust, dysfunctional parents, skeptical neighbors, nasty bullies in school - Eli encourages Oskar to fight back and reassures him that if necessary, she will help him.It's a fascinating story and director Alfredson, with Ajvide's 'clean' script, is so skillful in tying the scenes and elements together, along with the punctuation of silent visual episodes interchange with brief haunting melodic background music at critical segments. There's no need for any vampire 'gore' - slight special effects perhaps. The pace and rhythm is quite poetic in depicting the central theme: the extraordinary relationship between Oskar and Eli.The DVD contains 'Audio in English' version and it's actually quite well done: the dialog heard is more appropriate to the plot and storyline vs. the English subtitled words which didn't match what's heard at times. (Don't think we need another Hollywood remake when this Swedish version is flawless with the two talented young actors.) Included on the disc is a brief Behind the Scenes segment with director (speaking in English) providing insights to the film preparation/production. A soundtrack audio CD is also available with 21 tracks featured.LET THE RIGHT ONE IN (2008, Swedish) is a DON'T MISS film experience.",Let the Right One In

In this case, snowy Stockholm, and alienated 12-year-old Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant) is having a rough time of it from the school bullies, until androgynous little Eli (Lina Leandersson) arrives to make it right, while doing terrible wrongs.This haunting, near-indefinable art-house-crossover sensation isn't a high school horror exclusively, though the scenes set within its gates are as ghastly, if not more so, than those from any classic gym locker shocker: see what happens to Eli's guardian Håkan (Per Ragnar) in the shower rooms, or what happens to bullies and their elder brothers at the school baths when they go too far.",Let the Right One In
125,dfle3,A strange and compelling coming of age story...with a twist,8,22 April 2009,"""Let the right one in"" is the story of a tortured soul called ""Oskar"" (played by the alabaster skinned Kåre Hedebrant). Oskar is a 12 year boy, white as a sheet, blonde and androgynous looking. The opening scene sets up some expectations for his character. One problem that faces Oskar is seemingly as insoluble as his Rubik's cube...a gang of fellow students who torment him.Soon, Oskar has new neighbours...a man, and his daughter, who is sort of the same age as Oskar. One of the endearing elements of this movie is the relationship between Oskar and this girl, Eli (played by Lina Leandersson). It is this relationship which brings another dimension to this charming, yet horrifying movie. Eli is a mysterious girl...a dirty, pretty thing. Perhaps if Oskar and Eli pool their resources, she can twist and turn a solution for Oskar's problem? Watching the sensual dance between these two is absolutely charming.Now, although this movie has a very large Euroopean charm to it, it is a bone fide horror movie. So, be warned-along with its charming elements are some conceptually disturbing scenes (in fact, the scene that disturbed me the most was in fact very subtle). This movie does not always stay subtle, though. There is blood and gore. It's definitely a movie for teenagers and adults who are older than the principle characters.For fans of this genre of story, I think there is plenty to appreciate. There are some novel aspects, it seems to me, to certain folklore common to this genre. Another genre film which also brings something novel to its own genre is ""Dracula 2000"". That novelty was, it must be said, its most interesting element. ""Let the right one in"" transcends its novelty and totally enchants.Fulfilling strange desires for both the audience and the lead characters, ""Let the right one in"" is sensual, tender, disturbing, bloody, horrific, yet beautiful...all at once.The ending is quite intriguing too...one can't help but draw parallels between Oskar's relationship with Eli, and Eli's relationship with her father.A terrific film. 85/100. Do not wait for the English language version the US is in the process of making. The cinematography in this movie is great, and the subtitles allow us to hear the charming voices of the characters. I feel no need to sully my memory of this movie by seeing a needless US remake. Highly recommended.",Let the Right One In

128,skay_baltimore,Really makes you wonder what's going on in Sweden,7,1 December 2011,"First, let me state from the outset that I am not a fan of the current vampire genre. I think it's been milked to death and exploited at every corner. So I wasn't looking for a typical vampire/horror film when I watched LTROI. Also, I had not read the book before watching it, so I had no preconceived notions going in, nor did I have any background material -- which, in the case of this movie, seems to be critical because almost all the defenses of this movie come from people bringing evidence for this or that from the book (i.e. Eli is or isn't a girl, Eli is or isn't really old, etc.) I found the basic premise of this movie to be a double-edged sword: using CHILD actors to portray the admittedly complex and arguably amoral human/vampire relationship conundrum. As such, it attempted to introduce a certain element of innocence. But therein lies the rub -- this movie has very heavy pedophile shadings, from the clear pedophile Hakan, Eli's ""helper"", to the somewhat murky shadings of a 220 year old castrated male/female vampire posing in the body of a 12 year old, sleeping with a 12 year old vulnerable human boy. Additionally, the very notion of romanticizing killing humans to feed a vampire's need for blood is highly questionable at best, especially when you're using 12 year old's to deliver that message.So if that sort of thing is your cup of tea, go for it. But given the popularity rage for the book and the film in Sweden, it really makes me wonder just what's going on in that country. There is definitely an agenda going on with this movie, so viewer beware.As far as the acting goes, I preferred the acting in this film to the acting in the remake -- Let Me In, although Let Me In did seem to close some of the plot holes opened in LTROI. I found the pace of the film to be metered, with some definite suspense that was the result of decent film making, not sloppy film making that simply hides its flaws under the flag of ""purposeful ambiguity"". But make no mistake...this movie has some significant flaws. Without having read the book, certain aspects simply don't add up or make much sense. Even worse is the warped logic I've seen in the comments section regarding what actually WAS shown in the movie itself. For example, there's a brief cut to Eli's pubic region (it was a mannequin, BTW) in which a scar is visible, purportedly to ""prove"" that she was actually a castrated male. However, the scar is nowhere NEAR where any castration could have taken place, but to some delusional individuals, it's their ""proof"". You decide for yourself.Somewhat ironically, after reading the comments section on this board and seeing all the ""You've GOT to read the book in order to be able to fully appreciate the movie"" comments, I decided to go ahead and read the book. I do not agree with those suggesting that reading the book enhances an appreciation for the movie. I actually liked the movie LESS after having read the book. The book is much clearer than the movie, and as such, the movie then paled by comparison. Paradoxically, the pedophile agenda is much clearer in the book, making the book more disturbing. Either way -- reading the book or watching the movie -- if you get a feeling that something just doesn't ""feel right"", there's a reason for that, if you're a sane human being.",Let the Right One In
129,jeroduptown,Vamp Drama,6,2 November 2021,Let the right one In is more than your normal vampire movie and really centers around bullying and loneliness more than anything. The english-dubbed version is horrible - but the plot stands out.,Let the Right One In
130,supertom-3,Utter brilliance!,10,12 October 2009,"Since Nosferatu first reared his ugly head in 1922, Vampires have made innumerable appearances on celluloid. We've seen an evolution in the films from the early silent movies, through to Hammer, to the MTV/punk stylings of The Lost Boys. There's also been the Vampire ass-kickers of late with Blade and Underworld. It's a monster with a mythology, that can transcend genre, and tone. Be it intense horror, action, or spoof. As a whole though, Vampire films don't often strike an almost all encompassing positive chord with critics. Whilst in truth, the Vampire films of recent times have been growing stale, lifeless, and unimaginative.With Let The Right One In, director Tomas Alfredson, gave the ailing Vamps a few gallons of free-range man blood, and breathed new life into Count D. The film stands head and shoulders above almost an entire sub-genre. Let The Right One In is a work of sheer brilliance. Both in concept and delivery. This Swedish film breezes in with subtlety and depth, to completely overshadow the somewhat shallow, and marketing comes first, Hollywood flicks, such as Twilight.The story centres on a young Swedish boy, Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) who's scrawny physique, woeful haircut, and nerdy intelligence, paint a bully's bullseye across his back. He lives in an apartment block with his mother, who of course seems blissfully unaware of anything that's happening with Oskar. Into the apartment next door, moves a young girl Eli (Lina Leandersson, who looks like a young Amy Winehouse, but with slightly better night time habits) and her father. Eli is different, and behaves strangely, which fascinates young Oskar, who himself is an outsider. Both find in the other a kindred spirit. Eli as it transpires happens to be a Vampire. Writer John Ajvide Lindqvist has crafted a beautiful tale of adolescent infatuation, whilst simultaneously keeping up plenty of Vampire mythology too.The film is beautifully shot. Between Alfredson and his cinematographer, Hoyte Van Hoytemer (yesthat is his name), every frame is wonderfully precise. The setting of a stark and cold Sweden in 1982, comes to life. The lighting is evocative, while the framing gorgeous, from every camera move, to focus pull. Such thought, attention to detail, care and love has gone into the film, where-by an American equivalent to this film would be heavy handed and crude in comparison, like a Gorilla decorating a cake.The cast are all excellent. Scenes are beautifully played out. There's no back minded worry about getting to a ""point"" quickly in case audience attention wanes. It allows the actors to dictate the pace of a scene, instead of relying too much on editing to bring the emotion. The young actors especially though impress. Hedebrant and Leandersson have to carry the movie on their shoulders for most of the running time. It's a big ask for young thesps, but these two pull it off with aplomb.Overall Let The Right One In is a remarkable film. It's touching, haunting, and beautiful. There are gruesome moments of sheer brilliance and power. They don't rely on cheap editing tricks, or scares. But every time someone dies in this film, Alfredson times it and shoots it, almost pitch perfect, and often without resorting to the most obvious way to show it. You'll have to see for yourself, but I can tell you, I'll always flinch opening blinds from now on, and I'll approach swimming pools with trepidation. *****",Let the Right One In

It's obvious that this film is being released in the U.S. to try & attract the same crowd that is currently packing the cinemas for 'Twilight' (i.e. the giggly 12-year old girls who haven't gotten away from the cookie cutter mindset). 'Let The Right One In',is a savvy new film from Sweden that focuses on a lonely 12 year old boy,who is being bullied in the middle school that he attends. The lack of friends doesn't help matters either. He meets a mysterious young girl who has moved in next door with her strange Father,who is obviously up to no good at night. When he discovers that she is a Vampire,the friendship gets downright weird. Random murders happen,people are attacked by cats,and other strange things (I won't ruin it for you by detailing exactly what). Passed with an 'R' rating by the MPAA, this film serves up some bloody violence (mostly off screen,as graphic violence is banned in Sweden---remember, this is the same country that outright banned 'Star Wars' in 1977 for it's (so called) ""Romantic"" depiction of violence),language & brief nudity,which probably means that some cinemas that opt to screen this film will probably discourage anybody under 17,unless they bring a parent/older sibling/etc.",Let the Right One In

It's certainly not the first coming-of-age vampire movie, but I've never seen another with this film's sense of generic balance - the lurid through line of the horror plot exists in utter harmony with the kitchen-sink and high school bullying stuff. While there is a tremendous amount of tenderness and feeling in the characters' interaction, it's success isn't measured by how much we 'care about the characters'. On the contrary, the emotional content is swimming in a sea of distance - there is NO imputation of good/evil here, just humans (and otherwise) dealing haltingly with the brutal contradictions of their circumstances. The chilly, low-key Scandinavian setting is perfectly disorienting, as is the pervasive deadpan humour - such as Eli's stumblebum Renfield, an old fella whose mysterious motives/backstory take a back seat to his unfailing and ultimately suicidal incompetence. It's so measured, so calm in its forward motion, that its Big Moments are even more startling - the horror is continuous with the everyday. But that doesn't mean that it can be controlled or understood - it's just there, and I think that's why this movie elicits such strong reactions from so many.

137,gpeevers,Interesting Take on a Vampire Story,7,1 April 2019,"Swedish take on a Vampire story that seemingly expands somewhat on a character somewhat similar to Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) from 'Interview with a Vampire'.Oscar is a 12 year old victim of bullies who fantasizes somewhat about his revenge while Eli is his new neighbor who moves in mysteriously over night, doesn't attend school and exhibits some decidedly strange behavior.While this could be considered a horror film and there are certainly some horrific elements, it's probably more accurately described as a story about friendship and possibly love. Other themes which are addressed as they relate to the central story are survival and what someone might be willing to do to survive, and revenge.As I have suggested there are obviously some horror elements here but that is not what the film is about, both the gore and the psychological horror are nothing compared to the recent excesses of the new torture sub-genre.This is also a Swedish/European film, it does not have a frenetic pace in fact much of the time it is a very quiet movie set during a Swedish winter which moves almost languidly. The depiction of the Swedish winter is very evocative and similar in some ways to a snowy Canadian winter.For the most part the film focuses on the children; the adults while present don't seem to connect with the children and seem to prefer to not see what they don't want to see.The Swedish novel upon from which the film was adapted by its author, was somewhat more involved and included themes which were either dropped for the film or only just alluded to.The American re-make by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) is titled 'Let Me In'.

Alfredson and his scenarist John Ajvide Lindqvist (who wrote the novel on which the film is based) set the story of the relationship between a bullied twelve year old boy and a vampire appearing as a girl about the same age in a dreary suburb of Stockholm in the early eighties (an inexplicable and needless touch). It's a Swedish winter, which means there are ample white-on-white compositions, punctuated by elements of red (it's a vampire film, after all) and everything plods along to the predictable, if shocking, conclusion, made all the more disturbing by the characters involved. It's a completely despondent work, with ineffectual adults and children doomed to grow into them, regardless of the chance they're given to flee, and it might be completely dismissed if it weren't for the sophisticated bursts of gore that punch through the miasma at well-timed intervals.",Let the Right One In

I kid, of course, this film is gorgeous and expertly shot, and my god is it refreshing to see some actually good child performances. It's just so sad that the director went on to make Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy , and his career was seemingly blossoming for a while...and then he got stuck with The Snowman.
Ouch.
However, for as amazingly acted and written as the relationship between our two leads is, I can't help but really not care about any of the side characters, and it certainly seems as if you're meant to when they start getting chugged like the first drink of the night when the clubs reopen. Also, while I definitely would never call the story badly told, it does feel a little...safe to me. Just from knowing the concept I was able to predict a fairly sizable chunk of what would happen...and I'm honestly not sure if that's just because this inspired a lot of other vampire movies that are now copying its shtick, or if it's just because I saw Thirst at the beginning of this year, which is in some ways quite similar.

Immediately when they tape the windows shut with cardboard and dad goes out at night knocking out boys to drain their blood into a bottle we know that Eli is not an ordinary child but rather a vampire that sleeps at day and only comes out at night and like she tells Oskar has been 12 years old for a very long time. From here on the relationship between the two deepens while some cracks appear between Eli and her ""dad"" who fails at providing her with blood. When Elis Dad dies after trying to find a victim for Eli she is left on her own and soon the small town finds dead people in the snow. The story how Eli became what she is now is not through flashbacks but rather through a woman that is bitten by her and survives, turning into a vampire herself. The classic vampire movie elements were used in a very unique way, especially the title-giving invitation to come in. The use of special effects in this movie is brilliant ... like when the cats turn against a vampire when sensing it or the short and rough final scene when Oskar is dunked under water. Basically the story deals with the old sad story of the curse of immortality and how everything withers around the vampire except for himself. But the way this is placed in a children's environment and how Eli approaches Oskar is special. In the end the viewer is left to judge on his own... is this a heartbreaking love story, is Eli using Oskar or is it both as a natural way that life demands of their fate? When thedramatic piano music fades on you are sure thinking about this and inthat way the movie is great, subtle and different. The acting especially of the 2 lead children is great and the casting for Eli is beyond perfect because she has something hypnotic in her eyes that captures a lot of her character by the first time she appears on screen. I guess this is a movie not to be missed, no matter if you like vampire movies or not... this should appeal to anyone in a way.",Let the Right One In
147,paudie,Chilling - Slow Paced - Excellent,8,15 February 2010,"This film crosses many genres. It is a vampire movie, it is about adolescence, and the longing for friendship.Set in suburban Stockholm in the 80's we meet Oscar, an unhappy child, bullied at school and living with his mother after his parents have separated. Eli, a young girl, and an older man move into a vacant apartment in Oscar's building. We see that they are an unusual pair as the older man's ""job"" is to murder people to supply her with blood. Oscar senses there is something unusual about the new arrival that looks the same age as him but has little else in common. Eli too seems curious about her new neighbour and his life. They become friends. From there the film subtly shows the Eli's effect on the life of Oscar, and the people living in the area.The story moves slowly but this is a good thing as the viewer has time to think about the events they are being shown, some of which are pretty horrific. The film does not judge the actions of the main characters. An amazing scene near the end of the film will probably have the viewer wishing that they too were friendly with a vampire!Young actors Kare Hedebrant and Lena Leandersson are brilliant in the main roles. All the scenes are beautifully filmed in the bleak snow covered suburb or drab apartment buildings, giving them an eerie atmosphere. The screenplay is written by John Ajvide Lindqvist from his own novel. This film was widely and correctly listed as one of the best films of 2009.",Let the Right One In

He's bullied in school, she's a vampire.Visually very appealing, giving the Swedish winter the greatest and most true imprint on celluloid that I have ever seen, but at the same time it's fair to say the film is flawed as far as tempo and plot is concerned. The actors are OK, but not much more. The CGI is quite horrid, and personally I would have recommended the crew to have used dolls instead.At first I was quite taken by the film, but having dissected it a bit, it's not all that.

149,RockPortReview,SCREW TWILIGHT!! See this instead!,10,19 November 2009,"We begin with Oskar, a twelve year old boy living with his mother in a suburb of Stockholm. His parents are divorced and Oskar usually keeps to himself. He is constantly bullied by a group of kids at school and dreams of revenge. He collects newspaper clippings of murders, and violent crimes, while also carrying a knife with him. Although he never acts on these violent urges, it simmers just below the surface. Oskar's interests are peaked with the arrival of new tenants that move into to an adjoining apartment. Eli is a girl that looks to be about Oskar's age, while Haken is the older man that accompanies her. Oskar and Eli meet outside at a jungle gym a few nights, both seem interested in one another, but their conversations are short. Eli is always bare foot and underdressed for the weather but is never cold. Haken on the other hand packs up a case of curious objects and goes into the woods. After this scene we begin to see what Hakan does for Eli, he kills people and drains there blood for her consumption. Haken has to abandon his kill at the risk of being found out by some hikers and a very inquisitive dog. Eli is not pleased by this and must take matters into her own hands.There is also a secondary storyline that involves a group of locals who are also interested in the new comers. They try talking to Haken in the local café, but he just brushes them off. Later that night as one of the drunken men walks under a bridge; Eli is able to get his attention by pleading for help. She then feeds on him and Haken discards the body. The real heart and soul of this movie is in the relationship between Eli and Oskar. You have to keep in mind throughout the movie that these are really twelve year old kids. Oskar is aware that Eli is different and doesn't seem bothered by it. It only strengthens his curiosity. This really comes into play after Eli can't stomach some candy Oskar gives her. As he hugs her she tells him ""If I wasn't a girl would you still like me?"" Although he is not sure what she means, he doesn't make a big deal of it. After another bully attack leaves Oskar with a bandage on his face; he shares his problem with Eli. She tells him to ""hit back, hard."" Oskar does such a thing at an ice skating pond, during a school field trip. Oskar is punished, but has renewed self confidence.We go back to Haken as he has a teen boy hung upside down in the school locker room. He is interrupted yet again by the boy's friends. Haken does not want to be found out so he pours acid onto his face scaring him almost beyond recognition. Eli scales the hospital walls (in her Spider-Man scene) to Haken's room. Feeling that he has failed her, he lets Eli feed on him before jumping to his death. It seems as if Eli has found a new protector and provider in Oskar, but is he really willing and able to do the job? I felt some of the scenes between Oskar and Eli where way above their age, although Eli was in reality over 200 years old. After Haken's death she visits Oskar at his window and he invites her in. She then undress (off camera) and gets into bed with him. Oskar is surprised that she is so cold. There are no sexual implications with this scene, but it shows Eli's growing trust and overall need for Oskar. In a further scene in the school basement Oskar makes an effort to become closer to Eli. He purposely cuts his hand in the old ""blood brothers"" routine. At the site of his blood Eli loses control and ends up licking the blood off the floor. Extremely embarrassed she asks him to leave. Eli then comes to Oskar's place and lets him know ""You have do invite me in"" Oskar is defiant and asks ""What if I don't?"" Eli takes a few steps inside and begins to bleed all over. Oskar freaks out and ""invites her in."" The following scene is one of the more head scratching scenes of the movie. As Eli cleans her self up in the bathroom, Oskar hands her some fresh clothes and takes a peak while she's charging and it's revealed that Eli is neither male nor female.As the locals start to suspect Eli in the death of their friend, one of the men breaks into her apartment and finds her asleep in the bathtub. Oskar comes over at just the right time and shouts ""No"". This gives Eli the time she needs to pounce on the would be assassin. She tells Oskar that she has to leave town. In the mean time the bully from school has recruited his even more ruthless brother to get back at Oskar. In one of the films final scenes at the schools swimming pool; Oskar is told to either hold your breathe for three minutes or lose an eye. The brother grabs Oskar by the hair and holds him underwater. Oskar starts to loose his breathe and panic. There is an intense commotion up above and a severed head fall to the bottom of the pool. Oskar is released as the arm holding him also starts to fall to the bottom. Oskar jumps to the surface to see Eli has rescued him. Thus completing Eli's full need and devotion to Oskar. The final scene finds Oskar alone on a train with a large box, with Eli inside. Oskar has become the new Haken.",Let the Right One In

She's not perfect: she'll sleep with him but no sex. Plus she rips people's heads off to get to their blood. No big deal - everybody's weird at 12.Set in a soulless quasi-Soviet suburb decorated with ominous lumps of ice, LET THE RIGHT ONE IN has metaphors galore, political as well as literary. There's a cold-war proxy joke about middlemen who have to get blood for the vampire, a childish creature who can't stop killing but can't quite survive on her own, either. Another CCCP satellite allusion: the monster triggers her own self-destruct mechanism when she enters sovereign territory unbidden. Then there's the more obvious Stevenson reference, with the meek blond introvert as Jekyll and the spooky dark bloodsucker as his Hyde. And who's the real beast here, the little girl who can't help herself or the bullies who do it because they can? Plus the obligatory European adolescence-as-beauty-and-terror B-plot.I'm not complaining. This movie is scary, engaging, compelling and occasionally surprising. The leads are well cast, the big-eyed girl especially good in a challenging role. Director Tomas Alfredson and writer John Ajvide Lindqvist keep me interested by penciling a world in black and white and painting two characters in luminous color, lovely little people I really like.

As a child I always fancied having a creature all feared by many as my friend, be it a lion for example, here we got a vampire. Oscar is brilliant, and so is Ela. The director really did find the perfect kids for the part, and 1980s snowy cold and frosty Sweden makes the perfect backdrop. One could say that this film dwells a lot on bullying. I can't help recalling that kid playing Floyd as a child in Alan Parker's The Wall in those scenes were he fancies the children taking over the school. I love a film like this where we are not even sure if Ela even truly exists. Is it all the kid's fantasy? I ask that since we are witnessing a world were the adults don't seem to be paying enough attention. The final swimming pool scene left me truly awestruck.",Let the Right One In
153,JaydoDre,Original and charming,8,3 January 2015,"I question the author's understanding of bullies. Without spoiling too much, this movie is built in a way that shows a misunderstanding, either because the writer was bullied as a kid and learned nothing from it or because the writer was not bullied and learned about bullies from some other movie.Other than that, the film is quite good but it is important not to go into it expecting a run-of-the-mill horror movie.This film deals in subtlety. Arguably, it may not even be a horror movie in the modern sense of the word. Modern horror movies try to gross you out, create strong tension and throw jump scares at you. There are no jump scares here. The macabre content is well distributed over the length of the film and when the gore comes, which does not happen often, the movie does not shove it in your face like so many horror movies do. The content comes naturally and casually.This style has to do with the fact that this movie is more of a drama in a horror coating rather than a horror film. It is about the relationship between the main characters, and that relationship is very touching and believable. The level at which the two young actors operate is quite impressive for their age.Rather than ""scary"", a much better word for this film would be ""creepy"". There are various sexual undertones; the casualness and calmness with which the violence is introduced is in itself unsettling; the psychopathic signs in the character of the protagonist are disturbing. You get your share of delicate psychological content.The movie is a fairly slow burn and camera shots tend to hang for a while centered on people's faces with a narrow depth of field, up close and personal. When special effects are used, they are of mixed quality. There are a few really fake looking CGI cats in this film. Thankfully the effects are not overused.This film feels like a fresh take on a vampire story. It lacks the Hollywood's over-saturated pomp and feels far more natural with the focus being on the relationships. It has psychological depth and comes off as both creepy and charming.",Let the Right One In
154,ozjeppe,"Read the book of one true horror masterpiece, please! This seems to have the chapter-skip button stuck...",5,6 March 2010,"Truly original story of childhood alienation and good-old Gothic horror: It's Stockholm suburbia in the early 1980s; 12-year old loner (and school bully victim) Oskar meets new neighboring (and VERY unusual) girl Eli, whose presence and impact on him, more and more points to the fact that she's a vampire Oh boy, this is the problem of watching a movie after having read the novel - which is a masterpiece of modern horror - that you love so much because of its richness, complexity, depth and suspense and finding it butchered to the extent that it feels like the chapter-skip button on the DVD remote is stuck. The fact that it's scripted by its author, makes the mystery even greater, since there's no reason why a 2 1/2-hour version wouldn't work. The look (and effect quality) is absolutely spot-on, with the stark winter landscape of Stockholm trash suburbia... but it's the content and its proceedings that will leave the fans of the novel desperately and frustratingly wanting. And why? Major characters are stumped and muffled and therefore devoid of much-needed empathy. At least three indispensable story threads (Eli's background, Håkan's resurrection, the basement finale) are haplessly chopped out, which will most likely leave the ones NOT having read the book, guessing 'til the cows come home. Yes, I know most good movies should show and not tell... but it almost NEVER gets into any of its characters, their action motivations... and the suspense enough to make that massive emotional and horrific impact of the book. It cries for more dialog, or at least a voice-over! Why it remains not bad, is simply because the basic set-up story and setting is so unique plus its visual quality.I don't often shout this out, but: Read the book, please! This adaptation is passable, but does sadly not do it justice by a long shot.5 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",Let the Right One In
155,krzysiektom,I loved it,10,8 February 2010,"I was very positively surprised by it, to the point of admiring this film in the end. It started a bit sloppy and I thought - after about 5 mins - what the heck, but then it all started coming together. I love that it is such an interesting take on the horror genre, intelligent and profound, it feels not like a horror film at all. More like a drama or a serious film about childhood. Why I think the script is very intelligent and even profound is because there is so much more to the story than just a ""vampire"" element. It tells about the horrors of growing up, when your family splits up, when u have little in common with your parents, when u are picked at by a few thugs at the school. It happens to many children, they suffer humiliation from other pupils on a daily basis, sometimes with true cruelty involved. The film also talks about more important and general topics: what it means to be good and bad; that many of us have both the good and the bad in them at the same time; how the capacity for violence is within human beings, something we are born with; how people deal with pain, suffering and survival in various ways: Eli and her relative (father, brother, former lover??) chose to kill others for her to survive while the poor woman bitten by Eli chooses to kill herself before it's too late, in an act of true heroism. The film also picks on various facets of heroism and love, as the mentioned older man - Eli's companion, destroys his own face with an acid in order to prevent identifying him and protect Eli. Then he allows her to drink his blood in a final act of devotion and love. And the film (yes, the same little film, only 90 minutes) tells us how there are various facets of violence: the violence committed by the vampire is very different from the violence inflicted by the group of sadistic kids, hers is the animalistic drive for survival, the evolution at work if u will, theirs is pure sadism. I loved the scene at the swimming pool, the behavior and participation of the four attackers varied and represented the society. I have read that the Haneke's latest ""White ribbon"" film shows how in a German village before Hitler people were quite capable of evil, thus sowing the seeds for what was to come. It reminded me of this scene: at least two of the attackers do not want it really to happen, have serious doubts, but do nothing, the quiet, passive participants, because of the fear. Isn't it how the world and society functions where it can?? The film truly screws with our feelings too, it makes u root for the little vampire and the boy who helped her kill an innocent man. I rooted for the two as well, and was glad they made it. At least for now, it seems that what expects the young fellow is the bitter fate of the old man.",Let the Right One In
156,Johan_Wondering_on_Waves,And I even don't like vampire movies,9,5 March 2015,"Movies about Nosferatu, Dracula, Queen of the Damned, none of these legendary vampires could actually fascinate me. And after seeing the first of the Twilight movies I was pretty convinced vampire movies must be mostly aimed at a young and prominently female audience, so not for me. And than I saw this wonderful movie about a 12 year old boy named Oskar who is bullied at school. Everything changes when he befriends the mysterious girl living next door, Eli. The chemistry between both is amazing. Their relationship becomes pretty disturbing once Oskar realizes that Eli isn't actually a little girl, yet I couldn't help rooting for them to remain together. It's based on a book which I haven't read so a few things might remain unclear but none of those actually take anything away from how the whole story enfolds. OK, the ending might be pretty unrealistic but to me very satisfying and after all this is a fictional story with supernatural horror elements. I have also seen the American remake ""Let me in"" which I first thought was equal to this one but re-watching the Swedish original I change my mind. Let the Right one in is the better movie in every way and really didn't need to have a remake. Chloë Grace Moretz was lovely but Lina Leandersson really rocks. Finally a vampire story I like.

157,johnny-08,European cinematography at its best,9,25 November 2008,"It's very hard to describe what I feel about this movie but I'm going to try. I've never read the book nor I've ever heard of it's writer:John Ajvide Lindqvist. I read that this is his first book and after watching this movie I must read it. I'm guessing the book is good and I can certainly say that the movie is brilliant. One of the best European and world movies of 2008. (at least an Oscar nominee for 'Best foreign film'...) Plot is about 12-year old boy Oscar, who is very fragile and weak individual. He is bullied by his classmates and he takes all that quietly, without fighting back. Beside that his parents are separated and he lives with his mother. Oscar visits his father who obviously has drinking problems and the absence of father figure and friend makes Oscar so fragile and unable to stand for himself. Finally Oscar finds friend in his new neighbor, Eli. Eli is same age like Oscar with only one problem. She is a vampire...In all other cases this would be a life drama but here one of the main characters is vampire so we've got a touch of supernatural (if you aren't fan of vampires don't let this plot alienate you from this movie). While Oscar parents are separated, Eli has a father who would do anything for her. What Eli needs is blood, to survive, so her dad kills people. But he is not a killer and he just couldn't go on killing people so he tries to kill himself with acid and later on, there is a great scene in the hospital where Eli's dad says goodbye to his daughter and then sacrifices himself for her. He really loved his daughter and he did all he could. The opposite is Oscar father, but I talked about that before. The relationship between Oscar and Eli is elaborated to perfection. They're both kids and maybe we cannot use word love but then again the actions they make shows us what love is all about. They need each other to survive and like it's said in the movie;they are the same. The ending shows what two kids feel for each other and it makes us think what will their future be like. I feel that from the beginning to end, somewhere on the way, Eli & Oscar have grown up and now they'll try to manage on their own (just my opinion).All scenes are carefully directed so everything looks perfect, with minimum of computer staff, which makes it even better. Director Tomas Alfredson uses different angles, slow movements of the camera so the scenes like the hospital one or at the swimming pool are memorable and they will stick with you long after watching this movie. The actors are amazing. I mean we're talking about two kids, who never acted before and here they shine. Both Kåre Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson are great but really there is no one bad in the entire acting crew.My opinion is that movies like this one, ""El laberinto del fauno"", ""Oldboy"" or any other non American masterpieces shouldn't be remade by the Americans just because someone is to lazy to read the subtitles. Please Hollywood, don't ruin something that you cannot do better. For all lovers of serious movies (cause this is much, much more then vampire tale), specially European ones, watch this Swedish movie. And if you do not see the brilliance of this movie then go back to your ""Transformers"" or whatever brainless fun you like. Cause this, and movies like this, can inspire someone to become director, actor or something that includes movies. Highly recommended!!!",Let the Right One In
158,vailsy,Magnificent,9,31 January 2011,"Perhaps due to the marketing for the film, I really was not expecting Let The Right One In to be quite as good as it was. I was blown away by itMuch more than a vampire/horror film, it touches on growing up, isolation, bullying, love and loss. The way in which all these threads are woven into the storyline is very impressive and the performances especially from the two central characters is unbelievably good*spoiler - I love how you get a sense that the young boy will become the next old man to look after her, perhaps destined to suffer the same macabre fate as the last oneLet the Right One In is a true piece of art, and I was especially impressed by the sound design.

161,lagriff05,Let this into your life.,10,25 January 2009,"Let the Right One In is definitely something you should be seeing right about now. Yes, it is a vampire movie, but it is different from what you'd expect. For one, it doesn't suck! (Yay!) And for another, it actually blends the vampirism tastefully in with a story that is both heartwarming and chilling, mixing reality and fantasy masterfully. In this regard, it is very comparable to Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth, and its quiet, subtle nature reminds me a little of the great No Country for Old Men, too, and those are high compliments, but Let the Right One In is not really much like those movies, otherwise. I think at heart this is a movie about friendship, about coming into one's own self and about interacting with others. The protagonist, Oskar, is a quiet kid who gets bullied a lot, and he just sort of takes it, and it leaves something to be said when he learns that his young lady friend, Eli, is not really what he thought she was, and is able to accept her freely and without much conflict. It sends a good message, that does: we should be able to accept peoples' differences and let things fall by the wayside in the interest of love.However, it is a bit harder still when young Eli is prone to savagely attacking people in the midst of the cold, windy nights and drinking their blood, but as she says, ""Try to be me for a while."" She can't help it at all, and she is clearly at war with herself over the moral dilemmas involved here. She has been alive for longer than she looks like, but that doesn't make her any less of a twelve year old, full of all the emotions and the struggling of adolescence, conflicted between her feelings for Oskar and the fact that she is already being noticed by people who are not too happy about her bloodthirsty leanings. That's another thing I love about this movie; the way it contrasts between the normal life of Oskar and the dark, supernatural, hungry and lonely one of Eli, and the way it intertwines them every now and then. Both stories are entertaining and compelling, drawing you in with ease and keeping you there until the film is over.There are no long stretches of dialogue in this movie, and pretty much all of the strength of the scenes here come from the scarcity of it. The characters speak in a short and succinct manner, and the writers kept the lines minimal. Some movies like Thank You For Smoking absolutely shine with great dialogue, filling up the movie with enough of it to where it is completely driven by words, but Let the Right One In is pretty much the antithesis of all that. No, this movie is right on the mark when it's got our two lead characters sharing a few words and letting the scene speak for itself. More movies need to do that. Let the Right One In's biggest strength is the way it executes every scene like the director's life was at stake, never doing anything that isn't absolutely perfect and having every scene aim for maximum impact. The result is a tremendous movie that says little and yet hits harder than a metric ton of bricks at the same time.Like towards the end when the man comes to Eli's apartment home to try and kill her (much like Van Helsing and his friends did at Castle Dracula in Bram Stoker's book), and is subsequently sabotaged by Oskar, and then bloodily murdered by Eli. Eli wraps her arms around Oskar, they share a few moments of silence, and Eli says she's going away. They share a kiss, and the scene ends. It's short, simple, and unbelievably moving and powerful, with the contrast between the delicate, tender romance and the shockingly red blood on the walls and on Eli's mouth being bizarre, but also genius. Or how about the sequence of scenes where Eli's guardian fails yet again to get blood for her, and ends up hiding from the police and disfiguring himself to prevent capture. When she comes to see him later on, knowing he has given up, she takes his blood, and he falls to the ground. There is so little explanation to this, and yet it's just so good. It's hard to explain why, but as he lies broken and battered, his face mangled beyond belief, in the snow, there is something ethereally powerful about it.When the ending comes around, not a word is spoken as heads begin to roll and the gory dismemberment is matched with the pristine silence yet again for that the film got so right for its entirety, you will either be a convert or you will be nothing. Okay, that is a bit harsh, as this is a heavily layered and textured movie that I still think I need to watch again to fully get, but still, this is one of the best of '08, right up there with any of the cinematic titans that got dropped on us, and if you're willing to let this right one in, you will never leave a film more satisfied.",Let the Right One In

165,larry-411,"Brilliantly original work of art, both horrifying and tender",10,13 May 2008,"""Let the Right One In"" is, at its heart, a sweet coming-of-age story which is so unique and different that it simply defies categorization. In this Swedish film, adapted from John Ajvide Lindqvist's bestselling book, director Tomas Alfredson dares to mix pleasure and pain in a way that is both horrifying and tender.""Let the Right One In"" has a storyline which, although it reveals some secrets early on, is best left as a surprise. So this will necessarily be one of those rare reviews in which the less said about the plot the better. 12-year-olds Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) and Eli (Lina Leandersson) meet one snowy afternoon at a jungle gym in the courtyard of Oskar's housing complex outside Stockholm. Their young, tender attraction for each other is apparent right from the start and we think we know where their relationship is headed. But there is a deep dark secret to be discovered here and when it's revealed the audience is both repulsed and curiously fascinated at the same time, in a similar fashion as when yellow crime scene tape brings us closer rather than warning us away.The supporting cast is completely beholden to the narrative as it revolves around the adorable young couple, whose performances rival the best I've ever seen for actors of that age. The innocence and vulnerability of Hedebrant's Oskar is simply a tour-de-force and he admirably carries the film on his little shoulders. Leandersson matches him scene by scene, line by line, and the result literally gave me chills.Production values are stellar, with all technical aspects -- lighting, original music by Johan Soderqvist, and Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography -- combining in perfect synchronization to produce a Hitchockian tale that somehow brings love and light into what could have been the darkest drama imaginable.""Let the Right One In"" was the overwhelming choice for Best Narrative Feature after its North American Premiere here at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival. It is a truly well-deserved honor. Tomas Alfredson has crafted a brilliant work of art that left me shaking my head with wonder.",Let the Right One In
166,kevin_crighton,"One of the most haunting, emotional, disturbing, touching horror movies ever.",10,13 April 2009,"Oscar is a 12 year old boy, being bullied at school. He appears to have no friends. He takes out his frustration by stabbing trees with a knife. Then one day he meets Eli, who has moved in next door. As Oscar and Eli become friends, he discovers the truth. Eli is a vampire....This movie is truly astonishing. While it does fall into the horror genre, there is much more going on here. It's as much a story of loneliness and friendship, and also a coming of age tale.John Ajvide Lindqvist, has made changes to the story in adapting his novel for the big screen. He concentrates on the friendship/relationship that grows between Eli and Oscar. As a result, several plot strands and characters are either reduced or removed. In a way, this is good, As the key to the story is Oscar and Eli. Here we have two lonely people, being brought together through circumstance. And each gets something from the other. Oscar learns to fight back against his tormentors, and Eli gets something too: a friend.Director Tomas Alfedson, does a brilliant job with the material. While the film is bloody in parts, it is never overly so. A lot of the violence happens just off screen, or the camera is held a little away, and just lets the scene play out without lingering on the violence and bloodshed when it happens. He also stages, in a stunning scene the answer to one of the most curious questions in vampire mythology : What happens if you don't invite a vampire in.... and they come in anyway...? The setting deserves credit too. This is not set in a small town, or a place with a Gothic setting. Instead, it is set in a early 1980's suburb of a large city. It's a mundane setting, perfectly normal and is used well as a background for the events being played out.Despite the horror elements to the story, there is a real emotional core here. You really care for these characters, and in a way you hope for the best for them. There is also a haunting quality running through out. Eli, yes is a vampire. But you can get a feel for the loneliness being a vampire has. And Oscar, finds someone to talk with, who simply likes being with him. A true friend. It's things like this that give the movie a truly emotional center. And yet even when there is a revelation made regarding Eli, it doesn't unbalance the relationship/friendship between them. It deserves credit for allowing them to accept each other for who they are. In this, the movie is helped by two brilliant performances from Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson as Oscar and Eli. Let The Right One In, as a vampire movie is right up there with the very best of them. But it isn't just one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. It's also one of the best movies I have ever seen.",Let the Right One In
167,grnhair2001,Two lonely souls meet,6,4 October 2016,"Terribly lonely if unsympathetic boy meets equally lonely ""girl"" and develops a crush that makes his isolation recede. She is neither girl nor human, but he is so lonely, he can overlook both failings.The bullying is so cliché and Oskar is so weak in the face of it that I had a hard time rooting for him both in the book and the movie. The movie underplays the pedophilia angle – spoiler for the book: the vampire's first assistant is a pedophile who masturbates while looking at the naked vamp, which is what ties him to her/him. The scene is not played it here. The drunk father also is a clichéd way to invoke sympathy. The endlessly running nose, explained in the book, isn't explained here and just looks a little weird. In both the book and the movie you get the sense that the author is trying to say something about gender fluidity, but for the life of me I can't figure out what that message is. The movie is slow, but I enjoyed the young actor who played the vampire, and I thought the violence was well done. I've never been to Sweden, but I would like to one day go to see if everybody is as depressive as they are in the movies and novels of that land. Surely not.In the end, as awful as the future will be for the victims of this pair, you can't help but be relieved that out of the well of loneliness and despair, they found each other.",Let the Right One In
168,pontifikator,I have no idea where they find kids that are as good actors as these.,8,9 December 2010,"This is a movie about 12 year olds, but it's definitely for adults. Oskar (played by Kare Hedebrant) is a puny 12 year old boy who's being bullied by another boy named Conny, who has a posse with him. Oskar fantasizes about stabbing Conny and making him squeal. Like a pig.It's all a fantasy, though, as Oskar knows all too well.But then a man and girl move into the apartment next door. Things get weird. The girl, it seems, is a vampire, and people in Oskar's home town turn up dead in strange places. The girl, Eli (played by Lina Leandersson), appears to be 12, too, but she doesn't go to school, and Oskar sees her only when he's out playing at night. They become acquaintances, then friends in spite of Eli's reluctance. She encourages him to fight back against Conny and his stooges, and one day Oskar does. The thrust of the film is not about Oskar's bullies but about his relationship with Eli. Oskar is only 12, and he has no clue. He asks her to go steady, but he admits that doesn't really change anything between them - it's just what older kids do. In the depths of the movie, what is really going on is a relationship that is doomed to failure. We've all seen them; some have been through them. Oskar is a normal 12 year old doofus, and Eli has been 12 for hundreds of years, and she kills people so she can live. It's ""Lost in Translation"" with a wicked twist.The director captured the awkwardness and lack of self-consciousness of kids at that age well, and the actors playing the teachers have the worn look of people used to dealing with kids whose minds wander at the drop of a hat. The atmosphere is that of a small town where people know each other and mostly care. Everyone is trusted until the murders start. Oskar's parents are separated, and Oskar's torn between them and hungry for his father's love and attention. It's very well done.His infatuation with Eli develops normally, as she's the only one who pays attention to him. Leandersson was well-cast; she's odd-looking and unkempt in the film. Eli has her own worn look, but it's not from dealing with kids. We get a look at how bad it is being a vampire; it's worse than those other horror movies make it out to be. The man she lives with is her lackey, and he tires of his life before the movie ends. For some reason Eli chooses not to use Oskar as her food, and they become friends although she's told him they can't be friends. I'm sure she's been through that before.Now there are twists and turns that I'm not going to reveal, but we have a movie about kids on the cusp of growing up, not a vampire horror movie. It's a fascinating movie about the relationship between two kids, but we adults can see a world unknown to little Oskar. Directed by Tomas Alfredson.(Regarding the title, legend has it a vampire can't enter your home without an invitation. So you must sure when you invite people to your home that you let the right ones in.)",Let the Right One In
169,joestank15,good story with horror touches,8,11 December 2008,"Let the Right One In  12 year old Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant) has divorced parents, abusive school bullies, unsatisfied revenge issues and no friends. One day a 12 year old (more or less) girl named Eli (Lina Leandersson) moves in next door. They quickly become friends even as Eli's bloodlust wreaks havoc on the quiet community.Oskar is a good protagonist. We follow him on his quest for love, acceptance and a spine. And it's difficult not to like Eli even as she commits atrocities. She has such pathos and really seems to like Oskar. I've read reviews describing Eli's vampire behavior as ""cat-like"" but ""dog"" or possibly ""wolf-like"" seems more accurate. She is quite vicious and it occurred to me how much the qualities of rabies and vampirism are similar. Both involve lack of pain, feral behavior and strong aversion to sunlight and water.The usage of the old ""the less you show, the scarier it is"" rule is appreciated. Clever camera angles and Pov shots conceal sinister goings on to make what is shown all the more fantastical. I liked the neat twists on old vampire rules involving sunlight and invitation into people's houses. Also the understated (minus at the end of the film) violence was actually much more jarring because it was not out and out spectacle. Kills are not given huge sound effects nor are blows to the head.It's not a straight out horror film for those expecting huge body counts, jump scares and all of that crap. It is quite plainly, a coming of age story with vampires and romantic tones. Let the Right One In does lag occasionally but it's a good film all around, a good horror film and the best vampire film in years. Now will people stop watching Twilight and go see this instead?

Not the scariest--that would be the original Nosferatu, It's the craft with which this film is made that makes it so good. The effects are simple, but sensational. And the director employs a Hitchcockian point of view that even murder has to be approached in a practical, workaday manner. Dragging a body to hide it. Hard work.There is also a lot of black humor, and it's used to heighten the tension. The poodle in the park, for example. You had to laugh. As in Hitchcock films, you became anxious for the murderer, not the victim. And was that the best cat-attack scene ever? Yes, it was. And not just because I can't offhand remember any others....Why haven't I given this more stars? It's a tad too long. The film is beautifully atmospheric, but some small parts of the film seem to be there for just that reason. Not all of it was necessary. And the bullying seems a bit clichéd. A masochistic side of Oskar is shown as he interacts with the bullies that didn't quite ring true for me. Perhaps this other dimension is more fully developed in the novel; I haven't read it.Nevertheless, this is a must-see for anyone who loves good cinema.",Let the Right One In
172,ThreeGuysOneMovie,One of the more amazing films I have seen recently,9,3 June 2012,"So I finally got around to watching this film. Let the Right One In has been sitting in my Netflix streaming queue for about nine months. Being a bit of a wuss when it comes to horror films, I had perpetually skipped over viewing it, and watched many other inferior films instead. Looking back, this was a terrible error on my part, as this was one of the most enjoyable films I have seen in years. Perhaps we should start a whole new category on the site for films that I am late to the game on. Granted it has subtitles, its supposedly a horror film and its stars are both 12 year-olds. Put all the supposed negatives aside, make some popcorn, grab your beverage of choice, turn the lights down start-up this film and prepare to thoroughly entertained.It's the early 1980′s in a suburb of Stockholm called Blackenberg. Oskar (Hedebrant), is a sensitive 12 year-old who is being mercilessly bullied by a few of his classmates. They wait for him after school to inflect their daily torment. Unfortunately, for Oskar the bullying more often than not takes on a physical nature. Oskar's home life if an insular one, he lives alone with his mother, his parents are divorced, and his father lives out-of-town. Getting closer and closer to the breaking point, we see Oskar practicing stabbing his tormentors with a knife against a tree. It would appear that this sad, lonely, and tormented boy, is about to seek revenge against his tormentors.while practicing with his knife out in his apartment complex's snow-covered park, Oskar is surprised by his new neighbor 12 year-old Eli. Eli (Leandersson) and her father (?) have just moved into the apartment building. As chance would have it they have moved into the apartment next to Oskar. While initially a bit standoffish Eli soon begins to warm up a bit to Oskar. We get to see the budding adolescent friendship between two lonely outcasts, as they become closer and closer. It is fairly obvious that Oskar is smitten with his new neighbor.As Eli and Oskar continue to meet nightly in the apartment complex park, they become fast friends and perhaps infatuated with each other. Noticing a wound on Oskar's face Eli learns of Oskar's daily tormentors. She urges Oskar to defend himself and to strike back with great anger and furious vengeance at his bullying classmates. A class skating trip, provides a opportunity for Oskar to finally stand up for himself. At the same time that he stands up to the bully's a corpse is found in water. It would seem that some sort of serial killer is becoming active in Blackeberg.Alfredson (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) sets the mood for this tale, with the use of a haunting snow-covered suburban setting. His use of colors and shadows are reminiscent of the work of Kubrick, particularly from the Shinning. While there is some gory violence in the film, this is not simply a horror movie. Let The Right One In is much closer to an adolescent love story, than a hack and slash vampire film. The amount of character development they managed to squeeze into less than two hours is pretty amazing. similarly, the tension in the film continues to slowly ramp up, to an edge of the seat climax, that is both horrible and wonderful at the same time.This is certainly not a film for young children as the level of violence and the subject matter, will be sure to cause sleepless nights and nightmares. More mature adolescents, and pretty much everyone else will be able to handle the subject matter. This is a horror movie for those who usually don't care for horror movies. The romance and subtle slightly creepy sexuality in the film, more than makes up for the lack of violence typical in vampire films. Let the Right One In is everything that the Twilight series is not, and that is perhaps the greatest compliment an adolescent vampire film can receive.This was one of the more amazing films I have seen in quite a while. Once again you will end up impressed with and gain more appreciation for the Nordic cinema movement. If you're looking for a vampire romance movie that will have you on the edge of your seat and cheering on the protagonists despite that fact that one of them is the undead then I highly suggest watching this film at your earliest convenience.

173,quinnox-1,Pretentious and ridiculous,1,13 April 2009,"I had to warn others who could be taken in by all these glowing reviews. This is a shockingly over-rated and silly movie. It seems any movie featuring vampires has a built in fan base that will say its a great movie no matter how crappy it truly is. Just stick a vampire in your movie and it will be rated a 10 on IMDb! The two child leads are super boring and non charismatic, you would think they could at the very least find two attractive kids to play the roles but no. So for two hours you are watching these bad actors and their being directed in a pretentious manner as if this movie is somehow supposed to be taken seriously with sombre music and mood.The plot is the girl is a vampire and is unusually dull, she meets a boy who is just as dull as she is and they form a friendship. Then at the end she kills all the bullies that were tormenting the kid and he is happy and becomes her caretaker and leaves on a train for a new life as an Igor-like servant to her. That's it! And people think this is a good movie!? Maybe if you are 12 years old and have never seen a horror movie before.And this movie is rated in the top 250 films here. Just absurd! IMDb is getting less relevant all the time when movies of this low standard are put in the top.",Let the Right One In

Because after you are done watching it the haunting images and plot make you think about it afterwards. In a nutshell its a memorable flick. Even though this is a film about children it is definitely a film for adults.It has a good drama story too it, it delivers on the drama as well. One aspect that I found VERY disturbing and to be quite honest, distasteful and disgusting was the underage nudity. I mean isn't that supposed to be illegal? It should be. Shame on the director for doing this, and shame on the movie regulators for allowing this to be distributed as such.If we take that one part out it makes for a nice film though, too bad it has to ruin what is otherwise a great flick.",Let the Right One In
175,frankenbenz,Swedish Whale...of a movie,9,3 January 2009,"http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/2008 was a busy year for blood suckers and within this booming sub-genre was the syrupy emo of Twilight, the overwrought small-screen melodrama of True Blood and a film from Sweden that blew everything else away.Tomas Alfredson's Let the Right One In is something few vampire movies are: an art film with a bite. Atmospheric, contemplative, and relatively serene, LTROI is, in many ways, the anti- thesis of typical vampire films. Utilizing long takes and wide shots, Alfredson exercises restraint by allowing much of the action to play out in real time within each carefully composed frame. When random outbursts of violence occur, they are come as a shock, starkly contrasting LTROI's predominant calm. Alfredson alternates between wide shots and tight close ups, emphasizing both the interior and exterior world's inhabited by the film's lonely and sympathetic protagonist, a young boy named Oskar (Kare Hedebrant).Grade schooler Oskar is pale, frail and awkward. He has no friends, is bullied daily and, for the most part, ignored by his divorced parents. Oskar is a sensitive boy, who lives in an interior world, where much of his time is occupied by violent fantasies he plays out using his equally unimpressive hunting knife. Oskar's inability to fit in is what attracts his new neighbor Eli (Lina Leandersson), for she too is a social misfit...a blood sucking freak inhabiting the body of a twelve year old girl.Eli and Oskar develop an unlikely, but touching friendship fueled by the void in each of their lives. Eli's secret hinges on her servant/master relationship with an aging and pathetic man she lives with, her care giver who murderously maintains her debilitating hunger for blood. Once her servant is no longer able to serve her, Oskar becomes an even more prominent figure in her life. Eli's diminutive size, sallow complexion and large, puppy dog eyes, make her the ideal wolf in sheep's clothes, and her innocent naiveté is as spellbinding for viewers as it is for Oskar. Eli fills the void in Oskar's life, which not only gives him the strength he needs to stand up for himself, it gives him a sense of purpose.LTROI isn't the first vampire movie to use fangs as a metaphor for alienation, but Anderson's film is unique in the ways it represents this theme. One part coming-of-age, one part love story, and one part horror film, the sum of these parts manages to recharge the well-worn vampire genre. Most striking of all is Eli, who is one of the silver screen's most complex, disturbing and unconventional vampires. Because she's a twelve year old girl, her seduction of Oskar is taboo and uncomfortable to watch, yet, at the same time it's sincere and heartfelt. This contradictory duality, ironically, creates an incredibly human vampire, one we are both sympathetic to and terribly frightened of.Enjoy the freshness of this film while it lasts since the upcoming new year promises the foul stench of an American remake.",Let the Right One In
176,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,"For mature, not necessarily teen audiences",9,29 August 2013,"This is a lovely film with beautiful cinematography and something to be enjoyed from various audio/visual perspectives. I thought the orchestral background music, right from the off, was wonderful, as well as the fabulous camera work, filming inside a school building with four or five windows, watching a night train pass from left to right, gradually passing across each window, one by one... that sort of subtlety and build up throughout the film making it so enjoyable.It's not an action-packed film, so forget it if you're after gore and fast kicks.If you don't like foreign language films or subtitles, again, stay away. Watch 'Let Me In', the US remake.I guess the true impact of how good this film really is only hit me after watching the English language remake. Although the remake is still pretty decent, it missed all the subtleties that made this film so much better. I appreciated the gradual transformation of the girl from being intermittently discolouored, grimy and rather smelly, to becoming a more wholesome, attractive little girl after a feast on blood, instead of focusing on yellow eyes and scissor teeth when the vampire thing really ramped up.I also relished the fabulous tension between the characters, especially the main protagonists, which was somewhat vacant in the US version. The relationship between Eli and her father is also much more tender in this film. Father understands the difficulties of supporting such a bizarre creature but still does so to the best of his abilities, whereas the US counterpart swears and yells ""F*ck this sh*t"" due to his frustrations, also getting shouted at by his vampire daughter as though he's an inept inconvenience.The film entranced me and made me feel very pleased with myself for making the effort to watch the foreign language version first, before the US remake, but also a little disappointed with myself for being duped into thinking the US version would be even better - it isn't.The ice-cold, slow moving tension and beauty of this film is what it's all about.

177,fablesofthereconstru-1,My bloody bodyguard,9,8 March 2009,"For Oskar(Kare Hedebrandt), there's solace in the night, a few fleeting hours before bedtime in which the boy can retaliate against his schoolmates. Under a black sky, Oskar pretends; each and every night, in front of his apartment complex, he pretends to kill. No one is harmed, this time. The stabbing victim is just a tree. The snow remains white. Bleeding is for the breathing, after all. Prompted by constant antagonizing, Oskar has all the makings of a school assassin. But since the setting for ""Lat den ratte komma in"" is Sweden, where guns are harder to come by, the boy carries out his revenge fantasies with a knife. On this particular night, as Oskar mutilates the tree, his new neighbor, a girl, watches the discombobulated boy from atop a jungle gym. No stranger to misgivings herself, Eli(Lina Leandersson) senses a kindred spirit in Oskar, and likewise, the boy apprehends that they have much more than chronological age in common. An affliction, loneliness, rules her days and nights, too. Against Eli's protestations, the two become fast friends, nocturnal friends, over the course of several nights while the other tenants lie fast asleep. Needless to say, Eli is a vampire; she lives with an old man who kills for the eternal girl, by amalgamating the techniques one would find in a slaughterhouse, and in the woods. With cold calculation, he strings up his human livestock and slits their throats, collecting blood in a jar as if the tap was emitting maple syrup. After her caretaker dies, the vampire faces a moral dilemma: Does she go it alone, or indoctrinate Oskar into her way of life? In the film's pivotal scene, a nude Eli, newly emancipated after the mercy killing of her handler, is summoned from outside Oskar's window, then joins the roused boy from his slumber, with the expressed interest of stealing his humanity in the supercharged bed. As Eli bides her time, Oskar disarms the vampire with his naivety, suggesting that they go steady. She calls the seduction off, remaining on her side of the bed. For the time being, Eli keeps her identity a secret.It's this same naivety of Oskar's which forces Eli to reveal herself, when the vampire greedily licks blood off the floor, in a blood-brother ritual gone awry. The boy, in a sense, lets Eli off the hook; she now owns the moral imperative to embroil Oskar in her bloodsucking escapades, since it was he who led her into temptation. ""Lat den ratte komma in"" does a brilliant job of reconfiguring those old and musty vampire tropes(and even the hip and edgy ones: i.e. David Slade's ""30 Days of Night"") to befit the context of its contemporary Scandinavian setting; in particular, the bathtub as an urbane update for the Gothic standard issue coffin. In another example, an infected old woman on the verge, asks a nurse to open the shade in her hospital room, precipitating death by sunlight, in which the self-immolating flames connote a remonstrance against motherhood. The dark romanticism usually associated with vampirism gets lost in the translation, as even Eli is sick of being eternal; she tells Oskar, ""Please be me for a little while."" But he can't. In spite of his ostracization from any brotherly or coed fraternities, the boy's bloodlust had already been satiated on an ice skating excursion, when he struck his tormentor across the ear with a stick. In the bathroom(read: the vampire's inner sanctum without the usual goth trappings), an intruder(if this was Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"", he'd be the hero) goes after Eli, but the knife Oskar holds never leaves his side, as he's unable to perform the vampire's bidding. The inevitable massacre, suggested at the outset of ""Lat den ratte komma in""(through the boy's scrapbook of newspaper clippings detailing grisly crimes, and the aforementioned rehearsal with the tree), comes to fruition in the final scene, which plays like a macabre version of Tony Bill's ""My Bodyguard"". The carnage left behind at the indoor pool works as a psychical projection of Oskar's fantasy life, a grisly impulse he never acts on(thanks in due part to the anti-gun laws: refer to Michael Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"") As the two fugitives flee the scene by train, the viewer knows it's just a matter of time before Oskar has to go against his nature and repay the favor.",Let the Right One In

A ludicrously simple story that could have been told just as effectively as a 20 minute (or less) short film. It really is incredibly drawn out, only being interested in about 3 ideas for the whole duration. Everything that people have cited as a reason for its greatness, I think was actually covered very poorly and has been dealt with far more effectively in other films. The fact that the girl is a vampire is being cited as a reason for why this film is incredible and special, but I just don't understand that. I couldn't care less.The relationship portrayed is actually very unrealistic, and in many ways irresponsible. The boy is encouraged to attack one of the bullies. Eventually a gross act of violence is committed against some bullies. I found this yet again another Hollywood-esquire superficial treatment of bullying, which could have been a much more interesting angle to the film. It doesn't allow us to understand anyone's side, it is stripped of humanity.In summary, this is very weak cinema. Using a feature runtime to explore a couple of very weak ideas is poor work. So much could have been done with this story. If you haven't seen it yet, I would say don't be overly confident based on the reviews. You might be very disappointed.",Let the Right One In

The movie shows vampires not as bloodthirsty killers eating for their pleasure, it shows survival, and the vampire seems more human. The movie is really well done, it is dark, has some great effects and theme. Really good vampire movie definitely recommend.",Let the Right One In
183,Hawkensian,Not as affecting as I was led to believe.,7,28 June 2014,"I don't like vampires; I've found the genre's latest surge in popularity most boring. Indeed, I don't particularly like fantasy generally, I've never been that interested in the much lauded Lord of the Rings trilogy, Game of Thrones or the scores of others. However I do like fantastical narratives when they're grounded in reality, like the superb Pan's Labyrinth.Let the Right One In, which I have been comparing to Pan's Labyrinth, is grounded in reality too. It is set in 1980s Blackeburg, an achromatic, modernist mess in suburban Stockholm. However, unlike Pan's, this Swedish horror is bereft of the characters, the imagination and the pathos that made Guillermo Del Toro's film such a great piece of fantasy.The film focuses on Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant), another archetypal bully victim who's too sensitive to stick up for himself. I love seeing a bit of playground retribution, and there is a great moment of it in Let the Right One In, but Oskar is a stock character who is generally quite unremarkable and hollow.This proverbial loner soon meets the mysterious Eli (Lina Leandersson), who unfortunately is even more laconic. Although Leandersson isn't given much dramatic range, she has a good physicality for the role with her long, dishevelled hair and her big, brown, bleeding eyes.One of the main problems is that there just isn't much chemistry between them, not much depth. Yes, the principal characters are 11-year-olds, I know from personal experience that children aren't as likely to discuss in detail things that really matter, but seldom if at all do Eli and Oskar have an interaction that is above vacant gawping and muttering.It is a film about two outcasts coming together, it should be moving, I was expecting something of a vampiric Leaving Las Vegas, but it's difficult to empathise or in fact care at all when one character is a murderer and the other is a laconic child who forever fails to wipe his runny nose (which is rather repellent in full 1080p). Some of the supporting characters were also flat, especially bullies Conny and his older brother, who are excessively and unrealistically cruel.This all may seem harsh, I don't think it is a bad film, but the endless praise and the 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes had given me high expectations and they were not met.Through cinematography, décor, costume design and plenty of Scandinavian pathetic fallacy, the film achieves a pervasive and at times oppressive ambiance of melancholia. There are also some very well-orchestrated set pieces, particularly the film's penultimate scene in Oskar's school swimming pool; it is initially ambiguous, proceeding to shift mood and wind tension and suspense excellently. The sound is also sharp and really booms in some instances, adding to several of the film's jumpier moments.Although I liked its ambiance, realist elements and several grisly scares, Let the Right One In fails to justify its reputation as it doesn't sufficiently explore its characters, the central relationship is quite vapid and the narrative is marred by several instances of Eli's gratuitous violence and an implausible conclusion.68%www.hawkensian.com",Let the Right One In
184,CountVladDracula,Pick the Right One,10,28 October 2011,"The following is an explanation as to why I prefer Let The Right one In to Let me In. Many people think it's pretentiousness to prefer the Foreign film to the domestically made one but really, it's not. It simply was a bad a film.1. I don't like the CGI. I see no point in adding blood with CGI. It looks awful.2. I do not like the implication that the boy is to be the next henchman (or whatever term you want to use). It goes against the original novel and the original theme of rare and true unconditional love without sex. The purist and most innocent love through darkness. That was at the heart of the original story and what made it so endearing. Also to claim Eli had known her/ his henchman since that henchman was a boy is wrong. He's too bungling and incompetent. He clearly is not experienced at killing and disposing of the body so how could he have been doing this his entire adult life? That version of the character in the remake does not make sense.3. The setting of the remake felt wrong. I like atmosphere and I like the unearthly quality of vampires and you lose some of that without the bare footed child in a t-shirt walking in snow and you can't see her breath but you see everyone else's.4. Making it clear that Eli was really a boy was important because it was the result of that mutilation that Eli was anti-social, avoided human society, was clearly awkward and shunned society with it's gender roles. Eli did not trust the outside world because of his secrets and because of what he suffered and some of that was lost. It takes away from the child vampire's tragedy. And the solidification of the fact that their love was NOT sexual but something far deeper. I think it's kind of depressing that we Americans can accept monsters but we can't accept that the child vampire was really a boy? The fact that being a blood thirsty monster seems ""more acceptable"" to the audience than the idea of the child being a boy says something is really wrong with our society right now.5. I feel the Swedish actress was simply a better actor in general. The girl who played Abby is now in Dark Shadows and I've been watching interviews with her and she's spacy and acts... well, kind of high...6. I just tend to prefer films that follow the original source material better.7. This was the first good vampire film since Twilight. And by ""since Twilight"" I do NOT mean that Twilight is good, but rather the first good vampire film since the whole annoying fad started!8. The remake disappointed me for another reason as I expect more atmosphere from the recently revived Hammer company and they let me down.9. I don't like finding out that the reason the title was changed was ""The original title is too long for Americans."" (real reasoning). That offends me. Especially when the original title was based on an English language song by Morrisey and the song definitely suits the movie. And the follow up short story is named for the next line of the song, Let the Old Dreams Die.The interpret it that OsKar / Owen (what's the point of changing the name? We have Oscars here in the US) is the next henchman hurts the film and the entire theme of the movie that love, actual unconditional affection, without need of sex, can bloom in the strangest of situations. That was at the heart of the story. For the boy and for the monster. And if you deliberately strip that out for the sake of your ""interpretation"" the entire message and meaning of the movie is lost just to appease contemporary and cruel cynicism. It's wrong to completely twist the very heart and meaning of the story to appeal a cold, modern interpretation based on the disturbing fact that people today have become too cynical to accept the notion that love can bloom anywhere at ny time with anyone. The heart of the story was that Oskar could love despite the fact that Eli was a monster and not really female and that Eli would love to a degree of fierce protectiveness she/he never gave to the henchman. To dismiss this and turn the film into something colder and shallow. And to be honest the mindset that does this... disgusts me.The writer of the original story said what it's about and wrote a follow up story to prove the way it's supposed to be seen. He says that Eli eventually makes Oskar a vampire after they finish the blood pact when they get off the train. To act as if he's wrong about the outcome of his own characters is like telling a child they are wrong about their own imaginary friend. That it's not a pink rabbit but rather a green bear.Watch the original, skip Let me In.",Let the Right One In
185,imdb-19548,Weird and weirdly funny.,8,20 April 2009,"This is an interesting film. It's a vampire film that isn't a horror; there are some very funny moments but it isn't really a comedy either and although there are many coming-of-age moments it is far from a simple children's tale.The acting is very good especially from the two leads. Leandersson in particular delivers a convincing performance as a creepy but likable ""girl"", Hedebrant as a bullied child is also quite believable.The humour is very dark but very well delivered with most of it coming from Ragnar's character's incompetence.The film doesn't rely on special effects so the one CGI scene comes as a surprise and is extremely unusual and memorable.There is very little gore or direct violence here, we don't see the real brutal killings just the after effects of them which is far more effective and does leave the door open for some gallows humour.A dark, funny and smart film.",Let the Right One In
186,Billy_Crash,Much Needed New Blood for the Vampire Genre,10,15 March 2009,"If you like different takes on the vampire mythos and typically mundane story lines, then this is the movie for you.Director Tomas Alfredson really creates a thrilling, atmospheric movie without being artsy and cute. Better still, young actors Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson were brilliant. And with all the great sets and excellent acting was John Ajvide Lindqvist's wonderful screenplay based on his novel. (Just avoid the ""English dubbing""  the Swedish is beautiful and the subtitles don't get in the way due to minimal yet poignant dialogue.)Some of my favorite vampire movies are the ones that leave the same old vamp story behind, like Larry Fessenden's ""Habit"" and Abel Ferrara's ""The Addiction"". Not only does ""Let the Right One In"" go beyond the vampire mold, it crushes it with a riveting storyline and execution.Needless to say, this is definitely one the best horrors I've seen in a long, long time.",Let the Right One In
187,Michael Kenmore,The antithesis of Twilight - a genuine movie that abides by the rules of vampire lore,7,29 March 2009,"On surface, ""Let the Right One In"" is a perplexing and bizarre film. It's about a lonely and bullied young boy who meets a neighboring girl who happens to be something else. The relationship begins to develop and the end result is a strange homage to vampire lore on the impossibility of love.I admire the fact that, unlike Twilight, Let the Right One In strictly abides by the rules on vampire behavior rather than twist and discard the rules to tell a different story.However, I found the film glacial in pacing, especially the first half hour. After that mark, it begins to pick up. After the slow introduction, the story becomes engrossing that makes you care about the characters.The emotions become profound towards the ending with the horrific and surreal scene. The shock value is genuine without unnecessary exploitation and the aftermath in the ending made it doubly touching which is extremely unusual for a purported horror film.Whereas dozens of Twilight rental DVD on the multiple shelf rack is empty on the weekend of the first week release at video shops, Let the Right One In DVD rental copies are left unrented until I picked it up. The alternative film is not perfect by any means -- glacial pacing may be irritating and disturbing scenes of grisly murders and blood-splattered gore a turn-off for sensitive viewers -- but the astounding emotional quality of the story along with the faithful rendition of the ancient vampire legend makes it a worthwhile viewing, to be seen only once to appreciate the story in spite of realistic violence.Let the Right One In must be seen to be absorbed in the love story between the pre-adolescents, to feel the surrealistically haunting effect when the movie comes to the conclusion after the particularly shocking scene. It's a perfect story material Terrence Malick would have directed if he were to make a horror movie.A good movie overall, despite the slow pacing, uncomfortable scenes of murder and gore and subliminal but uneasy pedophilia theme.*** of 4",Let the Right One In

I have to say that it deserves every little bit of praise it gets because it is simply a phenomenal movie. The story is beautifully written and really draws you into the movie. Even though it's a horror movie, the story is a violent yet beautiful and emotional one and there aren't many movies that has a story like that and there's not a lot that do it so well. The characters were fantastic as you really cared for Oskar and Eli and what happened to them. The acting was brilliant, I think that Kåre Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson were both fantastic as their characters and they really brought out the emotions from their characters. The writing was simply fantastic as the script and the storytelling was great and the timing was near perfect for each scene. The direction is great and really captures the human emotions and relationships and how much we need them.This movie really spoke to me more than I thought it would. It really gave out a nice feeling that nobody is really alone in the world and that there is somebody out there for everyone. This is possibly the best vampire movie I have ever seen. The relationship between Oskar and Eli was beautiful and very intriguing to watch and I thought that Oskar grew emotionally and mentally with Eli, as he became more confident as time went on. Their relationship is the highlight of the movie for me and it really stuck out in my mind about friendship, love and loyalty. I really don't think I can do this movie justice with this review but all I can say is it's just simply beautiful and breathtaking and I urge every movie lover to watch this. Everything about the movie was near to perfection and this has on my list of all-time favourite movies and I could easily watch it again straight after.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",Let the Right One In
190,plex,Refreshing and Unique!,9,16 February 2012,"I have never seen a horror movie like this. Very stark and real with superb character development. Its restrained visceral content is only matched by its perverse elegance. Against the backdrop of a nordic winter, the constant reminder of chill and omnipotent gray take on a phantom character of their own. Nothing about this film ever poses or is self-aware as its oblique frankness and honesty impel the interest throughout the entire film, leading to a contained climax. The connection between the two leads is uncanny, almost a ""Harold and Maude"" type of thing as Eli, who never offers her age, is perhaps a century older than our young Oskar. The only questions I have is this: With her aged wisdom, was she just grooming Oskar all along to take the place of her erstwhile caretaker? After the last killings did she have any other choice as the body count had started to mount in such a small area and she didn't want to see Oskar implicated? I don't pose these questions in any sort of complaint against the story-line, the script is bullet- proof. Equal time was given to Oskar's suffering at the hands of some truly bad bullies. It could be argued that the vampire represented a narcissistic fantasy for Oskar to live vicariously through.I know this isn't the case, but the symbolism is there. This film is a MUST see for any serious movie-lover, regardless of your preference to horror genres. It has staying power beyond viewing.",Let the Right One In
191,JeanMoniette,2 stars for... i'm not sure.,2,11 July 2020,"""Let the right one in"" is slow , and not in a good way - think shots of trees that really overstay their welcome (I counted an average of 8 second per tree). It's also strangely overproduced with some scenes using such a razor think depth of field that it becomes really distracting, especially when all of the b-roll is in sharp focus.That's a shame because otherwise the SFX is really on point (minus a few CGI cats that were more aristocats than well.. real cats). Not that it matters anyway, as the plot can be explained in 2 lines but stretches on for seemingly ever.The main reason I disliked it is how predictable it was. 30 minutes in and it lets the viewer on the ending, and that's not forgivable. Disappointing 'coming of age story with a twist' that never develops into anything meaningful.TLDR: I get it, you own a nice cine lens and you like bokeh, but this does not a film make.",Let the Right One In

194,antoniokowatsch,A Sweet Love Story,9,20 November 2017,"I've seen many movies about vampires and this is easily one of the best ones I've ever seen. Mostly due to its original take on vampirism. I first heard of this movie in another vampire movie called ""The Transfiguration"". The protagonist in that movie was obsessed with vampires and claimed that ""Let the right one in"" is the most ""realistic"" movie about vampires. Well, he was right.At its core it is a love story and a tale of revenge. Despite some of the gore the movie is quite innocent and sweet. It's just really well balanced and the characters are believable.The only thing that I could criticize would be the film score. As other have noted the score seems a little bit too grand at times. It does become quite apparent; a chamber orchestra would've sufficed for a movie of this caliber.

Far from being the best vampire movie ever, it is slightly above average, despite a languid pace.The worst part of the movie, however, is the scene in which Oskar looks in on Elie as she changes clothes. We are then treated to a grotesque full screen image of Elie's crotch, revealing that ""she"" had a penis and testicles crudely removed, leaving only a crooked horizontal crack where the genitals once were!Call me unenlightened, but this was just plain gross and completely unnecessary.

196,wynonasbigbrownbeaver,"If I want to see a teeny bop-per vampire flick, this will be the one.",9,29 January 2009,"This movie is rather enjoyable. The movie starts out very gloomy with an arctic ice freeze to set the mood and the tone for this near perfect vampire movie. 30 Days of Night (though scarier) cannot compete with this well made vampire movie. Neither does the cheesy ""I am Legend"" or trendy teeny bop-per ""Twilight"". One of the main reasons for it's success, is because this movie does not abuse CGI unlike the guilty party of Hollywood likes to do! The special effects are used sparingly but sharply. There is a bit of gruesomeness when applied. One thing I do wish, was to see Eli actually fly in ""Let the Right One In"", though there are other effects that compensate throughout.The tone of this movie is Suspense. This movie has unearthed this long lost trait that most modern vampire movies have lacked in recent memory. (Except for maybe some short-lived intrigue in ""30 days of Night""). Some movies like to use extensive music scores to move the audience, but this film was effective enough without the usual background music scores portrayed in many horror-action-romance films. ""Let the Right One In"" allows you to feed on the movies bouts of silence in certain parts. It enforces you to pay attention to every detail in the movie. Though there is no extensive dialog, (and the fact that not many foreigners can understand Scandinavian), the audience can get a lot out of what isn't being said. I like the dialog because it wasn't influenced by any smart-alack punch lines.The characters are well portrayed. Notably Eli and Oskar, the interaction between them is very intense yet innocent. This plot between them felt complete and the direction and focus on these two kids were very disciplined. Don't let the beginning of this movie fool you. The pace of this movie in the beginning can be a little misleading but the suspense will build and grow on the audience. This one will keep you guessing on what will happen between Oskar and his vampire girlfriend Eli. You will get used to the lack of extravagance of this story around midway through the movie, and what ever you do, Don't Miss The Ending! 9/10, I will watch this again in a heart beat.",Let the Right One In

But I could not resist watching this one because of the rave reviews by many of the esteemed horror fans of this community and some of my friends in college as well . The basic story is about a 11-12 year old school boy Oskar who is basically a very shy guy and harassed by his classmates. With very few friends to fall to, he meets a girl named Eli who incidentally comes to live besides his apartment in this snowy town of Sweden. Eli's actions are mysterious and the person living with her, probably her father provides her fresh blood by killing people on the road. Yes you guessed it right, Eli is a vampire whose hunger for blood makes her kill even her own father. But there is a certain special kind of relation between Oskar and Eli which can be called as innocent cute romantic teenage love. They help each other in difficulties and share a special bond which cannot be expressed in words.The performances of the actors are really engaging. The guy playing the character of Oskar impressed me the most. Just the feel of the movie makes you get involved in it . I have watched very few movies of the horror genre and this one I will surely rank very high. Needless to say this movie is a must watch for horror fans. But people who don't like this genre and have a certain fixed preconceived notion about it, I suggest them to watch this movie and clear their doubtsRating : 8.5/10",Let the Right One In
198,aeo,A movie worthy of 9 out of 10 stars,9,4 November 2008,"It has been awhile since I have seen a movie that moved me. This movie, while a horror story, has a ""human story"" behind it to give it a certain dimension that you do not normally see in a typical horror movie. But, this is not a typical horror movie given that the principal characters are young children. One of the main character is a ""human"" boy named Oscar who is 12 year old. The other main character is a girl named Eli who looks 12 years old physically, but in reality, she is much older. The movie, however, never states her real age.By the way, this is a Swedish movie with English subtitles. I know many people do not like seeing foreign films because they have to read subtitles but please give it a chance. You will not be disappointed.The setting of the story seems to begin sometime in late 1970's or the early 1980's in Stockholm, Sweden. Oscar is an introvert.

This movie is absolute trash. It offers nothing original or exceptional. Acting is horrid. Kid actors are so bad it almost feels like amateurish High School play. There is no conviction in their acting. But the real problem is the plot. There is really nothing in the plot that drives any kind of emotion, whether suspense, drama or sadness. Is this supposed to be a love story? OK, I get it, it is intentionally left to interpretation, wow that is just brilliant. Just write a stupid screenplay that doesn't make any sense and say that it is open to interpretation as if that will qualify it for some sort of artistic achievement.This is a story about a vampire girl (Eli) and a boy (Oskar). There is absolutely nothing special going on here. Oskar is a shy boy who gets bullied by some kids at school. Also, there are some gruesome murders taking place in the town. All of these get connected at the end in the most predictable fashion. Except, there are those instances when the events make no sense whatsoever. SPOILER ALERT ****** It turns out that the serial killer (Hakan) is actually vampire's assistant (wow!). And he kills people to feed her because you know being a vampire is not easy and she cannot always kill people by herself. Apparently she needs Hakan's help but then she kills him later! in the most stupid twist I see in any movie. I guess the writer didn't have any material to surprise the audience and just wrote it up this way. There are a lot of scenes in the movie that are designed to shock the audience but don't make any sense. In one scene, Hakan captures a teen in school and ties him upside down to kill him while his two friends are waiting outside (of course when friends decide to check out on their friend, this creates a suspense but a fake one). It is all so contrived. In another scene, Eli bites a victim who turns into a vampire and later gets attacked by a dozen cats - what's that supposed to be, scary?I think vampire genre is dead. I think they should stop making vampire movies and TV shows. This whole vampire thing is done to death. It feels almost like 5 out of 10 movie has vampires in it. Vampires have become salt and pepper of Hollywood. I can picture bunch of producers sitting at a table somewhere saying ""Let's put a vampire character in this movie, will sell well"". I just can't take it anymore. They destroyed the vampire genre. And this movie is supposedly add something new to the vampire genre but it comes across fake, contrived and poorly executed. Just because you make a vampire out of a 12 year old girl and make her friend with a boy doesn't really add much creativity to the genre, I am sorry.

The director made an OK job while the plot was weak. But the main problem of the movie is using small kids for such a violent topic. As some people pointed out in their comments, in some scenes, it even looks like child porn. I don't think it deserves very bad ratings since the atmosphere was given quite good. But come on, 8.2, that is joke. Just that a movie was produced in Europe does not make it a masterpiece or art. We have to overcome this arrogance.

201,J_Trex,Another Vampire Movie Classic,9,17 November 2008,"The Vampire movie is one of the most overdone in the entertainment industry. Yet this movie seems to have clicked with its audience, and it's not hard to understand why: Eli, the 12 year old vampire is a highly engaging character, with a wisdom that belies her tender age. It's the strength of her role that carries the movie. There isn't much about the young actress (Lina Leandersson) playing her role on IMDb (not even her birthday). My guess is we'll be seeing a lot more from this young lady in the very near future.The movie is Swedish, and the atmosphere is dark & snowy. The protagonist is young boy named Oskar, a 12 year old loner, who lives with his single mother. He inhabits a fantasy world, where he slays the evil doers with his dagger. A new family moves in next door, and little else is known until a serial killer strikes, draining the blood of his victim.Eventually, Oskar meets Eli and they strike up an unlikely friendship. This is basically the plot of the movie. And it works on many different levels.

202,Red_Flag,Let the Right One In,10,19 April 2009,"Anyone wishing for more of a bite out of the 2008 blockbuster Twighlight might want to sink their teeth into Let the Right one In. a thoughtful and provocative movie that tells the story of unrequited love in its most innocent of forms. At its best ""Let the Right One In"" is hauntingly chilling and motivating creating a romance so pure and innocent that it juxtaposes the bleak environment its set it. Granted, it feels very similar to Twighlight, though to be fair the book that this movie was based on - also called let the right one in - was published a year before Twighlight. Anybody ready to condemn this as a mere rip off with be forced to eat their own words as the unadulterated relationship between our protagonists (Oskar and Eli) unfolded smoothly while if you were to rent Twighlight (out on DVD) you would find a clunky, forced and artificial relationship, if you were to ask me which of the two I would spend your money on, Let the Right One In ticks every box.While lacking a couple of years and experience, Kåre Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson, play their characters with strength and determination, its clear on both parts that effort went in to both of them as you watch in awe these screen virgins tackle their very first project with ease and grace, especially Leandersson who on several occasions sent chills down my spine as a twelve year old girl who must feed on human blood to survive. Despite its heart being in the right place, this warm, sweet tale of young love quickly turns into something completely different. A 12-year-old boy befriends a mysterious young girl whose appearance in town suspiciously coincides with a horrifying series of murders in director Tomas Alfredson's adaptation of the book by author John Ajvide Lindqvist, who also wrote the screenplay. Oskar is a young boy who can't seem to shake off the local bullies, but all of that begins to change when a new neighbour moves in next door. After striking up an innocent friendship with his eccentric next-door neighbour, Oskar realizes that she is the vampire responsible for the recent rash of deaths around town. Despite the danger, however, Oskar's friendship with the girl ultimately takes precedence over his fear of her.With the pace at a steady, down tempo speed it's a wonderful opportunity for the audience to take in their surrounding beautifully filmed by the movies cinematography. He/She displays wonderfully the contrast between beauty and austerity as we see blood splatter hauntingly align upon the snow. Beautifully crafted and expertly acted, Let the Right One In eschews the easy options of excessive gore and cheap laughs to create a haunting, emotionally involving journey into the macabre. It can only become a classic of the genre. You're unlikely to find a more affectionate, loving yet equally frightening movie this year. As it stands Let the Right One In is the best movie of 2009 bar none. Just wait until the nerve shredding ending that had my heart in my mouth for the entire 10 minutes.Verdict: Right One is a marvel: an ingenious genre film that manages to terrify and endear in the same instant, deftly erecting one of the most persuasive, haunting film experiences of the year. Where Twighlight failed Let the Right One In soars with impressive cinematography, beautiful acting and an ending that will have your heart racing while at the same time allowing you to shed a tear. Be that a tear of happiness or sorrow I will not tell you, I might just have to let you find out for yourself. You would be a fool not to let this movie in. For my overall rating I give Let the Right One Inan outstanding 5/5",Let the Right One In

The thing that baffles me is the positive response to the film, people say: ""its a lovely tale of friendship"" ""its very dark and mysterious"" ""Its a brilliant film""......rubbish. This film, quite simply, is the most dark, disgusting, twisted, disturbing, sickly, weird, demonic, pathetic, chilling, horrible, abnormal, strange and ghastly film i have EVERR laid my eyes upon (and the list goes on)the actor who played Oskar was annoying and unlikeable. The character of Eli is the most disturbing. A castrated vampire who falls in love with Oskar, and in the end they end up running off together! This is meant to be a romantic film: between a small boy and a castrated vampire...lovely (sarcastic tone) I just find that concept incredibly disturbing (so is ELi a boy or girl? and is it a gay relationship or not?) But that aside i wouldn't say it was scary but more chilling in a dark and horrible way. There is a limit with the dark tone to a film and this exceeds it to the max. You see Oskar underwater with body parts and blood falling into the pool ripped apart by Eli which is just plain sick. I don't understand how people see this as ""sweet"" or ""romantic"" or ""brilliant""...IT'S NOT! I was forced to watch this in Film Studies (i did not watch this out of my own free will) This film is the most immoral and disturbing film i have ever and i will ever see.

Before I knew what was going on, I thought it was a bit slow, but this film is not slow; it's deliberate. It can be enjoyed on different levels. It's a beautiful and sincere love story, and it's also an authentic vampire film not to be taken lightly. He asks her, ""How old are you?"" ""I am twelve,"" she says. ""But I have been twelve for a long time."" He is twelve and alone and being viciously bullied at school. She is a vampire and cries after she kills someone; she tells him to fight back against the bullies. The atmosphere is dark and somber and eerily quiet. The acting is first-rate. I really liked it. This film is a must-see if you like vampire films.",Let the Right One In
206,poc-1,A movie loved by critics - but a bit tedious for me,6,16 April 2009,"I realise by writing a mostly-negative review that it will be voted down. Despite this I have always found that the negative reviews are the most honest and informative. If I want to know about a movie on IMDb I always read the negative reviews.This is exactly the kind of movie that critics love - genre busting, anti-Hollywood, foreign language, low budget. It is all of these things and in truth it is a pretty good effort. But it is a very long way from being the greatest horror movie this century, as the Irish Times movie critic Donald Clarke calls it when he fatuously compares it to The Shining and The Exorcist.Traditionally a vampire has been a villain, lives the glamorous lifestyle of an immortal in a castle. In this movie, the vampire is a child, lives in a crappy flat and has no friends. Set in 1970s Sweden in winter, it is about as bleak as it gets. Oskar, a friendless, bullied child who lives next door meets the vampire and the two of them find that they are kindred spirits. There are two things which recommend this movie, the new take on the vampire genre and the acting of the child vampire. Detracting from it is the movies slow pace. Even the opening credits (plain white text on black) took an age. I hate that, unless you have really fancy credits that are worth watching, just get on with it. Visuals are pretty good though the incessant darkness and cold tends to get dreary after two hours. The child vampire is really excellent and she expresses the right kind of other-worldliness. The main child-protagonist (Oskar) however is very awkward and frankly annoying. He seems to be put in mainly because of his goofy ""children of the corn"" looks, and the camera takes full advantage of this taking rather too many opportunities to show him semi-naked.The other main flaws are a very silly scene involving CGI cats and the climax, which is too contrived and too ""Deus ex machina"" and utterly predictable. The horror/gore aspect does not succeed and the director's efforts at shocking moments are good but for me they do not really shock. The movie is most memorable for its mood in the tender scenes between the two children.",Let the Right One In
207,revere-7,A tender little coming of age story about first love ...and the vampire next door!,10,1 May 2009,"Since the beginning of film history, every decade has one or two really good vampire films that stand out. But the genre seemed to peak in the 1980s and has been on a steep downward slide ever since. The 90s produced only a few, and just when it looked like we were going to get all the way through the 2000s without any really standout candidates... along comes 'Let the Right One In'...Oskar is an introverted school kid, bullied by his classmates, and misunderstood by adults. One night he meets Eli, his next door neighbor who is also a bit of a misfit. Slowly they begin to understand each other on a level that no one else ever has. Alternately through scenes both gentle and horrific, the film lets us know that putting trust in just anyone can be fatal, but when trust is earned... when you let the right one in... your life can change forever.Despite all the media hoopla about last year's blockbuster 'Twilight', the creators of that film could learn a truckload about love, adolescent angst, and vampires from this film. 'Let the Right One In' eschews all the slick polish and prettiness of Hollywood films like 'Twilight' and 'Underworld' in favor of an honest real looking world full of human frailty. In some ways it does for the vampire story what 'Ginger Snaps' did for the werewolf tale.'Let the Right One In' is a great reminder that it's what's on the inside that counts. Especially if what's inside contains the RDA of hemoglobin!Highly recommended.",Let the Right One In
208,bondgirl6781,"Pan's Labrynth Meets Nosferatu...Beautiful, Innocent, and Horrifying",10,4 January 2009,"It is hard to find a good and original horror film let alone in the vampire genre. I had seen the film Twilight and 30 Days of Night, but neither one captured the mystery, Gothic romance, nor the chilling horror of the vampire genre. And tonight I saw Let The Right One In a film that follows all the vampire rules and breaks away from the campy and clichés of casting beautiful people, pumping corn syrup and sex simultaneously. Let The Right One In (a reference to the myth that a vampire cannot enter a mortal's home without being invited) tells the story of Oskar (Kare Hedebrant), a 12 year old boy who is horribly bullied at school and alienated by his divorced parents. One night he meets Eli, a ""12 year old"" girl who moved in next door and forms a strong bonding friendship. They fall in love but not in the way that adults do. Their relationship is childhood love. In between, Eli kills to satisfy her hunger for blood. Let The Right One In is a love story but it isn't perverted or downgraded into cheesy romance novelty. It's a horror film without the serial killer jumping out of the closet. The film is amazingly chilling and terrifying yet the film draws you in because of the love story between Oskar and Eli played beautifully by Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson. The scenes between them are sweet, haunting, and more importantly, innocent. This film was both moving and chillingly scary without having to succumb to the clichés of typical horror films. The film's horror is that it sneaks up on you and yet drawn more and more into Eli's world. She is not an evil character, but she is a creature of habitual survivorship: ""I live on blood"" she tells Oskar. Let the Right One In is the missing answer to the film Twilight and I highly recommend to those who are fan of horror, film, and the vampire genre.",Let the Right One In
209,movedout,Poetically revitalising and sincerely entrancing film,8,13 February 2009,"Tomas Alfredson's cult sensation ""Let the Right One In"" fundamentally boils down to an adolescent love story amidst a torrent of violence, blood and the moody topos of the vampire mythology. It opens on a repressive, wintry suburb in 1980s Sweden and relents, with patient observations, the film's key motif of alienation. As if frozen in time, the shots  as it pulsates to the erratic rhythms of a dream  turn into a piercing look into the lives of the occupants in an apartment complex guarding secrets and hidden desires but it shifts into focus when a bullied boy with a mop of yellow hair and pale skin who yearns for retribution finds a protector through the avenging affection of an undead pubescent girl.Instant attraction belies the idiosyncrasies apparent between the 12 year-old Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) and the scrawny young Eli (an irresistibly eerie Lina Leandersson) who notices him at the playground as he continuously thrusts a knife into a tree, reenacting his quest for revenge against the school tyrant. She's drawn to his blistered emotionality  perhaps his wounded humanity  and he is drawn to the novelty of her awareness of him. They eventually find solace in each other's loneliness. We understand this societal disconnect because Oskar is a product of a broken environment, void of attention and concern while Eli is essentially a predator of instinct and devastation as the director Alfredson feeds this forced isolation into the film's abiding theme of disaffection with a remarkably assured visual mastery of grey and grit that captures the stony and unyielding mood of bleak frustration within each occupant of the apartment complex. But he still manages to punctuate these moments of deep silence and menacing creepiness with an assertive show of force  intense images of terror and shock that rivals the best genre films in their indelibility.Writer John Ajvide Lindqvist condenses his novel into a strictly brutal and raw affair, with a removed sense of amusement attached to a serrated edge  consider how matter-of-factly Eli's ""meals"" are delivered to her or the droll tête-à-têtes between Eli and Oskar. But the real power of the film doesn't derive from the film's traditional horror tropes but of the poignancy wrenched out of the awful depictions of puberty and adolescence. It is, above all else, a gutting interpretation of the coming-of-age that contends with the feelings of bloodlust it augurs in young, artless scapegoats like Oskar and countless of other youths.Eli becomes Oskar's salvation  not just through the promise of protection but one that justifies his existence and inherent self-worth. It begins as a despairing tale of fear and resentment and ends on a note of hope and renewal. And it is in its ending that ""Let the Right One In"" rapidly instigates a quality of genius, as it validates the film's powerful emotional core. It is at once enriching and thematically functional.""Let the Right One In,"" demands not so much an open mind but an open heart. It is a poetically revitalising and sincerely entrancing film that transcends its genre trappings and simply becomes a terrific film capable of profound currents of compassion in its world of frigid callousness.",Let the Right One In

Yai! Idea of school-bullies tasting their own... medicine in long and repeated intervals is great one. Unfortunately, execution is terrible. It is slow-moving, with drab and ugly photography and visuals - people calling this movie beautiful boggles the mind. No gorgeous dream-like atmosphere and symbolism of best vampire films here.

214,iNickR,Nordic Noir in Fine Bloody Form,9,5 November 2017,"I saw this Swedish gem, Låt den rätte komma (or translated: Let the Right One In), in 2008 at the Vancouver International Film Festival. It is exceptional, to say the least, and one of my all time favourite movies. I had a suspicion that Hollywood would make an English version of it, which they did two years later, calling it Let Me In (2010). Thankfully, they didn't mash it up too much.Let the Right One In (this Swedish version) is a very simple story, simply told with simple 'execution'. What won't a father do to help his daughter? It's easy to follow and and get into if you don't speak the language. If you don't like ""reading"" movies, please give it one more chance with this one. If you love movies like I do, you won't regret screening this.Great production design, and great cinematography from Hoyte Van Hoytema. If that name sounds familiar, it may be because you saw the other films he lensed: Interstellar (2014), Her (2013) and The Fighter (2010). All great movies, am I right? Good movies attract a good crew, and vise versa (in my experience).There's a term some scribes and industry-types use for these kinds of movies from these kinds of places. ""Nordic Noir"". That term is very fitting for this film's 'dark' plot. I am not only a fan of the low-budget, indie features but also a fan of foreign films, and in particular Nordic Noir (like me, you may also enjoy the original The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (2011), called (in Swedish) Män som hatar kvinnor (2009).Open your mind to places just as great at making movies as Hollywood!

217,UncleTantra,The Enduring Innocence Of Childhood Love,9,2 January 2009,"Remember the days when there were ""revival theaters,"" and the owners used their knowledge of film and film history to carefully choose appropriate ""double features"" -- two films that somehow ""go together?"" Yesterday was a gray day, so I took advantage of it to catch up on a couple of well-reviewed 2008 films before the awards frenzy starts. I could not have chosen a better ""double feature"" if I had been trying to.Both films have made critics' Ten Best Lists for the year, and both deserve to be on them. The first -- Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" -- has a lot of buzz behind it as having a shot at the Oscar for Best Film. That buzz is correct. The other film -- Tomas Alfredson's ""Let The Right One In"" -- is far more low-key and less ""feel good,"" and doesn't have a ghost of a chance of winning (even though it has now won the top prize in 18 film festivals worldwide). It probably won't even find widespread distribution in theaters in the U.S., because an American remake is already in the works. But in a just universe, it would have a shot at the Best Film Oscar -- it's that good.( Hint: Do NOT see the remake of LTROI. Rent the original film on DVD. The American remake has as much chance of being as good as the original as a copy of a Fabergé egg made by Detroit autoworkers would have of resembling Fabergé's original. It will be like having to sit through a remake of a classic Ingmar Bergmann film made by Baz Luhrman. You would have a better chance of enjoying major dental surgery performed without anesthetic than enjoying what Hollywood is going to do to this masterpiece. ) The two films couldn't be more different on the surface. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is all brilliant color and vibrancy and the razzle-dazzle gaudiness of India at its best and its worst. ""Let The Right One In"" is a Bergmannesque study of silent, snowy Winter nights in Sweden. But the thing that made them a ""double feature"" for me is that both stories revolve around the wonder and innocence of childhood love.In the slums of Mumbai, we watch as young Jamal Malik is first orphaned by uncontrolled religious hatred, and then we watch as he and his brother find ways to survive on their own in the squalor of slums that defy Western imagination. The wonder of his early life is not just that he survives, but that his innocence does as well. Along the way, still very young, Jamal meets and instantly falls in love with equally young, equally innocent Latika. Their magical love story takes a decade or more to work itself out, finally doing so on television, in the Indian version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire."" Half a world away, in the suicidally-depressed suburbs of Stockholm, 12-year-old Oskar fights for a different kind of survival. He's just trying to get through the day without any love from his divorced parents and without being bullied by the other kids in his neighborhood. One night, out in the courtyard of his sterile apartment complex, alone as usual, he meets a girl about his own age, and love begins to develop between the two of them. The only trouble is that Eli isn't really a girl -- she's a vampire.A warning to potential viewers of either of these films who are...uh...sensitive. Even though ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is being billed as the feel-good flick of the year (and is) and LTROI is clearly billed as a vampire flick, *both* films have more than their fair share of blood and violence. Duh. So does life. But at least you can't say I didn't warn you.But both films are transcendent in their beauty, in their craftsmanship, in the brilliance of their young actors, and in their vision of how young love can endure and overcome all obstacles...at least in the movies.Personally, I think that ""Let The Right One In"" is the better film, and that Tomas Alfredson is potentially a greater talent in the world of film than Danny Boyle. Boyle, as good a storyteller as he is, seems to need a lot of colors in his palette, splashed onto the screen big and bright and loud for all to see. Alfredson could paint a masterpiece with only three colors to work with, and did. I watched both films in one day, and ""Let The Right One In"" is the one that haunted my dreams, and that I was still thinking about so strongly this morning that I had to sit down and write this review.",Let the Right One In
218,roondogbb,Best Vampire Film there is.,10,24 May 2021,"I have watched many vampire films, but absolutely none come close to this film in terms of gauging the tragedy of what it means to be a vampire. Ann Rice's Interview With a Vampire, good as that film is, stand behind this film.So why is it good? You may be asking? Because many movies (especially modern movies) fail at good story telling and cinematography with vampire films. Often we get a gore fest and something without much substance beyond that. Yet the concept of vampires are as old as the vampires themselves and they are ingrained in the mythology of many cultures. So they deserve better treatment than a gore fest film.This film (A Swedish film) tells the story of a young vampire called (Eli) and the young boy that she befriends (Oskar). Oksar is a bullied lonely child in his town and gets picked on. And seems to connect with nobody until he connects with Eli. I could go into detail about how this all happens but its honestly more magical to watch some films without having seen the trailer etc. To enjoy every seen as it comes along for the first time. So I'll not give anything away.Also, take note there American remake is absolutely terrible, do not watch that first. It was created for lazy reasons. Such as people not willing to read subtitles. But all the magic was lost and the production took a fall.... Its also important to note that this film is based on a book written by John Ajvide Lindqvist a Swedish Author.. So being a Swedish movie, set in sweden. Is how the original author probably imagined it.So please watch this film if you're a vampire film fan. Its easily a 10/10.

219,pkneer,Interesting Film But Glaring Problems,5,10 October 2015,"This film offered some real promise and I found it to be interesting and at times touching. But I had a hard time with some major story lines that made it hard to take it too seriously. Early on, Eli's provider kills and hangs a man up using ropes and a tree - in very bright lights with people close by. No one would do that, please. Also, people are dying left and right and where are the police? And why don't these survivors notify them, they know who it is, yet they do nothing - not really believable. Probably the more interesting aspect of the film for me was Eli's character. I got the impression she had lived a very long life as a 12 year old with no friends - just survive to kill. Then she meets Oskar who becomes a friend and a first love - something she has never experienced and slowly trusts him enough to let him in, as the title says. I felt a little pity for her, but she was aloof enough to not quite understand. But then you have to wonder, was she doing all of this to lure Oskar to be her next provider and make him think she cares for him? This would make her a pretty cold blooded person, since she thinks nothing of heading down and killing the next unsuspecting victim without so much of a tear. To me, the film was good, but not great and certainly not a masterpiece. It was gloomy and very slow moving and no interesting characters outside of the children.I rate this a 6/10 for a little originality and the use of child actors and their relationship was done fairly well yet not too cheesy. However I found Eli's character to be somewhat shallow.",Let the Right One In
220,Kalle_it,"Unconventional, maybe trying too hard",7,18 March 2010,"Probably the most concise way to review ""Låt den rätte komma in"" is: Scandinavian.Dim, grey-white scenarios, perfectly matching the dark characters and the moody tone of the movie. Slow paced, almost plodding at times. Few, short dialogues and not a whole lot of action.That's the charm of such a movie, but also its downside, depending on your taste.The movie revolves around the odd friendship between a shy and troubled 12-years old boy and a 12-years old vampire ""girl"".Then you can read more than that between the lines, either taking the vampire girl as real, or as a projection of the boy's mind... but in nay case the plot isn't overly complicated or twisty.The young actress is indeed quite impressive and creepy in her role, while the male lead is equally able at conveying the (lack of) character of a subdued boy.In truth the movie is not as awesome as many made it to be, but it's worth a watch if you're into Scandianavian-style, or if you want a different take on vampires. The violence isn't that much, so fans of gore will surely get bored with the movie.All in all a nice unconventional movie, with its obvious shortcomings and a bit of pretentiousness, but enjoyable overall.If you're looking for close-up disembowelments or for cheap drama involving flickering pale teenyboppers, then ""Låt den rätte komma in"" is NOT for you...",Let the Right One In
221,madcardinal,The Rarest of Films: An Authentic Portrayal of Young People As Real and Breathing,9,7 April 2011,"Superb, beautiful and unique, what makes ""Let the Right One In"" so special is its authenticity with regard to what it's like to be human. The way the film portrays the burgeoning emotional intimacy between Oskar and Eli is beautifully nuanced and natural. And the scene where Eli visits Oskar at night and they talk in bed is unrivaled in all of cinema for its aptness; deep, humane decency; and subtle beauty. ""Let The Right One In"" takes its time to develop the relationship between the two kids. In fact, this movie is as much a love story as it is a vampire story. As an American, I am sad to say there is simply no one in Hollywood with enough courage and moral fiber to make a film about a 12 year old this honest and authentic. ""Let the Right One In"" mercifully avoids the shallowness so prevalent in Hollywood movies; you know, all those ridiculous car chases and all that silly gun play just to avoid dealing with human intimacy. As vampire films go, this is the best one I've ever seen; vampire film enthusiasts should be aware, however, that it depicts comparatively little gore and little violence. For viewers in the U.S.A., some may be uncomfortable with such a realistic and forthright portrayal of youth, because American audiences are so used to seeing ""pretend"" kids in films - those exemplary pixies, comical cut-ups or non-physical cardboard cut-outs we're all so familiar with. This Swedish film did not have to worry itself over raising a few cranky American eyebrows or angering some willfully misinformed extremist, and so, it grants Eli and Oskar the very rare dignity of possessing real self-knowledge, real souls, real minds and real bodies.

It's the same with this movie I'm uncomfortable with the age of the kids in the movie. The vampire is neither cute nor attractive its uncomfortable watching her mope around. I'm uncomfortable with the violence that is heaped on to these rapscallion's. I've seen this movie a thousand times before. Part 1. The ghoul picks the odd-ball out of the crowd and seduces him. Part 2. She alienates or kills of his friends. He starts to put one and one together and starts to suspect she's a vampire or whatever that's when the trap is set. Part 3. When they spring the trap and he can't leave. It's like a Zombie movie part one realize they're the walking un-dead. part 2 realize you have to shoot them in the head.

This is the original Swedish film on which the current flop, _Let Me In_, is based (a flop despite the American filmmakers' greedy certainty that anything with vampires in it would be box office gold). It is also a parody of why Swedish films are such unrelenting, open-a-vein bores: phlegmatic actors, laconic characters, a total of about 250 words of dialog (much of it senseless), and a sense of rhythm you'd expect from someone on massive doses of Haldol, including a willingness to spend five agonizing minutes on scenes that have nothing whatever to do with absolutely anything. But you don't have to hate any of those elements to find this film silly, amateurish, and tedious. Maybe there was some knee-slapping Swedish irony and humor going on behind the freakish characterizations and the illogical turns of plot, but you certainly didn't get any sense of it from the ham-handed subtitling in English. All in all, this is an inferior product, an incompetent film, and an enormous waste of two hours of your life.

I consider the Original movie's backstory to be the same backstory for Let Me In's characters regardless of the name changes. And as an American, I am rather embarrassed (for so many other reasons as well..lol) that such changes were made to what I now know to be a great original movie and Novel, neither of which I saw/read prior to my hearing about and buying Let Me In. Believe it or not, I can (as could anyone) watch Let Me In with the original backstory in my mind as fact and it still fits fine, thankfully nothing in the movie really forces that ""never mentioned backstory"" to be the ""American version backstory"" anyway. I choose to watch both versions with the same backstory in my head/heart.",Let the Right One In
227,trcky1,Slowly paced and goes nowhere,4,4 July 2011,"There's some nice scenery/cinematography and the relationship btw the kids is built decently. But the pace is too slow and plodding and nothing that interesting happens in the film. Or rather, nothing in the film is really told in much of an interesting fashion. The main characters don't really seem to learn / grow / progress throughout the film and it's not well-done enough to simply enjoy the journey. I could see how people who enjoy art-house films might like it, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. Guess I'll give the American remake a try. It's directed by the Cloverfield director and the American version of the Ring worked out way better for me.",Let the Right One In
228,aernest,Just lovely and horrifying,8,2 January 2010,"I really can't add much to what other posters have said, but I feel compelled to post after hearing that there is going to be a (probably stupid) remake. Why? This movie is everything it sets out to be. I am amused to read about the ""beautiful"" settings in Stockholm or wherever. Good heavens, if this movie convinced me of anything, it was the fact that I do NOT want to live up North! Read the subtitles and enjoy a master filmmaker at work. The scene in the swimming pool is perfect - it should be mandatory viewing for any director who thinks he can make a horror movie. I notice a few commenters objected to the pre-teen nudity, but it does reveal a plot point that they may have missed. I think the movie could have done without that particular plot point, though.It does rankle to see this movie languish while dreck like Twilight flourishes. But no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the movie-going public.",Let the Right One In
229,randbark-2,Excruciating!,1,18 October 2009,"I watched this vampire film based on high recommendations for viewers. I despise any film with vampires or zombies, as they are typically boring and uneventful, but, thought I would give it a try.This film was no different. The script was terrible- a 200 year old vampire posing as a 12 year old girl, who befriend a neighbour boy. Her fatherly benefactor hunts for victims, and the 12 year old vampire teaches the neighbour boy to toughen up against bullies at school.There appears to be no community affect related to all the victims. No discussions, no fear, no investigations, even though many are eyewitnesses to the brutal attacks. The community seems to have a la di da disposition to events occurring around them. All the acting from all the characters is lifeless and emotionless. All I can say is, that this was an excruciating film from beginning to end.",Let the Right One In
230,akkoziol,"No schlock, slightly minimalist, and not at all what you think...",9,28 December 2008,"I was rather surprised that I fell in love with this movie because, really, how many ways can you possibly work the whole vampire thing? This is a slightly interesting take on the genre and it strips down and omits all the sorts of stereotypical and trite themes we've all come to see in vamp flics. You don't see that here, thankfully. And it's tough to even say it's a vampire flic either, because, at it's core, it's not.When I was watching this, it sort of reminded of the rather quiet and insular nature of the character and movie The Red Balloon meeting up to hang out with the bildungsroman from Stand By Me (so now, I expect ever moron movie reviewer and blogger to use bildungsroman. Hasn't zeitgeist been screwed up and misused enough already?) and a tiny sprinkling or nod to Rumble Fish. It's an amalgam of moods I would say and the filming is very clean and tight.The main character is this skinny 12 year old kid in frigid Sweden who's parents are divorced or separated and not really involved enough in his life so he's rather introverted, friendless, and finds himself the victim of bullying from his school peers. As the movie progresses, we see his growing anger towards his bullies progress as he fantasizes about revenge and stabbing them. Meanwhile, in the adult world, we begin to see the worry and concern over murders occurring in town. And it's at around this time a mysterious girl appears on his playground. Her character, in some ways, reminds me a lot of the tough little girl Miette (played by Judith Vittete) in City of Lost Children.What I also find likable about the movie is what ties the two characters together: loneliness, isolation, and a want to have understanding and someone defend you. I have to admit the one CG scene with Ginia and the cats could probably have been less cheesy but I guess now, looking back, she had no idea what was happening to her.The last 30 seconds of the movie was rather cute but in some respect sad. Cute because the director chooses to let the viewer figure out what is said. And, without giving the plot away, sad because, if you're like me, you realize that after the credits roll and you reflect back on the movie, you finally realize who the man is with Eli. At least that's my interpretation. Your mileage may vary.",Let the Right One In
231,aztrshbyz,The remake is MUCH better,3,21 July 2017,"I'm trying really hard to rate this movie on its own merits or lack thereof. I've seen both this version and the American version, and I much prefer the American one. I found the pacing in this version to be very slow and plodding, the cinematography dreary and tiring and didn't like the choices that were made for the dubbing. The chief bully sounded like a girl which kept throwing me off and made him a little unconvincing. The other dubs just were bland all around.I had a really hard time feeling any sympathy for the leads as well which surprised me. I didn't really care what happened to any of the characters, unlike my feelings about the remake. There are incredibly boring interactions between minor characters that made the film just drag for me and didn't have any context within the whole scheme of the movie. I kept thinking, ""So what?"". I'd recommend the remake in a heartbeat, but not this version. Too boring and slow for either a drama or a horror movie. Yawn.",Let the Right One In
232,Pozdnyshev,"The Profoundly Sick, Poisoned Beauty of Vampire Chicks",5,15 June 2014,"In a nutshell, this is a very good movie about some waifish pubescent boy who gets brutal revenge on the asshole kids who bully him by befriending a mysterious twelve-year-old girl who happens to be a vampire. The good acting and the accuracy with which it portrays being a misfit in junior high makes this movie bound for ""classic"" status. The problem is the vampire girl ""Eli."" I think I'm supposed to want her to succeed, but I don't because she's evil. She's a vampire, she kills innocent people, and by all appearances uses her sexuality to get people to kill for her -- like the older guy who's with her at the beginning, and ends up killing himself because it's all too much for him... Why couldn't she just go out and kill people herself? She's fully capable of it. I guess because even vampires get lonely, but she sure didn't mind letting this poor guy have it when he came home without blood. It's very sad, the scene where Eli touches the man's face, and he says her name -- how many people long deeply enough for love from someone beautiful, to where they'd murder for it? A lot, I think. So Eli is a little bitch who coldly exploits the lonely by offering them a deal: be a murderer, and she'll make you feel loved. I don't call that heroism, I call that someone who needs to be stoned to death!Another gripe is how things don't make sense here. Eli's helper strings up a dude and bleeds him like a deer -- in a public park? With headlights in the distance?? Such a brutal, senseless murder in a middle-class town would cause an EXPLOSION in public outcry, not to mention MULTIPLE MURDERS. But for all we see of an investigation, people in the town react to the carnage as if they're doped up on Thorazine: no policemen, no calls to 911, nothing. It only makes sense if it's a juvenile fantasy, where the murders only function as reasons why precious Eli is marginalized enough to identify with feminine, physically weak Oskar. SPOILER: I can't completely condemn Eli for killing Oskar's bullies - even though only one of them (the pimply, knife-wielding big brother) was a psycho who deserved to die, they DID all conspire to cruelly victimize Oskar, possibly kill him. What bothers me is that with Oskar taking off with Eli in tow at the end, he might be happy just then. He's probably in love with her. Hell, I fell in love with her. But in the end, I think poor Oskar is going to end up being just another one of Eli's accessories. That's why this movie made me feel uncomfortable and sad.Also, what the hell is going on with the scar on her crotch? So she literally isn't a girl, just like she says? That's what the movie seems to hint at, although I think a real castration would leave a bigger, more terrible scar than the one we see. :think: after becoming a vampire, I guess Eli castrated himself so that he'd... be feminized, like a eunuch, I guess, not sure how vampire biology plays out here... And be better able to manipulate people. Uh, okay. This is a door the movie opens that I don't understand, unless it's a nod to some obscure tranny vampire mythology.And poor Oskar, then. All the trouble he must go through to support Eli, and then he can't even make love to her... I mean, him... Oh gross. The movie successfully manipulated me into sanctioning homosexuality. The world doesn't need this Leftist bullshit right now, where gender roles are aggressively blurred. Good job, filmmakers, you successfully used a truly touching story about innocent young romance to sell murder without consequences, homosexuality, and transsexualism. You sick, cunning bastards.This should have ended with Oskar's parents being so horrified at his relationship with a vampire that they resolve to do a better job rearing him. Then the town would swarm over Eli, staking her through the heart, and she'd morph into a loathsomely old midget lady after she dies. A priest burns her remains in a bonfire.

Is it a thriller, children movie, horror, horror thriller or artistic? It seems it wanted to be a little bit of everything and ended up being none of above.Plot is seriously lacking in more imagination and better judgment from director. We know it is about relationship between girl vampire and a boy but it goes nowhere. There are many movies with similar plot (minus vampires of course) that show more gratitude to the story. Pace is painfully slow. There were few interesting moments that took unwanted direction and could have been used in much better edition to the movie. Dialogue is superficial and almost none. Acting is handled with quality but does not add any kind of dimension to characters. Even main two actors are one dimensional.Real pity, and I did gave this movie a really good chance but at the end, after I summarize impressions, it just did not cut where it actually should have.",Let the Right One In
234,saeedahmedsasoli,This film is great.,10,9 December 2020,"When I watched Let the Right One In, I was reminded of my experience reading Anne Rice's books. The stories both involve vampires but concern greater topics. This film uses vampirism to explore loneliness and acceptance. The story is about a young boy who befriends a girl vampire. Both of them are ostracized and introverted people. The boy, Oskar, is marginalized from his peers by bullies and has no bond with his divorced parents. Eli is an ageless entity who destroys nearly everyone she encounters, even her trusted servant. They meet and develop a platonic friendship.The film is set in Stockholm during the 1980's and has a desolate, indeterminate look. Snow covers every location and becomes thicker as the film progresses. Most scenes occur indoors or near a building which is well-lighted. This isn't going to scare you but force you to look directly at Oskar and Eli. Alfredson knows this and adds several Easter eggs. When Eli attacks her first victim, a car passes by overhead. When Oskar is being held underwater by his tormentors, a severed head appears behind him. Both of these scenes keep the film from falling too far into one genre and restore its ambiguity.As far as I can see it doesn't happen often these days, that a film is told in such a fine and sensitive manner like this work by director Tomas Alfredson. There never is too much talking and often what you experience is just an image which tells more than 1000 words and gives the whole movie even more depth. The director did perfect work and his writer and novelist Lindqvist succeeded to do something not many can do: he wrote the original novel AND the screenplay. I think the screenplay has the right focus on his book. Perfect work.My conclusion: If you love beautifully dark vampire stories, I'd recommend ""Låt den rätte komma in"". I'm sure this picture has excellent chances to get at least nominated for an Oscar. Let's only hope no one in Hollywood will get the stupid idea to remake this movie.",Let the Right One In

The movie tries hard to be artsy and gropes for some meaning, but succeeds only in being slow and dull. The characters are unattractive, the story line is largely non-existent and the film meanders for 114 minutes but seems much longer. To the extent it tries to be a horror flick, it fails as well as it's not the least bit scary. If you want to see something good in the theater, go see Doubt, Slumdog Millionaire or The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. On the other hand, if you liked Eraserhead or Liquid Sky, you may think this piece of drivel is swell.",Let the Right One In

237,standardbearer,Surprise: It is almost like a kids movie!,9,21 February 2009,"I can't really decide if this is brilliant movie or not. I got quite attached to it, so i just cannot be objective enough. And if I'd have seen this one at the proper age, I swear, I would've fallen in love with it. Because however disturbing this movie might seem at first, it is a movie for the youth. I would recommend it to people around 13. Seriously. At that age kids wouldn't get really freaked out on anything, so i can't imagine someone would find this movie truly disturbing. Parents, stop being overprotective. I makes you look really stupid.It may seem a violent, horrifying film on the surface (it has just enough gore to keep everyone entertained), but really it is just a movie about two 12 year old kids. One of them a vampire, and even has some more... complications, but that's really just a different WAY, to tell the same story over again.Let the right one in is a simple, but subtle movie. The characters, the plot, none of those things are overtly complicated in this one, but it changes enough things to keep it fresh, and exciting. Once the film starts, and sets the mood, you'll know exactly what to expect... Or as you would think. The last half hour of the movie has some pretty nasty surprises and the ending is way more tragic if you start to think about it, but they all blend into the rhythm of it so well, you wont feel that bad about them (you may cringe however... There are some things you wouldn't be prepared for sure!). So, as I said, on the surface, this is not a very deep, or controversial movie. Or is it?. It seems to be an entertaining and touching youth-film, about a young boy and a... erm... ""girl""... The best thing about this movie however is the chemistry between the two protagonists. We see this relationship mainly from Oskar's point of view, and through his 12 years old eyes, this seems to work just fine! There is a certain innocence about them, as they slowly get closer to each other, which makes the outcome of the movie even more baffling. It's up to you, the viewer to draw the consequences, and even though everything you've seen between the two seemed sweet and honest, their fate is more likely sealed to lead to a tragic end. Does Eli know this? Does she think about it, which makes her a manipulative monster or she isn't even aware of her destructive nature which makes her also a victim, but even more dangerous? It's all up to you to decide. So if you, like me had way more than enough of kidsploitation nowadays (seriously, whats the reason why every movie-maker thinks that from the age of about 12, kids only obsession would be having sex with everything that moves???), just pop in this obscure ""kids movie"", and enjoy! And be hasty because the American remake (yuck!) is on the way, and without the courage and charm of the original (and we can be totally sure, that it'll gonna lack these two things) that movie's gonna blow...

238,bobhartshorn,All dressed up with no place to go!,5,24 May 2010,"This tale of a young boy bullied at school and then befriended by the vampire girl next door, has had accolade after accolade piled upon it's slight, fragile frame earning it the 'most overrated movie of 2009' from this reviewer. The first half is engaging, prettily shot and contains some genuinely macabre black-comic moments courtesy of the young bloodsucker's father figure's woefully inept attempts at offing strangers in the night and draining them dry of the red stuff for the benefit of the bratty little fiend back home. After this bewitching set-up however, it quickly becomes clear that it really doesn't have anywhere interesting to go and would have worked much better as a short film. Most of the good work is undone by clumsily inserted gore scenes that feel like they've wandered in from a bad Wes Craven schlocker. Admittedly, these high-octane, claret-squirting moments are very entertaining and funny - the audience I saw it with were rolling in the aisles on mass during the climactic scene - but they're completely at odds with the tone and atmosphere of everything else on show and the final result just feels messy and silly, so even though the ending is very good, it doesn't have the impact it should thanks to the ill-judged proceedings before hand. Also, and I may be being too cynical here, but I cant help feeling that the critical praise it rode into town on does have a lot to do with the fact that it's a Swedish film with subtitles. I believe exactly the same movie could have been made here in the UK, or the US, and it would probably have gone all but unnoticed. This could have been a small horror gem, but it drops the ball badly at half time and quickly starts to bore, outstaying it's welcome by at least 30 minutes. Shame.",Let the Right One In
239,stephparsons,Nordic Bleakness with an Uplifting twist,8,13 April 2013,"Ethereal, bleak, enchanting, understated, shocking, bloody, romantic and beautifully filmed, Let the Right One in is all that a great Swedish film should be. Kare Hedebrant who plays Oskar is mesmerising; a gentle, innocent, 'different' child, as white as the perpetual snow that covers the landscape throughout this movie. Wild horses wouldn't normally drag me to watch a 'vampire movie' and yet the vampire theme in LTROI is almost peripheral to the central themes of loneliness, isolation, bullying and the gentle (well, sometimes brutal) unfolding of first love. The adult characters, although numerous, often belligerent or sometimes just plain bizarre, fade like shadows into the background, so strong is the presence of Oskar, Eli (played by Linda Leandersson), and their brutish peers. Like a well written book, there is little self pity shown by Oskar and Eli, despite their often being neglected, ignored, or bullied; they simply 'survive' in their harshly lonely world and gravitate towards each other, outcasts both. The only thing that I feel slightly mars the intelligent sensitivity of LTROI, is one too many dismembered body parts; we got it the first time and the second time and after that became overkill (no pun intended) and somewhat spoilt an otherwise beautifully conceived film. Overall, however, I found LTROI to be a haunting juxtaposition of fear and hope - Nordic bleakness with an uplifting twist and for those reasons I thoroughly recommend it.",Let the Right One In
240,rich-106,Quite unpleasant and unclear (spoilers galore),3,5 October 2010,"I don't see what the fans like about this. There is little redeeming value here. No characters are at all admirable or likable. Even the hero blond Oskar is a wimp training to be a delinquent. I wanted everybody in the film to disappear and leave us that beautiful winter scenery uncontaminated with human decrepitude of the movie. I shudder to think what the author and the fans of this movie think of humanity. Are all the people you know cruel or crude to you? Are you all persecuted or perverted? Apparently you are happy Ellie survives solely because she saves a blond boy even though she's a blood thirsty serial killer who should be exterminated immediately. How long before she decapitates Oscar? Is that low a relationship what you all expect in your own life or what? The movie had many loose ends: How could Oskar be attracted to this creature only because it talks softly and solves Rubik Cube? With the near daily rate of killings Ellie needs in order to survive for 200 years how can anyone not know about her? Why make her a boy and not make it crystal clear to the audience? How can Hakkan be such a bungler on his killings? Carrying acid to burn your face to hide your identity seems a bit extreme and idiotic. Why is Oscar allowed to continue school as if nothing happened without any changes after bashing a boy's ear severely? Why would cats attack a vampire instead of just keeping away? Why not make it more clear why Oskars father friend can interrupt Dad-Son day so easily (its alcoholism when you investigate it) ? What is that precious egg supposed to be? Why does Ellie say ""feel what it is like to be me"" and nothing is shown in the film? Hardly any police in this movie of many gruesome murders? Why do some common people seem to know so much about vampires that they burn yet the hospital doctors seem clueless about it? Why is not Oskar gasping for air when he comes up from under water? Are we suppose to think the ending scene of Oscar carrying his new ""girlfiriend"" creature around in a box as heartwarming?Put the book and the movie in the sun and and let it flame out like a vampire and the same goes for its US remake.",Let the Right One In

242,FSfilmblog,"Let the right one in, into your house",10,18 November 2010,"Let me just start off by saying this is my favourite film of last year. I rant and rave about this film to anyone who is willing to listen. I even managed to convince my partner to watch it and she thoroughly enjoyed it too.As people may know by now, Let The Right One In is a ""vampire"" film which has been recently remade by Hollywood (Let Me In). Anyone wishing to see Let Me In, I urge you to start with this little gem, (even if you are not going to see the remake) I recommend you to go and rent/buy/steal/beg/borrow or by whatever means you can. It's a refreshing and rewarding experience.The title refers to the Morrissey song ""Let The Right One Slip In"" and to the element of vampire folklore (for those of you not in the know, never invite a vampire into your home!) but what stands this film apart is that it doesn't play out like your stereotypical vampire film. Its a film about kids that happen to feature vampires (whereas Let Me In is a film about vampires that happen to feature kids....).Let The Right One In is based on an international best seller and has been translated into numerous languages. It has also been nominated for and won loads of independent film awards. Its just a pity not enough people will see it just because they have to read subtitles. I am dreading anyone going to see the remake and not recognising this brilliant original film.The film is set in 1980s Sweden where we follow a boy named Oskar (Kara Hedebrant) who recently has had new neighbours move into his block of apartments. The new arrivals are a ""twelve"" year old girl Eli (Lina Leandersson) and her ""guardian"" Hakan (Per Ragnar). The film makes no bones to hide the fact that Eli is a vampire, we see windows being boarded up and in the first few minutes Hakan goes out to syphon blood out of an unsuspecting victim.The pace is quite meticulous. It slowly builds up to an inevitable ending but it doesn't mean that there isn't anything going on in between. The story unfolds to show us a blossoming friendship that develops between the Oskar and Eli. Their initial meeting outside their apartment block shows us how coy and lonely they both really are. Oskar is being bullied at school and at night he often fantasizes about exacting revenge on his tormentors. Eli catches him whilst he is stabbing a tree. She tells him abruptly that they can't be friends and he in reply tells her who said I want to be friends and from there on in they end meeting with one another every night and they begin to bond.When Oskar gets a whipping from the bullies no one figures out what has really happened but Eli. He builds up a trust in her and Eli advises him to hit back and hit back he does. Oskar finally feels happy that he has found a friend that he can trust and makes him feel confident. But as we go on, bodies start to pile up and Oskar begins to realise that Eli isn't a normal girl, their friendship is put to the test when the locals suspect Oskars' new neighbours.What gives this film its strength are the performances of both leads. The white setting of the snow gives the film a bright and innocence to it and the soundtrack is beautifully subtle and haunting. The CGI is used effectively and seamlessly. Its the story about loneliness and friendship that sets this film apart from being your average vampire flick. Yes, there are scenes of vampirism and sudden acts of violence but it isn't out and out gore. There are tender moments within the film and you learn to care about Oskar and Eli. A friendship that overcomes differences and obstacles. Watch, enjoy and recommend to others...if you like my review please visit my blog http://fsfilm.blogspot.com/",Let the Right One In
243,rsa5387,Brooding and Emotional Vampire Tale,9,29 March 2009,"A very different mediation on the standard coming-of-age story. Oskar, tormented by his peers, is veering for companionship in a snowy small-town outside of Stockholm, Sweden. One snowy night, he meets Eli, the new girl who has moved in next-door. While the two unabashedly grow fond of each-other, Oskar knows that theirs something curiously odd about her. She seems to only be out at night, her body is deathly cold, and she craves human blood. Let the Right One In is a strangely sweet and captivating tale of the trials of adolescence and a love that knows no bounds, really. But this isn't Twilight by any means. The film does not rely on melodrama and special effects to hold your attention. It almost indiscernibly places its vampire mythos into our world, making Eli feel far more 'human' than most of her other fang-baring brethren. That she has the physical and mental capacity of a 12-year old, yet has lived for hundreds of years, also makes us feel for her innocence and emotional plight, yet fear her for the bloodthirst she possesses. Its methodically slow pace allows the films lingering cinematography and haunting musical score to craft a suspenseful, brooding atmosphere effectively. The two child-actors who play Oskar and Eli respectively, are excellent in their very under-stated roles, allowing their facial gestures to do most of the talking. In summary, this was a very enjoyable, affecting drama/horror film that served as a refreshing take on adolescence and the vampire folklore. Highly recommended!",Let the Right One In
244,gundognc,"Let the Right One in, OR I was a pre-teen vampire's lover",10,2 September 2009,"Definitely this year's best Swedish vampire love story. Hopefully people will not consider this to be a spoiler as the blanket media coverage of the film has mostly referred to it as a vampire film.Vampirism went out of vogue in the 1980's, returning with gusto in the mid to late 1990's. Thus there is an enormous amount opportunity for cliché in making a vampire film. Let the Right One In avoids almost all of them and presents an unusual story in a unique way. The cinematography of the film is stunning but it is outdone by the sound which is amazing. I'm not much for art films but this is a film that you could almost listen to rather than watch.SPOILER Oskar is an introverted, solitary 12 year old is being victimised at his school by a trio of bullies. He meets Eli (pronounced ""ee-lee"" rather than ""eh-lee"") a girl his own age who has just moved into the same block of flats. She is living with a creepy old man who is seen to be murdering teenagers and attempting to collect their blood. It quickly becomes apparent that Eli is a vampire, and the old man is her helper and possibly lover, though this is never explored.A local man is killed when the old man botches a murder, loosing the blood that Eli needs to stay alive. After being discovered trying to find another victim the man attempts and fails to melt himself to death with acid and is captured.Eli, forced to fend for herself, begins to befriend Oskar. Oskar eventually learns her secret – which doesn't phase him at all. I guess when you are twelve things like that are different – those kidz eh.Oskar's friendship with Eli seems to give him enough courage to stand up to the bullies who've been making his life hell. You realise that this is radically different to an American film when, instead of backing off (which in Hollywood-world is what happens when you stand up to a bully), Oskar's tormentors recruit help to come back to make Oskar's life even more of a hell than it was before.Eli does perhaps the most unknowingly cruel thing she can and kills the victimisers and rescues Oskar, he runs away with her and we realise that in sixty years or so he'll have become the man who originally arrived at the apartment block with Eli.End SpoilerLet the Right One In is mostly compatible with what might be called Stokerian tradition of vampirism. Vampires ares agelessly immortal, vulnerable to sunlight and can infect others with their curse/gift. They do however cast shadows and reflections. Whether they are afraid of crosses or other religious symbols is not explored. I mention this because I expect many people will take issue with this interpretation of vampirism not being ""accurate"". In fact the body of legend on vampires is enormous and highly divergent (take a look at the Wackypedia entry for vampires if you don't believe me) and an ""accurate"" approach is impossible.In conclusion this is definitely worth seeing but do not expect an action epic or a traditional horror film, this is neither. The acting is superb, especially from the girl who plays Eli who (with some clever lighting) can go from looking like an innocent 12 year old to a ancient monster without having any prosthetics attached to her face or digital jiggery pokery.Let the Right One In is a tale of horrifically tragic, doomed but innocent love.",Let the Right One In
245,sjogro,Not a typical film-festival art-house horror,8,13 February 2014,"There's been a lot of attention for this movie, that's mainly how it ended up on my watch-list, where it remained for a good while before I felt to actually go and get through it, and finally today I did. I started watching with some healthy scepsis, thinking what this applauded new wave trendsetter in vampire horror would bring me. And so in the beginning I was waiting to get hooked in by the film, I remember thinking ""typical film-festival art-house horror!"". And once the vampire theme comes out of the hat, it feels a bit like the gimmick's been played. I lost interest for a bit because of the slow pace and because of the limited scope of the vampire storytelling you start to feel like you know what's next. However slowly though, and tricked by the normal-world esthetics, I started to sink into this fantasy world that was carefully being crafted in front of my eyes. I let the weird characters happen and started to believe more and more in the journey of a twelve year old dueling his darker thoughts. There's a lot happening in this film you don't see happening a lot in other films that would be tagged with the same keywords. I'd probably file this as a ""vampire nouvelle vague"" (if I had to). I bet there's not too many made in this bloodline, so to speak (nodge nodge, wink wink). The ubiquitous vampire theme is actually not of major importance to the plot of the film, if you can actually call it a plot. The whole vampire thing appears more like a skin, a wrong skin even, or a compulsive design to fit the story in. It really feels as if there's a heavier theme that overrules that vampire gimmick. A (teenager's) fascination for life and death. There's a lot being told without being told, which I really like in this film. I think in many ways it is an intriguing film because of the way it is mixing the horror genre -- which seems to be built on rules and cliché's -- with the freedom of the nouvelle vague. I was worried whether this film would be ""worth my time"" so to speak (sounds more arrogant than I mean it to). And it definitely was worth my time, great casting also, by the way. I recommend you watch this!",Let the Right One In
246,RohitRajkumar,"""The horror movie we wanted to see""",10,24 November 2009,"We have seen over the years how the horror genre has able to portray monsters, vampires ,zombies and other such characters on screen. Nonetheless, some stories had just gore and blood all over them, some stories had a particular message to give but rarely do you get a horror story which scares you and at the same time leaves you speechless. In other words,what do you say? A PERFECT HORROR PICTURE EXPERIENCE.I myself too have been part of that bunch of people who believe that a scary movie is one which makes you jump off your seat and not have any other romantic or comic element in it. But this movie made me realize what a horror movie can actually do to you. As I said there is definitely a romantic twist to this tale but it doesn't make you feel for a second that you aren't watching a horror movie. The romantic elements in the film are in sync with the theme of the film. The film actually has everything in it, drama,emotion,horror,suspense,romance but still makes you feel you are watching a horror movie.First of all, the cast has to be praised for their brilliant performances. Kare as Oskar and Lina as Eli have taken their romance in the film to heights never reached before in recent times. You would never actually expect that some 13 year old kids could play lovers on screen. But their compassion and love for each other is so well brought out by the director Tomas Alfredson that you just feel the pain of the characters in the movie. Such good is the direction of the movie.But the soundtrack of the movie is one you should watch out for. It is one of the best you will hear in recent times, especially 'Eli's Theme' if put down in one word is simply magical. The composer Johan Soderqvist has managed to bring out a very unique music score for this film. And for the guys who have read the very critically acclaimed and popular book, there are bound to be differences because each person has a different perspective about the book so when you have so much altogether in one film, you shouldn't miss this one. Sadly, this couldn't make it to the Oscars but it's their loss as they could not present one of THE best movies of all times.",Let the Right One In

Although it is a far step from my usual enjoyment I thought this was a sweet movie and I did enjoy it quite a bit. I enjoyed the story from start to finish as it played together very nicely and added the teen romance in it at the same time. If you don't mind reading subtitles while watching the movie you should enjoy this. If you can't multitask you should learn Swedish so you can watch this. It is totally worth watching even if you aren't into the Romance type of movies. I give ""Let The Right One In"" an 8 out of 10.~Joe",Let the Right One In

I just randomly stumbled upon it and without knowing anything about the film, I was already intrigued by it. I couldn't find a source that had an english dub or subtitles (the film is in swedish). I just decided to hell with it and buy the blu ray. My eyes were glued to the screen while watching this film, and it almost hypnotized me. I did not expect the movie to be a horror/romance, and those genres meld together greatly in this movie. There are times where I'm terrified, and there are times where I feel soft inside. These feelings for me melded in such a unique way in the ""pool scene"". The film has beautiful cinematography and the shots of the swedish winter looked entrancing. The 2 young leading actors in this film had great performances, especially Lina Leandersson. The screenplay was also masterful because it somehow made the film half romance, half horror, and those genres didn't overtake each other. They were exactly 50/50 in this movie, and it is surprisingly a great mix of genres. The movie is a perfect length, and Tomas Alfredson directed this film with mastery. I wonder what happened to him in 2017 though, *cough cough* The Snowman. Everyone should check out this movie, It really deserves a 10/10",Let the Right One In

Oskar is doomed to this same fate as the movie ends. She could easily turn Oskar into a vampire and they could be together forever at the same age... but she doesn't want that. She wants her next thrall. How many cycles has this creature been through and how old is she really? Brrrrrr.Best vampire movie I've seen, manages to blend in lots of the vampire lore without becoming trite. Original and truly horrific.

Not sure where John Aivide Lindquist (author) got his inspiration, but's clear that love was at the heart of the story. I don't doubt this film might win an award, for him and the director. The story begins with a girl, named Eli (Lina Leandersson) moving into the same apartment building as Oskar (Kare Hedebrant). Oskar is a boy that's continually being bully at school and it's obviously having a psychological effect on him. After seeing this, Eli, begins to talk to Oskar, but warns him that they cannot be friends. We find out later, she needs real blood to live. But what begins as curiosity, ends with both of them being so attached to one another that,they begin to depend on one another. But it isn't until Eli's guardian futile and idiotic attempts to feed her, that forces Eli to take a course of action, which will change the lives of both (Eli & Oskar).

I honestly had it in my mind that I'd have a good night watching a movie when I inserted the disc into my blu-ray player at 10pm. How wrong could I have been? The movie has no action at all. When there does seem to be a scene of killing, the camera stands still as if this movie was recorded back in 1930. After 15 minutes I simply realised that this movie is insanely boring and lacks action, interesting characters or at least interesting conversations between those. Hoping that it is just one of those movies that has a slow beginning and gets better, I fast-forwarded to the next scenes.This made things even worse. Not only is the main character a 12-year old boy who looks like a 10-year old girl with SERIOUS learning difficulties, the whole movie also seems to be concentrated on the boy being bullied by three other boys at school. Where, oh where are the HORROR parts of this movie? I don't want to get into too many details as this reminds me of how tragic this movie is and makes me feel rather irritated. It is always a case of personal taste, but from a decent horror movie I expect a lot of action, interesting characters, lots of suspense in the scenes, possibly a few more gory scenes to add to the scary-ness of the movie, a plot that makes sense and a general horror atmosphere. ""Let the Right One In"" scores a 0 on all of those, and instead seems like an extremely boring, psychological documentary about a boy who gets bullied at school.Not worth it, simply not worth it.",Let the Right One In
253,Joe-146,My kind of vampire film,9,29 October 2008,"I must admit right off that I have a soft spot for vampires. When written well, they're poignant, tragic characters. Having - not necessarily voluntarily - given up their humanity for an eternity of youth and hunger... unable to be a part of, or maybe even remember being a part of the world of ordinary people. Let the right one in is first and foremost a relationship movie about the misfit preteen boy and the little undead girl he befriends. There is sweetness and sadness, suspense and gore - but only to the degree appropriate for realism, and the sort of macabre humor that can't help but occasionally happen under such surreal circumstances.If you're looking for a Hollywood spectacle, go rent Interview with the Vampire or Coppola's Dracula. If you want characters as interesting and engaging as Anne Parrilaud & Anthony LaPaglia in ""Innocent Blood"", with a down-to-earth film making style reminiscent of George Romero's Martin, you just may like this movie & add it to your short list of great vampire films.",Let the Right One In
254,terrazygotes-30881,Wonderful,9,26 December 2019,"One of my two favourite movies ! The most important feature for me, was the emotional interactions, especially between the two main characters. Lost children, like the rest of us, who found someone to rely on. A real love story, wrapped in a mysterious, supernatural fairytale. A snowy winter world adds a magic atmosphere to the tale. It is totally serious and realistic in emotional demeanour, unlike most films. The real situation of childhood angst in a world of distracted and confused adults, whom they cannot count on for love and guidance, which somehow they are able to find in each other, because one of them is much more than she seems. This reminds me of the denouement of the other childcentered drama, ""My Life, as a Dog."" The two main child actors are amazing, a boy and girl, whose gender characteristics are somewhat reversed. She is realistic and tough and he is a delicate dreamer. Unfortunately the American remake did not convey this, I believe due to miscasting. Though well-made its existence seems rather pointless. The Swedish version is definitive.",Let the Right One In

I felt it was a horror movie with a lot of meaning behind it and powerful storytelling.It was like a breath of fresh air in the vampire genre, with a few crummy vampire movies released lately *cough* Twilight *cough*.The creepiness of the film comes from a lack of music. Usually horror films need music to fit the mood, but with Let the Right One In, that wasn't the case.Overall, this is a very well-made horror film with lots of meaning behind it, a hidden gem that should have a wider audience, a mesmerizing experience, and one of the best vampire movies ever made.Rating: 9.5/10",Let the Right One In
256,tawdry_hepburn,A Risk Worth Taking,10,22 October 2008,"Let the Right one In is like no other vampire movie that I have ever seen. It is smarter, scarier and more nuanced. It doesn't feel like a thriller, it feels like literature.The film, which details the bizarre misadventures of a pair of pre-teen star crossed lovers, one of whom is an androgynous vampire, is phenomenal in almost every regard. The details of young Oskar's (Kare Hedebrant) life are spot on. Stuck in that incredibly painful period of post-childhood, pre-adolescence, Oskar is aware of girls, but has no idea how to contend with them. He is small for his age and is brutalized by other boys as a result. He's terribly alone and collects news clips of violent crimes as a way of letting out his rage. One day a strange young girl named Eli (Lina Leandersson) appears on the playground. They become fast friends and things begin to look up for Oskar. Eli even (innocently) spends the night on occasion.Meanwhile, we are privy to some things that Oskar doesn't know. As it happens, Eli's caretaker is a serial killer of the most brutal order, desanguinating his victims into a bucket. Soon, Oskar comes to realize that his new friend is a bit more than she seemed at first.After a tragedy of shocking violence Eli is left to fend for herself, trying desperately to stave off the urge to drink fresh blood while also forming a delicate new bond with Oskar.There is already a remake of Let the Right one In on the way. But don't wait for it. There is no way it could ever hope to capture the magic of the original. It's not just that this film is gorgeously shot. Not just that it is impeccably written. Not just that it is fully realized with an unmatched respect for vampire lore. It is all in the acting. Even if the producers find two amazing young actors, the odds against recapturing the brilliant, melancholy chemistry are astronomical.Everything about Let the Right one In is thought through. Where a more traditional horror film might have opted for endless ultra violence or else cut everything out in favor of a kiddie friendly rating. director Tomas Alfredson steers the line right down the middle. When the violence comes it is brutal and horrific, but it is never dwelt upon. We are left to question what we just saw rather than see kidneys on display.Too, there is a great stillness to the film. The first half of the film it mimics Oskar's stage. Stuck in between. Never moving, with no hope of growth. But as things begin to change, it becomes apparent that the stillness is not for Oskar but rather for Eli. Oskar will grow up, change and become a man. Eli is stuck in a much more burdensome fate.And then there is the quiet, understated ending. Some will find it haunting, others will find it whimsical, I went back and forth more than a few times. No two people will have the same understanding.This is the kind of movie people beg for. Don't miss it. This is the first time since perhaps Silence of the Lambs that a horror film had a real chance to take home some Oscar gold. And not only that, it will deserve it.A+",Let the Right One In
257,BSHBen,The Right Stuff,9,24 October 2009,"Society's glamorization of vampires has always confounded me, and I doubt that Eli, the eleven-year-old bloodsucker from 2008's ""Let the Right One In,"" is any less confused. Eli, played by Lina Leandersson, is a miserable creature, cooped away from society with an equally wretched caretaker, Hakan (Per Ragnar), but she is solemn about her curse. Human schoolboy Oskar (Kare Hedebrant), also eleven, is just as pitiable, suffering from neglectful parents and brutal bullies. Perhaps the factor that draws the two together is their hopelessness; they may not have reached puberty, but they have grown out of complaining.Tomas Alfredson's Swedish film is based off a novel of the same name by John Ajvide Lindqvist, raising obvious comparisons to the vampire-themed Twilight franchise. I'm above taking cheap-shots at a series intended for mass appeal, but there are reasons Twilight won't be appearing on any 'Best of the Decade' list. The key to Let the Right One In is its subtly, which is precisely what Twilight lacks. The dialog between Oskar and Eli is sparse, barely conversational, but we understand their relationship on a deep level. Eli murders to survive and has, perhaps, for decades, but around Oskar she grows to possess his wide-eyed innocence. The performances of the two leads are astounding.""Let the Right One In"" is, foremost, a horror movie, but the violence is never glorified. Alfredson emphasizes the crisp whiteness of the snow, and the blood that eventually stains it seems as otherworldly and unnatural as Eli.The vampire genre has been done to death, making the originality of the story all the more remarkable. We get the usual conventions – vampires can't be exposed to sunlight or enter a room without permission (hence the title) – but ""Let the Right One In"" turns them upside-down. I won't spoil the surprises. The final confrontation with the school bullies is just as shocking, but it's not the thrills but the warmth between Eli and Oskar that resonates strongest through the freezing Swedish winter.Anybody intrigued by the story but wary of the English subtitles may be in for a treat: an American remake directed by Cloverfield's Matt Reeves, currently in pre-production, is scheduled for 2010 release.",Let the Right One In
258,CinemaPat,Haunting and Steady Drama,10,28 October 2010,"Bram Stoker would be shaking in his coffin if he were to see how vampires are being portrayed today on TV and in Movies. Movies like ""Twilight"" and TV shows like ""Vampire Diaries"" are bringing Vampires out in the daytime, having them in intimate relationships dealing with ""high school"" drama. Thankfully directors such as Neil Jordan (""Interview with The Vampire"") and Tomas Alfredson stayed true to the legend of the Vampire.""Let The Right One In"", starring Kåre Hedebrant as ""Oskar"" and Lina Leandersson as ""Eli"" brings the classic vampire tale back with a unique twist. The film is based on the book by the same name from Swedish author John Ajvide Lindqvist. ""Let The Right One In"" begins with a man out in the woods collecting blood from a recently killed person. Little do we know this collection is for a 12 year old vampire who has been living for hundreds of years. It is a fresh take on the classic vampire dilemma: finding food and staying out of site and sun.One of the many things this film got right was the atmosphere. This is a Swedish film and was shot entirely in Sweden. This was the perfect setting for a film like this. The constant snow fall and dreary look of the town really added to the realism of the movie. Unlike ""Interview with The Vampire"", I could relate more to this modern setting. The director chose exactly the right times for the music score to come in. He didn't saturate every moment like a lot of horror directors tend to do.This story is a lot more than just a vampire girl trying to survive. It is also a story of love and redemption. Oskar is constantly being bullied by the local kids and he is always so retreated and alone. Eli brings a sense of wonder to his life. He finds in her an oddness that brings him out of his shell. He builds a relationship with her carefully and slowly. She teaches him how to stand up for himself and gives him confidence. It is an interesting back and forth between the two as their relationship builds. A testament to the director and the actors.This is a wonderful film that has single-handedly brought a genre out of the ""sparkly"" hole vampire films have been in for the last few years.",Let the Right One In

261,ftyl,'Twelve... more or less...',8,2 March 2009,"Let the Right One In (or Låt den rätte komma in the original Swedish) is an unusual coming of age drama set in snowbound Stockholm in the early 1980s. It tells the story of a boy on the razors edge of puberty and the trials of trying to rip a nascent adult from the restrictive cocoon of childhood. Oskar is a typical movie pre-adolescent  he doesn't really fit in at school and is perpetually bullied by his cruel peers, whose attacks are casually brutal in the awful way children can be. Oskar's life is further complicated by the separation of his parents; he splits his time between living with his mother in the city and the countryside haven belonging to his father. Increasingly frustrated by his life, Oskar has taken to carrying a knife and seems on the edge of violent reprisal. Then a mysterious young girl moves in next door and Oskar's world is forever altered. So much of Let the Right One In conforms to the standard rules of the pre-teen, coming of age genre. The broken home, the bullying and, most specifically, the mix of curiosity and burgeoning sexuality which defines those initial interactions with a member of the opposite sex. Eli is a mystery to Oskar, a truism only heightened by the strange life she lives  not attending school and living with a man who is old enough to be her father but who she never obeys. Her habits are not kept a secret from the audience, but the filmmakers are smart enough to not define her merely by her needs. As the two young, isolated people grow closer together, we hope for a happy resolution, even though we know how unlikely it will be. Despite its genre trappings, Let the Right One In never becomes a horror film. It has horrific moments and it is certainly not for children but the director, Thomas Alfredson, never forgets that his film is a drama and that the relationship of the children is the most important element of the piece. Combining themes of endless childhood, subsumed sexuality, casual violence and mesmerising performances from the 2 young leads, Let the Right One In is far more than the sum of its stereotypical parts. A sweet story of young love, with violent embellishments, wonderful effects and a healthy dose of the macabre  it is a gem in the increasingly stagnant horror movie genre.",Let the Right One In

They love nothing more than laying into ""dumb"" Hollywood productions for a lack of plausibility yet consistently let foreign productions off the hook for the very same mistakes. Many called this quiet little Swedish film a masterpiece. You have got to be kidding me? Let me see now, if this was a Michael Bay production do you think they'd overlook these corkers? Read on.....Eli has a guardian figure who murders innocents and collects their blood. You get the impression Eli and him have been around for quite some time. This moron decides to abduct and murder a young man yards from a main road. His attempts to extract blood consist of a funnel and a makeshift bucket. It's so idiotic it's embarrassing. Naturally he's spotted and has to bolt. We then see him sitting on a train holding his waterproofs which are splattered with blood. In full view of everyone. Unbelievable. This clown wouldn't last a week in this line of work.It gets worse. This same philistine decides to try again. This time in a SCHOOL. Yup, you read that right. He hangs a lad upside down in the changing room, primed for throat slitting, bucket at the ready. He doesn't even gag the boy. What happens? The boy has friends waiting for him outside and he starts SHOUTING for help. Mr Murderer really is as dumb as they come right? This time he's cornered. Solution? Pours acid on his face so the police won't recognise him and garner a lead to Eli! Hahaha. Masterpiece right?!!Not only that, if you're going to murder people for blood why not just let Eli feed there and then? Why wander around with waterproofs, funnels and buckets when she can just come along??! It's so dumb it hurts.There's more. There are dead bodies dropping left and centre. We even have a man witness Eli maul his friend. Yet there is no discernible police investigation, no one reports anything to anyone. The stupidity of every character is mind boggling.A local woman is attacked and infected by Eli. She survives but is now a vampire. She and her husband both know full well who attacked her. The young, creepy looking girl who stays just over there! Yet they tell no one. She's never interviewed and her husband doesn't crack a light to anyone. He has his own little revenge mission which also ends in complete and utter farce. No surprise there.Oskar's relationship with his dad is never fleshed out and has absolutely no bearing on the film at all. Why was it even in there? Another mystery not explained.We see Oskar at the end heading to pastures new with Eli in a box. Haha, another belter. I'm sure his mum was happy to just let her 12 year old boy leave home, no questions asked. Perhaps he's fled of his own accord? On a PUBLIC train! One call to the authorities and he'd be picked up at the very next station. It's so stupid it's borderline offensive.I could go on, really I could.

The scenic beauty portrays the Swedish taiga surrounding the newly-established Blackeberg suburb around Stockholm magically. One is pushed into the fore of events at the very outset. Watch as young Oskar replays his daily (school) troubles to himself at home. Watch as a new neighbor arrives. An odd one. Observe their immediate and undeniable chemistry.Oskar's torments become your torments (yes, both main characters in this film are probably the best pre-teen actors I have ever seen on the big screen. Dakota Fanning tames in comparison, even if having showed decent prowess in her many pre-teen features). You root for him, at every moment wishing he'd end his travails, by answering back. By defending himself, damn it! Do not expect to find it simple to grapple with this film. To begin with, it is a complex affair - you want Oskar to be happy, and you can feel his love for Eli, but is that the right course to be taken? What of Eli's contrivances? Yet she is locked into a life she cannot possibly control.A highly philosophical piece, that benefits from it's masterly crafted portrayal.

In an isolated town, snow drifts through the night sky as Oskar stares longingly, cold and alone. A dishevelled truck pulls up outside his window and out steps Eli, the young (or old?) vampire who is about to disrupt his life.This is not your average vampire film. If carlsberg did vampire films, they would probably make this one, it is an outstanding horror film, with equal doses of drama and romance that serve to make the scares far more chilling as well as adding depth to an enchanting story. While recent vampire films tend to focus on action and gore, Alfredson uses it sparingly and to great effect, clearly aware that on screen violence is much more shocking and powerful when the audience share a connection with the characters.Vampire fans will instantly recognise the title's reference to vampire lore, the creatures can only enter a house when invited in, and it is pleasing to see a vampire film that breaks away from the genre in terms of storytelling and character development rather than the reinvention of vampire legacy seen in films such as Blade and 30 days of night. Let the right one in has more in common with early horrors such as Nosferatu and Vampyr, creating an unsettling atmosphere and building up suspense as the story develops. The two young actors are stunning as Oskar and Eli, creating very believable characters who are bought together through a shared sense of isolation.As Oskar gradually realises that Eli is not human, he begins to confront his fears as the town around him is sent into a panic due to a number of deaths in mysterious circumstances. It is the growth of Oskars character that really sets this film aside and the final pay off is an extraordinary scene reminiscent of the bloody prom night in Carrie when a prank goes horribly wrong.Let the right one in probably won't be given a major release in the UK which is a huge shame, although it is rare to see a subtitled film in any mainstream cinema. Do yourself a big favour and watch this film, you won't be disappointed.8/10If you liked this film, you will also enjoy these: Near Dark, Carrie, Mean Creek, The Lost Boys",Let the Right One In
267,the-timelord-victorious,A stylish and beautiful piece of filmmaking.,9,26 October 2010,"I've always felt that foreign films were a massive step up from the mainstream and generic Hollywood films out industry has been churning out of late. We've had robots, and aliens and vampires. They may all tell some kind of story, but nothing really stands out for me as far as they go. I felt 'Let The Right One In' was a breath of fresh air, complete with a brilliant narrative and fantastic performances. The story follows a young boy called Oskar, who is bullied enormously but just doesn't stand up for himself, something I feel anyone in this situation could relate to. Oskar soon meets Eli, a young, mysterious girl who is harbouring a very dark secret. Yes, she's a vampire. All of you who have just rolled your eyes at this revelation don't fret. Eli is no Edward Cullen, in fact she is nothing like him. As far as this film goes, it bears no similarity to the Twilight Saga what so ever. Something this film does really well is capture the childhood innocence present in Oskar, and in addition, the experience of Eli's character. Striking a massive contrast between both characters. The film itself has been described as a romantic horror film and the best thing about it, is that it doesn't follow the generic codes and conventions of both genres. The characters love isn't clichéd in the least and the story follows the story of Oskar, rather than Eli, whereas in most romantic films we follow the female character. I felt this decision was brilliant, it really allows the audience to make their own interpretation regarding Eli, who tends to provide the narrative present within the film, and gives the movie a sense of urgency and mystery. In terms of performance Kare Hedebrant and Linda Leandersson are fantastic in their portrayal of Oskar and Eli, and merely create magic on screen together with brilliant chemistry. They also seem to bounce off each other, delivering believable dialogue and tackling situations very realistically. Which is very important, considering the story of the film relies heavily on realism in order to make it work. The soundtrack I felt was fantastic, Johan Soderqvist provides us with a very imaginative score. Perfectly balancing both the horror and romance present in the film. In some places the soundtrack tends to be very haunting, providing us with the right amount of suspense to keep us glued to the screen. Soderqvist tends to keep the 'jump music' to a minimum, a severe contrast to Hollywood, who tend to overuse this quite a lot, to scare the audience. This just proves how imaginative the film is on the whole, the real horror in this film doesn't lie in the fantastic soundtrack, but instead, the most horrifying aspect in the whole movie is just how realistic some parts are. The performances are top notch, and situations are dealt with such care, that it actually makes us question what's just happened, and allows us to draw our own conclusion. Overall, Tomas Alfredso has delivered a stylish and very dark thriller, the cinematography is stunning. A modern masterpiece.",Let the Right One In
268,saturnalia33,A highly artistic and involving movie about loneliness and emotions in an unusual friendship,8,6 April 2009,"Låt den rätte komma in (Let The Right One In) is an interesting mix of drama and horror which could only have been made outside of Hollywood. Whilst the horror element is subdued, when it does occur it is harsh and violent with an obvious realism that is absent from most films in this genre that go for a hyper-reality form of gore and blood lust.It is based on the 2004 novel of the same name set during the early 1980's of Stockholm.The film focuses on Oskar, an only child in a divorced family who spends a lonely time living between his mother and father which is further compounded by his bullying at school.One evening outside the apartment blocks, he meets an unusual girl called Eli and they form an curious chemistry. During the course of the film situations arise that questions how far their relationship can go, the strength of character that friendship provides and nature of the friendship itself.Set against this human drama there are other social relationships within the community where Oskar lives which impact on everyone concerned.Let The Right One In turns the idea of a horror film on its head and brings a more natural as opposed to supernatural element to play. It's only downside is that the pace can be a little slow at times but this is a relatively minor qualm in an overall highly artistic and involving movie about loneliness and emotions in an unusual friendship.An English language remake is on the cards for a 2010 release. I imagine it will lose most subtle nuances and go straight for the action jugular. I suggest getting in now and enjoying the original.",Let the Right One In

It's on the top ten list of must watch movies in 2008 and I'm eager to watch this as soon as it comes out in cinemas here. Finally the wait is over and I walked out of the cinema with a big 'wow' on my face. I will say that this is one of the best vampire film in a long time. I have to admit Let The Right One In makes a better date movie then those current vamps films like Underworld, Twlight etc. This the kind of film that reminds us of classics like Bam Stroker's Dracula, etc. The Romance here is beautiful. It's better than any of those romantic comedy coming out every month.The story goes like this, Oskar is a normal kid who is bullied by his classmates daily. He meets this girl, Eli, who juts moved in next to his apartment. They meet almost every night and soon have feelings for each other. What nobody knows about Eli is that she's a vampire. When Oskar finds out, he tries to protect her from what's coming next.Let The Right One In is beautifully shot and directed. It's a sweet romance story of a boy and a vampire. And a really damn good horror movie. Great job for the acting as well. Especially Eli cold stare which could send chills down your spine. The final scene in the swimming pool is just too beautiful to be describe.This isn't another vampire movie or another horror movie. This is an artistic, brilliant, beautiful, sweet, romantic, horrific masterpiece which is an instant classic. This is truly one of the best film of the year and probably the best vampire movie to come out in years.5/5 Stars",Let the Right One In
271,fionagreen1,This movie will stay with you for quite some time...,10,26 September 2009,"Yet again independent European cinema shows us why Hollywood shouldn't stand a chance.Whether you are a fan of the vampire genre, a tag I reluctantly hang from the toe of this movie, or not is irrelevant. For me 'Let The Right One In' is a dream-like tale of innocence, pre-pubescent awkwardness and the chance meeting of two individuals lost in isolation. It also, of course, explores the loneliness of the vampire mythology, an avenue not well-trodden.I feel sorry for those who approach the movie expecting their usual brand of capes and fangs. They're not going to enjoy this, which is a shame, because for once the vampire genre has something special in its cannon.SPOILERS AHEAD:Another aspect that probably turns people away is in the subtly raised questions that never receive answers; Hakan's sadly evolved relationship with Eli, the rings in the egg - a conveyor belt of previous suitors, Eli's genitalia stitched closed, her true intentions towards Oskar in light of her dommed relationship with Hakan...The first time I watched it I was simply captivated. The second time held far more poignance for me. Also having seen the dubbed and subbed versions I have this to say; the dubbing of everyone with the exception of the two leads is poor, although hearing Oskar and Eli in English, for me, allowed more time to study the visual acting on display.After reading some other reviews I felt compelled to tag on this additional point. I'm surprised at people's confusion over Eli's gender. She is female, but not a girl. She is an old woman trapped in a girl's body. This, I believe, is the point she is making to Oskar, not that she is simply a vampire.It's a sad thought that Hollywood is remaking this for the popcorn-munchers. Movies that are born in underground cinema shouldn't be thrown into the blinding lights.",Let the Right One In

At first you are cheering for him, than you are bothered by how real the violence is.Eli is the Vampire. She is repulsed by killing, but must do so to survive. She is unable to end her own life as it is simply too physically painful to go through with. Her condition comes at the terrible price of being an adult in a child's body.

The movie is presented in Sweden during the 80's, in a cold, dark winter environment in the suburbs of Stockholm.It has its flaws, but they are few. They are well covered up by the relieving and refreshing fact that no character is obviously heroic and good, nor is any character obviously evil and cruel. Nothing is white and black, all of them are in a grey zone, with their own reasons why they behave like they do, good or bad actions, depending on how you see it. Yes, there are actions performed in the movie that can be seen as both good and bad.The dark atmosphere is great, so are the performances. It's such a sweet, disheartening movie, that makes you feel sympathetic for and pity so many different characters. Like I said, one of the sweetest, goriest movies ever made.

276,ed_zeppelin,"""Are you a vampire?""",10,14 November 2010,"Let The Right One In, adapted from the novel of the same name by John Ajvide Lindqvist, tells the story of Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant), a bullied twelve year-old growing up in a dreary Stockholm suburb in the early 1980s. Living in a small tenement flat, sealed in by the permanent snow, separated from his father and alienated from his stressed, overworked mother, Oskar fills his time fantasising about taking his revenge on the gang of tormentors who make his schooldays a misery and by filling a scrapbook with news stories of gruesome murders. That is until, one night, a girl his age moves into the flat next door with a reclusive older man. Oskar immediately strikes up a touching friendship with the girl, Eli (Lina Leandersson), but can't overlook how strange she seems - she claims never to have seen a Rubik's cube and yet solves one without even trying; she only sees Oskar at night, who notices thick cardboard shutters going up in the windows of her flat; she claims not to know when she was born and casually sits around in sub-zero temperatures, barefoot and casually dressed, without showing any sign of being cold.This is an odd little film - one that I can say is a great horror film without being particularly scary. Whereas it's considerably less subtle English-language remake Let Me In made prominent use of CGI and explicit bloodletting, Let The Right One In never comes across to me as a film that's particularly interested in scaring its audience. A little like how The Ladykillers is still a great comedy without actually making me laugh, Let The Right One In takes a group of genre tropes and sets them to a different purpose. This is a film primarily about an impossible relationship between a morbid, weakly unstable boy and an ancient monster in the body of a child. Much of the additional detail in Lindqvist's novel is excised, particularly with regards to the true nature of Eli's relationship with her familiar, Hakan (Per Ragnar). The film therefore invites us to scrutinise both characters closely and question the nature of their relationship: does Eli genuinely care for Oskar, or is he being groomed to take Hakan's place as her new familiar? Can Oskar drop his old life so easily, and so young, if Eli requires him to? Let The Right One In's greatest achievement is in presenting these two characters so beautifully that you forget how insane and impossible their relationship is really. Oskar is morbid and obsessed with death before Eli comes along: just before he meets her for the first time, we see him taking out his frustrations on a tree in his tenement courtyard with a stolen knife. Significantly, while he acts out the murders of his bullies, his fantasies take their cues from the bullies themselves - he repeats their insults, mimics their methods and imagines them turned back on themselves. Eli challenges him on this later - she kills out of necessity, whereas Oskar genuinely feels the desire to kill out of anger and malice, even if he can't act on it. Of course, it's more complicated than that. It's more than a simple question of ""who is the monster really"", especially when the departed Eli - bound to defend her companion - returns at the end of the film to rescue Oskar from his tormentors once and for all in an absolutely breathtaking scene.Eli is just as subtly drawn. She herself is a tragic figure, sealed into her lifestyle just as helplessly as Oskar. She lives a paradoxically vulnerable existence - ageless, monstrously powerful and immune to injury, and yet would be killed instantly by sunlight, shows signs of decay very quickly once Hakan fails to procure a supply of food for her, and is unable to control herself in the presence of blood. Her pathetic existence is seen most clearly when she attempts to enter Oskar's home without being invited in, in violation of vampire lore; the result is an instant and horrific haemorrhage, only stopped by Oskar's intervention (cutely, Oskar's response to this is to lend her one of his mother's dresses to replace the soiled old one, and put a record on while she has a shower). The film does present a fairly straightforward check-list of vampire mythology and, while some notable elements are omitted, neither is there any real attempt to subvert the form where those elements that do appear are concerned. Hence, Eli becomes sealed inside the rigid and unbreakable rules that have come to dictate the boundaries of vampire fiction over the last two hundred years.That doesn't undermine her victims' own tragedy. The broken Hakan, unable to provide for Eli any more but loyal to the end, destroys himself in the most pathetic and undignified way imaginable. A woman, hopelessly transformed into a vampire herself by Eli, chooses death by sunlight instead of life as a murderess. Her boyfriend, who in investigating the mystery is doing nothing but the right thing, meets his own end as a consequence. We, as viewers, are not asked to condone these acts - but we are challenged by them. Can we overlook them, if that's what it takes to still buy into the central love story? Throughout the film, director Tomas Alfredson gives us a stark and oppressive aesthetic that perfectly matches the isolation of the characters. The lighting is glaring and unforgiving. The music score, omnipresent in the remake, is here sparse and understated; instead, Alfredson uses silence like a harness, holding the plot and the characters in their places. The end result is the best horror film of the last decade; it's also a touching tale of friendship to boot. Although, depending on how you look at it, it might not be that last one.",Let the Right One In

280,crustysaltmerchant,Unconscionable bore,2,6 March 2010,"I was really looking forward to this film after hearing lot's of good things about it. I was maybe expecting too much, first off let me say that good vampire films are few and far between, Twilight - Awful, New Moon - Awful, Lost Boys - Good, Bram Stokers Dracula - Awful, Hammers Dracula - Superb and so on. I sat down in the dark and started to watch, now the first thing that hit me was, and this may seem a bit xenophobic, the clothes and surroundings, it took me a while to figure out it was set in the 1980's. I thought maybe they were just a bit backwards. No caption had come up to explain the time period and so you're left looking at a rather ugly, emaciated child wearing brown flares and a blue jumper thinking are so it's like an inbred community thing going on. But that, my friends, is where it all starts to go down hill. The first MAJOR complaint I have is the truly awful, excrementally bad dubbing. It's as though they've stolen the soundtrack to a bad spaghetti western or an even worse 1970's kung fu film. The characterisation of the dubbing is just terrible and the literal translation of some of the dialogue is even worse ""the unknown man poured acid on his face making it really difficult for the police to identify him"" and that's from a newsreader! the second complaint is that the film can't seem to make it's mind up on whether it want's to be a horror or a social-drama/art house film about alienation. chose one or the other because the two do not make for easy bedfellows. long scenes filled with nothing but silence and intense looks do not make for scary horror thrills nor are they incredibly entertaining. Thirdly the secondary story concerning a group of alcoholics who gather in a scruffy diner is just totally pointless, it leads nowhere and adds nothing to the story. some of the actions of these characters are totally unbelievable and ruin any sense of disbelief. and last but not least the fourth and overall most important complaint, the two leads.

I must say that the film was not bad as I thought. On the contrary, I actually like the ""let the right one in."" It is a story about Oskar, bullied by peers at school, and an androgynous vampire named Eli. The story is, thankfully, not gory (Except for the ending) but quite bloody.The book I read, ""Let the right one in,"" is very dark and disturbing. I would advise anyone who choose to read it should be forewarned that it's not for the squeamish. It contains a graphic scene where Oskar sees what has happened to Eli when he got turned by a vampire who Let's just say was repulsive at the most and was the reason Eli was genderless (I did say it's not for the squeamish). There's also a scene where Eli's Caretaker Hakan tries to violate Eli. Thankfully, it's not in the film.I can sense that Eli is a vampire who didn't like being a vampire, is often times alone, and needs someone to help get him blood. Oskar is also alone, bullied quite badly by his tormentors, and his friendship with Eli is quite pure.

What follows is a magnificent smörgåsbord of modernistic Gothic horror, black humour, murder most foul, vampirism, sexual uncertainty, revenge and love that is seemingly - and may well remain - unrequited. Knitting the whole thing together is a minimalist - yet far from superfluous - dialogue. Words and pictures dance together forming an almost chemical balance. Sweden's far from friendly neighbours are alluded to as if they, like vampires, may not exist; an almost Chaplinesque sequence captures our hero and his mother brushing their teeth in unison; a camera pans silently on a wooden table; and ultimately, kisses signifying love that is deep enough to kill for are exchanged in a most unusually unromantic way. Music, mostly of a classical bent, is comfortably unobtrusive. In almost two hours only one scene (that of 'Ginia and the cats) grated with me, the rest of the time, due to excellent editing, passing almost too fast. As other reviews detail the synopsis, I shall say nothing more than that this is an intelligent, superbly crafted horror movie which should be seen by anybody with a love of good film whatever the genre.",Let the Right One In

285,david-phillips-4,p-u-s-s,6,22 March 2010,"**This review contains spoilers** Having recently watched The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo I seemed to be having my own Swedish film festival when I received Let The Right One In from my rental list. Let The Right One In is a very different animal to the mainstream detective/thriller of TGWTDT. It has the look and feel of a quirky indie movie, but it does have the sophisticated special effects that a horror such as this deserves. The story is of Oskar, a 12 year old loner who, whilst being relentlessly bullied at school, dreams of exacting brutal revenge. One night, new neighbours move in next door. Seemingly, they are father and daughter. She is Eli and she too is 12more or less. They meet at their building's municipal play area and cautiously hit it off. Whilst Oskar may seem to be a little eccentric, Eli is positively strange. She does not feel the cold, only comes out at night and smells funny; on top of that the old guy, Hakan, that lives with her (it is now apparent that he is not her father) is out and about town, slaughtering people and draining their blood. Eli is a vampire. Far from becoming a monster movie, this develops into a poignant romance between Oskar and Eli as they both have to come to terms with who they are and how they live. There is a true innocence to both of the characters that enables them to develop a touching relationship without it becoming contrived. There are killings and there are gory moments, but by and large this is a film about young love. So, when their relationship, and Eli's existence, is threatened, it is them that we root for; which is remarkable considering the horrific demise of Eli's victims. Vampirism is definitely shown here as a curse, but not one that cannot be worked around, as Eli is testament to. This is helped enormously by the unwavering devotion of Eli's guardian, Hakan, who somewhat bungles his way through a series of attempts to garner the blood that Eli needs to survive and pays the ultimate sacrifice. Oskar has his issues too. His involvement with Eli boosts his confidence and he does deal with the bullies, to a point; although this comes back to him tenfold in the final climactic scenes. Perhaps I read too much into a segment of the movie where Oskar is staying with his father and his father's friend comes over, but I detected an undercurrent theme of abuse at the hands of said friend, which took Oskar's life on to another level of sadness. The final scene which sees Oskar and Eli effectively riding off into the sunset led me to think that perhaps 50 years previous to this, Hakan was 12 years old and was devoted to Eli in the same way; in which case the cycle has begun again. This means that their love is ultimately futile, as Oskar will age and Eli will not. Although the movie has been critically acclaimed, I found the direction to be rather dawdling with far too many long cuts of skies, dripping taps, etc. While this might add to the indie feel of the movie, I saw no obvious reasons for the shots other than padding the running time. Let this not detract from what was a movie that will stay with me for some time. Apparently, a US remake is on the cards. I see no reason why that is necessary or how this would be adapted to suit an American setting, presuming that is their plan. Although with Gus Van Sant or Larry Clark at the helm, I could see the potential. www.writeronthestorm.wordpress.com",Let the Right One In
286,benjones-11,Doesn't work for me,4,15 January 2011,"The film is close to two hours long. During that time I watched the clock and wondered if anything was going to happen.Nothing did.O.k. Maybe that's being harsh. The film is, without doubt, exploring a fascinating avenue: mingling the evil of the occult and death with the innocence of childhood. The occult factor takes the form of Eli - a vampire who lives her life as a twelve year old girl and who is forced to fend for herself in the rather glum suburbs of wintertime Stockholm. She befriends a young child who is bullied at school and leads a rather lonely existence. The film centres on the friendship and the struggles of adolescence, love and being a vampire.The problem is that the movie attempts to be art-house. It indulges in long, lingering shots with very little occurring. These shots vary between close ups of the characters as they stare at various things, to wide angled shots of snow covered streets. I would like to say that the scenery is beautiful. I would like to ... but I can't. It mostly consists of red-brick cheap housing, sitting in piles of brown, slushy snow. I would like to say that the shots of the children are moving, but unfortunately they dwell for what seem like hours on a child looking gormlessly out of a window, or twitching and squirming in order to show that he is ""acting"" the emotion: ""self reflection"".What's more, the film is unrealistic to the point that bits become irritating. I'm not talking about the vampire element. I'm talking about the people who are supposed to be ""normal"". A man watches a child savage his wife and drink her blood. But (for no explicable reason) he takes her home, puts a bandage on her neck and then goes round to see a friend while he leaves her to wake up in bed. No police, no doctors. No reason. A child watches his friend lick his blood off the floor like a cat, while her face morphs into that of an old lady, and yet the next time they meet, he casually asks ""Are you a vampire?"" with the same slow, dull countenance he uses for every other scene in the film. I could go on.And furthermore - there are questions which go unanswered. What was the relationship between Eli and her carer? If she is capable of love then why does she do to him what she does, without even batting an eyelid? And what is going on with her groin!!!?

287,wolfcub7,Not like The Little Vampire. This's brilliance.,10,13 September 2010,"The translated title (to my mother language which isn't English nor Swedish) combined to the back cover text made this sound childish but finally I gave it a chance and found out this is the one titled ""Let The Right One In"" which had been recommended in serious vampire discussions and I was not disappointed.Films spoken in a language I don't understand much, usually don't hold my attention, but this one totally hooked me from the start. Interesting setting, constantly dark atmosphere, and this doesn't reveal too much about the characters or their lives, leaving deliciously enough to interpret and ponder after the film. And the actors are great.I fell in love with Eli and Oskar's dark friendship/romance that has a touch of pre-teenage sexuality lurking in there, portrayed in some elegant, sweet way. The fact that they are basically just children, made it all the more powerful. Well, Eli isn't actually a child though is anyway and it's shown well, but this film doesn't sugar-coat at all the fact that Eli's a monster. Yet this doesn't throw it at our face the way most gore-related movies do these days. At least I found the gory moments in this film rather dramatic and slightly scary, unlike in most films. And this film doesn't over-do how Eli suffers. They portray it perfectly well and in the right amount. There is nothing childish about this film. And to me this is so far the only movie/story wherein the vampire/mortal love story trick doesn't feel cliché, old and used and stupid. But rather the opposite. What I sensed about Eli's character and later turned out to be true, only makes it all the more unique and fascinating.The ending is surprising and dramatic. And very memorable. The very last scene crowns what I loved about the Eli/Oskar relationship.If this film has any flaws, I didn't notice them at the first view. Not that I even care if there is. This is an excellent movie. Especially as a vampire movie.",Let the Right One In

289,adamsoch-1,A brilliant film.,10,10 March 2009,"""Let the right ONE in"" is poetry on celluloid, it is one of those rare gems that comes along only once in a while. I am not a big fan of vampire literature, but this story is so beautiful and the film is so well done that it will hunt you for a long time. It will hunt you, I might add, only if you are open to non-conformist, exceptional and personal cinema. It was a small US release in 2008, and not surprisingly it was overlooked by the Oscars Group. Is it a horror film? It could be. A love story? Definitely. Thriller? Not really. It is a film full of surprises, enigma and metaphors. Especially, I love the brilliant music by Johan Söderqvis and the two fine young actors playing Eli and Oscar. The cat scene? Just have a great time watching it. The end scene? Always remember: what goes around comes around, but most importantly, as much as possible, or whenever possible: let the right ONE into your life. Simply brilliant film-making.",Let the Right One In
290,dalefried,Transcendence From Genre,10,30 November 2008,"A major issue with horror films is their inherently being trapped in some corner of the genre. Vampire films are to a degree less prone to this because they are almost always based in relationships. Their power at times depends on the quality shown in these relationships developing, both human and not.From the moment this film steps from the eerie softness of the snowfall, you know you may see something different if not extraordinary. This tranquility subsists throughout as you observe the evolution of one of the most interesting and provocative relationships you will ever witness in film. The subtlety and, yes, beauty of this truly throws you off bearings of any expectation.Then suddenly, in context of genre, horror explodes that both redefines and extends the vampire myth. Most importantly, it scares the crap out of you.The motion between these two moods really moves your emotions in ways you have not often experienced, almost never in a fright fest. Innocent sweetness. Sick pleasure in revenge. Longing remembrance of first love. Amazement at so simple special effects. An almost tear inspiring bloody kiss. Many others.It all works because of the wonderful story, amazing performances from two first time actors, cinematography that rivals that seen in Bergman, and direction that drives this amazing sense of continuity.I recently saw this film at a festival in Sarasota, FL. 28 films in seven days. I've Loved You So Long, The Wrestler, Waltz With Bashir, Slumdog Millionaire, The Class among them. This film was far and away my favorite and will end up somewhere in my favorite five for the year. I think that many film snobs like me who see this will be shocking themselves as they compile their personal end of year lists. Maybe end of year awards, particular considering the expectations of a genre that seldom delivers anywhere near the beauty you witness here.Not convinced yet you MUST see this film and not the likely beyond pathetic US remake already in the works. Any film that can have you weeping at closure with the decision by an innocent yet likely sociopathic little boy running away to facilitate the life of a timelessly young, lonely, and vicious vampire has taken you to a place almost sacred.

Innocent people are killed for their blood and small bullies (who certainly deserve a good whupping) are murdered as a gift. Then a small boy is recruited to be her personal butcher.Vampires are monsters and were usually portrayed as such and were vanquished in the end by ... us, real people. I know there are anti-heroes but they just don't go around killing innocent people. Dirty Harry didn't walk into a coffee shop, order a decaf and gun down the barista! When did we start backing them? It's like the Japanese monster movies where suddenly Godzilla was the good guy.Who are we supposed to be rooting for in this film?

292,Anyoneatnowhere,Atypical vampire movie,9,5 November 2009,"Even if you're not a fan of the vampire genre I would strongly recommend this movie. The vampire theme is actually quite subdued so that it feels like you're watching a movie about adolescence with a vague nod to vampire mythology.I think this will soon be considered a modern classic because of the way it portrays adolescent loneliness against the cold, bare backdrop of suburban Sweden - even though it seems like a strange, faraway land, we've all been there. More than anything, this is a film about friendship and acceptance with an undercurrent of the macabre as you find out more about why this vampire may be befriending a young boy. Oskar is a 12 year old with no friends who is bullied at school. His domestic life is not much better as his parents are separated/divorced and, as a result, he spends most of his time alone, collecting newspaper entries or playing with his knife. In fact, he acts out his fantasies with this knife, pretending to confront his tormentors.Then a new girl (Eli) moves into the apartment next door with a man. She looks androgynous but Oskar likes her anyway and, in typical adolescent male fashion, tells her she smells funny, acts tough and pretends he doesn't like her.There's not much more to it than that - this is a simple story. But the way it's told, the pacing and gorgeous cinematography all keep you invested as a viewer until the end, where you get a well-deserved payoff. There are quite a few scenes that you'll want to rewind and watch again because they're so outrageous and the ending is absolutely stunning. The gore is tastefully portrayed and the special effects are top-notch. But those are just cosmetic enhancements to an already beautiful movie and one you should definitely check out.Highly recommended.",Let the Right One In
293,Xcstacy,The Greatest Beastly Allure,10,12 July 2009,"When a movie is made last year, and is already topping most horror/vampire films of all time and has already been sold to Hollywood to make there own version(one of the fastest foreign films being recreated by Hollywood) you know you have something special on your hands.Swedish creator Tomas Alfredson finds the beauty in something so beastly and violent, and he does it in a way that invites you in to want to learn more and be a part of that life. This movie has surpassed all expectations and it has garnered much attention by word of mouth and will quickly spread across North America in due time especially before its American version counterpart is released.Finding someone such as Lina Leandersson will be a difficult task, she played this role to near perfection. Her ability to be inviting yet the ruthless killer due to her instinct is something mesmerizing to me even till now. All others played adequate parts in this movie and they did not overplay their parts as to take away from the dark atmosphere of the film. It did the book justice I just wish it went into Hakan's character a bit more but it did not take away from the film.The premise of this movie is about a young girl with what appears to be her father move in to an apartment complex and their neighbour is a young boy named Oskar, who is getting bullied by his classmates. He meets the new neighbour Eli who shows him that he needs to stand up for himself and an emotional connection builds between these two young couple. Oskar finds out that Eli is different but does that stand in the way? The movie was created on a very low budget but the story and the mood that is set throughout the entire film is captivating and pulls into the story so well that you forget how little this movie costs. I for one look forward for the remake even though I don't think it will ever do this justice, I still always applaud most remakes for at least trying.10/10 ~XTC",Let the Right One In
294,masakiuma,Overrated vampire film with some really uncomfortable romance,6,23 June 2010,"It is basically a vampire movie which is hailed as one of the ""best"" ever. I respectfully disagree, but I'll get to that later. It is about a young boy who is constantly being harassed in school. A mysterious girl, and someone who appears to be her father, move in to the apartment next to his, murders start to happen all over, etc. The girl is a vampire, of this there is never any doubt in the viewer's mind.So what did I think of it? First of all, let me get this off my chest: I HATED the main character. Not just because he was a wuss that let the other kids walk all over him either. Something about his face...that super white skin, platinum hair, and the REDDEST natural lips I have ever seen. Every time he was on-screen I wanted to join the bullies who were punching him!! Next, I know there is supposed to be something ""beautiful"" about the romance that develops between the two leads, but really it was terribly uncomfortable to watch two twelve year olds be all romantic with each other.Maybe I'm missing something here, because critics and viewers alike couldn't stop praising this movie, but I didn't think it was anything special. More heart than ""Underworld,"" more action and maturity than ""Twilight,"" but it didn't really meet in the good middle for me. Would I watch it again? Sure, but I can't guarantee my opinion would change Final Score: 6/10",Let the Right One In
295,MichelleAudrey,Watch this instead of Twilight please (or the Hollywood remake!),10,25 November 2011,"Given the recent hype of Stephenie Meyer's 'Twilight' series, 'Let the Right One In' provides a more realistic vision of vampirism as it still exists today. The two main characters are both endearing yet unsettling in their own ways. Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant) a bullied twelve year old boy and Eli (Lina Leandersson) a twelve year old (albeit, she's been twelve for a long time) who must drink blood to live, are joined together in what seems to be a journey to save each other from their alternate worlds.The film is startlingly blunt in its depiction of murder, particularly when Eli's father (Per Ragnar) ventures out in the night to murder young boys in order to draw blood and bring it back to Eli. The act of hanging the victim from a tree upside down and slitting the throat to tap blood alludes to ancient vampiric lore whilst the scene is set in physical contrast against a background of pure white snow. Although the actual slitting of the throat is mostly guarded from view, the sound is an art in itself as it allows for the viewers imagination to conjure an image for themselves.Unlike 'Nosferatu' or 'Dracula', this portrayal of a vampire who does not wish to go out and kill of her own accord, unless she has to, is a challenge for the viewer. The fact that she appears as a child but is evidently much older also allows for empathy with her plight. Leandersson plays the part naturally, and effortlessly oozes an aura of suffering balanced with the knowledge that she possesses great power. Oskar is also intriguing, as he strikes a solitary figure throughout the film until he begins to fall in love with Eli. His constant torment arising from the bullying he receives almost daily is quenched by his encounters with Eli, this most peculiar of girls.The film has a number of outstanding scenes which are notable, especially for the cinematography. When Eli's father is about to be discovered and arrested for murder, in desperation he disfigures himself with acid that was about to be used in the process of killing a victim. Eli later visits him in hospital and there we see the results of his attempts to kill himself. The scene is shot beautifully and perfectly encompasses the father's last few moments of desperation and pain as Eli draws his blood and allows him to drop the seven floors from his hospital window to the snow-covered ground. The audience witnesses his death from his daughter's perspective. For Eli this is yet another reminder of how alone she is in a world where fear of the sun, food and the need to be invited into a room are all isolating factors in her existence.One of the final scenes is, in my opinion, the most impressive. In order to torture Oskar for retaliating against a bully, the young boy is held underwater for three minutes by the older brother of one of the bullies. As he is submerged the viewer is taken underwater with Oskar and there we hear the sound of shattering glass accompanied by the vicious decapitation of one of the bullies and the murder of the perpetrator holding Oskar beneath the water. Eli rescues Oskar as she had promised him she would and the film is brought to a close with Oskar trainbound and Eli hidden in his suitcase.Overall, the film is well-made, a characteristic that may seem simple but appears to have been overlooked by some contemporary film-makers of the Hollywood bourgeosie. 'Let the Right One In' is a refreshing take on the vampire film. It is comforting to find a story that can portray the traditional vampiric lore through a contemporary setting, whilst remaining eerie and seemingly untouched by the Hollywood treatment of vampirism. Thus, it is advisable to see the film before Hollywood attempts a remake!All Rights Reserved © Copyright 2009 Michelle Lacey (Michelle Ní Láitheása).",Let the Right One In
296,GRWeston,Only the Lonely,8,17 November 2015,"Let the Right One In is advertised as a vampire movie, which is understandable since Eli is one of the best portrayals of a vampire in movie history. She exemplifies the classic vampire rules such as immortality, vulnerability to light, a need to be invited inside a home before she can enter and of course an appetite for blood. Even so, the true horror of this movie is not vampires, but loneliness. The young protagonist, Oskar, defines loneliness: he has no friends, absent parents, is constantly tormented by bullies, and to make matters worse, he lives in an isolated apartment complex. He becomes friends with new neighbor Eli, a relationship that initially provides hope for his desperate situation. However, as their friendship develops, it reveals that Oskar may develop a blood lust to relieve his solitude in the same way that Eli's relieves her hunger. The movie is set in the '80s, presumably to avoid adding cell phones to the plot, but Let the Right One in is very much a horror movie for our times. There have been too many accounts lately of young people like Oskar who tried to escape their loneliness by harming themselves or others. While the movie portrays such horror, it also provides a solution to it. It may be less frequent if more people confront the lonely and isolated in the same way Oskar first confronts Eli by trying to understand them first and judging them second.",Let the Right One In

After the first Twilight film (which was not all that bad), the second one was a torture by any standard, and I actually could not muster the courage to see the third installment. However, this Swedish vampire flick was a very pleasant surprise to this genre of films, and also had a unique twist to it.Without giving away too much away, this movie captures the romance between a young boy and a young girl (who is actually a vampire) quite well. The relationship between this so – called young couple is captured in quite a unique, and at the same time – a tasteful manner. The cinematography and visuals are very good, although the film may seem to be a bit slow at times.In a nutshell, this one is definitely worth a watch (if you don't mind watching movies with subtitles).

There are SOME impressive visual moments, allowing the visuals to tell the story, but there are also at least 4 non-action scenes where the director and makeup artist seem to have a fetish for keeping blood and snot on the character's faces for minutes on end. Many reviewers claim this is ""beautiful"" and ""realistic."" I ask: What is beautiful and realistic about a boy and a girl with blood and snot on their faces?

300,bain0038,Let's remake this excellent movie?,10,15 December 2008,"At it's worst ""Let the Right One In"" is far too subtle and slow and nothing like typical horror movies, (if it should be considered one.) At its best its one of the better films we've seen in the last decade. As a foreign film it should see wider American distribution and publicity than any such film since""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""Our hero here, who is just twelve, is so perfectly likable and so well played he is the sort of boy you'd want to raise, or the sort you'd want your child to end up with. He's richly contemplative and caring, lonely, but not broken, cool, but not pretentious, precocious and yet without arrogance. Who knew that he would fall for a vampire?It's a story more like ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" than "" The Lost Boys."" It's more about asceticism and existentialism than blood and gore. I won't give any details away, but this film is neither convoluted nor cliché. Sure, it's not amongst the best stories. It's not a formula film, but it's intelligently written and doesn't start anything it doesn't conclude, (well not too much).Beautifully shot in a snowy and desolate Swedish town, the film very much carries on a world of its own. The film as an entirety is subtle, even slow. Likewise the effects are far from showy, making tasteful use of CGI with kitties or watching our vampire climb seven stories.The sound does not rely on a creepy score, nor attempts a hip or ambient soundtrack. Instead, it successfully amplifies the sounds of its fictional and isolated universe, (which is far away from reality and amid somewhere in the early 1980s.) For the most part we only hear what the characters or the world around them, gusts of wind, the brushing of teeth, The Clash. Though most notable is all of the silence, all of the stillness that creeps about keeping the viewer mystified and engaged.What the film does is allow adequate time for the viewer to develop a consciousness about the situation of the story. It allows us to make our own determinations without being told what to conclude. Throughout the entire movie I could only count one legitimate flaw, a tiny divisive issue, which I'm sure was mulled over by a brilliant director and screenwriter.It certainly won't be for everyone. It's not for those who can't read. It's not for kids. And it's not for those who can't bear non-traditional story telling. For me, the film was a breath of fresh air in an increasingly tiring and rehashed film industry. At least this film is rehash of a different kind.This film should have seen a slew of Oscar nods and it seemed to me this film could have had a wide release. Nevertheless it will turn out to be a classic.",Let the Right One In
301,crey014,"Generally moody and calm on its almost 2 hour running time, audiences will be spellbound if not disinterested.",8,24 July 2008,"Thematically rich ""Låt Den Rätte Komma In"" hits refresh on the vampire genre with an interesting outlook on character and its development. Casting is accurate although out, as even with the sinister events, performances are played with such convincing skill that its subtext is never overshadowed. Generally moody and calm on its almost 2 hour running time, audiences will be spellbound if not disinterested.Film follows the empathetic and anemic looking Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant); desperate for friends and also revenge on bullies who mistreat him in school. Main protagonist eventually meets with the mysteriously charismatic Eli (Lina Leandersson) who slowly unravels herself as a character of the dark. Events transpire that further cements an unlikely friendship of sorts, leading to a very bloody finale. The film is no doubt not for the squeamish as even with the abundance of tender scenes between Oskar and Eli, violence is still undeniably present which is depicted in either a repulsive or comedic light.Archaic monsters have always been an allegory towards a more imminent threat, like Romania's Dracula for Eastern Europeans immigrating to Western Europe, threatening the economy. In Tomas Alfredson's modern twist, Eli's fangs are treated as if it were of biological origins, which need a treatment that may pose morality questions. Her paternal figure becomes the film's tragic core as he emphasizes the depressing lengths he would go through to sustain Eli's thirst for blood. Although played as if he was paternal, further reveals later would show his function was to foreshadow the main protagonist's future removed from this micro cosmos.Also interesting is Alfredson's play on the sexual identification of the creature. All femmes become fatales in one way or another, whilst male characters turn into almost bathetic who are never snapped out of a hypnotic spell. Also seen in Almodovar's ""Hable Con Ella"", technique adds a level of sophistication to the proceedings and further enriches their characterizations.As with old Hollywood's Dracula, Eli is perfectly portrayed by Lina Leandersson as she not so much carry the entire film, but devours the role. Shiny eyes not seen since Puss in Boot's ""Shrek"", she gains easy support from audiences just from her look alone. Perfectly matched with Kåre Hedebrant, leads instantly become characters worth caring about, that even the murders that conspire become a necessity.Set in Scandinavia, film reminds of ""30 Days of Night"" as it's filmed as if it never sees the sun and is forever winter. Of course, this works well with the illusion of having the main character as someone who would burst into flames if UV rays touches her skin. This, among others are the film's small touches that further cement the mythology on vampires and adds some more, even. Cats provide a darkly hilarious spin as the film reaches 30 minutes before the credits.""Låt Den Rätte Komma In"" is indeed an enjoyable intimate celebration of loneliness and the things that transpire from it. Setting it with a vamp angle further uplifts the thematical significance of the film, although even if they exist, picture doesn't pretend to be more than it actually is. Conceived with a specific audience in mind, the curious would also be rewarded. Film often reaches subliminal moments that will live long in the memory.",Let the Right One In

The adult world fails to contain either the horror or the love that the vampire child creates and fails to be anything more meaningful to the living child (Oskar).

Altogether touching and extremely sharply written; this will definitely stay with you for days after viewing. It says it all that the backlash felt when a Hollywood remake was announced just a week or two ago - by fans and critics alike was so eminent. That seems to me to indicate that even within such a short course of time, this has acquired a cult status.Finally, be warned that their are two subtitles versions out there - The 'standard' and 'theatrical' release. Standard is a dumbed down version, with liberties being taken and the meaning diluted. In other words, it assumes you as the viewer is a little on the 'slow side' lets say.

I loved it...the story...the acting...the places where it was played...the props...everything! The little actress Lina Leandersson played it beautifully and superbly! I like her looks too...she's a very cute young girl...with lovely smile! She was perfect for the part, as she has that androgynous look! The actor Kåre Hedebrant work was OK...when he was in the pool I thought he was drowning, he looked like a ""fish out of the water""! He also had a dialog mistake when he met Eli in the park, but that's the director's fault that let that error pass! But overhaul, it was OK! And to those frustrated ones that think that this film is child porn, or underage nudity, you are really stupid: To begin with...they are the same age! If you had a girl friend that came to sleep in your bed during the night at that age, you also would say ""come right in""! Secondly...it's a movie...not an illegal child porn video (there is no sex, nor even the suggestion of it, and they were not forced to do it)! About the pubic scene...remember...that's part of the story...I even doubt that it's the actress' nude pubic zone, they must've covered her crotch to hide her vagina slit in order to make it look like it was a boy with his genitals severed - you can see the scar (story that you'll find in the book and not in the movie)! That will be my next buy...if I find the damn book! I saw the movie without reading the book, so I didn't get disappointed, I advice you to do the same in order for you to be surprised even more when you read the book! On the romantic side of it...oh man...that is the dream of every young teen...to find a girl (or a boy) to love forever (you also get that feeling in ""Bridge to Terabithia"" for instance). It's an hymn to teen innocent and pure love, and also friendship trust! My favorite scene is when they have that bloody kiss, right after she killed the man that was going to kill her! We are very used to have Hollywood's view of vampirism and vampire movies, but eastern Europe movies are so much earth like (Nightwatch is also a great movie)! See Twillight for instance: typical rich teen vampire movie that saves the poor human defenseless girl! We never see the other way around...always is vampire boy loving human girl! I was quite happy to see this movie doesn't follow Hollywood's profit example of a ""knight shinning armor"" vampire for teen girls to sigh all the time for the cute hot actor that plays 1st role!

It passes no sense of fear or horror or even sense of metaphysic. Just a little girl and her thirst for blood (which in lots of parts reaches the bounds of humiliation). A young boy trying to find himself among other classmates isn't enough to build a scenario. Neither does a girl who by the way the director doesn't even bother to explain to us how the h..l did she end up in that city. Or why she does not know what love is even if she lived over several years. To end up, this movie was at least awful, underestimated my knowledge and unfortunately wasted my time.

309,ProfSpielberg,"The anti-""Twilight""",8,16 April 2012,"Not a ""fun"" horror movie by any stretch--this is more of a feel-bad heartbreaker not for the whole family. Haven't seen the U.S. remake and indeed can't think of any American film with such a range from sad to strange to disturbing, or sometimes all three at once. The setting is an especially bleak corner of 1980s Sweden, putting you into the appropriate dismal mood before much screen time has elapsed; the infrequent bits of comic relief nearly seem accidental. Dialogue is very slight and there were a few nagging points never filled in. On the other hand it has so many unpleasant plot turns already that not everybody can digest them in one sitting (I couldn't, and had to go for a quixotic pause after around 40 minutes in).The only big false note to me was the build-up to the penultimate, semi-absurd scene before the closing shot, because a) enough horrible things have happened by now, one begins to feel they're laying it on a bit thick; and b) it ends up contradicting a fundamental of the female lead established quite powerfully in the beginning: namely, that she's a weak, tragic outcast--akin to Oskar in a superficial sense-- instead of a traditional movie-monster vampire. Still, the whole performance by Lina Leandersson is the phenomenal quality of this production, simultaneously frightening and pitiable, and seemingly so self-tormented (Alfredson deserves a lot of credit for not surrendering to a simplistic resolution of that question). Considering the screen actresses who go their entire careers without a role this distinctive I can only imagine her typecasting quandary now. I would be remiss not to also mention Elif Ceylan here, who provided the character's eerie, threatening voice that's profoundly creepy no matter which languages you understand. If you make it to the end of this one you'll certainly never be able to forget young Elli.",Let the Right One In
310,anjru,A Most Unconventional and Satisfying Film by Andrew Malekoff,8,11 January 2009,"Let the Right One In is a most unique film about early adolescent puppy love between a sweet and oft bullied boy and his new neighbor, a 100-plus year old vampire that has occupied a 12 year old girl's body. They are kindred spirits, both lonely, misunderstood and seemingly adrift, searching for meaning and, in their own ways - blood. I really liked the pacing of the film - some that are used to bang-bang-shoot-em-up flicks might say plodding, but for the patient film-goer I say - just right. The boy, living in a single parent family with his mom and with periodic contact with this dad, is the target of a cruel group of classmates led by one particularly vile and sadistic punk, whose even more brutal older brother gradually emerges from the shadows as the drama unfolds. The girl lives in squalor with an old guy who she probably has more years on despite the contrast between his aging body and her youthful shell. He is charged with getting fresh blood for her. But, he is a clod and blunderer (there is a sort of slapstick to his shtick) and he cannot consistently deliver, leaving her to seek her own sustenance in very dramatic fashion. As the two protagonists become great pals and a little more, their secrets are revealed to one another and the story builds to most imaginative and satisfying conclusion. I won't give it away by saying more. If you are adventurous, see this movie that you won't soon forget...PS. I just learned that they are already planning a remake of this fine Swedish film, for the audience that cannot be bothered with subtitles I presume. What's that old cliché?: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.",Let the Right One In
311,rlipton,"subtle, cold, complex, very very Scandanavian",9,23 November 2008,"the dressed up poodle sitting in front of the aging boyfriend of the vampire as he drains the blood of some poor kid he's strung up is simply too cool. The fact that the aging boyfriend accidentally tips over the bucket of blood and runs away through the pristine winter forest was a great overture. See this movie, lots of issues raised, love, bullying, tragic love, (the aging helper boyfriend). The director captures urban, crappy winter Sweden very well. The cinematography is beautiful and witty. The dissipated lives of the middle class, estate dwelling neighbors and the emotionally deadened parents seem like a worse fate than going steady with a blood sucking adolescent. Another cool thing is that the vampire parts of the movie are mostly just glossed, a quick cut to her climbing up the side of a building, or breaking the neck of one of her victims, she dismembers the bullys, but we just see the aftermath, one kid being dragged across the surface of the pool, (she clearly had to be flying).",Let the Right One In

Great cinematography though, I'll give it that. Moreover, the dubbing in English was awful. The acting from the kids was okay but the plot was insane and I never felt like there was any twist contrary to the popular opinions I read. Funny that despite those deaths (just because a little girl needs to drink blood, her father kills people and finally gives up himself), the cops never show up. And wow!

314,gcastles-35417,A masterpiece of 21st century cinema,10,31 August 2016,"When I told a friend that the only good vampire film was The Hunger, they told me to watch Let The Right One In. I dispute the horror tag given to this film, rather I see this as a love story between two children where one of them happens to be a vampire. Of course, that means this will not be everyone's cup of tea; and I've had friends who were unable to sit through the entire film because of the violence. But for anybody who isn't put off by the blood lust of a preteen vampire, the rewards are many. The cinematography is spectacular, with the usual bleakness of the Scandinavian winter offset by clever use of sunshine creating luminescent scenes set in icy woodlands and atop frozen lakes. The performances of Lina Leandersson (Eli) and Kåre Hedebrant (Oskar) are outstanding, conveying both innocence and yearning for relief from the lives they find themselves enduring. The occasional glimpses into the darkness tormenting Eli and the intense loneliness Oskar endures show us why the two are drawn to each other, the tenderness of their friendship acting as a refuge as chaos unfolds around them. This is a great story, perfectly crafted, and is certainly the best film I've seen this century.",Let the Right One In
315,Lenoir-2,Would have been great on fast forward,5,25 October 2009,"Maybe I'm showing my American nature (bigger, faster), but this movie was so ungodly slow that it was almost impossible to sit through. There is a good movie here. It has an interesting premise that speaks of a very sad deeper meaning. In that way, it was a lovely film that showed the interactions that a vampire would have to have with the mortal world around her. However, the LONG stretches in between what I suppose should be called plot points (though I'm grasping at straws here since plot points are supposed to progress the plot) are tedious with no other purpose than setting a somber mood. Yeah, I get it. Somber. I don't need ten minutes of a child walking in snow to get it.The interactions between the two main characters are interesting though I found the boy to be very off-putting with his sociopathic personality. Unfortunately for the film, this is just about the only plot that is worth caring about.There are some gem moments in the film making itself. Attention to detail was paid by the film-maker and that is always appreciated. The vampiric subtleties like movement and eyes were done very well. I liked the camera and lighting work. The music was also appropriately cheerless.My main beef is that this movie is so boring. It could easily have been a ten minute short and felt just as satisfying.",Let the Right One In
316,ArthvrPendrag0n,Probably the best vampire movie I've ever watched.,10,15 May 2020,"The vampire genre is a very peculiar thing, it's in a certain sense very easy to write a vampire tale, due to how well known the vampire myth is, but the real challenge is to give it depth. What a lot of authors don't seem to realize is how deep the creature known as vampire can be, which I'm glad to say it's not the case in this movie. This is a vampire tale with depth, with substance, and with a tone that seems like it was tailor-made for fans of the genre who for long awaited for something familiar but at the same time genuinely authentic - something truly artistic.The plot revolves around Oskar, a boy who suffers on the hands of his classmates, but is unable to retaliate, and Eli, a girl, who just moved next door. Eli is a vampire and she depends on her guardian to feed, as she cannot expose herself. At first Eli states that she and Oskar cannot be friends, but later on she opens up to him and he finds comfort in her presence. Oskar is a boy with a supressed anger, he's someone who's fascinated with the idea of getting back at those who do harm to him, but he's unable to do so. Eli, differently from Oskar, is someone who's capable of doing whatever she must do for her well being; her violent nature, as shown when she kills a man, contrasts with the fact she's after all just a child - which reinforces the idea that vampires, due to their supernatural existence, are forever bound to be dislocated from the rest of the world. The interesting thing here is that what brings Eli and Oskar together is the fact that both lack a sense of belonging, despite the fact that one is human and the other isn't. Eventually Oskar hits back due to Eli's advice to do so, and upon doing so he seems to find release - which could also be seen as the ambiguity of human nature when it comes to violence, proving good and evil are more complex than often displayed. Actually, from the very beginning we see Oskar collecting pieces of journals concerning violent crimes, showing that the idea of violence lingers on his mind constantly despite his non-violent personality.Usually children are viewed as only capable of doing good, but here we have two kids who swing between good and evil. Oskar learns through Eli how to get his revenge, he finds the strength to do so in her. Eli, as she gets closer to Oskar, seems to be more human than what's expected - she displays a certain loneliness, which can be spotted more explicitly when she asks Oskar if he'd like her even if she was not a girl. It's interesting to take in consideration that Eli in fact is not a girl, but she's not a boy either - as it's shown in the scene she's changing - but another way to see the fact that she's not a girl is because a vampire is not a natural thing, it is not human and therefore doesn't exactly needs to be labeled under human standards. Oskar is also a lonely boy, he doesn't really have friends in other kids and the adults around him don't seem to be realiable enough. So we have here two kids who share a common loneliness, both in a certain way standing apart from everyone else. Another interesting point is that when Oskar, still unaware of what she is, asks Eli if she wants to be his girlfriend and she says she's not a girl, he doesn't really seem to change his mind, confirming what he had told her when he said she would still like her - I guess this could be viewed in a objective way in which he accepts whatever she is to his human perspective of people, but also as a foreshadowing of him accepting her once he discovers all there is to discover about her. Later on when he discovers that she is in fact a vampire, and still sides with her, is the third time he accepts Eli - this time being fully aware of all that she is and all that she isn't.Good and evil are things that are inherent to every person. Some of us do evil things, but are not evil as a whole, and some of us can be good but are not necessarily good people. The thing is good and evil are mixed in our ways of living and we can't see things as only black and white, sometimes things are grey. Oskar upon figuring out Eli is a vampire seems a bit reluctant to approve of her ways of living, but she manages to show him his own hypocrisy. Eli kills because that's what she must do, whilst Oskar would kill for revenge if he had the chance - both are capable of evil, but for different reasons. When Oskar helps Eli kill a man to save herself, good and evil are entwined - he makes his decision to accept it, he accepts that good and evil need to coexist. Oskar loves Eli, and she loves him, despite everything, which proves that in the end there are complexities to good and evil and more often than not you need to have both in balance; the fact that a vampire, a killer, is able to feel genuine affection for someone goes to show that there's much more than wrong and right, good and evil, feelings are complex and exist beyond certain rules and expectations.The tone of this movie is perfect. It's a quiet movie with some gruesome moments, but the latter do not break the immersion. The realistic, almost peaceful, tone of the story is captivating. When the night falls and Eli's guardian was collecting blood, making another victim, she was peacefully interacting with Oskar. It's interesting the way it's executed, the horror part of the story is subtle and feels much more dense, much more believable than if it was trying to be shocking. The shots are beautiful, wide and kinda bleak in their own way. I said before that it's believable, and that's a strong point because I feel like a vampire tale benefits a lot from the somber feeling - a feeling that everything happening is being concealed, happening in a world of darkness that envelops the natural world.The ending was very positive, left me satisfied with what I had seen - although I was also left wondering what would happen next, naturally hoping for the best. I like how every scene seems so carefully woven and inserted one after the other, the pace is so natural. You can feel a lot of sensitivity was put into creating the bond between characters. When Eli enters Oskar's home without being invited, risking her own life for it she proves that the bond between them is strong and real enough to the point she will put herself in real danger for him and his shock after seeing her bleed shows that, despite anything, he really doesn't want her to be harmed . In the end we see a conciliation between a supernatural creature and a human, they contrast but they also blend with each other. Good and evil blend with each other.I watched this movie more than once and it doesn't feel any less perfect time after time. It is a masterpiece of the genre and in my opinion it's the perfect example of what a vampire movie can be if it's allowed to be more artistic, more poetic. Through a mix of horror and romance, this movie invites the watcher to look upon the nature of good and evil, and gives a lot of space for our own personal reflections.",Let the Right One In
317,inspektorr,Best vampire movie ever made.,10,20 January 2009,"Having just seen glimpse of the movie via the trailer, I was definitively intrigued. But boy, was I in for a surprise... This is one of those movies that slowly suck you into their world and then simply blow you away.Since so many others already outlined the plot, I'd just like to add that to fully understand this movie, you really need to pay attention to delicate details and dialogs... or you might just miss those important bits that set the ""background"" of the characters, and end up with many ""whys"" and ""hows"". This is especially important in parts that describe the relationship between Eli (the young girl vampire) and her deeply troubled caretaker.If you were to take out the vampire theme, this would still be a masterpiece in describing the good and the bad, as well as deep love and violence we're all capable of inflicting upon someone else - even as children. The fact that the story is told through the eyes of a 12-year old boy, in that horrible age that you're no longer a kid and still not a teenager, is what makes this movie so powerful. It helps keep things simple and clear. There are no grand schemes, no masks to drop, there's no faking - that's all reserved for the world of grownups.

THE best vampire movie and probably the best movie I've seen in a few years. Actually it is much more than a vampire movie, with equal parts coming-of-age, revenge and love.Cold, quiet and depressing, yet really touching with many scenes that stick with you. The two lead child actors are just amazing. They're able to convey so much just with expressions and movements that words aren't even necessary. I could watch the ""come in uninvited scene"" alone over and over again. Another fine point is the way some things aren't spelled out directly for us, allowing us to interpret as we see fit, as in the final scene. The filmmakers allow you to end it the way you feel it should.For the gore-hounds, the grue is here as well, but it's more tasteful than there for sheer shock value (though it's well appreciated in the final scenes, that's for sure!). I'm trying to remember the last time I've seen children killing and being killed on screen in some fairly graphic depictions and it's definitely escaping me. This seems to be a taboo subject in American films, but I glad for the open-mindedness of others as it works in the context this film.This is a movie that you will constantly be thinking about after seeing it and that is definitely the sign of a memorable piece of work.

Just because there are vampires and people die in a movie doesn't mean this movie is a horror film. Twilight was honestly scarier than this garbage. Furthermore the dubbing was cheaply done. Now I know dubbing isn't the perfect solution to foreign films but try to get voices to fit the characters, a boy shouldn't sound like a girl and all the characters shouldn't sound like this movie was dubbed by only 1 person. The plot is almost nonexistent. So there's a boy, he meets a girl who turns out to be a vampire and the end. Seriously why is this movie getting good reviews? Is it because we all secretly love child pornography? That's right, ever wanted to see a 12 year old's vagina now here's your chance. Just skip well into the movie so you don't waste your night away. And yeah I get that the character is supposed to be a castrated male but they never got around to filming that scene (idk the word for that in Sweden but in America we call that laziness), but the character is played by a girl and that's her vagina on screen.

320,scottemery,Somehow finds a way to link a violent horror with a love story that you can't help to connect to,8,16 September 2013,"The first thing that struck me about this film is the colour pallet and the styling of the surroundings. Its very dark with most of the film being set at night and even in the day the bleak Scandinavian snow almost looks darker than it should. This adds to the feeling of isolation you get from the protagonists life. Oskar is a young boy with few friends and not much to help him at home. His parents are split and though they are friendly they seem preoccupied and do little to help Oskar with his bullying problem. The first few scenes really set the tone for the movie as we watch Oskar stabbing a tree with a large knife, miming what he would like to do to his bullies. Soon into the film we see the second main character walk into Oskars life, Eli. She arrives in a taxi with an older man and they both move in next door. She talks to Oskar one night while he is out pretending to stab his bully and says they cannot be friends but soon enough they start up a friendship. The two leads do a fantastic job of portraying two young, shy friends getting to know each other and when it becomes more supernatural you can see that they have really thought about there roles and show skill in portraying what feels like realistic reactions to their situation. The other actors also do well as they add to the gritty feel of the town whilst also giving a larger feel of isolation to the children as they go about there ""important"" lives. The amazing thing to note about this film though is the perfect mixing of two separate stories. On the one hand you can say it is a Gothic, gory horror with some good set pieces and some scary scenes and on the other it is a love/friendship story between two 12 year olds. It seems like a hard job but you really do get the two distinct sides of the story done very well. There is no let up on the horror and yet they somehow have moments of genuine affection seen between the characters which really get to you. There's not much you can say against the film and the feel of the film is what astounded me the most. You somehow find a way to connect with these two characters, pushing past the supernatural to the real heart of the story which is the finding of some love in an cold, isolated town. There is one thing i'd like to mention about this point though. There is a part of me which thinks whether this vampire stuff is all part of this boys imagination. You can see that he has an obsession with crime and then all of a sudden this girl turns up and kills these men gruesomely and helps him with his bullies. I'm unsure about whether I'm right or not but you can understand him adding this little bit of the supernatural to escape his reality.",Let the Right One In
321,TheGonzoJoint,"Sorry, ""Twilight"". Your fame just got snowed in by this cold, touching, and beautiful film.",9,2 March 2011,"**** out of ****Even if ""Twilight"" seems to be most popular when it comes to Vampires in any form of media, it's good to get a nice, big breath of fresh air. And for me, that refreshing, long breathe was ""Let the Right One In""; which by all means is the best Vampire movie since probably ""Vampyr"", ""Nosferatu"", and Herzog's remake. This is a moving, artistic, and powerful film that does not succeed because it is about vampires; but rather because it is sweet, tender, and even funny at times. This may seem like an odd blend (especially for a vampire movie), but I assure you that it works. I would have to say that there are a lot of people who just don't like vampire movies, and that's perfectly understandable. Crap like ""Twilight"" has taken over the world for the worst; and has since rendered teenage minds useless. I admire this film because it is not aimed at teens; but rather at adults. It is indeed about two twelve-year-old kids, but the plot that is involved is way too complex and emotionally resonant for most teenagers to understand. But my point is that even if you don't like vampire movies, and as long as you're an adult; I would recommend that you watch ""Let the Right One In"". It's about as bloody and as painful as a vampire film should be; and shows the emotional and physical burdens of a bloodsucker. I admire this film's cleverness; and its accessibility. It's easy to recommend, and it's also easy to love. I found the film just about as touching and deep as it wanted to be, and while the pacing is rather slow, it's good enough for me. You can tell so easily that this film wants to be art, and it's one of those films that never feels pretentious. Some people fail to see the greatness in the film, and that's OK. It took me one viewing to love the film; and another to really appreciate it for what it is. This is among the best Swedish films ever made, as well as one of 2008's best little gems. You can't miss it if you're a cinephile, or someone who just likes a great movie in general. The film is spooky, scary, tender, and unique. It could even be called beautiful, and not much vampire films can be called that. It's a special movie; probably amongst my favorites. It could even be my personal favorite vampire movie as of now, although then again there are always those classics that linger in the back of my mind. But this is the best modern vampire filmmaking has to offer, and frankly; it doesn't get much better than this. ""Let the Right One In"" knows just how awesome it is, and that's what I like the most about it. The film may not be for everyone, but since there's so much awesomeness contained within, why complain?",Let the Right One In

323,BenjAii,"A dark dark tale, masterfully told",10,10 November 2008,"So many people reviewing this film on IMDb seem to focus on the sweet friendship between it's 12 year old human and vampire leads. While this is a huge element of the film, this is a sweet story of childhood friendship in the same way 'The Godfather' is the story of a fathers concerns and worries for his kids; both true descriptions, its just that you would be missing the point if you came away from either film thinking that is what you had seen.In truth, 'Let the right one in' is about as dark a film as you can get, and its a measure of its brilliant story telling that having seen it a week ago, its disturbing echoes have stayed with me and refuse to go away.It's also one of those films best enjoyed without prior knowledge, but impossible to review properly without disclosing plot elements, so be warned - SPOILERS AHEAD.As another comment here has said, it's the character Håkan that is the key to this story; for at the end of the film we are led to believe Oskar is stepping into his place. It is that fact, revealed in the final scene that gives the film its dark and nightmarish core; the blossoming friendship we have been witness to prior to this will offer no redemption to Oskar if this is path his relationship with Eli takes.Håkan butchers boys not much older than Oskar as food for Eli. In this story, where the storytelling is of the highest order so many of its darkest whispers are just that, hinted and suggested at. Questions are alluded to that play on the mind, but are never answered. Why does Håkan pick these victims ? presumably they are Eli's preference. What does that say about Eli's interest in Oskar ? What is Eli's true nature ? She has been twelve ""for a very long time"", but we briefly glimpse her true physical age, in fact she is in late middle age; roughly the same age as Håkan. Her gift to Oskar in the films last moments; the brutal slaughter of his child tormentors. Entranced in her glamour, this makes Oskar happy, but how can this be happy or good ?And then they go off happily into the sunset, Oskar presumably to be deadened to the soul destroyed husk of a person Håkan had become, butchering his fellow humans to provide Eli with food. You can see why I am puzzled when people think this film is sweet. In fact its conclusion is utterly chilling; Oskar has happily swapped the commonplace misery of childhood bullying for a fate that will truly be hell on earth and you know as he happily smiles in the films last shot that he doesn't have a clue.None the less, it's superlative and a film I would heartily recommend. Like the greatest horror tales it succeeds by suggestion and playing on the imagination.

326,Mick-Jordan,Wonderful film,10,16 July 2009,"""Let The Right One In"" has been variously acclaimed as 'A Chilling Fairytale'; 'Horror film of the century'; ""Unforgettable Cinema""; ""Instant Classic"" etc. and apart from the last which is a contradiction in terms deserves all the acclaim. But it is much more than just a horror story, more like it is a coming of age story of first love – with vampires. Oskar is a lonely outsider, all but ignored by his separated parents and bullied cruelly by his classmates. When Eli and her 'guardian' move in next door his interest is piqued by the fact that she never goes out by day and the windows in her flat are all blacked up. For her part Eli is drawn to Oskar although at their first meeting she tells him ""We can never be friends"". Meanwhile her guardian is out hunting for Eli's latest feed, a batch of fresh blood.While there are a few frightening moments in the film it never sets out for cheap shocks. When Eli suddenly attacks one of her victims from above it isn't just a sudden ZAP! and she's in but rather a silent swoop from the sky making the scene all the more chilling. The horror of this story is in the setting not the action, it is in what Eli is rather than what she does. She is neither the Gothic nor glamorous vampire we are used to but rather a frightened little girl who will never grow up. When Oskar asks her if she really is 12 years old, the same age as him she replies ""Yes, but I've been this age for a long time."" As the couple are drawn more and more together their need for each other and their tenderness with each other becomes all the more heartbreaking because it is so inevitably doomed. At one point Eli leaves a morning note for Oskar in her flat advising him of all the usual precautions to take, don't go into her room, close all doors, keep out all light etc. and finishes with ""I really like you"". I wasn't the only one in the cinema who suddenly had something in his eye at that point.Eli is played by Lina Leanderson and Oskar by Kare Hedebrant who both give perfect performances by virtue of the fact you don't notice they are giving any performance. They are completely natural on screen which is just as well as they are in nearly every shot.

328,mbuckingham-1,Let The Right One In *****,10,20 April 2009,"I'm sure my readers will appreciate that I rarely give a movie more than 3 stars, and this is only the 4th time in my blogging career that I have given 5 stars, so I'm sure that you will understand that this movie must be some great revolution in the history of movie making... in fact, I would venture to say it is very nearly the ""perfect"" movie...It was with great anticipation that I went to view this movie, after reading that nearly every reputable movie magazine gave it a 5 star rating... I knew for certain that I was in for something amazing! I had to travel a little way as my home cinema wasn't showing it, but it was well worth it, and I would recommend it to all of my readers, even if you aren't a fan of the Vampire genre! ***Synopsis***Oskar, a bullied 12-year old, dreams of revenge. He falls in love with Eli, a peculiar girl. She can't stand the sun or food and to come into a room she needs to be invited. Eli gives Oskar the strength to hit back but when he realises that Eli needs to drink other people's blood to live he's faced with a choice. How much can love forgive? Let The Right One In is a story both violent and highly romantic, set in the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg in 1982.Written by John Nordling, Producer Starring: Kåre Hedebrant, and Lina Leandersson Directed by: Tomas Alfredson ***Fantasy Take*** Excellent fantasy movie, yet not too weird as to alienate the average viewer...***Storyline: 5 Stars*** Brilliant story, based in a perfect fairy-tale style, simple and easy to follow, yet leaving you as if you had had the most filling meal in your life! ***Graphics: 4 Stars*** Hey, it's not really that kind of movie, but for what it is, the graphics certainly do what's needed of them...***Acting: 5 Stars*** O just perfect actors! Especially the little girl (Eli), who was both sweet, but still quite freaky at times! ***Music: 4 Stars*** Excellent music, though I would have liked a catchy theme tune to hum on my way home...***Emotions: 5 Stars*** Excellently emotional throughout, I was completely wrapped! ***Conclusion*** Well, in conclusion... It's basically perfect... need I say more?",Let the Right One In
329,bloodweiser1,A Classic,9,4 August 2009,"Touching, moving, enchanting, atmospheric, haunting and dare I say it, beautiful. Can this really be a vampire movie?Let The Right One In is the story of a young Swedish boy named Oskar and his new, mysterious friend Eli, who just happens to be ""The Vampire Next Door"". To begin with the movie concentrates on Oskar's loneliness and frustration and then moves onto the relationship between the two main characters and their desperate attempts at surviving in a bleak world.I started to write a plot synopsis about Let The Right One In but quickly realised that I don't really have the literary capabilities to aptly describe it. A quick review couldn't even begin to do this movie justice - there is a sense of depth that can only be appreciated by viewing this masterpiece. Yes. Masterpiece. I've always been set against the cliché (as I see it) of calling cinema ""Art"", but this definitely is art in it's purest sense. In my book, art not only has to be aesthetically pleasing but it has to make a lasting impact on one's emotions and I believe that this movie certainly fills that criteria.I'm a fan of neither ""foriegn"" movies with subtitles nor the vampire genre but quite simply, Let The Right One In isn't your average vampire movie, and it's so engrossing that (if you're like me) you forget that it's subtitled and just go with the flow. As many have said in other reviews - don't wait for Hollywood to corrupt this as they inevitably will. Don't settle for second best. Go for perfection and purity and watch this movie in it's glorious original form.",Let the Right One In
330,Teeny1589,A horror that makes you care!,10,6 October 2020,"I have just watched this again after 10 years. This is such a good movie. One of the few modern horrors that actually make you CARE about the main characters. Don't expect non stop action, murder and gore. It's not that kind of movie. It's dark, quiet and tense. Highly highly recommended. (Just forgive the very dated CGI cats in one scene)",Let the Right One In
331,villanwilson87,A classic Vampire film,10,15 December 2009,"Many vampire films over the years have become worldwide and incredibly 'cheesy' (shapeshifters?) pictures, where instead they should be horrifying and original. This is what Let The Right One In is because it tries not to be a horror film, where instead focuses on a love relationship between the vampire and the human. These characters are both wonderfully played by Eli the 12 year old vampire (Lina Leandersson) and Oskar the 12 year old boy (Kåre Hedebrant).The story is set in Sweden 1981, in the beautiful western Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg, where it is delicately cold with the snow falling everyday and where Oskar lives with his Mother in a flat where his parents are divorced and he is harshly bullied nearly everyday at school. Until Eli moves in next door to where Oskar lives, and the relationship bond begins between the pair of them. This is beautifully told where they connect through various scenes, e.g. A Rubik's cube, and one very intense, terrifying, but at the same time strangely touching scene of a classic vampire myth on what happens when you don't invite a vampire in but they cross the threshold anyway? It's a very groundbreaking scene but that sets the tone to how incredible this film really is. Astonishing credit must go to screenwriter John Ajvide Lindqvist, who adapted his own book, and directed expertly by Tomas Alfredson as to the endless new possibilities for the Vampire fork-lore that nearly 90 years after Nosferatu there are still new twists to the most familiar of all movie monsters, instead of (in my opinion and I hope many others) the Twilight Saga & even the daft T.V. Programme True Blood.The film then follows Oskar being encouraged by Eli to fight back against the bullies at school, which in-turn only escalates the situation to a quite unforgettable ending of how far these two are willing to go for each other, especially in a bravura long-held, underwater shot which is easily labelled a, ""How-the-hell-was-that-done?"" talking point after you've got over the impact of its gruesome content.A devastating, but yet an interestingly uplifting in-human drama that is a majestic genre picture, which excels and is the best foreign film I have watched since Pan's Labyrinth. It shows that this film will not be as successful compared to the biggest grossing Vampire film-Twilight, (although U.S. rights to this book have already gone to Matt Reeves of Cloverfield and being filmed for a 2010 release) but proves that it is the small foreign based films over the years who get the critical praise and influence it deserves over the 'Hollywood style blockbusters'. This deserves to win 'Best Foreign Language Film' at next years Oscars, and will be very surprising if it doesn't even get nominated. Watch It.",Let the Right One In

333,uncertain,"Why, oh why?",1,8 November 2008,"I hate to rate this poorly - this was a pretty good movie. It's a refreshing break from the usual vampire movies that are loaded with special effects - guns, explosions, monsters, etc - and instead does tells a story more focused on the characters and their interactions.This is a love story of sorts between two pre-teen kids, one of whom happens to be a vampire responsible for the recent string of gruesome murders in an otherwise quiet part of town. The meek and helpless boy-next-door first befriends and then falls in love with what turns out to be a pre-pubescent vampire.There's one scene that absolutely ruined an otherwise good movie for me, and I just can't imagine what a director was thinking when he threw it in. Hell, I can't even imagine why he would have filmed it. I think people need to be warned, hence my review. I think it's odd that not one person in three pages of reviews mentioned this or finds it disturbing.There's one scene where, after a kill, Oskar is helping Eli get herself cleaned up and changed. He's spying on her while she changes her clothes, and the camera cuts to what Oskar sees, and the audience is given a full-screen shot focused on a 12-year-olds' genitals.If nudity in a movie is both tasteful and in some way contributes to the plot/storyline, then it's not a big deal. But this one shot fits neither of those categories, and this one shot ruins an otherwise enjoyable film.",Let the Right One In
334,retasulover,Bound To Be One Of The Greatest Swedish Films,10,24 April 2009,"I have to admit that when I first heard of this movie from my stepmother who had rented it at our local video store, I was a bit skeptical, as I had never heard of it before. When we popped the DVD into the machine I had prepared myself for a lousy television movie. The movie basically grabbed that thought, and shoved it down my throat. I was absolutely blown away by this film. None of us had even guessed that it would be a foreign film, but it was. This was the very first Swedish film I had ever seen, and I am very glad for that.Let The Right One In is a shining light in the dying world of horror films. What it gives you that makes it better than most modern horror films, is that it gives you more story than mindless blood and guts. In fact, there's hardly any gore in this movie at all, until the very end at least.This film pretty much shows that great child actors are all over the world, not just from the U.S.Kåre Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson give such beautiful performances as Oskar and Eli, a young boy who is repeatedly tormented by bullies in his school, and a 12 year old female vampire who offers her friendship to Oskar.It is pretty much a no-brainer that the love story in this film between these two star-crossed souls, wipes out Twilight without a trace left. This film provides a touching love story, but with a fittingly dark atmosphere, instead of mindless mush and romance, which is pretty much all Twilight was.The developing relationship between Oskar and Eli from friends to being in love is delivered at a wonderfully realistic pace, with a good share of realistic hardships that they both must help each other face: Oskar's bullies, and a vengeful man out to kill Eli for feeding off of his best friend.The storytelling, atmosphere, setting and music (which is orchestrated beautifully, with a good share of 70's Sweden-Pop) all give Let The Right One In an enchanting and haunting atmosphere that will suck you in and make you a part of. This movie is THAT involving and good.The very, very ending scene is especially heart-warming for me, as it shows a lone Oskar sitting in a cabin on a moving train, accompanied only by a large luggage crate, wherein a Morse code message for ""Kiss"" emerges, to which he responds the same in Morse Code. That is just beautiful to me.For those who wish to receive a true treat in film-making from Europe, Let The Right One In is the ticket for satisfaction. You will most likely enjoy it as much as I have.",Let the Right One In

I saw this last night after waiting and waiting for it to get to my video store, and since viewing it, I can't stop thinking about it. It makes me so sad to think that the little boy Oskar is going to eventually be the pathetic old man that was Eli's ""father"" in the movie. The ""father"" was once young and virile and, since only human, he aged and weakened, whereas of course Eli did not. What a wasted life. I loved this movie; my husband hated it. And what a waste that was when Eli's father killed that young man in the beginning to drain his blood for Eli, and then he had to leave him there to avoid being caught. The young man was killed for nothing---Eli didn't even get a meal out of him. Isn't that a horrible way to think? But it's kind of like when someone kills a deer: if the deer at least provides a family with sustenance, it has a purpose. If the deer is just killed for no other reason than sport, it loses any dignity and purpose. Am I twisted? So is the movie---a little.",Let the Right One In

You can see my video review of this if you would like if you don't feel like reading this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhLCZWkNGh0ANYWAY. There is a reason why this movie is so good. It's simply because it's not a horror story. Yes, it does have horror elements to it by being very violent at times and of course containing vampires. The story is a very sincere tale of pre-pubescent childhood. The story centers around Oskar a young boy who is lonely and confused. And the only connection he can make with mankind is something that is NOT human. The movie takes a huge look at the lonely feelings we all deal with at certain times in our lives. And the attributes of the story are never told dull at any given moment. The film keeps you wrapped up in it's mystery, fantasy, and it's emotion. This is just a solid film full of great directing, acting(EVEN FROM THE CHILD ACTORS) and writing. I could go on and on about this film but why should I? What can I say? YOU must experience this film. And a last I will leave this review by saying that any teen, adult, (this maybe a bit far fetched) but even kids will feel much more connection with the characters in this Vampire flick than something like Twilight.

The kids who played Oskar and Eli have done really well in bringing out the emotional exchanges and bond between the characters.

So if you are a lover of vampire movies and want to see a fresh take on the same, this is a must watch But if you are a movie lover and watch movies on merit and not on herd mentality, you will want to kill yourself and suck your own blood after watching this movie. In fact my guess you may start getting that urge somewhere after the first 30 minutes. The movie starts with a promise no doubt but along the way fails to arouse anything within you. The acting is pedantic, the screenplay is meandering... all in all it is just chewing gum which just goes on and on without being swallowed or spit or giving any taste or stimulation.1 star, because IMDb forces me to give some stars.

it is different, it does not need a lot of action because that's not the point of the story and should not be an important part of this movie. 
when there is action it's because the situation leads to it, it's not free and there just to give you cool things to watch, it's there to make the story prove it's point and bring you to the level that what being with that girl is. it shows you what she is and how being around her is a amazingly huge thing and heavy with consequences.
the US version has some good situation but again it's not telling a story but more showing action and focusing on that Chloë Grace Moretz, i can't stand her anymore.
the US version has more likes than this version but if you've watched this version you probably think it's better like me.

341,rickyscouture,Interesting. Flashes of brilliance. Way incomplete!,5,30 May 2015,"For all of the ""10 Star"" ratings this film's received from other viewers, I truly don't think it carries the the depth or the consistency to really deserve anything above a ""5"". Although I definitely liked the style and simplicity of it, at times it's almost too simple and the lack of dialogue (especially strong dialogue) makes it somewhat disengaging. I wouldn't quite go as far as to say it's boring, because it isn't, but it is a bit empty.There are also just too many points during this film where you're stuck asking questions that don't ever really get answered. The plot centers itself too much around small moments that don't add up to a complete film and, although that can seem magical or brilliant in some films, in this one it doesn't. It feels very unfinished.There also is a complete lack of a supporting cast and the only two characters who are even mildly interesting, in my opinion, are the two main characters; Oskar and Eli. Everyone else seems like they've come straight from a 1980's Stephen King shoot, which almost just splits the movie in two. There's the scenes with Oskar and Eli, and then the other scenes which are either corny, irrelevant, or both.Overall it's not something I'd strongly recommend and I certainly don't see myself watching it again in the future.",Let the Right One In
342,kirkintha26,Not a Hollywood vampire flick.,9,17 November 2008,"I really have a split decision on this movie. Sometimes I felt there was a lack of back story to help bring key plot devices home and sometimes the pacing was a little awkward and mis-timed. Sometimes, I wanted a little more from the camera angels, a little more flow to the scenes. The camera was very minimal in this movie and sometimes it takes away from the scene.BUT! Mostly I think this is a mesmerizing tale of boy (Oskar) meets Nosferatu (Eli) and falls under the spell of it's vampiric charms.What I liked about this movie is that it intentionally did not do the ""trying to scare you"" bit - you know, the quick cuts and the loud music that makes you jump out of your seat. That bores me to death anymore - I'm so desensitized to the Hollywood process of smash and gore, that I think it is why I respect the film making so much. If you want smash and gore, the ""Saw"" series is a better choice.This movie is simply not an Ann Rice novel clone - this is not supposed to be Interview with the vampire 2, or Blade 4, or Underworld 4, or other films that toe the ""par for the course"" vampire movie of erotic sex and ultra-violence. I do like a good vamp flick, but I have been looking for something that just does it differently in the vampire genre: and this movie is it.This movie is incredibly internal - and since I saw a sub-titled movie - I really can't comment on anything other than the plot. I think the acting is good, Oskar and Eli especially. But, I don't understand Swede, so I can't tell you if the acting worked.What I can say about this movie is this: most vampire movies have to fall back on the T&A factor (beautiful men and women covered in blood, screaming) to over compensate for a simplistic plot - and this movie takes a simplistic plot and adds many subtle layers for you to decipher. This movie is not for children and early teens, it is meant for adults who are tired of the same old vampire shtick.",Let the Right One In

344,coolrobbie,All the Superlatives are Deserved,10,19 March 2009,"After having heard and read reviews and comments about ""Let the Right One In"" for months, and being unable to find a local screening when it arrived in the US, I was eager for the DVD release. The day I picked up my copy, a huge banner near the checkout stand touted the upcoming DVD release of ""Twilight."" I couldn't help but compare the two a bit, considering their seemingly parallel material. Let's just say that, after finally watching LTROI, I can confidently say that it's the ""anti-Twilight."" And that's a compliment.Plot synopses are given elsewhere, so I won't bother too much with those details. But, yes, there is a vampire, and yes, there is a certain amount of on-screen bloodletting, as is required by this sort of movie. The brilliance of the vampire aspects of LTROI lies in its construction of classic vampire-movie elements -- the vampire's assistant, the fate of those bitten by the vampire, the attempt to destroy the vampire in its lair, the reaction of animals to the creature. Vampire-movie lovers will not be disappointed in the least by this film.But, as has been said in other reviews, the film ascends over and above a simple genre picture, due to the relationship between the two principal child characters. The actors depicting these roles are, to put it simply, astonishing. How the director, Tomas Alfredson, managed these performances is a wonder. Of special note is Lina Leandersson, playing the pivotal role of Eli. With her expressive eyes and older-than-her-years face, she is perfect in this role. You won't find a better child performance on film this year.The central relationship and its tensions will be familiar to anyone who remembers the awkwardness of early adolescence, the pain of being an outsider, the blossoming of a first love. You may actually find yourself shedding a tear at certain points, unusual for this ""type"" of picture, to say the least.I cannot commend highly enough virtually every aspect of this film. Cinematography,casting choices, score, direction, art direction, script -- all excellent. When the final credits roll, you may find yourself in stunned silence. This would be, I think, an entirely appropriate reaction.There are some moments that are not for the squeamish, so be forewarned. However, some of what could have been the more grisly moments are handled discreetly off-camera, making the impact even more pronounced.Pre-teen females will probably not seek this film out, form fan clubs and put posters of it on their walls, as they do for an afore-mentioned movie. Except, perhaps, for a certain type of pre-teen female: paler than most, usually seen only after the sun has set, able to complete complex puzzles with ease. If you don't know that type, pick up a copy of ""Let the Right One In."" Once met, she will remain with you for quite some time.",Let the Right One In

Oscar gets bullied at school but finds friendship in Eli who lives with, i suspect, another young boy she befriended 45 years ago. The movie throws up some wonderful extra-movie plot stuff, well at least for me. It doesn't rely on gore for entertainment and, as with all decent movies, it doesn't need it. I like the direction in this movie particularly, the camera shots set the mood perfectly in every scene. A film about friendship, innocence and love. Well possibly, it could easily also be about manipulation, survival and resentment towards ones self.

346,dreamtrove,Vampires for social commentary,10,10 October 2010,"The film is slow ""creeping dread"" horror more on the level of Cat People, or the early 80s horror films than it is on a typical monster movie. It's subdued, subtle, and substantive with social commentary on the potent current problem of bullying. It's not strictly speaking a vampire movie, it's a movie with vampires in it. The acting is superb, as is the writing and direction, it's just all around impressive.It's hard to write a review for this film without an extreme spoiler. I have not yet seen the American remake yet to see if they picked up on it, but *SPOILER* I'm not actually going to tell you specifics about what the spoiler is, but I don't think you should read this paragraph if you haven't seen the film. The film contains an aha moment that suddenly makes you realize that maybe the film was not quite what you thought it was about, and nothing was quite as it seems, and that it was filled with clues all along, something along the lines of the sixth sense or the usual suspects, and I'm not talking about when you find out one of the characters is a vampire. If you reach this point (I got it about five minutes before the end of the film, so I felt slow) the story is suddenly much much scarier. If you feel there was an aha moment on this level, that's probably because you missed it. Enjoy your happy life, don't go back looking for it ;) When I see ""Let Me In"" I will see if it is still there, and while I would like this aspect of the film to remain, I would rather that it disappear than to have an American director hit us over the head with it.",Let the Right One In
347,richrodi,his film manages to explore a very unique distant world of the supernatural without having to directly explain it,9,16 November 2008,"Let the Right One In is a film that represents the interesting perspective on what it might be like to be a lonely child vampire who happens to be a Swedish murder machine. Let the Right One In explores the virtuous nature of isolation in the face of an ever-growing fever of paranoia. The film's setting is that of a bleak Swedish landscape in the late eighties. The not so distant Soviet Union is often talked about through the conduit of radios and serves as an encroaching force that is ignored by the local residents of this small town.The town seems to exist in a perpetual state of darkness. This eternal night scenario is perfect for the pedophilia like nature displayed by the vampire's manservant. This manservant acts as an interesting catalyst for much of the films events due to the fact his primary function of nurturing the vampire is completely interrupted by his idiocy and incompetence. Wondering why he can't seem to ""get it up"" he goes through his last licks of life unable to fully achieve his goal of self-fulfillment in the eyes of his innocently seductive young master. The prize for his loyalty is his death in the form of a consumable meal for the vampire child. Once his life is extinguished the young vampire advances on the young boy whose name is pronounced Oskar. Oskar is completely vulnerable to his external elements. His peers delight in his swine like completion. Interestingly Oskar has a violent side to his distorted angelic face. He delights in the destruction and is equally attracted to the possibility of dismemberment and human causalities. In one particular scene Oskar responds to a question relating to the circumstantial evidence of this person's demise. He is qualified to answer this proposition because of his obsessive collection of newspaper clippings. Due to his isolation with his uncanny abilities he is quickly alienating by his classmates and is tortured throughout the course of the film. This torture comes in the forms of verbal abuse, whippings and beatings. Of course this conflict is resolved by the friendship gained by a new girl who is equally complex and isolated. Oskar's parents are divorced. Living away from his father gives Oskar feminine qualities, which are juxtaposed against the dominant tomboy attitude of this young girl. This young girl exclaims without hesitation that she is not a girl. She is quite literal in her own assessment because she is really a boy with his penis removed who also has inherit ability to suck blood and destroy the lives of anyone she seems to come in contact with. She dislikes her own condition and finds a small amount of solace in this young fragile boy. She seems to stalk him. We see her cat like eyes prey on this young man's emotions. She is quick to offer him assistance. She is also quickly taken by his charismatic charm so they decide to go steady with each other. Obviously this steadiness is quite complicated; with her lack of genitalia and the ability to age. Despite these bizarre circumstances their relationship is extremely innocent. Oskar first hand views the young girl's ability to annihilate life. He remains very calm despite these drastic scenarios. He adopts an attitude of a much more conservative nature towards her advancements of extreme violence.In one scene we see the playground bully's return to exact their revenge on poor Oskar. Oskar taking the initiative to further his own self-images decides to tone his body with weights and swimming exercises. The bullies arrive in the form of archetype interlopers who demand revenge for Oskar's previous transgressions. His late night swim is interrupted by the threat of his eye being cut out. Before these heinous acts could be executed his fellow vampire bodyguard quickly dispatches Oskar's transgressors. The perspective throughout this aquatic scene expands on the vision that this elderly child has the inane ability to end human life. Oskar relieved of his problems in the form of decapitations decides that this new friend is worth keeping. In this instant these two isolated worlds of questionable homosexuality and blood sucking delight are merged and these two distant individuals understand the hardships of such a lifestyle. Vampires in appearance usually carry an aesthetic of opulence and charisma like the character of Dracula. The vampire in this film displays opposite tendencies in the form of visible imperfections and destitute attire. Her appearance relays the information of her obvious internal conflict of loneliness. She is unable to find a person who understands or accepts her flaws as both a human and a vampire. Oskar tries and ultimately succeeds in showing her his acceptance in terms of their isolated microcosms. This film manages to explore a very unique distant world of the supernatural without having to directly explain it. Let the Right One In tells a Romeo and Juliet story of the supernatural where the different parties deal with the harshness of the environments they are thrust into with the mutual acceptance of their obvious flaws.",Let the Right One In

Very believable; the steely knife pulled out of a jacket while he's half naked in the pool. The author/director could clearly feel Oskar's fear. Truly inspiring! And even though you see that Eli collected Oskar from the beginning, it feels okay. They needed each other.The lady bursting into flames was interesting. That was the only part that made me laugh in a ""fonzie just jumped the shark"" kind of way. But when I think of it overall, I think that this scene is okay now.

I, for one, am a great fan of foreign film, in fact, i think it's better than all this mainstream crap you get down in Hollywood nowadays, so that's why i loved watching 'Let the right one in', every single second of it.The cinematography was artistic and outstanding, the acting (especially the children) was jaw-dropping, the direction was near perfect, and on top of all that the storyline was the best, most immense vampire story i have ever seen on film.For every fan of European cinema, or for anyone looking for something beyond your average, cliché-ridden horror film, choose 'Let the right one in' You will not regret it!While your here, why not check out my own movie and see what you think, just click the link to watch it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftnsUZRD-o0",Let the Right One In

These peole come along a film like this and think that because it is different (in a bad way) but nevertheless because they see it's different, they think that it is the next best thing because they equate different and foreign to mean greatness.

It has the gore and blood you would expect of a vampire flick in spades, but it gets tedious quickly and wasn't even particularly scary - we see the human side of the characters early on and it doesn't generate the tension and suspense that many other horrors rely on.However, seeing glowing review and glowing review, I thought i'd give it another go. And how wrong I was. For one, the chemistry between the two leads is phenomenal - powerful, intimate and authentic, you come to root for them more than they do for themselves. It's hard to believe Eli, in particular, wasn't even a teenager when this was filmed. The plot is fairly simple, but the narrative weaves together seamlessly, carried by the excellent all round acting and the quality of the writing. The pacing, likewise, is actually a big part in why it works so well - from the sumptuous cinematography, Oskar's slow breathing to the slow drip of blood down Eli's face, everything builds to the most equally uplifting and gruesome, as well as mesmerizing, conclusion.It's probably a bit misleading to call it horror - its more a teen-love/drama/ bully revenge film with vampires and lots of blood, but there isn't really any discernible trait that marks it out as such a marvelous piece of film making.

Moreover, the cinematography and atmosphere in this film are undeniably superb. The chemistry between two preteen protagonists is outstanding and very believable. Everything in this film is well-made in synchronization. This is the first film related to a vampire that I think is least connected to Vampire's teeth baring at audience all the times, like other familiar horror we used to see. Other than some gory scenes in this film, we can yet see some flesh and blood moment of humane Vampire. And that is truly written to the core plot.The last scene at swimming pool is totally mesmerizing and mind-blowing.By the way, if Sweden submits this movie to be in competition with other nominees around the world for Oscar foreign-language film category this year, this masterpiece should win or at least be short-listed for the final fives.10 out of 10",Let the Right One In

357,scrbblr,Sweden -- a nation of gentle dimwits,7,21 February 2009,"A few things this movie teaches us about Sweden: Swedish adults are a gentle, dim-witted breed with an average IQ of 70.They don't react overmuch when their suburb is the scene of a gruesome murder... or two... or more. As one reviewer put it, ""The townspeople seem just a bit too sanguine about having a mass murderer in their midst."" You think? When murders occur, they don't call in the police.In fact, there apparently ARE no police in Sweden. You can start killing off the inhabitants one by one and the rest will continue to go about their daily business. Murders -- even murders in which the victims are butchered and drained of blood -- get headlines in the local papers but are not, it seems, investigated.When an adult Swede witnesses a gruesome murder from his apartment window, he just watches in silence and then broods about it for days on end. He doesn't go to the police.When friends of the victim learn that this man has witnessed the murder and hasn't gone to the police, they grumble a bit in a mildly Scandinavian way, but they don't yell at him, or argue with him -- and they don't go to the police either.(Sorry, I forgot -- there ARE no police.) When, after several murders, a Swedish man sees his wife attacked outdoors and knocked to the ground by a young vampire girl, he boots the girl off, then attends entirely to the wife, not even looking up, allowing the girl to leave the scene.The corridors of Swedish schools are pretty much deserted. The same goes for Swedish hospitals.Swedish boys of twelve are able to slice their own hands with hunting knives without flinching, and then to watch their blood drip onto the floor while smiling sweetly.Despite the way it taxed my credulity, I enjoyed this unusual movie. I thought the two strange, spooky, taciturn young leads were terrific, and I'd certainly like a mysterious dark-eyed waif like Eli for my special friend and protector. But as I said to my date near the end, ""Who'd have thought that Swedes could be so creepy?""",Let the Right One In
358,kevi_kevi,Let this right one in,9,22 January 2010,"Poignant. The first word that popped into my head after watching this film. It left me thinking a lot afterwards, I wasn't quite sure if I liked it or not for about an hour or two, but one thing's definite in my mind during that period of time: it's a masterpiece. It doesn't matter if you decide to love it or hate it, at the end of the day it's brilliantly shot, the characters were efficiently portrayed, and the story line's just simply haunting. In some sense it's a love story in the purest form, that between two innocent beings, that surpasses age and gender; it's also a story about survival in a world where you don't fit in; it's a story about searching for the end of solitude; and it's also about fighting, be it for survival, or for acceptance or attention. It's a layered story that can be dissected and analysed in great details, and still be able to survive the scrutiny. It's amazing how this film about the relationship between two pre-teens (around 12, 13 I think?) actually managed to portray a much, much deeper relationship with a much higher maturity level than that between two teenagers (yes, I'm talking about Twilight). Read the book if the film left you confused, it does explain a lot about the background of the characters.",Let the Right One In

So good that if we were to find an alien race and we wished to demonstrate for them a human beings attempt at true art, this movie would be a top contender. Let The Right One In is a wonderful expression of genres in an amazingly dark horror mystic that refuses to be categorized. Some may class this as a horror but the only scares are through the power of the story that's all about relationships. The depth and brutality of the story leaves a strange uplifting feeling followed by a tinge of sadness, it's that clever. The movies finale is astonishingly well shot which is only fitting with all that goes before it and surely puts the movie right up there with all the great vampire movies ever made. LTROI, like Eli asks of Oskar, fights back against all of the Hollywood regurgitation over the years. A fantastic dark horror that's overshadowed by a lingering disturbing love.

360,ridingjunky,Right when I thought that Vampire Romance was a lost cause...,9,10 June 2012,"I stumbled upon ""Let The Right One In"" while flipping through channels late at night. While every ounce of interest that I once held for vampires died the moment I grew a brain cell and stopped loving Twilight, I had heard some great things about this film and decided to give it a chance.At first I just sort of had it on in the background while I did other things, but was soon entranced by the gorgeous visuals. The wintery paleness of the setting swallowing up the colorless Oskar beautifully reflects the pain of a young boy who is beaten and taunted every day of his life, but can't find the strength to fight back. It also serves as a stark contrast with Eli - the dark circles under her dilated, sad eyes and the crimson blood smeared around her lips revealing a girl who can never fit in.Apart from that, I really enjoyed the fact that it was in Swedish. It's really nice to have a break from our dumbed-down language once in a while. Now, I admit that sometimes I find foreign films hard to follow subtitle-wise, but the dialogue in this one is so simplistic and succinct that I hardly even needed the subtitles to understand what was going on. It also helped that it was so beautifully acted all around, but in particular by the two young leads. Each of them emoted genuine passion, innocence, and sorrow so subtly that I forgot that they were even acting.What I loved most about this film is that it was so much more than an artsy vampire flick. Instead it focused on more relatable themes such as coming of age, standing up for yourself, and unconditional love. I was also grateful that it didn't try to sexualize vampires, but instead depicted them as disgusting yet tragic monsters. It was especially heartbreaking to see this in the form of a twelve year old girl doomed to fight to maintain her innocence while having to commit unspeakable crimes in order to stay alive.I could ramble on longer, but I don't want to ruin anything for you - assuming that you'll do what any sane person would do and see this a.s.a.p.

361,jk384-949-142166,Just beautiful...,10,18 March 2014,"'Squeal like a pig. So, squeal' is the macabre first line and it sets the tone for the film. Not only is Let The Right One In one of the most original accounts of vampires ever put on screen, it is also a ferociously beautiful and self-contained work of art.Oscar (Hedebrant) is a child bullied at school, who imagines ways of getting revenge on his tormentors. In Eli (Leandersson) he finds something he has not had before, a friend Let The Right One In details the growth of their friendship. It is predominantly a film of juxtapositions. Blood and ice. Love among savagery. The desire to kill versus necessity. Platonic love stronger than any lust could be.Its pacing is perfect, it unravels slowly and the conditions that vampires have to live under is revealed throughout without exposition. Both Hedebrant and Leandersson push child acting beyond what seems capable, and are as compelling as any Hollywood adults, if not more so with their unique blend of romance.Snowy Swedish suburbia is the perfect location for. It is inherently Scandinavian - moody, cold and atmospheric. There is a rising tension as the outside wold closes in on Oscar and Eli which progresses slowly and naturally, somehow the reactions of others are very believable and human. A Rubik's cubes and plain wall are elevated from the mundane to symbols of the challenges that lie between Oscar and Eli's friendship and some of the more overt imagery is horrifyingly powerful. See, for example, how vampires react to sunlight.It is easy to run out of superlatives to describe Let The Right One In.

I read people's reviews of how good the soundtrack and the acting are but these are two areas that I found slightly weak - not bad but nothing great either. The two main characters were presented with excellent acting but most of the rest were kind of cheesy I thought. The actual scenes of vampirism were sparse and that is not always a bad thing. For as low-budgeted as this film seemed there is a scene near the end that had one of the neatest special-effects I have ever witnessed. This movie came with no subtitling but it was overdubbed with English voices that, as always, were more than awkward sounding. To judge it on visual aesthetics alone I would give this movie a 10. Locations and indoor settings were excellent. This is a very memorable film. I highly recommend it. Calling it the best vampire movie ever is a very long stretch for me.

363,MCDRLx,Band of Outsiders,9,23 July 2009,"Parting the veil on a brooding, translucent realm of wintry isolation, ""Let the Right One In"" is nothing if not the vampire film of the new millennium. Not since Werner Herzog's 1979 ""Nosferatu"" has a film of this genre gazed so deeply and darkly into the human psyche, juxtaposing the allure of mortality with the existential plight of melancholy outcasts. In adapting Swedish novelist John Ajvide Lindqvist's work to the screen, director Tomas Alfredson has crafted a film that leaps beyond the confines of its medium with astonishing power and subtlety.Set in the snowy apartment complexes of suburban Stockholm, the film begins with fragile 12-year-old Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) poised ethereally against the window, looking outside. His reserved demeanor at school makes him a regular target of bullies, to whom he never retaliates but are the cause of bottled-up frustration. Enter Eli (Lina Leandersson), the new girl next door: pale, wide-eyed and somewhat enigmatic, she frequents the courtyard only at night and appears to be unaffected by the freezing temperatures. After a series of short conversations, the two become curiously drawn to each other.As the town begins to witness mysterious deaths, the relationship between Oskar and Eli blossoms in equally strange fashion: Both discover a tenderness in each other that transcends mere words and actions. For him, her presence becomes his strength and solace; she, a vampire masquerading as a 12-year-old girl, takes a liking to him despite the irrevocable nature of her identity. Yet for all their poignant commonalities, Oskar and Eli remain worlds apart, victims of marginalization as well as eternal condition. When Eli is finally compelled to leave, her note is tellingly brief: ""I must be gone and live, or stay and die."" Chaos ensues, quietly but forcefully. Oskar summons the courage to turn the table on his tormentors; bodies resurface, trapped in ice. Blood is drawn on a gruesome whim; a swimming pool becomes a murderous set piece for retaliation. Manipulating tensions admirably throughout, Alfredson renders each scenario with a beautiful, almost otherworldly naturalism. The haunting sense of the quotidian is surpassed only by the ferocity of Eli's acts of vampirism, which both fascinate and truly frighten.There's so much more to admire about ""Let the Right One In,"" from the splendidly complex performances of the child actors to the unforgettable, jaw-dropping moments of beauty that is pure cinema. The last of these, in particular, fittingly evokes both the visual and aural: that of Oskar and Eli, communicating their affection for each other through Morse code (K-I-S-S) as they ride away on an empty train. Call it pre-pubescent infatuation, if you will; as for the film itself, it's something of a masterpiece.",Let the Right One In
364,Brc123,"Good, but overrated.",7,23 April 2015,"Don't really understand the overwhelming amounts of praise for this movie, it was decent, but that's about it.I guess I will start with the things it did right in my opinion. The acting was very good, even the child actors pulled of really solid performances (child actors usually suck, let's be real). The emotions the characters portrayed felt real. The cinematography was good. And the atmosphere and score set a very dark tone which fit the movie very well. For the things it did bad. Well first off, the movie got pretty boring at some parts. Like, I get it, you need to develop your characters, but there was so many scenes that were so unnecessary that just dragged the movie along at a very slow pace. There were a few characters that were introduced that had little to no effect on the plot at all and were just boring to watch and wasted time. Most unforgivable, there is literally no plot. What was I rooting for to happen? Where was the rising action? Climax? Falling action? It just seemed like a bunch of stuff was happening that didn't really correlate with everything else and I felt kind of unsatisfied when the movie ended. There was a lot of unanswered questions. Why was that one boy pretending to be Oskar's friend? I thought Eli left, why did she conveniently show up to save Oskar at the pool? And for a movie that was labelled as a ""horror"" movie, for me at least, I never felt genuinely scared throughout the movie and never felt sympathetic as the characters that died, you either wanted them to die, or just didn't really care much about them.This movie did all the little things fantastically. Acting, cinematography, atmosphere, score, all spot on. But it was also riddled with many useless scenes and characters, barely even had a plot at all, and wasn't really scary. making it a slightly boring experience.

366,Zarathustras_Crown,Brilliantly moving work from an oft under-appreciated cinematic locale.,10,22 June 2009,"I'm not generally one to write reviews of movies on IMDb, I generally find one-sided comments to be difficult to write in comparison to a healthy back and forth dialog on a film, this one sticks out though.I heard about this film while looking for information on Park Chanwook's ""Thirst"" in which users were asking as to whether that film would be as powerful and moving as this. My interest piqued, I went and picked up a copy to watch, put it in the player and satin rapt amazement for the next nearly two hours watching the beautifully paced story gradually unwind before my eyes.Oskar is a young, thoughtful boy of 12 going through a stage of life I think most of us remember with at least some small sense of displeasure, when our emotional stability was built largely around our interaction with our peers. Like many, Oskar is viciously victimized by a group of bullies at his school, but doesn't seem to carry the force of personality necessary to help himself out of his problem.All this changes when a young girl named Eli moves in next door, at first reticent to build any relationship with Oskar, she gradually warms to him and the two begin to develop a deep friendship, brought closer together by their shared isolation and anomie. Unfortunately this relationship is tested on a very fundamental level due to the fact that our young Eli is, in fact, a vampire.I can't go into great detail as to the plot without utterly ruining the impact of the film and so I won't bother to try. What I will say is that this movie is, without a doubt, among the most brilliantly and emotionally honest ""vampire"" movie I've seen in a long, long time...perhaps as far back as such masterpieces as Near Dark and The Lost Boys.What makes this movie stick out isn't the general Vampire fare of intense fighting, gore, blood and mayhem (though they do make appearances throughout), it's the slow pace of the film. By the time any conclusive mention of Vampires is mentioned we, the audience, is already completely and utterly immersed in the moving relationship between our two young protagonists. I use the term Vampire movie lightly, one could very reasonably remove the vampire undertone to the film and still have a beautiful story of connection, love, loss and morality. Very rarely is this the case in such movies.Ultimately I think the appeal here is that all of us have been, or known someone like Oskar...and ultimately all of us wish for such a connection in our own lives. While some audiences may find it slow paced (the same people who shut off the brilliant Audition halfway through because there'd bee no payoff yet), for those willing to immerse themselves in the story and with a sensibility to thoughtful, and honest storytelling, this film is among the most moving, and emotionally meaningful films to have come out of cinema, period (let alone foreign cinema) in the last decade.",Let the Right One In

369,liersenic,A must see for vampire fans,9,12 December 2011,"I had actually started watching this movie about two years back, before the remake had actually come out, but I started watching it way too late at night and only got about 20 minutes into it. I had heard incredible things from it from friends and internet sources, but once the remake came out I had little or no desire to see it because remakes that come out so shortly after the original tend to have no purpose in watching. Based on my first time fully watching this film I knew I already was going to have a biased opinion towards the remake, solely based on the performance by the two kid actors in this film. Both of them are so awkward, and are even more awkward when they interact with each other, but it fits so well with the movie, it's strange really. The way they both interact with each other is very unique, and really can't be replicated by force, it kind of just happens between two actors. They do a great job of telling the story of a vampire through a child's eyes. The movie is a really neat take on the story of vampires, and is told through a story of two young kids, one of whom is a vampire. It reminds me a bit of Interview With a Vampire, because it shows that even though a child is a vampire, that child is still a blood thirsty beast, and they will forever need the assistance of an adult; they will never grow out of the childhood stage of their life. This is a really haunting dilemma to think about, because when thinking of immortality it at first sounds like a great thing. Although we have seen countless vampire movies show us the reality of being a vampire, and that it is not at all what it is cracked out to be.The film is shot so well and at time is shot from a really interesting perspective. One of the scenes in particular, my absolute favorite scene in the whole movie is the pool scene near the end. When Oskar is being held underwater in the pool and Eli comes to save him. I loved how it was shot underwater and you see all the kids getting demolished by Eli all from an underwater perspective. It is a really neat shot, and I could imagine when director was first talking about the scene, I'm sure many people were confused as to how it was going to turn out. Tomas Alfredson shows off his creativity in this film by not going with the standard angles and scenery we normally see in horror films. This movie deserves all the hype it gets, it did not disappoint one bit. Getting to see the kids grow as friends was neat but then eventually leading up to Oli learning that his only friend is a vampire. This film is easily in my top 3 vampire films, right next to Thirst and Interview With A Vampire. I loved how dark of a film this was even though it had to deal with story of kids, it never strayed from the darkness and brutality of being a vampire. http://tgtbtw.blogspot.com/",Let the Right One In

I heard they are trying to make a American version of it but the problem with American remakes they are never as good as the foreign films. I think it is because Americans like to censored things for their children maybe that is why twilight has become such a big hit. It is a good movie for all ages basically and it is not even a little scary.Whereas LTROI has a little bit of darkness to it that just makes the movie even more great.

I found the story and characters to be told in a very beautiful, almost poetic way, with lingering scenes/shots telling more about a moment in the film then any dialog could. The acting, directing and cinematography is mesmerizing from the first opening scene until the closing credits.Several reviews that I have read on this site panned the film, but that is mostly talk dumbed down from years of cinema where over-the-top soundtracks, action, and special effects rule the day.The brilliance of this film is that it strips away all of the gloss, grander, gore and other 'adult' preconceptions about vampires tend to exist. The only way to do that is to show everything from a very young age, where Oskar has so many questions, but Eli doesn't seem to know the answers, or maybe simply does not want to share just yet, leaving the viewer wanting to know more as well.The film flows very well between Eli appearing very young, vulnerable and helpless, to suddenly being dangerous and threatening. That transition is what significantly separates this film from other movies.In so many other supernatural films, the character in question lives in a realm that is untouchable by humanity, but Eli's character still seems to retain her humanity (or innocence) and that is what makes this film stand above the rest.Enjoy!",Let the Right One In
372,sammyfatkitty,Let the Right One In Review,9,12 August 2011,"This is easily one of the best vampire movies to come out in the last decade. Unlike every other vampire title around today, this movie has good acting, a brilliant story, characters that you actually care about, as well as some brilliant scares and kill scenes. Another thing that sets this apart, not just from vampire movies but from horror movies in general is the overall tone of the movie. This isn't a high pulse, adrenaline pumping experience like most of the horror films around today. Instead, Let the Right One In takes a more laid back approach, with a somber and patient mood set perfectly by Tomas Alfredson's direction. The tone works perfectly for the story, which is just as emotionally gripping as it is terrifying. The growing relationship between the two main characters, Oskar and Eli, feels very real and it's fascinating to watch it grow from a courtyard friendship into a do-anything-for-you relationship. You really feel bad for Eli, a role done with a perfect balance of innocence and evil by Lina Leandersson. She's a vampire that can't help her overpowering thirst for blood, but feels terrible about what she has to do to stay ""alive"". She especially feels bad when she must perform these acts in front of her companion Oskar, played by Kare Hedebrant. Oskar is a bullied child that falls for Eli's sweet innocence without realizing what she truly is. As a character, it is moderately interesting to watch how he changes from before knowing about Eli's powers to after, but for the most part this is truly Eli's story. She completely steals the show, from the initial courtyard meeting right down to the calm and subdued yet still epic final scene. Overall, this is a great movie that really reboots the vampire horror genre with a chilling tone, a creative and gripping story, as well as intriguing characters and great acting.",Let the Right One In

I love that this gives us a whole new take on the Renfield character from Dracula. Anyway, this is a great film, so much deeper than horror and it does what all great stories do, it tells us a bit of what it means to be human (or vampire). I love the American title for this film. Classic lore has it that a vampire cannot enter a person's home without being invited in. We see that in this film but we also see something else and that is the vampire's need to let the right person into her life. In one sense it's about finding one's other half and in another sense it's about survival. You won't want to watch this film alone, you're gonna want to talk about it when it's over and then watch it again.",Let the Right One In

Although I love the plot, I was disappointed by the ending. I wanted more closure. I wish there was a second film which explored how their lives continued. I know that probably the boy will end up like the old man who took care of her. He will dedicate his life to her and then when he is old, she will throw him out a window. But I expected a different ending and a different future for this couple. In my opinion, the girl had different feelings for the boy in this film. I don't think he is like the other boys/men she has used in the past. I expected or hoped that the girl would turn the boy into a vampire and the two of them would have eternal love. I know... I know... it sound mushy, but that is the end I would have liked to see. I will say that the movie does make me want to read the book. I would recommend this film, but I can only give it a six because of the ending.",Let the Right One In
375,anuragr,Strange vampire movie...,7,25 January 2009,"For an average movie-watcher I think this was a rather strange vampire movie. The idea of vampires has been so beaten to death that it may be hard to expect an original movie. ''let the right one in'' doesn't disappoint us in any way but it still has had its own problems.After reading the reviews and noticing the high ratings, I thought this was going to one of those phenomenal movies that explore the emotion of fear itself while letting it overlap with greed, revenge, sexuality or love. But unfortunately that deep exploration of fear (as claimed by many reviewers and friends) didn't seem to be so much there. I wouldn't for example compare this with Rosemary's baby, the Exorcist or even the Ringu. Still it was a nice break from the vampire slaying entertainment.For an average movie-watcher this movie was quite strange in many ways. The involvement of Oskar with Eli, wasn't about attraction or conventional ''romance'' as you might expect reading the reviews- it was merely about a friendship formed in the vulnerability of childhood. The whole idea is unconventional and interesting but not very well executed. There is a little bit of incoherence and disconnection in the various carefully shot scenes.The isolation of winter (a technique heavily used in Scandinavian cinema) was probably there to make us feel the need for support and love that Oskar himself feels. His involvement with Eli might have implied the need for courage and revenge he would've felt; ''Letting the right one in'' could suggest the ambivalence of weakness and revenge that Oskar harbored. But none of this was directed well. What we see is a different set of scenes that don't connect with each other to convey something. We may give credit to the script writer for all what he would've wanted to say.. but despite splendid cinematography the overall execution was far from perfection.With so many loose ends and ambiguities, and the direction losing its focus intermittently this is not the movie that you would be eagerly waiting to watch. However, its good to see people trying such things in vampire movies - in a time when Twilight runs successfully in the theaters.",Let the Right One In

Vampire. Movie. Ever."" coming from a foreign origin rousted my curiosity, so I gave it a whirl. What a treat! The wintery backdrops of Scandinavia are masterfully and subtly delivered to your brain in crisp, steady, refreshing scenes that set a thawing pace for both your mind and your heart, slowly inserting you into story and waking you up to the whole idea of ""vampires"" in a plausible new light. Just about the time you get to that point and start smiling, the film dawns to reveal one of the most beautiful love stories you'll ever see. Enjoy.",Let the Right One In
378,Thrillseeker303,A diamond in the rough.,8,7 September 2013,"This versatile little jewel can't be easily categorized to a specific genre. In a sense it's a horror movie, but at the same time so much more than that.Oskar is a lonely twelve year old boy who is waylaid daily by a couple of bullies. One night, Eli appears on the courtyard of the apartment-complex where Oskar lives. She warns him to stay away from her, but Oskar ignores her warning. The fact he never sees her in daylight and that she's looking rather pale, doesn't scare him and an endearing friendship arises.Eli needs to drink fresh human blood to survive, but loathes the violence that goes with it. With a blade in his hand, Oskar fantasizes his cruel revenge on the bullies, but fails to act when confronted with them. Many more dimensions have been cleverly added to this seemingly simple story, weaving everything together to one organic whole.Two other important factors are the wonderful camera-work by Hoyte Van Hoytema and the intimate directive skills by Tomas Alfredson. The clear cinematography of Van Hoytema doesn't just capture the astonishing Swedish snow-landscape, which accentuates the red blood in the sparingly applied horror scenes, but also accentuates the vulnerable-making visibility of Oskar and Eli. Both would like to hide, but Van Hoytema's special lighting hardly allows it.Van Hoytema's communication of feelings with images gives Thomas Alfredson a chance to shine while directing his two protagonists and delicately forming their world into shape. Obligated scenes where natural laws of the vampire are explained hereby become part of the way the children interact with the world and each other. For once, the erotic aspect of the vampire-fiction doesn't matter.Let the Right One In is a tender horror-film which is very rare. Alfredson successfully merges sensitive Swedish children's movies and teen-drama with very mature vampire horror. And he ends this masterpiece with a climax that leaves the viewer speechless.",Let the Right One In

380,jacobsteel,... in many parts a beautiful and original piece of cinema.,7,4 February 2008,"I read the book and loved it. Now, I had the chance to see the movie version at the Gothenburg International Filmfestival 2008, as the movie won the ""Nordiska filmpriset"". I saw it at a really big screen (700 seats), happy that it delivered fine acting and quality cinema.Having said that, I'd also agree with what's been said (e.g. above) that the music is a bit over the top. The movie itself is a study in the small: tiny nuances in the classroom and schoolyard, the almost forgotten suburb, the hiding qualities of snow, ice and winter (not to mention the, at least partly, neglected kids). To score such small details with grand strings makes for a bit of a mismatch. Enough on that, some parts have only piano and those work perfectly.Witout spoiling anything it's safe to say that this first and foremost is a story of friendship. Second, it's a story of revenge. Either way, this is a truly original tale and in many parts a beautiful piece of cinema. Original (and sometimes quite gory) still even the violence seems subdued (at least in comparison to the vampire genre as it has evolved from subtle romance flick to full blown war movie). This movie, however, is about loneliness, friendship and loyalty --- and it's really worth watching. Recommended.",Let the Right One In

Given there are so many bad Vampire films out there. One thing I was curious about is several times in the film Eli tells Oscar ""I'm not a girl"". Then in the scene where she changes into the dress Oscar gives her we see a brief view as she pulls the dress over her head and there's no genitalia, just what appears to be a three way surgical incision that's been very crudely sutured closed.

I have seen some people say this isn't a horror movie, and at first glance, I might have agreed. However if you dig deeper, you'll find that this is truly a suspenseful and frightening tale.

384,dante_leebo,Not Just A Vampire Movie,9,25 August 2008,"This film was the main reason for my attending Frightfest in London this year and I was not disappointed. From the opening shot you realise that you are in for something special. The film is set in (a very cold) Sweden in the early 1980s and the writer of the novel/screenplay has confessed that it is semi-autobiographical and based loosely on his own childhood. I'm guessing that the inclusion of a vampire in the story is what takes this away from being simply autobiographical.Although people are describing this as a vampire movie, I cannot help but feel that this does the film something of a disservice. Does this mean that people who do not particularly like vampire movies would not necessarily go to the cinema and watch this? That would be a shame because this is a very human story. The vampire element does take a back seat to the main focus of the story which is the fascinating relationship between Oscar and Eli. These are two outcasts brought together by their miserable lives.The film is Swedish with subtitles but again don't let that put you off. The two performances by the child actors are fantastic and director Alfredson is apparently better known for comedy in Sweden and his humour is evident throughout the film. Without a doubt the best film at Frightfest 2008, there is a remake planned for 2010 but the film is near perfect just as it is so why wait? Go and see it.",Let the Right One In

It does so through the world of a child where both pure evil and pure goodness are somewhat discernible, and it achieves an astounding array of contrasts that allow us to see that good and evil can coexist side by side. Doing so, this movie is very thought-provoking, leaving the audience yearning to read the novel. In short, this movie is a gem.

I read the summary on the back and it sounded really cool. I wasn't into bloody violence so I let my parents watch it first. When they came in to tell me good night, I was surprised and asked why they weren't watching it (it hadn't even been a hour). They said it didn't get anywhere and that they had better things to do. They said it barely had any gore, so I could watch it. Since I usually like stuff my parents didn't , I ignored the comment and thought that I'd see for myself. I should have listened to them. It was awful!!! There was no music except for maybe one scene, the characters were boring and disturbed, the dubbing was awful, there was nothing vampiric or romantic about this movie, Eli and Oskar kept acting all awkward around each other (not to mention all of the sexual crud!), there were scenes that were pointless, the directing was boring, and when I thought the plot was about to get somewhere, it didn't ! The plot was basically some creepy murder obsessed kid who falls in love with some weird pale girl (who, the book, I believe, is supposed to be a boy who somehow changed sex. So, does that mean Oskar and Eli are gay...?) who kills Oskars bullies. I usually try to hold out on movies until the end, even if they're bad, so I can have an honest opinion. But I drew the line with that notorious nude scene with Eli. This is the first movie that I actually turned off before finishing. I was disappointed; as a vampire fan, this movie had potential. But whoever gave such good reviews has either never seen a vampire movie or was bribed to give it good reviews, or probably both.

Those who seek adrenaline rush and action better avoid it if it is all they seek. Mind you, there are some scenes that send chill down your bones, but still function more as a way of defining the drama than as a way of defining the horror of it. This film focuses primarily on a relationship between a kid who is ill adapted at school and whose relationship with parents is far from ideal. He is lonely, misunderstood. The girl he meets is, as far as he goes, the thing he missed the most. A friend. Her story differs from any I've ever seen regarding vampirism mainly because it focuses on down side you rarely have a chance to see in a vampire movie. It shows all the loneliness and grief which comes with Eternal Life and the gruesome things one has to do to endure. It shows what being a vampire is truly about. If vampires should exist, I imagine this would have been the best draft of their every day life.The scenery is magical. So is the music. Together they create a magical cocoon where nothing but those kids (well, kid and a vampire) matter. This is a drama spiced with just a pinch of chill. Beautiful.",Let the Right One In

Oddly I started off wishing for an English version and ended up thanking my lucky stars for what I now think is the finest subtitled movie I have ever had the absolute pleasure of watching, reading and thoroughly enjoying.

There is a flow to this picture rarely ever realized by modern cinema and that should be appreciated as it stands.Note: Having now seen the Americanized version, I appreciated this original that much more.

This was a change in direction of vampire movies. I like most vampire movies and think people imagining them in many ways is great. From Nosferatu, to 30 days of night, to Van Helsing; they all entertain me. But this was a movie that you would want to share with anyone. Not overly romantic or overly horrific in any means. The pictures were great, the story was great, and it made you wonder and think. I also like how the movie makes you think back to many events to come up with a different fate of the characters.

'Let The Right One In' is, by turns, beautiful, horrifying, funny, tender, brutal, sad, and hopeful. The performances of all the young actors were of the highest quality, especially our two leads. The chemistry between these two pre-teens outstripped many a Hollywood pairing. The camera work was excellent. The only qualm I could think of was that, once or twice, the music was a little intrusive on the quiet beauty of the scenes, but this is a very minor complaint.After TDK, 'Let The Right One In' was the best movie I saw this year, and I cannot wait until the DVD release so I can watch it again.

The movie is superior than the book(and that's saying a lot)in that the screenwriter - also the author of the book - has refined the story, focusing more upon the angst, curiosity & burgeoning love that truly defines the heart of this amazing cinematic adventure.There has been a great deal written about exactly what kind of ""love"" is involved; suffice to say, love is love is love; and the writer has left enough ambiguity for each viewer to form his/her own personal perceptions. Irregardless, the thrust here is that the only barrier standing in the way of any true love is choice.

405,amalgam-3,Oh when the räts come marching in..,1,24 March 2010,"Let the right one in, critically acclaimed, is a Swedish Indie-like coming of age story with a vampire thread thrown in for good measure. During its runtime, which felt like it was going for a new world record, we see the excruciatingly slow developing relationship between Oscar, a 12 year old bullied schoolboy and Eli, a much older Vampire who very convincingly passes as a 12 year old herself.Though the premise is original, which at least should entertain a shade of interest, the whole movie is set up to be more of a painting than an actual film. What little plot they undertook to be screened not only got lost in the superabundance of superfluous scenes, it also drowned in an overall feeling of lifelessness. I got the impression that this was intentional although it boggles the mind what they felt was so interesting about the story arc that the movie could get away with the glaring lack of suspense, momentum or indeed, any respect for logic.This brings me to my main complaint, which is that nothing in the story really made much sense to me. People are hung from trees to capture their blood, brutal killings take place in plain sight in the streets galore, but I didn't get the impression anyone in the movie really cared about it. No police is informed, no investigation is started. Although I can imagine why the storyteller tried to follow a different path, the absurdity of it was so glaring; you'd think there was some hidden point to it. But there isn't. It's just plain weird and annoyingly so. Another issue I take with the film is the acting/portrayal of the unsympathetic and uninvolved characters. No one acts according to the laws of human behavior; it's like watching a parody of something I'm not aware even existed. Right in the beginning of the movie we see the character Oscar mimicking the stabbing of one of his school chums. He uses a tree for inspiration and mutters the words ""scream, scream you pig!"". The way he spoke these words raised a couple of eyebrows with me, and the brows didn't seem comfortable to settle back down during the course of the film. I'm sorry, but no one talks or acts like that. The boy either simply can't act or was instructed to behave like an autistic buffoon with an IQ to match his shoe size while saliva continuously drools from his mouth. Most of the other dim characters in the movie fare even worse and I think it's sadistic to expose an intelligent audience to this sort of nonsense.For a full length future film, this movie simply lacks plot, scenario and a sense of direction. I'm still completely unsure what the filmmakers set out to create here. As a coming of age type of film, nothing really was added to the vast legacy this theme already laid down for us to enjoy in numerous books and films. As a vampire movie, it just lacks everything that makes those movies enjoyable to those that are into that genre; namely suspense and humor(?). And as a slow moving Indie movie it really lacks art. The endless showing of dimly lit streets or droplets from a tap forced down by Newtonian law, while being accompanied by abstruse orchestral overtures, shouldn't be a point in itself. And neither should the deliberate lack of conversation be, nor its replacement: long tedious shots of facial expressions that try really very hard to express nothing at all.In short, this film is a dud. Like a bomb that doesn't go off, it just lies in the ground after a forgotten war to harmlessly corrode away into oblivion. A seemingly endless string of mind-numbing scenes built on an almost non existing plot line where suspense is replaced by predictability and out of place absurdism. 3/10",Let the Right One In
406,chintones,Close to perfection,9,6 December 2008,"This film is by far the best thing that I have seen all year (I've seen it twice). It is beautifully shot and depicts the darkness of winter with all of it's forebodings of death, as well as it's renewals. The opening scene is filled with silence and the rustling of falling snow... I dare any Hollywood director to be as brave! Obviously the lack of a huge tent pole budget was no deterrence to the quality of this film. The acting is uniformly excellent with special kudos to the two young leads! The effects are well thought out and prove to be very effective in bringing sharp jolts of horror to what is essentially a poignant love story. Masterful work coming from the land of Ingmar Bergman... I knew there had to be some 'new blood' around! (No pun intended, or maybe it is... see this movie and you can decide!)",Let the Right One In
407,drumgirlelena,"Critical acclaim seeps from pores of ""Let The Right One In,"" but still dry",7,12 May 2014,"Vampires have taken the world by storm since the inception of the idea in the early 1700s. What started as folklore has become a central theme in much of today's media. From Dracula to Edward Cullen, we have seen many illustrations of what makes a vampire: blood lust and superb physical ability being quite common, with more imaginative depictions expanding the definition to include sparkling in the sunlight and lesbianism. However a wholly new version of vampire is conceived in Tomas Alfredson's 2008 film ""Let the Right One In,"" or ""Låt den Rätte Komma In"" in the film's native Swedish.Based on the novel of the same name by John Ajvide Lindqvist, ""Let the Right One In"" tells the story of two kindred spirits, one a vampire child and the other a tortured boy, who find comfort in one another, much as they may try to show strength through independence. The ""children"" experience great turmoil and triumph together, attempting to get through life as ""others."" Eli, the pre-teen vampiress' differences are pretty obvious – she drinks blood and cannot be exposed to sunlight. Thus, she needs to kill to survive. Oskar's desire to kill, both driven and invigorated by his social incompetence, makes him a perfect match for the troubled Eli. The film found much success worldwide, even placing at number 15 on Empire magazine's 2010 list of the ""100 Best Films of World Cinema."" This success is likely due to the film's versatility, fitting into numerous categories such as thriller, romance, drama and coming-of-age. Those who enjoy gore and suspense will find as much pleasure in the film as those who seek an endearing (albeit creepy) pre-teen love story. Not only is the film's story appealing to many, but it also provides broad aesthetic appeal, with its realistic though sometimes mangled characters, accurate and carefully planned sets, and chilling visual effects. The cinematography reminds me most of that in David Slade's ""30 Days of Night"" from 2007. Because many, if not most of the scenes in ""Let The Right One In"" take place in the dark, snowy Sweden, it looks very similar to ""30 Days of Night,"" which takes place almost entirely in the black polar night that hits Barrow, Alaska every winter. The red blood against the white snow is another image that saturates both films, although less so in ""Let the Right One In,"" which has gained critical acclaim for its more subtle use of blood and gore.This film's color also contributes heavily to the appeal of its sets and general mise-en-scène. Most of the film is dim and monotonous in color, with only bright pops of primary colors red, yellow and blue. These colors often symbolize innocence and childhood, for example the Rubik's cube or the children's shorts and balls in the gym. The color red is often exaggerated more than any other, reflecting the blood that Eli needs to survive. The accentuation of color also stands out because of the sparse props in most scenes.The music also contributes to the film's depth. There are certainly moments of eerie music and sound effects that help remind us of the subject matter on screen, but there are also very emotional melodies, highlighting the romance between Oskar and Eli. The music's deliberate use also makes it difficult to take for granted. It is not often used for simple background noise, so most dialogue stands out as there is nothing to distract from it. Because of these small details in the sound, both in music and text, I think this film would be far more moving to a viewer fluent in Swedish. There is much to be said for being able to listen careful, instead of reading. This is also true of the images. The striking visual details are much easier to notice and thus, more impactive, if you do not need to read subtitles. As much as I have praised the film, this is from a purely critical perspective. I myself found the film interesting, but not outright entertaining or attractive. The most exciting piece of the film, to me, was its noted similarity to ""30 Days of Night,"" a movie I thoroughly enjoy. The pacing, dull colors and lack of music however left me wanting more, instead of noticing all the little details as intended. It was absolutely a good movie in terms of success and creativity, but for American me, trained to fall for explosions and fast-paced drama, it lacked excitement. Because of this, I give the film a seven out of ten, getting points for all critical aspects, but losing quite few for entertainment value.",Let the Right One In
408,ruben-154,How sweet and tender and lovely and cold at the same time,9,8 May 2010,"I loved this movie. I loved the atmospheric way in which it was filmed. I loved the music. And I especially loved the realistic setting and the realistic acting in this movie.The story takes place in a working class suburb in Stockholm. Not a setting where you'd expect a vampire story to unfold, but this is exactly what makes the story so believable. You don't need a dark forest, swords, stakes, wolves and a big castle to create a vampire story. In fact, these fantastic elements all create an unrealistic setting. By setting the story in a normal urban area, the story is much closer to home, both literally and figuratively.Another thing I liked is how the two kids in this movie remain actual kids. Some (mainly Hollywood) directors have a tendency to give much too emotional and complex texts to children that are supposed to be CHILDREN in a movie. Oskar and Eli, the two 12 year old main characters in this movie talk and think like 12 year olds, which makes them more credible as the children they are supposed to be.Despite the occasional blood and gore and the loneliness and misery of Eli's life as a vampire this is a very sweet and tender love story. Highly recommended.9/10",Let the Right One In

410,joe_blaugh,NOT a sweet coming of age story - FAAAR darker than most seem to grasp,8,13 April 2010,"I have read numerous reviews, both here on IMDb and elsewhere, and not one of them seems to grasp the essential horror of this movie. At its core this is a completely, utterly, and totally horrific film.Oskar is a budding serial-killer, lacking only the strength of will to engage in his imagined acts of violence. He is driven to this state of mind by the bullies who torment him, but he is not a sympathetic character in the broader social sense. He is at best an anti-hero, one whom we come to know and understand but with whom it is difficult and disturbing to empathize.Eli is thoroughly inhuman and completely absorbed by her/its own needs and hungers. It is regarding her nature that I depart from most other reviews of this film. Eli is NOT in love with Oskar. She is not, cannot be, and is utterly incapable of being Oskar's ""soul mate"" in any way whatsoever. The wishful thinking of reviewers who long for Oskar to become a vampire himself so that he and Eli can be together forever indicates that those viewers utterly miss the point of the movie! I am not arguing that Eli completely lacks sympathy for Oskar, but rather that her sympathy for him is akin to that one might have for a loyal and useful dog. Oskar is to be her next Håkan, securing the blood she requires to live, but eventually to be another (though perhaps willing) victim of her blood-hunger when he is no longer useful. Håkan is clearly jealous of Oskar, likely recognizing the possibility that Eli will soon be done with him (his repeated problems/mistakes certainly don't help his position).As the IMDb synopsis by bj_kuehl puts it, Håkan is Eli's ""Renfield."" Oskar becomes her next ""Renfield"", though perhaps to be spared insanity in favor of death/consumption at the hands of Eli (à la Håkan, though one might question Håkan's ""sanity"" given his self-inflicted mutilation). Oskar is, indeed, ""saved"" by Eli in the pool scene, but he is saved so that he may serve her needs. She cannot survive completely alone, so she must have a human assistant. She cannot turn Oskar since that act would preclude the acquisition of another weak, needy loner who longs for the sense of companionship and otherworldly power that she provides. If she is pair-bonded, any such loners would feel like outsiders with her just as they do with the humans who surround them.There may be some degree of genuine feeling between Oskar and Eli, but in Eli's case it is NOT anything like romantic love. Even in Oskar's case it is more akin to gratitude for freeing him from his impotence and somewhat self-imposed loner status. Eli provides Oskar with the strength, both physical and mental, to get the revenge he desires. But Eli also demands that he continue killing long after this ""revenge"" motive is fulfilled. The end of the movie that many regard as a touching finale to a ""sweet coming-of-age story"" is in fact representative of Oskar's willing acceptance of the role Håkan once played. I do not see ANY way in which this end ""brings love and light"" to the darkness of the story. Oskar is doomed to a role as a lifelong loner whose only companion is a perpetually 12-year-old androgynous vampire who needs and demands of him repeated blood sacrifices of innocents, like the hiker at the beginning or Matte or Jocko, or the guilty like Jimmy, or whomever just happens to be available at the time).The story is, however, very well told. The acting is solid (though the dialog is hard to judge as I do not understand Swedish); the cinematography is appropriately dark and brooding; the story is well paced and tense. Nonetheless, in the end this is a dark tale with a dark end that is ""happy"" only to those who fail to see the back-story and the rather clear parallels between Håkan and Oskar.Well worth seeing, but FAAAAR darker than most seem to grasp.",Let the Right One In
411,JunKitatani,A Beautifully Executed Story of Being Misunderstood.,10,23 June 2009,"This film has a minimalist story structure, and is open-ended by design. The mood of the film is also minimalist with a post-modernist feel. The story arcs around inner conflict of the one lead and the outer conflict of the other. They are both outsiders and misunderstood. Repressed and ostracized by ignorant and fearful people, their story is one of true horror. One is singled-out like Piggy in William Golding's The Lord of the Flies. The other is chased-down by angry towns-folk like Mary Shelley's monster in James Whale's 1931 telling of Frankenstein. The parallels are chilling.The two leads communicate in Morse code at times, and there is the enigmatic plea of the creature to the human ""Try to be me for a while."" There is a secret code embedded in this film. Just like in Frankenstein when we see how the fleeing monster and the ostracized blind-man share in their plight: They meet, and there is a rare love between a man and a non-woman, a kind of true-love in it's asexuality. The creature Eli who says ""Would you like me even if I'm not a girl?"" has scars that look like certain male genitalia were removed (no sign of female genitalia anywhere, and the scar is too low for a hysterectomy). The subtext is there for us to see. This film is a stark echo of a similar message sent out by Whale in 1931. Expertly wrapped in the genre that best shows the horror of the experience that is embodied in the message. The true horror is that it is just as pertinent 78 years later: The experience is lived and real today. Like the creature in the film, an untold number of people must still find refuge only in the dark. The coded messages are a reminder that fear and ignorance that vilify, repress and ostracize are very alive. When the plea to us to ""try and be like me for a while"" is made by the tortured soul, the lasting image is vivid, and the message is loud and clear: Stated in the way that a film is truly meant to say it. This film does it beautifully.",Let the Right One In
412,almos666,Reality meets the myth meets the dream,10,26 December 2009,"There's a Chinese saying that it's much easier to paint the devil than it is to paint a dog - which means that creating a depiction of an actual being requires more skill and discipline than the depiction of an imaginary one. In ""Let the Right One In"" Lindqvist and Alfredson manage to depict both the devil and the dog - to confront a grittiness of the real world with the wild flights of fancy. The grimly romantic story of Eli and Oskar and their completely fantastic relationship - which doesn't quite belong to reality - is cast against canvas of an actual place and time which the film manages to depict in a depressingly vivid detail.The fantasy books/movies/games of more or less distant yore were all about escape from reality. Remember ""The Neverending Story"" and its lonely and bullied protagonist who sought refuge in the imaginary world? Remember the ""Lord of the Rings"" which took place in reality completely separate from our own? Remember the ""Pan's Labyrinth"" where a little girl created a fantasy world so she could forget about the pressure of living in the fascist Spain? The ""Pan's Labyrinth"", for all its escapism, paved the way for another kind of fantasy - a one that would mend the mythical realities of Faerie with the grittiness of the actual world. ""Let the Right One In"" is, in my opinion, another step in this direction. What it makes me think of is Hegel's triad - with realism, fantasy, and a seamless blend of the two standing for the thesis, the anti-thesis and the synthesis respectively. I hope that - rather than being a fortunate exception - ""Let the Right One In"" will pave a way for a new brand of storytelling - a one that will re-conciliate what are the two sides of the same coin: the myth and the reality.In addition, the movie has a dreamlike quality: it's not to say that the story told within its frame is a literal dream; rather, it reminded me of the dreams I've had when I was young; of the nights when I dreamed of impossible love that prevailed against all odds - even against death. In a way, it reminded me of the dreams that will never return.",Let the Right One In
413,goodfellas-foggetaboutit,"Melancholy, ornate and beautiful",9,7 March 2010,"Every now and then a movie comes along that promises to cut across genres, to sweep through the narrow confines of stereotypes. Not all of them succeed though. Only some do. Tomas Alfredson's ""Let the right one in"" definitely belongs to the latter group. And maybe leads it as well.What should I call it? A movie about vampires? A movie about romance? A movie about relationships? Labelling it any of these would amount to seriously downplaying its potential. This movie presents an enormous array of emotions, moods and themes. Some horrific, some sad, some full of smiles – all beautiful nevertheless. Yes, beautiful. In terms of the story and in terms of the aesthetic – it's beautiful. How often would you associate a ""horror"" movie with something that is aesthetically pleasing and beautiful? Not every other day. It is a movie that is to be sipped slowly, not to be gulped down in one wild swig. And believe me, once you've seen it, this movie will stay with you. And grow on you. It tells the story of a 12 year old boy, Oskar, and his friendship with a girl, Eli, who moves in next-door. Oskar lives with his mother, is bullied at school and tries to find a friendly face in Eli. Although reluctant at first, Eli starts to share her secrets with Oskar and the two form a friendship which dazzles in its innocence. It evolves amidst the events at Oskar's school, at his home, amidst the fact the Eli is a vampire and there are things that both of them must cope up with. The two children, alone and sad, find each other and share their existence.The snow-clad neighbourhood, the dimly-lit houses and dark alleys set up the sombre atmosphere that enshrouds the film. I was constantly reminded of Kieslowski's ""The Decalogue – Part 1"". However, there are scenes which promise to melt the frost. Take, for example, the scene when Eli visits Oskar's home but stands outside waiting for him to ask her in. This is because vampire folklore states that vampires cannot enter a house uninvited. Oskar playfully refuses to do so. Eli just stands there, helpless, not saying a word as blood starts oozing out of her eyes, her ears, her nose...blood flows through her eyes like tears as she waits for him to ask her in..The expression on her face is so melancholy, so sad, and ever so beautiful that it took my breath away. The movie is replete with scenes as powerful as this, and this is what makes ""Let the right one in"" stand out among conventional horror movies. ""Conventional"" is one word that does not apply for this film. ""Beautiful"" is a word that does.Watch this film. It will stay with you, faithfully.",Let the Right One In

There's a Swedish counterpart (that's not just for girls) scoring 97% on rotten-tomatoes and a spot on the IMDb top 250 that shows the world just how good a vampire romance involving teenagers can be when handled properly.Låt den rätte komma in (Let The Right One in) tells the story of Oskar a lonely and bullied 12 year-old boy, he has revenge impulses but can't bring himself to act on those. One night as he repeatedly stabs a knife in a tree a girl appears behind him and casually says they can't be friends.She's Eli a 12 year-old girl (more or less anyway) and she has just moved into the apartment next to his together with Håkan an elderly man who provides her with the blood she (big surprise she's a vampire) needs to survive without putting herself at risk however Håkan may not be able to provide for much longer....Obviously we're dealing with a vampire film and thus a horror film so there's some blood and gore and it's not for kids but wisely the film focuses on the relationship between the two leads played brilliantly by two actual 12 year-olds instead of the horror. The story is told in a serious, realistic manner and the camera favours wide shots and close-ups giving the film a distant yet intimate feel.What one doesn't expect is how quiet the film is, this coupled with gorgeous shots of snowy Sweden and the subtle score creates an atmosphere that ensures that film draws you into it's little world right until the end credits.So go see it now.

416,kilmorekat,Light! Bite! Right!,9,17 April 2009,"The land of eternal sunshine and perpetual darkness provides a totally original and highly appropriate setting for this post-modern take on the tired, tired, undead vampire genre. The Gothic motifs are revisited in a vivid and original manner and those gory old vampire clichés are given new life, by transposing Eastern European mythology to the fresh, clean snowfields of Scandanavia, and by focusing the narrative on an innocent and troubled pair of blood-crossed adolescents.'You would like to kill if you could, but I kill because I have to.' Excuse the bad translation. Thus is the response when Eli the vampire refers to her first meeting with Oskar the troubled boy, when he fantasizes about stabbing the boys who are bullying him at school. Humans have free will and vampires are compelled to follow their instinct.The Swedish snowfields and their brilliant luminosity provide a stunning backdrop to a tale of darkness; blood has never looked so black on pristine, white snow.Rarely does a film capture the spontaneity, laughter, joy, disappointment, fear, lightness, and deep, deep seriousness of being a child. Such is the quality of the acting.'Let The Right One In' is a beautifully-paced tale full of sadness and joy, and an invigorating bite in the jugular to a tired old genre.",Let the Right One In
417,tjgross11,"A poetic classic about love, loneliness, and violence",10,18 December 2015,"""Let the Right One In"" is nothing short of a horror masterpiece, and makes a strong case for the best horror movie of the 2000's, even as we approach 2016. Although the film falls under the 'horror' genre, it can easily be sub-categorized under romance, thriller, mystery, and perhaps most importantly, drama. ""Let the Right One In"" successfully delivers one of the most memorable horror stories we have ever seen; in all my years of seeking that one horror title that would force me to catch my breath as soon as the credits roll, I am glad to say I have finally found it.You might see me say ""catch my breath"" and relate it to other classics such as ""High Tension"" or ""REC"" because of their overwhelming pace, and you would not be wrong, as those films are excellent in their own way; however, when I talk about having to catch my breath after watching ""Let the Right One In"", I mean it in an entirely different way. When I sat back after watching this gorgeous piece of film making, my breath was taken away not because of a jump scare or anything similar, but because I had to digest the mountain of symbolism the entire film had put out there for me to grasp as well as the Shakespearean ending that had just taken place.Alike to other great films such as David Fincher's version of ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"", every scene and word of dialogue in ""Let the Right One In"" has a significant meaning. It is no secret that the film has a slow burning pace, but in the end that is what makes it such a gem; too often you have films that tread at a lackadaisical pace with nothing of substance to fill these wide gaps between climactic scenes. In ""Let the Right One In"", every scene, no matter how quiet or passive, serves as a figurative scheme to further attach the viewer to its' characters.From the point where Oskar meets Eli to the final scene which is simultaneously beautiful and overwhelmingly tragic, ""Let the Right One In"" is a gorgeous depiction of what it's like to feel alone in a hauntingly exquisite world of freezing, cold, bright-white snow; a world where the only person you come to love and trust is someone that lives by vigorously painting that very snow red, and by the looks of it, has perhaps conned you into doing the same for the rest of your life, representing a vicious cycle of blinding love and violence that seems to be symbolized to go on forever.",Let the Right One In

419,dutta-satyaki,Be me for a little while,8,12 August 2012,"LTROI is a cute love story between two 12 year olds on the brink of adolescence with a small difference – the girl has been 12 for over 200 years. Based on the novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist, this is a directorial venture of Tomas Alfredson starring Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson as Oskar and Eli respectively.Movies on vampires have been attempted by many with little success. However this one strikes a chord and has the making of a classic. Shot entirely in Stockholm, it has a serene touch coupled with brilliant performances. The movie has been named so because in popular folklore, vampires never come in unless they are invited.The movie portrays the life of Oskar, a boy fathered by an alcoholic and mothered by a workaholic who have separated ways. Bullied regularly at school, he finds repose in books, puzzles and loneliness. It is then that Eli moves in the neighborhood with Hakan(an ex-teacher who willingly slaughters people to quench Eli's thirst for reasons unknown). They develop bonds and learn to interact through Morse Code, despite the fact that Eli is stone-cold and smells like a corpse. She teaches him to retaliate upon being teased. Meanwhile Hakan dies owing to circumstances. Oskar discovers that Eli is a vampire and what follows is one of the sweetest coming-of-age tales..The two child actors carry out their roles to perfection. The plot has the perfect blend of terror and romance. It is essentially a dark movie and the palette is so dark that even fresh blood appears black. LTROI isn't a vampire story, rather it's the story of friendship and empathy between two of society's misfits. It avoids being overtly melodramatic and portrays an awkward relationship between the leads. Towards the closing minutes it gets predictable but keeps you glued nonetheless.Movies with an open ending always leave an impact. Here too, the closing scenes are left to the audience's interpretation. Whether it's the beginning of a new love story or the usual process employed by Eli is for you to decide..Ratings :- The movie is rated R for some bloody violence including disturbing images, brief nudity and language.Acting : 8.5/10 Plot : 7/10 Direction : 7/10 Overall : 8/10 LTROI was nominated for the BAFTA Awards and has won 61 awards in different categories.

Tonight I watched it with a friend and at the end we both shared the same conclusion. This is the first Swedish movie I have seen, and the plot was not usual, but that doesn't mean that anything unusual can instantly be worthwhile to watch.Let the Right One In's biggest issue with me is that it doesn't make any sense at all. Let me explain before you say that I did not understand the movie. First and foremost of all are the two main characters, which are Oscar and Elly.These two eccentric outcasts eventually begin a relationship in what would you could call a horror/love situation for us viewers, because as far as I know, Oscar doesn't give a damn about Elly's actions throughout the whole movie.The way they talk is just random and confusing, because either they talk basically about the weather, or they ask the other a question, and then the question does not get answered. Both of these happen way too often in the movie, and only occasionally is the current subject ""to the point"" of the movie's plot.There are many slow moments in the movie where ultimately it's uncalled for, but if this is the director's intention then so be it. Some of the facial expressions are ridiculous, such as after the nude scene or after the so called ""infamous"" but in my opinion weird as hell pool scene. The support characters are all boring, not a single character actually stood out in acting or behaviour including the main characters, the special effects are just not special and NOTHING gets explained in this movie.I mean this is just some kind of obscure twelve year old's story getting bullied and happens to encounter a vampire and out of nowhere from that very moment on nothing matters anymore.There ain't no message, no logic and no point for me to rewatch this movie any time soon, unless I really missed something here, as I am still baffled by all the 9's and 10's this movie is getting from IMDb reviewers.And no way in hell is this one of the best horror movies ever(Or romance movie for that matter), not from the current horror decade and not from the older horror decades either. I haven't seen many vampire movies yet, but please don't tell me that this is the best we can come up with.It's just too bad, really. This is one of the rare IMDb top 250 movies where I give it a very low score. How could this pretty long horror/romance movie deliver with failure on such a high level? Where was the consistency? The direction? The point? In conclusion, I did not understand this movie. And do you know what the saddest part is?

When he comes across Elli, a mysterious and beautiful new neighbor girl, he clings onto wisps of friendship that emerge. So much so that the two eventually embark in a pseudo-love story, together facing a world they feel won't let them in – a world of unreliable adults, malicious classmates, and unpredictable legal structure.Narratively, it is clear that Alfredson works to take the feeling of otherness one step further through his implementation of the fantastical, by means of Elli the vampire. Not only does he place middle school children at the center of the story, but a middle school aged vampire is the point around which the story revolves – the ultimate misfit.Additionally, however, Alfredson approaches the concept of the misfit cinematically as well. Through his use of snow as lighting in a dark and ominous Sweden, as well as the film's sound and music, we watch not only as two misfits fall in love, but also as the binary of good and evil is broken apart. In the brightly lit snowy evening of a dark Swedish town, the film begins with a man abducting and killing an innocent boy. As he drains the blood from the boys' neck, a curious white poodle emerges. While at first the dog throws an accusatory bark at the man, he later approaches the pool of blood the boy has spilt on the snow and laps it up. The capability for something so dark and evil to take place in a winter wonderland, and also be enjoyed by a white dog, counters our belief in the system of light as pure and dark as evil. In this case, whiteness operates as pure evil. Or so it seems.As the film progresses, we see that the fair-haired Oskar, who is ever the victim of peer abuse, is capable of waving knives around in his free time and smacking a classmate on the head with a pole. Such violence from an innocent looking child seems jarring, despite the fact that his actions appear justified by the treatment he needlessly receives from his classmates. When he meets Elli and tumbles headfirst into an innocent childhood love affair, we audience members are further confronted with the confusing elements of sexuality. Everything we have come to understand as good and pure – childhood, young infatuations, victimhood – becomes more complex. Not only this, but our Kantian understanding of ethics is countered by Elli's condition as vampire, which is perhaps the highest form of moral complexity – I kill because I need to eat. Meanwhile, bullies attack for unknown reasons and are not explored as complex characters. As such, they are seen as pure evil in a film that dapples with more morally corrupt actions than stealing a hat from a peer.When Oskar passes judgment over Elli at the revelation of her true nature, she accuses him of wanting to kill out of revenge if he could. He does not argue, and goes on to assist her in killing so she feed. When Elli rips some children limb from limb in an attempt to save Oskar's life, the already blurred dichotomy between good and evil becomes slightly clearer – people are simply not what they seem and surface level evil is not always true to the core.The narrative strand of the film is beaded with an 80's punk rock soundtrack, shedding a new light on this music genre – angry though it may seem, it acts as a beautiful outlet for the misfit character like Oskar or Elli as they dance along to it. The sounds of Elli's hungry stomach are at first off-putting and frightening, but as we see her pained young face struggle with hunger, we empathize with the rumbling in her stomach, rather than fear the growling of it.As such, Alfredson works to mud up the waters of moral understanding in his exploration of the misfit livelihood. Hyperbolizing otherness through the use of a vampire in the form of a young girl, and confronting pre-conceived notions about good and evil, we see that everyone is capable of both - even Oskar's bullies wince in hatred for themselves for what they do to him. There is some comfort to be found in walking away knowing that no single being is wholly good or entirely evil.",Let the Right One In
424,mannb-938-88175,Letting a vampire in,7,14 April 2014,"Vampires are commonly thought of as insensitive, harmful, and vengeful, however Eli, one of the protagonists in Let the Right One In, demonstrates that not every vampire is so harsh. The Swedish film, Let the Right One In, by director Tomas Alfredson is perfect combination of horror and drama that follows the start and growth of young Oskar and twelve-year old Eli's friendship that turns into a relationship. Oskar, a physically small, blonde twelve-year-old lives in an apartment with his mother and is constantly being bullied at school. Eli is a mysterious stranger who moves into the apartment next door to Oskar with an older man and starts to get to know Oskar though he is quite oblivious for a while of Eli's true identity. Alfredson's makes this seemingly strange storyline into a huge success through putting huge emphasis on the setting throughout the film, adding extra intense focus on images and imagery throughout the film, and highlighting the theme of outsiders and alienation of members in society.While watching Let the Right One In, I thought the setting took on a huge presence within each scene due to the harsh characteristics of the beyond freezing winter in suburb of Stockholm. Not only does the choice of filming during the frigid winter in Sweden act as a crucial aspect to the plot of the movie, but also has a significant influence on the mood during many of the scenes. The various events throughout the plot including disposing and reappearing bodies and revealing characteristics of Eli's true identity as a vampire depend on the harsh winter setting to move the plot along. For example, we are given hints about Eli's vampire identity from her ability to withstand the cold while wearing minimal clothing and the dark, bleak winter allowing for her to be outside more then she would be able to in other circumstances. Along with this idea, the setting has a huge impact on the mood of the film. The winter, consistently freezing and bleak, adds to the dark, underlying suspense in each scene. Imagining this movie being filmed during the summer would completely alter the mood of the film; ultimately changing the way the audience reacts to the frightening, suspenseful scenes.As Alfredson places emphasis on the setting of his film, he also utilizes imagery in an exceptional way that causes the audience to have their eyes glues to the screen the entire time. The images being a central focus throughout the movie is highlighted by the basic and minimal use of dialogue in many scenes. Especially at the beginning of the film, when there are solely minor conversations between characters, the images that the audience members view on screen are extremely meaningful. We learn a lot about Oskar, Eli, and other secondary characters more through their actions and facial expression rather then what they say. I think this is an extremely important element throughout the film because of the huge reactions Alfredson draws from the viewer when he directs the film through visual exploration.A major theme that Tomas Alfredson highlights in Let the Right One In is the portrayal of ""outsiders"" in society. Both protagonists, Oskar and Eli, struggle with the continuous alienation from society. Oskar's outsider presence is shown through his multiple encounters with the boys who bully him at school and the beginning scene where he is talking and playing ""make believe"" with himself. Oskar seems to consistently be alone, not interacting with any part of society. The only significant interaction in Oskar's life we witness is the relationship that is formed with Eli, and even then, Eli's alienation from society is more then Oskar's. The audience witnesses the extreme alienation of both Oskar and Eli as their friendship evolves. The coming together of Oskar and Eli, two complete outsiders in society is intriguing to watch due to the support and eventual acceptance they have for one another. Eli supports Oskar and gives him advice on how to deal with the bullying he faces at school and how to achieve relief and revenge. Through this support, the two alienated characters accept each other as outsiders, and are able to feel accepted while completely separated from much of society.Overall, I think director Tomas Alfredson does an exceptional job drawing catching the viewers attention and drawing them in through the specific setting of the film, the focus on images rather then dialogue, and the important theme of outsiders in society. Each of these elements makes Let the Right One In a film that the audience",Let the Right One In
425,peterm9,A Great Movie Vampire Movie,7,13 April 2014,"The first view of Tom Alfredson's ""Let the Right One In,"" is the most compelling. Alfredson creates suspense, not only from the plot, but also from his refusal to stick to one genre. The movie is a little bit horror film, drama, dark comedy, romance and even social commentary. The viewer believes that as the movie unfolds, the main element will become clear, but that never quite happens. By refusing to conform to a genre, Alfredson creates a sense of unease in the viewer that sets the film apart from the typical vampire story.At first glance, Eli and Oskar's relationship seems like a romance. Yet, romance doesn't seem to fit their androgynous characteristics. While both characters reflect the paleness of the surrounding Scandinavian winter, their other physical characteristics seem to reflect the opposite sex. Oskar with his long white blonde hair, slight build and high pitched voice is more effeminate than Eli with her wild dark hair, surprisingly low voice and at times self assured nature (perhaps that is the result of being 12 for a very long time). Even the innocent first love element is contradicted by the violent nature of their secret. Oskar, who is not very successful in relationships, tries to place his new relationship with Eli into the social norms of ""going steady"" and blood brothers. Neither of theses attempts succeeds, as Eli is not really a girl or a child, but a vampire. The success of Alfredson's portrayal is that these defining characteristics do not prevent their relationship. They find their own language, including Morse code, and learn to accommodate each other. What is important is that together they are not quite as lonely or broken. The tenderness of Eli and Oskar's relationship contrasts with the violent reality of Eli's existence and the anger within Oskar. While Oskar seems the harmless victim of bulling, he is also disturbed. He collects murder articles, fantasizes about his knife and admits to Eli that he would like to kill for revenge. Eli, on the other hand, tells Oskar that she has to kill to survive. Yet while Alfredson allows Eli to plead her case of necessity, he also allows Ginia to question Eli's choice of survival. Ginia surprises viewers by choosing her own destruction over existence as a vampire. Ginia, a character of limited importance, becomes the story's hero by making the conscious decision not to allow the violence to continue. As the story becomes a web of victims, the victims, such as Conny and Ginia's husband, become perpetrators of violence. Violence is an unresolved issue in the movie. There is an acceptance and tolerance of violence. In Oskar's classroom, the police talk about a murder as if it is a trivia topic. Similarly when the first victim is killed no one seems to listen to the school's announcement about counselors. The man, with the cats, sees Eli kill, but doesn't want to talk to the police. By not calling the police he puts others including Ginia at risk. When Oskar hits Conny with the stick, his father ignores the incident. His mother simply worries about people saying he doesn't have a father. When Oskar saves Eli he allows her to kill Ginia's husband. It is confusing whether the Eli/Oskar partnership survives because they are willing to use violence to protect each other or if it survives because they are unable to process it fully.Alfredson uses visually detail and sound not only to create the sense of mood, but also to provide structure to the film. He uses little segments that almost act like still pictures to create a sense of chapters. The effect is like when the curtains open in a play and there is a new set on stage. In contrast to the visually bleak Swedish suburb in winter, the music almost seems to convey hope and the idea of beauty surviving amongst ugliness. It is a wonderful and successful contrast. While Alfredson is so skillful at creating the structure and mood through detail, he is less successful at supporting the story through the vampire details. When Eli appears nude, she has a scar that seems to indicate that she was once a boy. It is easy to get distracted, wondering if there is a homosexual element or even how Eli can go to the bathroom. Similarly, the detail of having to be asked in before a vampire can enter creates distraction. The viewer wonders why this rule applies to certain spaces and not others. Alfredson uses some details so frequently that it seems as if he is poking fun at the vampire motif. This is especially true with the vampire noise, the blood left on Eli's face, the dripping sound and the bad smell. Certainly, his intent is a little unclear, but perhaps that is also part of his plan.Alfredson leaves the viewer with more questions than answers. What type of story was he trying to tell? Who is Haskar? What is Haskar's relationship with Eli? Is Oskar's father's an alcoholic or is he gay? Was Ginia's husband abusive? Why is the one boy spared at the swimming pool? Is Oskar the new Haskar? Perhaps that is actually what Alfredson wanted to create. He leads the viewer through this story, but doesn't' provide all the answers so that the individual continues to wonder and question. In the end, maybe that haunting is a more effective form of horror.",Let the Right One In
426,sweisner,A love story bound by blood.,7,23 April 2014,"A compelling tale of friendship and understanding beyond boundaries, Tomas Alfredson's 2008 film ""Let the Right One In"" is at once atmospherically chilling and positively heart- warming. Kåre Hedebrant stars as Oskar, a slender twelve-year-old boy living in a Stockholm apartment block with his emotionally distant mother. Oskar soon befriends Eli (Lina Leandersson), a strange young ""girl"" who lives across the hall. As the film progresses, Oskar is fed more and more clues about Eli's true nature – she is a vampire, and presumably has been for a very long time. The girl has her boundaries, though, and Oskar is never placed at immediate risk – not by Eli, at least. Besides a troubled family life, Oskar's biggest problems lie at school, where he is bullied for his intelligence and independence. Eli's friendship and unquenchable blood-thirst become the answer to Oskar's troubles.""Let the Right One In"" stands out in several ways: the acting, sound mixing, and cinematography are all spot-on. Kåre and Lina have a very obvious chemistry that shines through in each scene they have together. Director Tomas Alfredson claims that it took almost a year's work scouring the Swedish countryside to secure such talent. At the time of the film's release, the two young actors were only thirteen years old – not too far off from Oskar and Eli's scripted ages, in fact. The sound editing – or, as Alfredson calls it, ""the soundscape"" – in this film is equally phenomenal. Even the smallest, most intimate noises are delicately synced with their corresponding on-screen actions: the riffle of paper in a classroom, for example, or Eli's amplified stomach-grumblings and lip-smackings. When every single movement is documented in sound, the atmospheric effect (and a gut-wrenching feeling of inclusion and reality) is inescapable. Couple these soundscapes with Johan Söderqvist's award-winning score, and the aural elements of the film truly make their mark. Visually, the shots are carefully placed – often in order to emulate Oskar's solitude or to build suspense through careful lighting and shadow work.It was a beautiful film to watch, and one that held my attention from start to finish. Thematically, it didn't sit quite so comfortably. Strange elements of vampire lore were tacked on to Eli's character without any real payoff – aside from arithmomania, since when do vampires like puzzles? And ""Let the Right One In"" had such a frequent, strong emphasis on mirrors and reflective window shots – but these never involved Eli! Maybe the special effects team reached their budget prematurely and couldn't erase the vampire's reflection, so they settled for a Rubik's cube instead. In any case, I was similarly baffled by Eli's moral tendencies. After draining the blood from her victims, the young vampire prefers to snap their necks (she even makes an interesting allusion to this fact while playing with the Rubik's cube). Maybe Eli is ashamed of her affliction and doesn't want to spread the curse to others – only one of Eli's victims, Ginia, actually becomes a vampire and then quickly commits suicide. But I was always under the impression that upon infection, vampires lose morality and humanity. So why did Eli act in this way? It just seems as though Alfredson couldn't quite paint a concrete image of the vampire due to its extensive lore – certainly, some factors are lost when crossing the cultural boundary to viewers in America. There were also a few dead- ends that I couldn't stop noticing: when hunting for blood, for example, Eli's ""dad"" preys exclusively on young men. I wonder if this was an attempt to make the audience fear for Oskar's life, but I never imagined the boy being at risk. Oskar's relationship with his own father was deceiving, too – it was explored briefly and confusingly. I thought Oskar's family life was hugely important to his development, and it should have received more attention in the film. For all its great artistic intent, I feel as though the ""message"" to this movie is extremely hard to interpret. In particular, the film's conclusion left me wondering: ""Is that all?"" Oskar leaves his family to be with Eli, and I got the gut-wrenching feeling that the boy would eventually become a father figure to her, as he grows and she does not. It is young love at its finest, I suppose – with no thought of the future, only of the present moment – but it is very disturbing to imagine Oskar facing the same fate as Eli's past guardian. After all, when a vampire gets desperate, a meal is a meal – the film made that absolutely clear. ""Let the Right One In"" tells the beginning of a complicated relationship in a beautiful way. But the film opened too many doors without permission or explanation, and for that it bleeds.",Let the Right One In

Strange, and only gives to-the-point answers to questions. They form a bond-and as the boy is looking for help with his bully problem, Eli is looking for someone to replace her caretaker (who has become complacent and quite frankly-tired of his duties). During the film, you see that they will become strong allies, and stronger friends as well. This movie is slower paced, but it pulls you in and you end up rooting for both of them.

I have a weakness for movies that make you like the monsters, and even after she drank buckets of innocent blood, and was obviously a stone cold killer, I couldn't help liking Eli. I mean everyone has to eat, I'm sure cows would like us all to be vegetarians, but that's not gonna happen. The movie left me wanting more.

I watched this because my cousin, a film director, recommended it to me and I'm a Scandino-phile, speaking Norwegian and able to read Swedish. I was blown away by this movie and the understated but eloquent performances by the child actors. Lina Leandersson is simply superb in her first film performance and she further endeared herself to me when I read in a Swedish newspaper interview that while vampires don't scare her, clowns do. It's a shared antipathy.The movie is atmospheric, low key and the violence, while understated by American standards, is necessary to the exposition of the plot. While Eli is the standout performance, Oskar is very well done and anyone who's ever been bullied can sympathize with him. He's just a little lost boy who meets an extraordinary friend and that relationship is really the heart of the film.The most horrifying thing about this movie is that it's currently being remade by Hollywood.

The horror is always lurking round the corner and there to let you know that the world is a hard place even if the story we see is kind of funny or fantastical.There are some mysteries everyone can figure out for themselves and the answers just add layers to this story that make it even better.

It's primarily a movie about how friendship can help you find your own personal strength. Two lonely children meet and change each other's lives. The fact that one is a vampire makes the movie even more interesting and unique, but it's not the most important plot detail. The cold darkness of Sweden makes the perfect backdrop for the story. It was so refreshing to see a vampire movie that doesn't rely upon cheap scares, fangs and gore. The only scene I didn't enjoy involved cats with computer animated faces - it looked very stupid and out of place, but this was a small disappointment in an otherwise outstanding film.

442,flick_182,"Not bad a vampire film, however...",6,4 May 2009,"I can see why people are fascinated with this film - it does have some credit for having a different take on a vampire story. However, even with this said, it does not make up for the fact that there were a number of unexplained things in the film. You have to read the FAQs to fill in the missing blanks in the film... for example, the ""father's"" relationship with Eli, her stitched crotch... From what I have read, the film is no where near as interesting as the book. What would have made the film more intriguing is if it included a background story of Eli's past... the film was suppose to show a flashback of this but it didn't because of some filming 'difficulties'. Clearly, the film did not think through such things and this is evident from the vagueness. If anything, this film made me feel arwkward in a number of scenes, like, for example when she climbs into Oskar's bed... naked. I guess you could say it was the film's attempt to establish a not-quite-so-normal relationship between the two young characters. Crotch or no crotch I found that disturbing. Also, in regards to the ending - why would a kid give up everything back home to escape with this vampire? I know this kid is being bullied, but surely, that is not enough to simply jump on the train to escape with a creature of the night. Simply, I don't understand why you would attach/associate yourself with a monster. Wouldn't you think that this monster might turn on you? It has to KILL HUMANS to live - now that is selfish need. You can't compare that to the equivalent of humans killing animals to survive. Also, the fact that 'love' is involved, it just goes to show what a crazy little boy Oskar is for attaching himself to a killer. I am sorry, but the ending was poor. Overall, the pace of the film was slow and boring - hence my disappointment.Obviously, this film got people talking about these things - good thing, no?

The movie is indeed a new spin on an old story and leaves you feeling as if you learned about these characters and not just gazed about them. The choice of sets and location was interesting in that it never really gave you a idea of where they were and the people we meet as the film unfolded were only the ones of any relevance and thus did not waste our time with useless side plots often used to hold up a weak main story, but no in this case.",Let the Right One In
444,user1265,not what it is publicized to be :-),10,22 March 2009,"I saw this movie for the first time last thursday, march 19. it impressed me so much that i wrote down some notes over the last 2 days and tonite went looking for discussion websites other than screenrant. looks like everybody already has seen it - comments since 2008. and i thought it was brand new :-) anyway, looks like jimina743 beat me to the chase but what follows occurred to me as i was cruzing home from the theatre, honest. to preserve any sense of my excitement i copied and pasted without editing: the feel of this movie is definitely a lot like Japanese Ringu. sparse dialog, hard relationships, supernatural black hair :-) the vampire assistant to oskar analogy is subtly introduced during the movie. i believed the assistant was eli's brother. maybe she was bitten in their childhood. he asked eli not to see the neighbor out of genuine concern for them being discovered. but that's not it.it may sound absurd but this movie is not about vampires and bloodshed. it is about adolescent psychology. this movie has only 1 character - the boy. all other subjects and events are time-compressed concurrent outcomes of his possible choices in life. it is about the boy's becoming deeply aware of own existence, his past, and the infinite paths of human experience. even the drawn-out length of the film has its intent: time is irrelevant. what may seem like a long time to the viewer is really only a fleeting moment of vivid imagination.Eli is of course his imaginary friend who is neither male nor female, but a strong-willed entity that eventually needs to ""go away in order to survive"", i.e. for the child to develop into a young man. Not simply dissipate like a dream but dissolve constructively, hence becoming a part of his psyche. open minds learn from each other exponentially. through this experience he learns to understand emotions and to comprehend his rage and thirst for vengeance. the title is precisely about that - choose which thoughts you let into your mind. i gotta admit this is one of the deepest stories i've seen in my life. of course it may be my imagination running amok here and this explanation is simply coincidental to the filmmakers' intent, a la mulholland drive craze.(insert a day's break)great times indeed. I was still high the next day from watching this movie :-) then on Friday night i went to see MDC play live and it was awesome /,,/. tonite i went back for a second look at the movie but it was sold out! so i decided to write some more instead.continuing my opinion, I want to emphasize one crucial scene where eli first comes to oskar's window. he lets this strange being into his domain, perhaps only to find out how ""she"" got to there. remember what the vampire told him - it is not a girl, for gender is irrelevant to a pure thought. nor is it a human being for it is as cold as the night. nor are they holding hands while in bed. -->Oskar's ""vision"" (most of film's story) starts and ends in the few moments when he is touching the cold window in his room. in the beginning it's his way of saying ""good night"" to the world and feeling her almost majestic frozen presence through the glass. the night's presence. i know this feeling exactly, because i've done this mini-ritual in my childhood. people from northern countries know what i'm writing about. can't get that effect in most of USA - not cold enough. it is a small step towards perceiving the energy of the universe, though very effective.back to the movie - it is not the vampire at the window. his own mind looks at him through the window - ""through the looking glass"". it is oskar's first encounter with self-consciousness, he is seeing himself from the side. and this is the crucial step when he decides to open the window (his mind) to something new. he welcomes a part of his mind that was unknown until now into the light. it is commonly known that a sense of touch can transcend into a dream. in oskar's ""dream"" he sees the flipside of the real world. it is not a cold vampire behind him in bed, it is the cold window in front. eli's cold hand is not holding his left had - he is touching the cold glass with his right hand. a question arises what will change if he chooses to keep this new awareness (going steady) and he answers to himself - nothing yet. for now it is just a turning point towards a new learning process.

445,naskeaton,"Sweet, Sad, and Scary",8,14 December 2009,"Let The Right One In is among the best horror films of the decade. Oskar is a lonely, tormented boy who befriends Eli, played with a unique maturity by Lina Leandersson, who is a 200 year old vampire in a 12 year old's body. Their friendship is the heart of the film, and the two young actors work beautifully together to create some memorably touching scenes, touching on the importance of friendship in a lonely world, and the innocence of young love. Both Oskar and Eli are lonely and alienated, and find shelter in each others' interest and approval. It works well enough on a dramatic stand alone to more than satisfy me, and the horror elements are there more as a backdrop to the emotionally sensitive story. The horror sequences are unique and creative, shot adeptly by Hoyte Van Hotema, with some genuinely disturbing scenes of violence and/or ""abnormal"" behavior by a child/teen. Equal parts moving and unpredictable, with plenty of great scares and an unforgettable ending, Let The Right One In is among the best horror films of the past 10 years.",Let the Right One In

I was rather surprised with the film for how insane it was in some places but in others, excellent screenplay and cinematography. I'm not a big fan of vampire films so when I realised this was a vampire I wasn't really ""pumped up"" to watch it. An was it worth it? Yes I would say so. Another vampire film trying to impress me but this one failed like all the others but from all the vampire films I have seen it has to be the second best, first being Nosferatu. The two main characters in the film, Oskar and Eli, are both portrayed as different to normal people in the world. The director shows how both have a sense for killing, Eli the vampire who has to kill and Oskar the 12 year old boy who wants to kill but has a choice. It is set in the winter of Sweden in 1980 and there is a very dark and cold feeling about the film from the minute it starts. It didn't have a lot of music which surprised me but when it did it was very mellow and dark to give a sense of something bad was going to happen in the next 2 minutes. It uses many generic conventions of the vampire in this film such as daylight burning a vampire, cats hatred of the vampire, sucking of blood and living in a coffin. It truly does follow the style of an ordinary vampire film which a sort of like. Keep to the basics (not like Twilight). Overall I have to say it was an alright vampire film with some twists and turns around each corner but none the less it can't beat my favourite vampire film Nosferatu. At least it was better than Twilight. (Vampires that glitter in the sun? what a load of dollop!)",Let the Right One In

Very often, as is the case here apparently, a 'foreign' film like this will be remade by Hollywood to a) remove the subtitles for the benefit of a whole nation who famously doesn't like them and b) take a little of the Scandinavian 'weird' out of the equation; if successful, the movie invariably becomes a little less disbelievable.I give this one a score of 3 for its outstanding cinematography and for the acting of the young female lead (no-one else), otherwise it merits a zero - if only as a lesson to the director to take more care with his audience....",Let the Right One In

451,calbee,More than meets the eyes - don't be fooled by the simple story line.,8,3 April 2009,"I like this movie. It drew my attention when I saw its bluray disc in local store. After checking reviews in IMDb, I decided to go for it since Twilight being too Hollywoodized is definitely not my cup of tea.The pace may be a bit slow to those whose are used to Hollywood production. However, if you are willing to ""feel"" the story and pay attention to details, a lot more have been told in very subtle manners.The story is simple, but I believe the relationships between main characters (Oskar, Eli, Hakan)are far more complex. A lot more have been told if you pay more attention to details and sequence. I believe there are more to be told if there is/are sequel(s). (Later I saw reviews saying that there are more than one books for the series).Anyway, I try my best to list some of these below:*** This comment may contain spoilers *** First of all, I have not read the book. The followings are just my pov.1) The relationship of Eli and Hakan. It seems like a father/protector to his daughter. But hell I think he was her lover. As Eli once told Oskar that she has been 12 for many years. Then Hakan is likely to be Eli's ""previous"" Oskar. Hakan got old but Eli stays at 12.2) I was confused by Eli's behavior and how she speaks to Oskar that she is like 12-year old girl. That is not reasonable after she claimed that she has been 12-year old for many years. One explanation to that is that Eli is acting. But why? it is obvious that she acts to get close to Oskar. For what? for getting him to be Hakan's successor for Hakan is too old that he could not even kill for her. Make any sense? I remember the first scene Eli speaks after Hakan forgot to bring the blood back to the apartment. Eli was angry saying if she should do it herself. Her behavior in that scene did not seem like being 12, more like an adult saying. And remember the night Eli actively befriended with Oskar, Eli was extremely hungry. This strengthen her intention to find a successor. 3) The scene discloses Eli's private part shocked me. I initially doubted if that is necessary. However I remember Eli told Oskar twice that she is not a girl. (I initially thought that was mis-translated, or she was referring she was not human.) But that arguable shot seems like she has a scar there. I start doubting if Eli is really a female vampire. Honestly speaking, you can't tell a 12-year-old boy from a girl sometimes, right? Specially when Vampire happened to have pale skin. The question is why should he pretend to be a girl. I think it is because a 12-year old boy is not strong enough to do the hard work. Hence, kill for blood as if it was murder (to hide vampire's existence, of course). Therefore, he has to borrow someone's strength, that is a male protector like Hakan, or Oskar in the future. Then being a girl is ""easier"" to get these people involved. This intention also explains that why Eli ""trained"" Oskar to use violence to fight back his school mates, because violence is what Oskar needs to bring Eli food (blood) in future.Therefore, it is a story about a male vampire pretending to be a 12-year old girl finding his next food supplier because the current one is too old for his job. Eli find and train Oskar to be Hakan's successor.I hope the above pov make sense, and brings more thoughts about the story. To me, the story has more subtle story lines from its simple story telling. You may want to give multiple viewing in order to discover more.Highly recommended.",Let the Right One In
452,justinlandau6,One of the best vampire films in a long time.,10,14 October 2010,"Let The Right One In is a touching, brilliant story that explores the underlying pains and feeling of two young children, both social outcasts for different reasons. While the film explores the life of a bullied child, it also explores Eli's secluded life as a vampire. Cinematically, the shots are beautiful and mesmerizing, the acting brilliant, and the plot gripping right up till the last scene. Rather than pure gore and fear, the film probes deeper into the psyche of both children, essential to acknowledging the possible innocence and humane side of vampires. It has proved to me yet again, that truly good horror films and art films are being made not in Hollywood, but in Europe and Asia, focusing less on glitz and big name stars, but on the storyline and psyche of the viewer.",Let the Right One In

The first and second time i truly thought that film was beautiful - with real innocence and true love or friendship. But after watching it for the 3rd , after a long long time (i think at least 3 years) i now find it less innocent and extremely haunting! I somehow find Eli to be extremely manipulative... although he/she doesn't do anything too extreme in front of Oskar, but Eli's behaviour in front of Oskar seems to be building on Oskar's loneliness and vulnerability in order to get herself a new caretaker! As for the Hakan ( i think) she was already prepared to replace him. And I suspect why Hakan was killing boys of that age was mainly to stop Eli from getting emotionally involved with the boys - also because of the envy that he is no longer the young boy he used to be!Nevertheless, still a good watch at the 3rd time!

While it is somehow tagged as horror, I would consider it more to lean on the drama part of it's classification - of course everything is subjective but I found very few scenes to actually be typical of the horror film genre. That is not to say the film doesn't have its scary moments or suspense, but it is, how would I say it, a very subdued experience if all you're used to are the all too common jump scares and slasher tendencies of modern horror films.There are few other things that might rub some other viewers the wrong way as well; At points, its pacing feels very slow. The supporting cast are largely paper thin as characters, I personally wish their stories would have been elaborated upon a bit more.Those thing aside, this is an amazing production with great performances from the main cast, and definitely some of the best child actor performances in recent memory as many others have noted. The setting of 1980's Sweden is done very well, adding to the overall feel of the film.I would consider this a must see film for all fans of vampire myths, this film certainly does add its own, worthy chapter to it.",Let the Right One In

460,malickisawesome,Squeal Like a Pig!,7,27 July 2013,"North Sweden. A snowy winter night in an apartment complex. A reflection off a window of a young boy in his underwear with bleached blonde hair. ""Squeal. Squeal like a pig"" the boy says while holding a large hunting knife, thrusting it in a forward motion. It is amazing to watch a film handle with such skill the introduction of its main character. Oskar(Kare Hedebrant), a boy of twelve, is in an alienating and cold world in which his only release from it is to plot his revenge against it. Oskar is bullied, as some kids are at his age, and like most kids his age he doesn't stand up to them. But he is smart and curious and will go places later in life. But the bullies are not the main focus of the film. Rather it is the relationship between Oskar and a girl who just moved in next door, Eli, played by the other worldly Lina Leandersson. And that is all I will tell you about the plot. I know the trailers and other reviews have given away its key plot element but I will not. It is unnecessary in order to attract people to this feature because the relationship between Oskar and Eli, beyond being the true focus of the story, is the film's emotional center. Tomas Alfredson, the director of the grainy spy thriller Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy(2011), and John Lindqvist, adapting the screenplay based on his own book, are not interested in the lore of this key plot element. They only use it as a ruse in order to increase the terror, in rather clever reveals of exposition.Eli provides a much desired companionship and warmth to the lonely Oskar - both in terms of the character and the color scheme, adding some reds to the overall coldness of the film. Alfredson shoots in long, static shots to truly capture the enveloping nature of its climate, which strengthens its thematic resonance. The film is perfectly set in a Scandinavian country, in which the winters, since Bergman has been filming there, have reflected an existential angst regarding the world. And so it does in this film for both of main characters. Yet, I would not want you to get the wrong idea about this film. This is a horror film. There are excerpts of graphic violence. But they are nevertheless concealed from the camera because, unlike some horror films, this film knows that true horror lies in the imagination of the audience, not in the gore on the screen.Despite my high praise, I suppose I do not consider the film to be that great because of the ending. Without giving away too much, there is a confrontation in which Oskar is in danger of dying and is saved. Hopefully without sounding too heartless, the fact that he is saved adds a misplaced romanticism, which was absent from the rest of the film. Not necessarily that I wanted him to die but the film seemed to be building to a more tragic ending than what was delivered. Nevertheless, Let The Right One In is a cold, angst-filled coming-of-age story that is a little more than your average horror film.",Let the Right One In

465,semicharm,Trick of light and shadows,4,6 February 2018,"There's plenty of other reviews that cover the basic premise of the film, so I'll just get to the point. After watching ""Let the Right One In"" and now rereading the same reviews that lured me to it, I'm completely befuddled. It seems as though I did not quite see the same film as everyone else. Sure, the film is in Swedish, the scenes and plot points were the same as the reviews described, but I apparently saw the film in a different light. They say it's a love story, I see a tragedy. They say the long wide-angle shots of snow were ""atmospheric"", where as I felt the scenes were slow, dull, empty--emblematic of so much of what is wrong with the film. Before I get into that, I would say the one thing that I truly liked about the film was Eli. Most modern films of its genre are huge overproduced blockbusters with tons of exposition, backstory, and/or gratuitous gore. Eli stands in absolute contrast. She's shy, enigmatic and, I may say, wonderfully understated. She has very few lines, so most of her story is told through her interactions with other characters and the actress' performance. Eli seems bored, trapped by her circumstances, as I suppose someone in her situation would be. Throughout the film, there are nice little hints and glimpses of her true nature before the ""reveal"". It shouldn't come as a surprise to those who'd been paying attention. The break from her normally shy and reserved demeanor in the reveal was a bit jarring, I give the film a point for pulling that off as well. Also, beneath her facade of shy innocence is a deceptive manipulator. There's a lot of other clues about Eli that almost no one seemed notice, but I'll get to that in a bit. In spite of her age, I feel the actress gave a solid performance that outshines even her elder castmates. Most of the film, overall, is average at best. The cinematography is ""effective"" at conveying the story. However, the pace of the film is glacial. While some slow-paced films take their time to build to something, this one seemed more interested in long shots establishing the ""mood"" than building plot or character. Much of this is to do with editing, how the film budgets its time with various elements. I wanted to know more about the characters and what was going on with them, but no...it feels like those scenes were cut short to make more time for cinematic ""atmosphere"" or other extraneous filler. For example, all of the scenes with Oskar's dad could just as well had been cut, as he's otherwise not part of the plot and the short phone calls with Oskar's mom said more about him and his relationships than any of his actual screen time. Hell, after all of the time spent with Oskar, the main character of the film, what can one really say about him? He's about middle-school aged, his parents are estranged and living apart, he's bullied by some of the schoolboys, he has a hobby, and a weird neighbor. A lot of his screen time is spent with all these things related to him, but the film says very little about what he thinks or feels. The rest of the performances are mostly average. Some characters were a bit understated and some were melodramatic, but a least they give some insight into their feelings and motivations. However, the lack of depth in Oskar is what really kills the film for me. He portrays very little about himself and rarely reacts to anything unless it affects him directly, in the moment. Even worse, the actor just can't act. I've seen other films with socially challenged characters that still managed to pour much more ""character"" into their roles. Oskar was as wooden as Pinocchio, only without any aspirations of becoming a boy. The film could have just as well had an actual block of wood stand-in while the actor read his few lines off camera without much consequence to the film. Eli's caretaker is similar to Oskar in many respects, but even he manages to portray more about himself in his few scenes than Oskar does in the entire movie. Also, the plot gives very little motivation behind Oskar. He's mostly a puppet of his circumstances, tumbling through life, lost in his own world until he meets Eli. The main character and actor are crucial to a film's success and Oskar fails to hit any mark. The only things I feel for him are boredom and pity. I pity myself more for haven't been suckered into watching the film. So, what did everyone miss? What makes this a tragedy rather than a romance? Looking at the plot from Eli's side rather than Oscars, things take on a very different perspective. (If I still, somehow, haven't dissuaded you from watching the film, I'll try to avoid any outright spoilers.) Eli's caretaker is an older man, likely in his 60s, who seems to be a little slow, dull, and socially challenged--much like Oskar. Eli's relationship with her caretaker is manipulative and abusive. By coincidence, one night she meets Oskar, who is also a social outcast. Oskar isn't put off by her peculiarities, because he's so desperate to have a friend and otherwise oblivious. Though Eli seems to develop feelings for Oskar too, she repeatedly uses and manipulates him for her own means--things she can't easily do herself. The similarities with Oskar and her caretaker, and Eli's relationships with them, don't seem to be a coincidence. None of this is explicitly said in the movie, as much is done without any real explanation, but there is a lot of subtext.",Let the Right One In
466,chacal8,Genius,10,3 July 2010,"It's late here... I wonder sometimes who reads these reviews... I decided to write it because i really enjoyed this film, and how it made me feel. I just finished watching it, so i still feel myself involved by the whole thing. I don't think it's ""cool"" to be a vampire, glamorous or charming, as it has been presented before in many other films and stories. I think this film makes the abominable, gruesome part of being a vampire quite clear. The beauty of it is in the acceptance of this condition and the transcendence of compassion. Friendship and mutual understanding. Caring and love. I enjoy when these things are so precisely portrayed, and when it is done in such a cleaver way, it's just all the more touching. it is difficult to approach these themes successfully, every year there are hundreds of films trying it, i wouldn't spend a minute of my life watching most of them, failed attempts destined to sink back into the noise of the mass media industry. It is once in a while that i come across something like this, simple and well made, technique (in all departments) well applied to tell a great story.

Kare Hederbrant as Oskar and Lina Leandersson as Eli present us with a vampire tale in a way we've never seen before. That , in itself, makes for a memorable evening at the movies. Here, the idea of longing is as beautifully portrayed as the idea of loneliness. We can actually see it and taste it. The structure and pace are clearly Nordic but the palpitating heart at its center is winningly universal. The bullied boy that looks like a girl and the mysterious girl who looks like a boy build a never seen before coupling of opposites.

This movie transcends the genres, and it would be unfair to describe it as a horror movie or a love story or anything like that. Its so much more than that. By reading my words you'll probably see that its quite hard to describe the movie in the way it deserves to be described. But let me just point one thing out. Transferring fantasy into a real world environment is an amazing way to reestablish the intensity that these ideas deserve. Nowadays that became the only way to create real horror and credibility, even though we know that we're just watching a movie. All the crap we saw during the end of the 90s and the beginning of the new century was so much overdoing it in terms of effects, bombast and unrealistic ideas (think of Underworld, Hellsing, Armageddon, Independence Day, or all Batman movies before Chris Nolan) that we now have to go back to the essence of these genres to give them a new spirit for the coming decades. ""Let the right one in"" is a perfect example for this attempt and there are many more (Batman Begins, Dark Knight, even movies like Superbad or Knocked Up) - they are all much closer to reality than their predecessors.

It's a dark movie, full of poetry and deeply disturbing. In one word: Powerful.

Alfredson breaks these norms and presents us a modern version of ""Nosferatu"" where the vampire is a young girl, who becomes friends with Oskar, a shy 12 year old boy.

To me this is a very shallow film, which don't awake any feelings towards the characters. The acting is not very good. You don't believe in the characters.

I didn't find the movie very horrifying, it does not contain any scenes which would make you clutch your seat, but it has a dark and cold vibe from beginning to end. People have experimented with vampires falling in love since a long time but a child vampire ( 12 years more or less....) is new and makes the romantic part of the movie just as good as the cold part of it. Performances of Eli and Oskar are awesome though the scope for showing for their acting talents was less. The scene where Eli joins Oskar in his bed and decide to go ""steady"" and the climax scene are worth giving a special mention. The viewer is left thinking on what Eli thinks of the relationship between her and Oskar, if its gonna be something like between her and Hakan or a romantic one, which I think is intentional and good that it was left out, since it goes with the cold vibe of the movie.",Let the Right One In
480,consuelo-holtzer-1,review of the film Let The Right One In,10,24 February 2008,"This review may be seen as containing spoilers – I don't think it does but a warning just in case. Be wary of genre classifications here: to call this a mere vampire film without qualification would be a disservice. A vampire film it is, but one that belongs to a very select club. Midway through, I imagined the ghosts old Bela and Tod Browning hobnobbing with a Mr Bergman, all three of them living up every moment of this elegant little tale of horror. With minimal special effects, no flashy editing and cinematography that leaves its imprint on your mind for days, Alfredson's layered film about cruelty and goodness, exclusion and marginality – for both vampire and human alike – is told through the unlikely friendship of two 12-year-old loners. One, Oskar, albino-like in his white blondness, is bullied at school. The other, Eli, a dark, unkempt and unorthodox girl vampire, teaches him to stand up for himself. In the background is the strange, devoted, slightly bumbling Hakan, Eli's human protector and blood gatherer. He strings his victims up, cuts them open then siphons their blood into jerricans for Eli to drink. He passes as her father. (Is he?)The film has a strong physical impact. The fatigue and drudgery (and anguish) of Hakan's attempts to find refurbishment; the confinement of Eli's agelessness (""I have been 12 for a long time""); the isolation of the dreary suburban setting in the dead of a Swedish winter – all of these are as palpable as the burden of eternity felt by Wenders' two angels watching over Berlin. The film's cadence is that of a macabre Bolero: slow and tame at the beginning, but relentlessly progressing, louder and louder until the film starts to explode in a series of horrific scenes towards the end. Troubling questions left unresolved only add to the film's richness and depth. Eli's labia stitched shut, her relationship with her protector. Why does he kill in her place? – because she is young?  to avoid a proliferation of vampires? When Eli finally has to find her own blood, thus turning a bitten woman into a vampire herself, the sequences that follow – the cat attack, willed self-destruction – are some of the most striking in the film, frightening enough to make your heart skip a thump. There are two ""endings"". Alfredson lures us into a false one when he circles the film back to a scene almost identical to that at the opening. But then he playfully tacks on another 10 or 15 minutes in a very different tone. At first this rattled me a bit, but then I came to better terms with it and decided that after all, its black humour was far from a cop out. Reviewers have predicted the film will have a solid festival and art house audience. Personally, I cannot imagine any kind of film-goer not being dazzled by this icy trip through bloodied woods, and where, according to the many reactions to the film, a light ""supposedly"" shines through. It does and doesn't. The film may be about friendship but the relief provided by the ending is only an isolated moment in time that has resolved nothing. The future that one is left to imagine for the survivors is disturbing at best.",Let the Right One In
481,c99432,Twilight vs. Let the right one in: immaturity vs classics,10,1 December 2008,"I have watched both Twilight and Let the Right one in.I strongly feel that Let the Right outruns Twilight on almost EVERY SINGLE ASPECT, except, of course, advertisement, due to the inequality of budgets. (a Swedish director vs a Hollywood one, come on...) If Twilight is no more than an idol gallery under the skin of vampire horror, Let the Right one in is such a film that completely redefines people's perception on traditional vampire horrors.There aren't many gory scenes or special visual impacts, unlike Twilight being fraught with computer generated scenes. Plus, the pace of Let the Right is slow, without many exaggerations. Yet, the audience could feel the profound impact of the film within, an impact that totally transcends cheap sensory stimuli, while exerting a quiet yet POWERFUL ""shake"" upon people's soul.I felt very upset that an American remake will be done next year. From our common sense, we could deduct how the remake would be compared to the original. Before the remake ruins the story, do yourself a favour watching the originals!!!If you feel yourself mentally more mature than 15 y.o., go watch Let the Right on in instead of Twilight.

It is a real pity that when you mention the plot summary (Love story between a human and a vampire) every body immediately goes into Twilight and dismiss this movie, when there is absolutely not even a chance to comparison.It is incredible how ""Let the right one in"" trespasses boundaries to revive a genre that in the last years haven't been giving us much surprises. The most amazing thing is that it doesn't betray any vampire rules to establish a hell of a love story. The Vampires in this movie have qualities that were forgotten in the last years such as the same title of the movie, of inviting a Vampire to your house for him or her to enter.Also is just a delight to see the love story plot around, not entering any of the ""clichés"" of being converted into a vampire for the story to continue to go on. The innocence of the characters and the strange relationship between human and vampire inks the story with a twist you will never imagine and finally become in love with.This movie got it all: Well plot story, a very special love charm, suspense in every corner waiting to jump on you and obviously Vampires.

483,marco-491,The best film ever.,10,18 July 2009,"Låt den rätte komma in is a tender story about a bullied boy (Oskar) that finds true friendship in his new girl next door, but she turns out not to be something one would prefer to have in the house next to you.When I first watched the trailer back in October 2008, I was immediately hooked, because the acting, setting and just the cinematography just seemed so ""eerie"" to me. Which is something I rarely see in films. And I am not a vampire film/tale fan at all. And still I was hooked on a Swedish vampire film.Then I finally got to see it in January 2009. And I have to say, I just couldn't move for 20 minutes after the film ended. I just could not believe what I just saw: the best film ever.Everything about Låt den rätte komma in is perfect. The acting, directing, setting... it's all perfect. And what makes the story so good is the subtle nuance and sense of truth it is told with. There is no bombastic ""I present you this out of the ordinary tale"". In fact, it's like seeing the truth - which I never had before when watching a vampire film (for instance, Twilight). I was also thrilled to find out that Dutch ""colleage"" Hoyte van Hoytema did the cinematography. And I got to say, van Hoytema did a perfect job. In fact, I think this is the best work I've ever seen from a Dutch cinematographer! The cinematography was perfect, lightening balanced, realistic and the image was a bit pale, something that really added to the ""bleach"" and ""washed out"" identity of that neighborhood and its residents.But the thing that really gave the film its ""awesomeness"", is Johan Söderqvists amazing score. The tender themes (played both on piano and guitar) brought tears to my eyes while the more horror-sound design cues gave me chills. No Hollywood-composer could write a better score to this film than Söderqvist did, that's why I am especially not so happy with Matt Reeves' remake. Only if they bring Söderqvist in for the score will I truly consider that remake to be worth the same recognition as as Alfredson's. Otherwise, ""Let me in"", will be much less interesting than Låt den rätte komma in .",Let the Right One In

The way the story slowly unfolds the relationship of the characters and exposes possible futures that leave us thinking about it at work a couple of days later is the mark of a truly well told story.Great to see films with stillness like ""LROI"", ""Autumn"" and ""30 Days of Night"" are starting to get footholds in the market.

'let the right one in' is horror interwoven with an emotional trip on the sides of two teenagers, one troubled and bullied, the other one vulnerable and blood thirsty. that said, there is still enough blood dripping into the snow-covered Swedish landscape to justify 'horror' as the genre... an extra candy for me is the setting of the story in the early eighties, bringing up own teenager memories and that bittersweet nostalgia... unfortunately the English dubbing is less than mediocre and i'm sure this made the movie loose some of its original charm - i wish i understood Swedish...",Let the Right One In

Only now after I've witnessed the genius that went into making 'Let The Right One In' do i understand why twilight is so popular among the brainless section of the society.Getting back to this movie, it is a story about a boy (constantly bullied in school) who befriends a vampire, and this is how a vampire-love story was to be filmed in the first place, the lead actors play their roles to perfection, and the affection they have for each other is much more convincing in comparison to the lead actors of twilight (who are much older and experienced in movies). Even though it had some scenes where one couldn't help but go ""WTF""! (example:the head in the swimming pool), it cannot be classified as a horror movie, it is much more about the romance Oskar and Eli (the lead characters) share with each other. Although i don't understand Swedish , i am of the opinion that the English wouldn't have worked as perfectly with this movie, the incomprehensible language added to the spine chilling effect.After i finished watching it i wanted to go out to every person who ever liked twilight and give then the DVD of this movie and show them the finger.It is going to win the Oscar for best foreign film for sure, and a little part of me believes the lead actors should be given special appreciation awards, those kids blew me away.",Let the Right One In

It absolutely is one of the bests for the ones who would like to watch a movie which has vampire image but differs from synonyms bringing an original look.

Oscar is a troubled young boy who is bullied at school by a gang of ruthless classmates and ignored at home by an overworked mother. His absentee Father is a borderline alcoholic and he has developed an obsession with murder.While acting out a fantasy murder he meets a young girl named Eli who has moved in next door to him and soon becomes her one and only friend. Eli however has secrets of her own. She is a vampire, the lecherous old man she stays with is a paedophile obsessed with her and willing to kill for her.Despite all of this the two children become inseparable and develop strong emotional dependencies for one another.Well i suppose that is enough amateur summing up for the time being, but suffice to say the story is original and intriguing from start to finish.The child stars of the film both play there parts amazingly, putting across what seems to be real tension and feeling with in the lines, hammering home the point of innocent love.In conclusion all i can really say is that, is you are looking for a great coming of age drama with a twist and are fed up of all the commercial vampire trash being thrown around at the moment (twilight saga to name just one) then it is definitely worth checking this film out.To flee is life, to linger Death.",Let the Right One In

The movie infects you. You will keep wondering about the minute details, the film screens and dialogs fully alive in your memory. I believe the most fascinating skills that the producer, script writer and actors show is the the sense of proportion.

494,emcartersf,Arguably the worst book adaptation of all time (Spoilers).,1,11 August 2013,"(Mild spoilers below contrasting scenes in both the book and film)It is universally accepted that most books far exceed their film adaptation counterparts. Even most well-produced film adaptions fall short because they cannot compete with the sheer scope of most books combined with the reader's limitless imagination. With that said, I feel the adaption of Let the Right One is arguably one of the worst book-to-film adaptions in modern cinema.By way of background, I've been familiar with the movie for some time after it earned some praise on the international film festival circuit, but never set aside the time to watch. Prior to a recent vacation I was happy to discover the movie was based on a book while browsing for some airplane reading material. After finishing the book, I thought it was well-written and original for what has become a rather tired genre. One must also recognize the book was written almost a decade ago (2004), well before the likes of Twilight and True Blood were introduced. After completing the book I was very excited to see the film. I know from experience that foreign films tend to be more graphic and envelope- pushing relative to what we see here in the US. There were a number of absolutely horrific scenes in the book (when left to your imagination) and I was curious to see how they played out on screen. Fast forward to the movie... in short I was grossly disappointed with the film and turned it off after thirty to forty minutes. Understanding that books are usually much better than their film adaptations, I cannot understand how this movie received any praise at all. The production, acting and screenplay were all very pedestrian. I can forgive poor-to- mediocre child acting, as two of the film's main characters are children. However, the screenplay and directing abhorrent.The following two descriptions compare two scenes as they occur in both the book and film. Spoiler #1: In the beginning of the book (and movie), Hakan (the older male who lives with and is obsessed with Eli - the young vampire) gasses and kills a young man in the forest outside of Stockholm for his blood - to feed Eli. The young man (after being gassed) is strung up on a tree so that Hakan can drain his blood while still alive. In the book, I imagined this as a very macabre scene, with the act taking place in a dark corner of the forest, removed from any foot traffic or line of sight from other people. In the movie, the gassing scene took place under a bright streetlight in a park where you could see well into the distance, assuming people could have seen this act taking place from afar. The actual murder scene also occurred in the brightest night setting I have ever seen on film. In the book, Hakan succeeds in draining the victim's blood with the crime scene being discovered the following day. In the film, Hakan is interrupted by two pedestrians and their dog. In haste, Hakan manages to pack all of his tools into his ""death kit"" but somehow forgets the blood container. Somehow, once Hakan gets home, he is seen unpacking his kit and manages to look surprised when he discovers he forgot the blood back at the scene. Spoiler #2: In the book, there is a rather disturbing scene where young Oskar (the book's protagonist) is branch whipped by a trio of bullies after school. The scene was disturbing but very effective in portraying the fear, torment and pain experienced by young Oskar. In the film, most of the whipping is done by the wimpiest bully I've ever seen with a flexible, vine-like branch. I actually laughed during the scene (after considering what was portrayed in the book).",Let the Right One In
495,moncale,This movie _Dares_ you to watch it.,1,13 May 2012,"After seeing so many stunning reviews of this poor excuse of a freshman high school film project, I watched it. This is, without a question, one of the absolute Worst ""movies"" I have ever seen. Your first clue should be the multitude of reviews that start out with: ""Brilliantly original work of art"", ""A Masterpiece"", ""Pure brilliance"", ""Transcendence From Genre"", or even ""European cinematography at its best"". Reviews like this should be taken as a sign to run, not walk, but RUN, for the exits. The plot is void, the child actors are more wooden than mature Oaks, the scenery is Marxist gray, drab, Nordic, government housing during the winter months. This is a ""film"" only an out of work, liberal arts, film student could prattle on about while sipping lattes in an over-priced foo-foo coffee shop. To any other viewer, this movie is a crime against humanity. It would be banned by (ironically enough), the Geneva Convention, as cruel and inhumane punishment were political prisoners forced to watch it. How any thinking, rational being could watch this and call it ""art"" or ""sublime"" or any of another dozen foo-foo adjectives is beyond me. This film commits the mortal sin of stealing from every one who watches it, over 2 hours of your life which you will never, Ever, get back. It will actually make you stupider and stupider as you watch it. It will suck the very life force, and, the will to live, out of you. Given the opportunity to to sit in a closed garage with your car running and it's poisonous exhaust slowly filling the garage or watching this movie, opt for the garage... Words fail me at this point. It truly was _That_ bad. You have been warned.",Let the Right One In
496,WaspEnterprises89,Let the Right One In Review,10,18 May 2013,"The movie that I'm going to be reviewing is called Let the Right One In. There was also a book that came out in 2004 by the same name by John Ajvide Lindqvist. They also made a remake called Let Me In (2010), which drifted further away from the novel and was a pointless exercise to capitalize on the success of the original. Although I like The Twilight Saga for the most part, I prefer Let the Right One In, because it takes more risks and delves into more themes.The film is about a young boy named Oskar (played by Kare Hedebrant) who lives with his mother and regularly visits his father, but he has also become the target of bullying. In the beginning of the film, a young boy named Eli (played by Lina Leandersson) moves into the apartment next to his with Hakan (played by Per Ragnar), his guardian. We find out that he's also a vampire who needs Hakan to go out and collect blood for him. Oskar and Eli end up meeting for the first time outside of the apartment building on a jungle gym and throughout the course of the movie, they form a bond.Let the Right One In stands apart from other vampire movies in the sense that Eli's appearance gives off a kind of fairy tale aspect and the fact that he shows emotion after he's murdered someone for blood. An interesting take on the character of Eli was discussed by Anne Billson in her book, ""Let the Right One In (Devil's Advocates)"", she said that ""Eli is nothing like traditional movie vampires such as Dracula or Elizabeth Bathory, and the only thing she seems to have in common with more recent movie vampires, such as Selene from the Underworld films or Edward Cullen from the Twilight series, is her preternatural strength and speed"". What also distinguishes him from other vampires is the fact that he was a a boy before he became a vampire and was castrated, but seems to identify more as a girl by his appearance. Even though it was subtly done in the movie than the book about Eli's gender, I think that's what makes the relationship special between Oskar and Eli is the fact that not only is he a vampire, but he was also castrated and Oskar doesn't discover that until later on. Some of my favorite scenes from the movie is when Eli is sitting in front of the wall where Oskar's room is on the other side and he touches the wall with his head down. I felt that that scene was effective in conveying Eli's loneliness and his desperation to connect with somebody. The other scene that I liked was the kiss at the end between Eli and Oskar because of how beautiful it was. The music added to the beauty of the scene.I feel that this film can be enjoyed by everybody, regardless if you're a fan of vampires or not. The relationship between the two main characters is well-written and the fact that Eli is not only a vampire, but a male makes it an interesting coming of age story. The music in the scenes with Oskar and Eli gives it added emphasis of the special romance that these two characters share. The acting is excellent on all accounts and the way it was filmed was amazing.Grade: A",Let the Right One In
497,polo_nordic,"Beautiful, original and very good!",9,3 November 2008,"I would say this one.. I'm not a big vampire freak, just a movie freak. I saw ""Let the right one in"" yesterday here in Sweden. Let me say that we haven't been spoiled with good movies in Sweden the last couple of years, often it's the same kind of drama and comedies. This movie really came out of nowhere, well from a book actually but you get what I mean.It's truly a movie that everyone should see, we have two amazing 13 year old actors (12 years in the movie). They are absolutely flawless and there is so much depth, some things you don't need to have served on a plate, like all good movies you use our brain and imagination a little bit to.So why is this movie so strong? *Captures the 80's in Sweden in a way I have never seen before, also the darkness in the movie (winter) gives it a slow, depressing and beautiful look.*The photo is really good, some of the ""scare scenes"" are done with just creepy music and a camera 10-15 yards away standing still. This gives the movie a very realistic look.*Realism is a word you have to use when talking about this movie. There is nothing over the top really (except that it's about a vampire girl:) ). There is maybe 3-4 CGI scenes in the whole movie but still it doesn't feel low budget at all, and very realistic. Not very common when it comes to these genre.* There is so much under the surface: Friendship, sadness, loneliness, romance (in a strange kind of way) and of course the very strong but needed scenes were Oscar is bullied. You leave the theatre with a very strong feeling and you think about this movie for days after.*The ending is very original and once again you use your imagination, a beautiful, strange, somewhat disturbing and maybe a bit sad?. Well, this is all in the eyes of the viewer.Of course there is going to be a US-remake on this movie, I say: Don't touch it. Some things are best to leave alone. And this movie is.I have seen many many movies, in all kind on genre. Would say that ""Let the right one in"" is one of the best thriller/drama/horror movies out there, ever. If this movie isn't nominated for best foreign film I will never watch the Oscar's again! 8,5/10 Best regards /André",Let the Right One In
498,ifjed,"Holy Exploding Vampires, Batman!",1,30 May 2009,"I don't think there is any ""spoiler"" information here but I'll check ""spoiler"" just in case so I don't get blacklisted.I was recently in Madrid on a family visit and as always my wife and I took the opportunity to see first-run, original version movies at one of Madrid's many fine movie houses. The movie we went to see was Lät den rätta komma in; all the movie reviewers in La Guía del Ocio gave it either four or five stars (out of five) and I lived for a time in Sweden and used to speak a little Swedish, I thought it would be good to hear the language again. However, neither of us knew it was a vampire flick since the description in the Guía didn't say this. Here are my suggestions if you decide to go see this movie: 1) Take a silver stake along with you...to drive through your own heart because this is a movie that refuses to die, but you can, at least, put yourself out of your misery.2) If possible, download a copy of ""Cat People"" onto your cell phone so that immediately afterward you can immediately watch it to remind yourself what a good ""horror"" movie is like (in this case, ""Cat People""). No, I know, ""Cat People"" is terrible, in fact, it's so bad it's worth seeing, and sadly it's better than ""Låt den rätta komma."" ""Låt den rätta komma"" in is painful to watch when it isn't downright laughable. Even within a fantasy genre, there are rules and traditions. A director/author can't simply add elements that aren't a part of the genre without, at least, attempting to explain how these elements came to be part of the story. And there are plenty of unexplained ""new"" elements in this movie, some of which are just plain ridiculous, even in a fantasy thriller genre film. Plus there are plenty of scenes that simply have nothing to do with the storyline. If a scene doesn't move the story forward...cut it out; at almost two hours some scenes definitely could have been cut out.The *only* good part of the movie was the acting of the young vampire, so if you are simply a vampire fan, you may wish to see this film. I'm neither pro- nor anti-vampire, but I literally laughed almost uncontrollably through most of the second half of the movie (which I realize may have bugged the more serious vampire fans), but I couldn't help it.

It quietly develops a wonderful love story about two outsiders. It contains many typical elements of a vampire movie, and of course you get to ask, who is the real monster, human beings or others? Besides that, you find the typical Scandinavian dry humour and a message, to accept others, as they are. When I left the cinema, I couldn't get the grin out of my face hand and I walked home with goose-pimples, not because of horror, but because of happiness and the beauty of this film. I just hope, the copies after the release will be better than the one I saw.

I wasted around two hours in this. I recommend not to see this at all. Ignore totally waste of time. Sweden is such a beautiful country and people are more gorgeous. This film is a disgrace. From the beginning it goes on aimlessly and there is no sense of purpose. It shows everything in bad light and I wonder what purpose the movie was taken in the first place for.

Finally a film that show us why we love the vampire folklore. So so many films have tried, missed the essence and gotten it horribly wrong. It's a slow paced beautifully crafted film that blends genres and emotions that one normally would think impossible to mix. It's eerie but warm, it's very sympathetic and in retrospect so so cynical.

The bullying was handled lightly, with nothing too traumatic, and there was minimal vampire gore (a few bloody scenes and a dismembered arm, for viewers who might also be bothered by these things).

It really makes me worry about the current gen public..Anyway, i was pretty amazed by the reviews and ratings of this movie here, so i watched it on Blu-ray. First of all, it's not really an vampire movie.. it's a child abuse themed movie, focusing on school violence and the violence it produces in return, how the abused kid wants and prepares himself in order to fight back, but does nothing, how he is given power to do so, blah blah blah, imagine Blood+ with only Saya and Riku, without the fun parts. In my opinion, the vampire stuff was just thrown in (i know its based on a book, same for the book then) for colors and drawing attention.Well, it does sends its message in boring and predictable way, but honestly, i was more disturbed from the documentary film about Andrey Chikatilo then this one, and to call it ""horror"" is really stretching the genre, maybe it could be horror for some 10 years old, like the main characters. Although the socialism and love romance between 10 years old could be strong selling points for some people too..Visually stunning? Well, for western public which, good for them, aren't familiar with the European habit of making movies with TV camera, maybe it is..My opinion is that Let the Right One In just serve as consolation prize for the disappointed from the movie adaptation Twilight fans.

The relationship becomes strained (or does it?) when Oskar realizes Eli's secret, which probably isn't much of a secret due to the fact this is a review of a vampire film.This movie is great on many levels. It explores good and evil in a way that seems almost refreshing (but not in a ""that blood sure quenched my thirst"" kinda way). The two seem to coincide with each other, even almost thrive upon the relationship betwixt the two. In addition, the film plays out as somewhat poetic, both visually and with the pace of the film.

The sound is other thing that you don't see so often, starting with the steps in the snow, the Eli drinking blood sound and even the bloody kiss between them are just magical.The actors, specially our two young main characters, are amazing. The innocence of Oskar and the bravery of Eli are perfectly represented by the two boys.

520,GaryLloyd10,A coming of age love story with Vampires,10,31 March 2009,"Oh, God, no!  not another one! How many times can the tired old idea of an undead creature feeding off the blood of the living be re-told? I think that we all know that the answer is 'lots', and with an infinitely varying degree of success. Well, this Swedish film  released last autumn in the USA, and still awaiting a theatrical release in the UK is, in my opinion, the best Vampire movie ever made. I know that is a big claim, but stick with me whilst I give you some background. It is a gorgeous coming-of-age story, combining first love, growing up, and revenge. It is a film where the main protagonists are twelve years old, but it is most definitely not a kid's movie. Oskar lives with his work obsessed Mom in an apartment block just outside Gothenburg. His parents are separated, and his Dad is an alcoholic. Basically, Oskar is a very lonely kid, and to make matters worse, he is being cruelly bullied at school. Suddenly, a strange girl moves into the apartment next to Oskar, accompanied by a taciturn middle-aged man called Hakan. The two kids bond over a Rubik's Cube, and Oskar discovers that the new girls name is 'Eli'. But Eli is not what she appears, in a myriad of different ways. Oskar asks how old Eli is, and she replies 'Twelve, more or less', Later we discover that she has been twelve for a very long time. Soon after Eli and Hakan arrive, there are a series of strange disappearances. Bodies are discovered drained of blood. We discover that Eli is a Vampire. She needs to feed off human blood, and Hakan, who obviously has a deep love for Eli, collects it for her. This is just one of many, many layers of depth in this film; not all of which are explicitly answered. What is Hakan and Eli's relationship? How long has Hakan been killing for her? How many Hakan's have there been over the years? Will Oskar become like Hakan? Does Eli love Oskar in return, or is she just looking to use him as her next guardian  to look after her during daylight (Vampires burst into flames if exposed to the rays of the sun)? It is also the reason why Eli and Hakan have to move around so much, never staying in one place for more than a few weeks. Eventually, one of Hakan's foray's for blood goes horribly wrong, and he is left in a position where he will be discovered and arrested. His loyalty to Eli is such that he chooses to disfigure his own face with acid just so that he cannot be identified and traced back to Eli's apartment. Now Eli must hunt for herself, and Oskar realises what her true nature is. But by this time, he has fallen in love with her. Can he love a Vampire? Is Eli even a girl? Eli helps Oskar to stand up to the Bullies at school, and he does so, with a brutality and coldness that makes you wonder if he is not the perfect replacement for Hakan. But the bullies' older brother is even more brutal, and wants revenge; and a final stand-off in the school swimming pool has a shocking climax. How does it all end? I won't spoil it  you will have to watch it yourself. This is a beautifully constructed film. It is filmed in a Swedish winter  snow covers everything, and as Quentin Tarantino knows, blood and snow make quite a visual spectacle. The two actors playing the leads do a wonderful job. Oskar portraying innocence and Eli an other-worldly strangeness as their friendship turns to love. The film is based on a best-selling Swedish novel, written by a Swedish stand-up comedian called John Ajvide Lindqvist, and he also provides the screenplay for the film. It has won an astounding haul of awards since its release last year  42 so far, and is fast becoming a cult classic. It deserves to be. It is one of the most original and entertaining films that I have seen, of any genre, for quite a long time. It is also the only one with a title taken from a 'Morrissey' song (the author is apparently a big fan). Inevitably, as always when a foreign film is so brilliant, Hollywood has thought 'Hmmm, that works, but no-one will want to see a film that has Swedish people in it, set in a place that no-one has ever heard of, and speaking a language that no-one understands. Lets re-make it, set it in the USA with all-American characters, and strip out all of the nuances and gender ambiguity that made it work so well in the first place'. And so a Hollywood version is being made even as you are reading this piece. Be afraid. Be very afraid.",Let the Right One In
521,demidov,"The one ""vampire"" movie you don't want to miss",10,3 November 2008,"In a nutshell, the movie is not about vampires at all. Yes there is violence but it is the kind of violence which is comes across as an absolute necessity. It often feels that the violent scenes are almost apologetic in nature. This is a movie about life, love and everything in between. The movie is very ""crisp"" and focused with every emotion being ""sharpened"" by the age of its characters, the cinematography and pureness of the actors portrayal of their characters.All of the other reviews already mention the plot so by now you probably have a good idea of what the movie has in store for you.I just wanted to draw your attention to one detail that i have not seen mentioned in any of the reviews. I think this one detail gives the movie its greatest depth: Eli's (Eli is the old vampire trapped in the never-aging body of a 12 year old girl) caretaker is seen by many as a serial killer or maniac which brutally slays young boys. He drains the blood of his victims and delivers it to Eli.I think everyone is dead wrong here. Eli's caretaker is the ""key"" to the whole story. He is clearly in love with her. He clearly hates murdering people but at the same time clearly hates to see Eli suffer without blood or doing the killing herself. He sacrifices himself for her.Who is he? He is a man who once fell in love as a young boy. Just like Oskar (the young boy who finds friendship, support and live in Eli). Perhaps he too at his young age found Eli a friend, a savior and his first and only true love. Perhaps he couldn't see her murder people for blood and he decided to take care of her just like she took care of him when he couldn't stand up for himself.When he is caught, he can not bare the shame. First he disfigures his own face not to allow authorities to link him to Eli and then he ends his own life, knowing well that his time has ended and that Eli has found a new life and a new friend.

If I hadn't read the book I would be sitting there wonder who many characters where and in many instances where the hell they fit into this story. The sick twisted mind of Eli's carer (Håkan) and his deep sexual desire for children - Eli's physical differences and lack of vital organs - Many important scenes and event simply lost - such as the cellar scenes, The Police hunt after the zombie - setting the school on fire scene that ultimately triggered the final swimming pool scene with the drug induced older brothers desire for revenge - etc. etc lostAlso, apart from some added cuts from Blackeberg where the story sits, and that I know like the back of my hand growing up there myself, the film have completely lost many important locations that sets the mode for many scenes. The Ghost house, the Cemetery, the lake/swamp, Kanan near the water.No - This film could have been so much better - hope the English version tries to justify the book (which is excellent) much better !",Let the Right One In

I saw Twilight a few days ago and thought it was OK but then I saw this little gem and I was completely blown away. This movie will make it to my top 5 list of my favorite vampire movies and probably at the top. I haven't read the book but I won't read it translated, I'm going to learn Swedish and read it in it's own language, it was that good.I will not take the artsy way of describing the beautiful scenes, which depict the normal suburban life of the Nordic nations. The dark and gloomy winter landscape hits too close to home for me to describe it properly.Of what vampire movies I've seen (and I've seen every movie I've been able to get my hands on) this is by far one of the best ones yet. Low budget (if you compare it to the Hollywood cash machine) and excellent actors. This is a must see.",Let the Right One In
524,Suunaabas,"If you are a spaz, do yourself -and others- a favor and move on",10,6 January 2009,"Alfredson's languorously paced dramorroromance is all intimacy. The shots, the sound, the lead performances; all constructed to reward those paying attention. So please save yourself the time if you cannot be bothered to spend 114 minutes of your life getting to know the characters. You'll be happier, and those who can, will be happier too.That being said, I cannot imagine more perfect casting for the main roles in this film. Their performances carry such sincerity, revealed in body language mostly, but dialog as well. A realist glimpse into life before the teen years; it's also an exposition on loneliness, and tormenting cruelty suffered by the ""outsider"" at the hands of attention-starved bullies. In fact, the bloody horror scenes pale in comparison; usually shot from a distance or out of direct view, they almost become part of the scenery.""Subtitles, ohnoes!"" Yes, there are subtitles and the voices are Swedish. However, the dialog is sparse enough that you can really focus on the characters and scenery. Personally, I found the language enhanced my enjoyment of the film rather than hampered it- though I don't speak a word of it myself. Which brings us to sound; silence is the canvas where ""Let The Right One In"" brushes some of its most poignant strokes. Attention to detail. Listen closely throughout and you will be overwhelmed by the subtle cues provided by sound.Lastly, there is the artistic beauty of each frame. Lighting and color are central to the film's personality. But even camera movement, zoom, and geometric composition have a part in bringing this tale to life. Prior to this picture, such things for me went by mostly unnoticed. For me, ""Let The Right One In"" was like poetry in hi-def. Each part of its construction was strong and and well chosen, but when put together, it is truly exceptional to behold.I'll close with one point to keep in mind. Not everything is spelled out for you, or thrown in your face as is most often the case. As in life, there are ways of viewing many plot elements presented to us. What makes such a lasting impression is that YOU the viewer are included in how the story is told, and the transitory truths you take away from it.While my comments deal mainly with how the movie is put together, let me say that it is a testament to the film makers. These elements assembled seamlessly into such a heart-felt story of innocent love and emotional desolation, harrowed subservience and bolstered triumph. This movie let me appreciate the art of film making.",Let the Right One In
525,rossjm,A fantastic film that beautifully merges Drama and Horror.,10,27 September 2009,"A mesmerising foreign film. One with true, lasting impact. Låt den Rätte Komma In (Let the Right One In), is filmed in a lovely dream like way that truly entrances you, much like any real dream. By being filmed like this, it, in a way, becomes more realistic. It is slow paced but in a great, beautiful way and is made to feel even slower by the nice use of haunting, slow camera movements, static shots and clever edits between shots and scenes.Driven by fantastic performances by two young Swedish actors (Kåre Hedebrant as Oskar and Lina Leandersson as Eli), Let the Right One In thrives in both the horror and drama genre. Perhaps even melodrama, with the use of beautiful music in truly touching scenes between the two characters being present. Also, their chemistry is perfectly realistic.This film has an incredible atmosphere. Partly because of the remote location itself and partly because of how it is presented by the director, Tomas Alfredson. A scene where Oskar confronts bully Conny on an ice skating trip is directed fantastically. Not just with the shots that are used to show the moment, but the shots that aren't. The shots that focus on something or someone else as it is happening. However, the best scene is the one set in the swimming pool near the end of the film, shot with true mastery by Alfredson. It is visually flawless as well as full of real substance.Although not the best foreign film I have seen, it is marvellous nonetheless. All it needs is an open mind.",Let the Right One In

This movie did not leave me a single impression that id care to cherish. It took 115 precious minutes of my life and wasted them. Let me play the devil's advocate and warn you.

528,prince-kratos,brilliant direction,8,9 June 2009,"""Let the right one in"" is a good though slow paced movie directed with amazing control over certain scenes which were shot with very good precision. The best part was that being a vampire movie it wasn't too gory and the scenes were pretty much clean. I have been too tired of movies which in the name of ""horror"" just show blood spurting out of peoples dead carcasses, open wounds, useless shrieking etc. and what irritates the most is the unnecessary prolonging of such scenes which is also a shame to such movies. This movie came clean of that aspect, except in the scene where the burnt and deformed face of the Eli's father was shown. To me and to anybody it was easy to make out the condition of his face while watching the window pane. Anyway, the rest of the movie was very good however, what is good about the movie is also a bad point about it i.e. the slow pace was good and showed the profound viewpoint of the director but led the movie to be a little longer than needed may be. The acting prowess of the young actors was a real treat which in turn shows the direction capability of the Director of the movie.. All in all it is must watch movie, at least once..

529,kcarling,Film Book comparison.,8,7 April 2009,"Having just been privy to a pre-theatre Film and Director Q&A in London central, I felt obliged to get something down about this little gem of a story.The film is a refreshing and original take, as we now know, on a tried and trusted genre. The two novice leads are nothing short of exemplary in their performances and steal the show.However I wish I had seen the film prior to reading the book. Having done this I feel the film would have been a more stimulating experience. Don't get me wrong, this little film is definitely worth seeing (UK readers), however it defines the boundaries of artistic liberty between celluloid and literature.In a nutshell and with no desire to litter this review with 'spoilers', the book contains a wealth of depth and sub-plots that were not contained within the film version. Admitedly, a good deal of what is written could not simply be put to visual representation as this film would receive publicity for all the wrong reasons! Because of this, some of the scenes in the movie leave one slightly bewildered as to motivation and logic.I would have liked to question the authors motivation to render the screenplay as such. That said, however, this is a gem of a film and anticipate that Matt (Cloverfield) Reeves will do an interesting, if not different approach to the story, predominantly as he's pitching to a very different audience.Film first, book second.

531,Omentuva,"Terrifyingly enthralling, or is that enthrallingly terrifying?",10,26 April 2009,"""A vampire film which adheres to the basics of vampire lore? This I have to see,"" were my exact words when someone recommended this one to me. And what a performance it was.Much has been written about Oscar and Eli's relationship, and I'll add some more. The first time Eli actually meets Oscar, Oscar is using his pen-knife to carve and stab the tree, whom he envisions as the sadistic Conny, though it is never outright said. And perhaps because of their respective statuses, they become friends, with Oscar crushing on Eli, hard.Forward to the scene with the school trip, and we see exactly what Oscar thinks of Eli. Eli has recommended that Oscar should hit back. And Oscar does, using, ironically, the same stick that Hakan used to push Jocke's body. For once, he feels the power that he feels Conny has over him, and he tellingly looks into the distance, to Eli, I feel. At this point, he's confessed his feelings to Eli, who tries to hold him off twice by first hinting to and then outright saying that the vampire girl is not actually a girl. Oscar cares little for the distinction.Then, the uncovering. Oscar proposes to share blood. It is worth noting that he says that Eli only needs to prick a finger, whereas he slices open his palm. Anywho, we all know what a vampire does when confronted with blood, and Eli was feeling the hunger once again. But Eli does not attack Oscar, who is no match for the crazed-by-hunger vampire. Oscar runs away and they meet up a few days later, following Oscar's hitchhiking back home after being confronted with his father's alcoholism, in perhaps the scene I loved most, where Oscar and Eli are separated by a windowed door, their hands meeting on opposite sides. This is where the title made sense to me. Eli divulges the secret and lets Oscar come in after a short dialogue. He leaves soon after, but it's worth noting that he does not openly proclaim Eli a monster.Then, the final two sequences of the film. First, there's Lacke's attempted kill of Eli. Oscar saves the sleeping vampire after ignoring the orders of his mother (I presume that his mother doesn't want him to sneak off in the middle of the night) and Eli (the upper layer of covering is something I doubt Eli could do when lying in there, so he did go into the bathroom). The saving is perhaps best likened to Anakin saving Palpatine in RotS, but with the difference that Eli is not out to force Oscar. Eli returns the favour when Oscar is waylaid by Conny and co in the climax. Eli saves Oscar's life when he's forced to choose to potentially drown or lose an eye. He 'chooses' the former and Eli assaults his assailants, embracing the vampire's supernatural strength not for a drink, but for the defence of someone near and dear.The last scene is ambiguous, which is perfect. You don't know what they'll do. Yes, they run away, which is impulsive, but what Eli and Oscar do is entirely up to the reader's imagination. Will Oscar become another Hakan? Will he become a vampire himself? Or will everything just stay as it is? A very good question, though the second option is allegedly rebuked in the book, which I haven't read. The shots are long and the film is surprisingly low on dialogue. Doesn't matter. The film sucks you in from the get-go when Oscar watches Eli and Hakan arrive. There is violence, but the violence is tenderly shot from a distance. This has the added effect that you, like Oscar, don't really care about it. Terrifying, but enthralling. The only real downsides I saw were the cat-attack (which was a bit over the top) and I personally felt that Oscar's face was too white in the swimming pool scenes. But perfection is overrated anyway. Definitely a film to watch, if you dare risking your thoughts turning to this for a few days.",Let the Right One In

Everything about it seems to be just perfect....camera-work, soundtrack, plot....But what I like best are the acting and the personae of the two main characters. They made me fall in love with them almost instantly and I was enjoying every second of watching them.I was again stunned by the natural beauty of Oskars childlike innocence and candour and by the way the camera captures this in several beautiful shots. (Like the one where he's on the bus and is looking upwards towards the sky, the camera captures him from a sideways/below point, its just perfect.... the scene where he's playing with his father in the snow, the scene in which.... gosh, I think it's almost every scene..)Also the way in which Eli's indissoluble loneliness came out of her acting, again deeply moved me. This is an incredible actress, she's totally convincing in her loneliness and in her caring for Oskar....

The child-actors in the leading roles are doing a great job making the movie believable.But don't be misguided, this is not a horror movie, you will not get scared by watching this.

I liked the fact that the main characters were both young children, who were still vulnerable but played the part so in but still keeping there childish ways. As we watch there relationship grow, we become more fascinated as to what will happen, whether she will kill him, or abandon him. Even though there of similar age, she is probably much more emotionally intellectual, and knows about much more serious issues than he would. This makes the story more interesting because you don't know how she will act with him or whether she will act like a child with him. Its a bizarre film, but I love the setting, Stockholm, Sweden during the winter when the snow is crisp, which I think adds to the child like theme in the story, because there is a lot of scenes when there playing the snow, which is a very child thing to do.overall, it was an interesting film and it wasn't clichéd as you would expect a 'vampire film' to be!",Let the Right One In

I was surprised by how easily i got into the film and could read the subtitles as well as concentrating on the plot of the film. The characters of Oskar, the young boy who we follow throughout the film as his love for vampire friend Eli grows and we see him expand as a character. The setting throughout most of the film is usually dimly-lit and dull, Tomas Alfredson (the director of this film) does this to add to the dark ambiance of the film and emphasise the genre to the audience. Alfredson doesn't use much music throughout the film, and i think this actually adds to the effect, the reason for this is because it creates an eerie mood as usually the music hints to the audience what is coming up next, however, by using hardly any music it gives the audience a false sense of security as they never know what is coming up next. I enjoyed this film because i felt although having generic conventions like the usual cold skin and big eyes that most vampire have in films, it didn't involve the bats and coffins etc, which i felt gave a slight difference to the normal films about vampires. Overall, i felt that this film was very good for people who enjoy something different and like films which are more non-obvious, however i did feel that some parts of the film were slightly strange like the confusion of Eli being a boy or a girl and i then began to feel not sure on the film as however interesting some viewers may find it, i, myself thought that it made it slightly more confusing than it could of been.",Let the Right One In

It is a film which is hard to label as it doesn't cover all the essentials you usually see in vampire films, it has more. From dark, bitter, and gory horror to a love, affectionate, and kissing romance - this film explores goodness and evilness in the characters.The child actors were fantastic. Oskar, Kåre Hedebrant, is 12 years old who is bullied at school. He is a typical outsider who has no friends until he meets his new neighbour, Eli. Eli, Lina Leandersson, is the same age as Oskar and they quickly bond and feel for each other. Obviously she has a secret which leaves the audience with the question, what will she do to him?...However, I did feel there were some negative elements in the film. I think that the directors could have maybe done something even more different with the vampires. Instead of ""only coming out at night"" and ""living off of blood"" I reckon that it would have been better if there was something different, as the film is a completely different vampire genre anyway, I guess they could have pulled it off! Also, there wasn't enough music, and when there was it was too noticeable.I would recommend the film purely because of the diverse, unusual, modern approach and you wont see anything like it.",Let the Right One In

541,xxcharlottecxx,A vampire film with a difference.,7,24 September 2009,"'Let The Right One In' is truly a unique film compared to its otherwise common stereotype. Unlike other vampire films, this one does not contain fangs, vampire bats or gore. The film is based in Sweden; the snow ridden town really does help create the right atmosphere for the film and adds to the mystery and gloom of the storyline. Eli (The vampire) and Oskar are two twelve year old boys who live two very different, yet similar lives.The film, oddly, doesn't focus on the fact that Eli is a vampire; it focuses on the lives of the young boys and the relationship they form. By diverting away from typical plot focuses such as, immortal life and the struggle for power, this film is primarily about a relationship which makes it worthy, raw and layered.I think the scenery and the music are very important to the film as a whole. The music is intriguing to listen to and fits well with the complex genre of the film; it's full of long drawn out minor notes, which gives a really mysterious and tense atmosphere.However I didn't think the film was very enjoyable to watch, because it was such a complex story line, it gives a really uneasy atmosphere when watching it because there is no telling of what is going to happen next. Although saying that, I don't think the film is scary at all, and doesn't really fit the stereotypical horror film description; however oddly, it's more of a romance.Overall I think the film was very different, but extremely good and well thought out. From watching the film I can see that a lot of effort and thought was put into it before putting it on the screen.

Of course friendship is just one of the values integrated into the story -- others such as bravery , love and loyalty- as well as understanding of the others are in abundance and contribute to the coming of age value of the film.excellent choice in directing the movie was the usage of snowy scenes/backdrops in the film.

This bittersweet tale shows a different take on love and foresees the trouble that might come with living in the moment. I found the movie a little too gruesome and intense in my opinion, i believe the storyline is great and the actors fantastic, especially Kare Hedebrant (oskar) and Lina Leandersson (Eli). I thought the story used too many of the typical features of the ""vampire"" characteristics, like being burned by the sun, sleeping in the bath-symbolising a coffin, i just didn't find a spark to make this story really unique. I found the confusion of Eli's gender was left with no clear explanation, therefore becoming irrelevant to the story.

There were a few, but not as much as i would have thought. When there was death scenes, they were done very well. The most well done scene has to be when the woman asks the nurse to open the curtains, and she suddenly bursts into flames. As i said before, there are good moments, but not many.The acting from the young actors was good, although sometimes i felt the speaking was forced from Oskar, I understand that they are still children, but it was noticeable sometimes.Overall, if you have a spare couple of hours, this film is a good watch.

This could be because when Oskar gives her his mothers dress to wear, He catches a glimpse of her, And we see that where her genitals should be, is in fact a scar. It could also mean that she isn't a girl, because she has been ""12 years old"" for 200 years. I have never really watched a film with subtitles until now, But it really wasn't as hard to follow as i thought it would be. There wasn't a whole lot of dialogue in the film, So there wasn't too much to read. Another thing i liked, Was that you never really know whats coming next, Which keeps you constantly on the edge of your seat. Even if you don't like films about vampires, or gory films, i strongly suggest you watch this. As i was sure that i wasn't going to like the it, But i came out pleasantly surprised.",Let the Right One In

A unique yet sometimes confusing drama set in a horror environment.To me, this film is exactly what the current film industry needed as it shows that a the story and the setting of a film don't necessarily need to be of the same genre. Because of this, the film is able to reach a much wider range of audience. It can touch the drama lovers and scare the horror Overall a brilliant piece of cinema.

548,stephen_good,Good but way too slow.,6,30 September 2009,"When I first heard about ""Let the right one in"", I expected something with lots of suspense and typical horror film aspects, but when I finally came to watch it I was surprised. Throughout the whole course of the film I didn't jump once. In fact, looking back on it, I wouldn't even consider ""LTROI"" as a horror film.The story follows Oscar, a quiet young boy growing up in 1980s Sweden when he meets Eli, a girl who a strange vampire girl who moves in next door. Both characters are portrayed surprisingly well by the two talented stars who play them. However, despite their performances, the film failed to really capture my interest. The reason for this is the overly slow pace of the plot, which is dragged out over 2 long hours when it could easily be done in half that. I genuinely had to try to keep myself from falling asleep during most of the long gaps that join up the parts of the film where anything actually happens.Overall, I enjoyed the film, but I only recommend you watch it if you have a lot of patience.",Let the Right One In
549,ftw93,Let the right one in,5,6 October 2009,"Let the right one in, is a Swedish thriller/horror film. I viewed it in Swedish with English subtitles. I don't think that the film being in Swedish made it harder or less easy to view, yet the subtitles slightly put me off. As i seemed to find myself concentrating on the subtitles and not the film. Overall the film was good. To me all actors/actresses were unknown and i liked the fact it wasn't a money obsessed Hollywood film, its grittiness reminded me of a British film. Even though i enjoyed the film, i found it very hard to understand. There were about three sub plots. The young boy being bullied, the vampire kid and the boys relationship and the old killer who killed for blood. This alone was confusing, let alone the fact that the vampire was a boy. Unless you read the book, its unclear that he's a boy, as you see its lower parts and assume the ""scar"" is female pubic hair. Also from the film the old man who looked after the vampire seemed to be its parent or such like. But from the reading the book you get the idea that he's a paedophile of some sort. Overall i enjoyed the film, its cinematography is very good, but the confusing plots and characters ruined it for me.",Let the Right One In
550,Somr,One of the best films I have seen in a long time,9,15 December 2009,"After watching one of the worst movies in the horror genre (It's alive) I stumbled upon Let the right one in"". At first I was unsure whether to watch the movie as it was about a vampire (thanks a lot Stephanie Meyer for ruining vampire movies) but after checking up on IMDb I gave it a try. And boy was I surprised for the better :)The story centers around Oskar, a twelve year old boy with apparently no friends, who is bullied at school. Not being able to cope with this he likes pretending / playing to murder his bullies. Also he collects newspaper articles about serial killers. (And although the killing scenes in this movie are not really pretty I have to say this character trait of Oscar is nearly the most disturbing thing in the film). When twelve-year-old Eli moves in next to him, he starts to befriend her, although he only meets her at night on the playground in front of his house. It soon becomes clear that Eli is a vampire and her father / father figure is the killer who hunts in Oskar's hometown for Eli's sake. When he is captured (again one of the more disgusting scenes, as he disfigures his face with acid) Eli visits him in hospital and kills/drinks from him. Being all alone the relationship towards Oskar grows stronger and she shows Oskar how to defend himself against his bullies. Later on Eli realizes she has to leave town, as people start to figure out, that something's wrong with her. Being alone again Oskar once more has to face his bullies who try to drown him, which is when Eli comes back, kills the bullies viciously (again a very disturbing scene, although you don't see that much) and the two of them leave town apparently for good while it's indicated that Oskar is now the new person on Eli's side to take care of her. The only negative thing that comes to my mind about this movie is the disturbing feeling you get when you watch the scenes with Oskar and Eli. In my opinion the two actors portraying Oskar and Eli were simply great (finally a film with two kids who look more or less normal, not the Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens wannabes you get with nearly every other movie) and you believe the roles they are playing: Two kids who become friends. The disturbing part comes in for Oskar, when he talks about or plays killing his bullies, as you wouldn't anticipate such behavior from a 12 year old. But where Oskar is only playing, Eli is killing people for real. And though there aren't many killing scenes (if I remember correctly Eli kills/attacks 5 people) they leave you a bit shocked as Eli turns into this vicious killer, while after the murder she's ""perfectly normal"" again. The only trace of her behavioral change is the blood smeared mouth. Partially the director / producer (or whoever is responsible :) ) could have elaborated. For example the relationship between Eli and her ""father"" (I'm now reading the book and there it becomes clear he only stays with her, as he's a pedophile and wants her) or Eli's past.But enough of the negative. As stated above I liked the actors, who were really good. Also the film has a runtime of nearly two hours which you won't even notice and for a movie of the horror/thriller genre the gore factor is more or less zero (what's a bit tough is the scene where Eli murders her ""father"", as you see his disfigured face). So altogether I give the movie a 9/10. Very good and you should definitely watch it (if you don't have a problem with movies that bring on the story at a slower pace and don't necessarily need blood and guts splattering at the screen every 5 seconds).",Let the Right One In

A subtle thinker of a film that's underlying story was well thought out and more about connecting and human emotions than vampires.Alfredsen's direction was solid and smooth. A lot of long steady shots showing off the wonderful cinematography, never choppy. Bringing a haunting and ominous feel that keeps you riveted to the very end.The cast did a wonderful job of helping to tell this story. Especially Hedebrant and Leanderson, who have to carry the entire film at very young ages or it doesn't work at all. They are brilliant young actors and I look forward to seeing how their careers go.The practical effects are minimal but effective and look outstanding. As far as the CGI goes, not much of any, except for one scene involving cats, but it was done well enough to not take you out of the scene.The score was very subtle and ominous and used to a minimal as well, allowing you to get wrapped up in what was going on and not distracting you away from the story.Definitely give this film a chance and don't judge it before you see it.

For this reason, tonight, I was compelled to sign up for an account, PURELY by my feelings towards 'Let The Right One In'.Please allow me to explain: For me, films are about being moved, being challenged; identifying with a character portrayed by a great actor (better still, if I've never heard of the actor or aren't familiar with their work). I wanna be taken away, shot up into highs and dropped sharply into lows. I wanna be active in the film - I wanna be forced to think about it as I am watching and mostly importantly, after I have watched it.Overall, without doubt, my greatest experiences with film have been when I KNEW THE LEAST ABOUT THEM.This may simply be ""my style"", but I strongly suggest you stop reading the crap I am writing, avoid ANYTHING written about 'Let The Right One In' and just buy it.One day, you'll watch it... and I trust you will appreciate it as I do.Spoilers are called that for a reason.Enjoy it (and each film) as they are intended: with no pre-conception.;)",Let the Right One In
554,m-dobrowolski-09,One of the best vampire movies ever made.,10,9 August 2010,"Film, set in 1982, tells the story of a twelve year old boy Oskar, who is bullied at school and despite anger and aggression growing inside him, cannot defend himself, not even by telling his mother or teachers about the bulling. Then a ""twelve years old"" hundred years old vampire girl named Eli moves into a flat next to his, and very quickly they become friends. However, despite its obvious horror-like subject matter, the movie does not try to be a horror. On the contrary, it can be argued that the director was determined to avoid most horror clichés, even if it meant dimming all scares, making killing scenes as dull as possible and focusing on emotional drama behind the story. To achieve this effect Alfredson uses the whole palette of visual and sound devices, abandoning many motifs usually associated with vampire driven horror movie and creating completely new symbolic meaning. When one considers structure and formal devices found in Let the right one in, one can clearly see, that Tomas Alfredson was not interested in making a horror movie. Instead he created eminently emotional teenage love story; a fairy tale about two creatures who both need help and can help each other.",Let the Right One In
555,rinkes,A somewhat different winter romance,10,19 July 2010,"Three months ago a friend of mine advised me to see this movie, telling me that it would be ""unlike any other film you've ever seen"". He then went on describing it as a mix of an Astrid Lindgren children's book and a Henning Mankell crime story.It took me quite a while to fetch it from the video rental. Basically because I dislike horror movies in general and vampire movies in particular. A lot of them are very unrealistic/unbelievable and they tend to rely on sometimes ill executed special effects. Mind you,I really do like horror novels. Probably because one is forced to use ones imagination when visualizing the text.I finally got around to renting it and watched it the night before it had to be brought back. My expectations were low, but I didn't have anything better to do that evening so. .I couldn't have been more wrong. Honestly: 'Låt Den Rätte Komma In' blew me completely off my feet. How on earth could I possibly have missed this absolute gem of a movie when it ran at my local art house cinema? The synopsis is well known. There's not much for me to add there. Although I would highly recommend everyone to read John Ajvide Lindqvist's book, if only for background information. For one thing you'll understand that Eli really loves Oscar to the point of self-sacrifice. He's so much more then a new Håkan. Eli? Of course I mean Elias! The movie only hints at Eli's gender, but apparently that was enough to give a lot of folks an uneasy feeling. LDRKI lingers with you. Thomas Alfredsson takes his time to tell his tale. No Hollywood style tempi here. The story slowly unfolds and goes along at a soothing, unhurried pace. It's visual beauty is stunning. Cinematography in it's highest form. The story's setting, (Sweden during wintertime, the bleakness of Blackeberg suburb)combined with Van Hoytema's camera-work and spread lighting technique are important aspects in achieving this feat.Then there is Johan Söderqvist's hauntingly beautiful music. If you've wondered why the scene in which Oscar meets Eli for the second time (at the jungle gym, in which he let's her borrow his Rubik's cube) gives you goosebumps and makes your eyes burn, it's partly because of the music.And finally there's the acting of course. You can tell from the beginning that neither Kåre nor Lina are actors groomed to youthful perfection by the Hollywood Circus (in full accordance to American 'taste'). Thank God for that, for exactly here lies their strength. Precisely because of their inexperience they display a rather disarming purity in their interaction that I have rarely seen on the screen. The sensitivity and tenderness in their play is quite wonderful and absolutely convincing.Of course, being a vampire movie there has to be violence. But when it comes it is functional, almost normal and it is never shown in graphic, close up detail. It's rather left to our imagination. The end effect of the violence is that it functions as a prism for the love story that lies at the heart of the movie. The real shocking violence in the movie, in my opinion, is caused by Oscar's bullies. That is really scary.I found LDRKI moving. It made me cry and think about it a lot after-wards. Identifiying with Oscar was easy for me. When I was at his age I found myself to some extent in a similar situation. And until the moment I found out that I possessed very sharp fangs myself , I remember dreaming of and longing for a girlfriend like Eli, who in the end would come to my rescue. For me 'Låt Den Rätte Komma In' is a movie to love and cherish.I don't think that Matt Reeves will be able to surpass it's beauty. Perhaps his remake will make more money. That's is what it is all about, isn't it? In the end however 'Let Me In' will turn out to be the vulgar, cheap and shallow Hollywood copy it already looks like it is going to be. In full conformation to the pity full taste of American main stream audiences. However the fact that he has the nerve to say (in an interview) that he respects the original and that he is touched by the fact that it can be placed in any setting makes me angry. What an utterly pathetic person he must be.",Let the Right One In

Often I was asking myself, ""what? what did I miss?"" It's like it was an exercise for a film class where you take out key scenes of a classic movie to see what it's like without them, hence realizing why you need them in the first place. Sadly, those scenes are not in this movie. You're just left to fill things in and assume motives, plot lines, side-stories, etc. in a way that fits with the story. Plus, this was a lot like watching Blues Clues. Long- agonizingly long- scenes of nothing going on. You might see a snowflake, or a fluttering curtain, and some music will be in the background. For.

559,paranoid_android91,Warning: This film may haunt your dreams for a while.,10,4 January 2011,"I have been in love with the concept of vampires since reading Interview with the Vampire when I was 15. Something about the romanticism and pure horror of living off blood and falling in love with mortals just stirred something inside me that I didn't understand, but loved the feel of. Enter Twilight. Anyone who has a love for real literature would understand what an insult this novel/movie was to vampires. They used overly good looking teenagers and multi-million dollar budgets to advertise the poorly made film, complete with a very famous soundtrack and a premade fan base to boot. But this review was not, by any means, meant to bash films that don't matter. Let the Right One In is possibly the most beautiful, well made films I've ever seen. I'm not exactly a movie buff but I think it's safe to say I know art when I see it. The Swedish language is a delight to listen to, the score is unbelievably haunting, and the color and basic feel of each scene is enough to burn an imprint on your memory for weeks to come. This is one of the few times I've seen believable child actors. Oskar is adorable yet creepy. Every time he smiles in the movie (which is not often) I found myself smiling along with him. And Lina Leanderson, who plays Eli, does an incredible job of embodying an old soul inside a young body. Though tiny and innocent looking, as well as very pretty, she speaks with a low voice and uses terms far beyond her years without stumbling over any of the words. A job well done by both actor and actress.

As an American, I'll say I think this movie might be difficult for some other American's to swallow. As far as I know, I don't think there is a dubbed version, so you'll have to watch it with subtitles. And it does have a somewhat slow pace. By that, I mean it is not so action packed there are a million things going on in each scene.In short, the only vampire in the film is a child. Or better, in the body of a child. A young child named ""Elli."" Elli movies into a neighborhood and makes friend with a lonely boy named Oscar. Slowly but surely, the two of them fall in love in the most innocent of ways because he is a child and she reverts to a child's mentality after meting him. Elli is capable of getting her own food, yet she has a ""caretaker"" (who could be considered a former lover) to get the blood for her until he sacrifices himself so she will not be caught. Throughout the film, Elli encourages Oscar to stand up for himself from the tragedies of being an outcast. They live happily ever after.The story is brilliant and a relieve from many of the movies being made today. The movie slowly builds to such full and intense characters, especially with Oscar and Elli. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful. The scenes with characters on set are well placed, and the artwork showing the scenery is breathtaking, even though most of it is set in a very snowy Sweden.I read the book only after I watched the film and I was very surprised how much the left out. So, I am not judging this movie as a book and screen translation. Both are brilliant in their own ways. I must warn anyone wanting to read the book there is an large amount of pedophilia, something they definitely left out in the movie. Some characters were taken out in the film, and the film doesn't explain Elli's orientation and how she became a vampire.It's a bit lengthy, but if you have the time I recommend you sit down and watch the movie.

I've watched the film three times since my original viewing and it only gets better each time. The performance(s) of Kåre Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson were simply stunning. All in all, ''Låt Den Rätte Komma In'' takes the classic vampire story and turns it into a beautifully woven modern tale of love, death, and adolescent challenges faced by people everyday.

562,alwaysintheroom,Amazing Vampire Film,10,28 June 2011,"The film starts with a boy (Oskar, our main actor) in his 2nd floor apartment, wearing nothing but his briefs, practicing what he'd say while he has someone at knife point (knife in hand) in front of his apartment window. Clearly, we see a disturbed kid, but that's not the whole truth. Part of this stems from the differences in the culture. The film is Swedish, so from this reviewers perspective, it's practically German (albeit ""the nice Germans""). Knowing a few Germans, I was able to quickly pick up on the mannerisms which make up their unique culture. This boy clearly is not crazy but is quite comfortable and just isn't ashamed, largely due to his youth but definitely part of his culture. Clearly, this is a cultural thing, since directly after this, a man begins to urinate no more than 20 feet from this apartment building in a decently lit park area. At best, this is a rare example of a film being extremely candid and natural, without making it cheesy, which helps you see the vampire story as though it were actually happening. There's hardly any need for suspension of disbelief when the world it's presented in almost looks like a documentary on the events, without the terrible ""shaking camera whilst running through the woods"" schtick. The film is filled with some questionable moments, but you just have to remember where it takes place to understand, and treat it as though they're are acting as they do, because they are. The film really does a great job at following Oskar to and from school and his interactions with the girl (Eli) who moved in the same night he was practicing his knife threats. This girl really shines in this role as both a victim and menace. The role is handled with a professionalism you only see from adults in the same role, similar to Brad Pitts' character in Interview with a Vampire. The film portrays her as being quite grounded for a person in that situation (though we learn why later). Overall, not much can be said about the plot of the film without ruining what I can only describe as a great drama that should get way more attention than any other overrated vampire films today. At this time, I have yet to watch the re-make of this film, but I will do so shortly to see whether the theme and acting was up to par with this great film.",Let the Right One In

At least, neither of those are the defining words I'd use to describe the essence of the film. It's about the mess of adolescence. It's an against-the-odds love story. It's about surviving in this world, doing what must be done. All classic, timeless templates, only in this instance told against a unique backdrop. See, then maybe it's a vampire film, or a horror film. It is slow, sad, dark, and cold, punctuated by both harshness and happiness, the dynamics of a haunting melody. It is blurry and distant, until Eli and Oskar, the two main characters, come together. Their interactions are close and intimate. The performances of the two main kids are remarkable, fully consumed by not only their roles, but by the world created in the film. Especially Lina Leandersson, who plays Eli (the vampire), truly looks far older than her years. The Dalai Lama once talked about every person being the center of his or her respective universe, and we get that in Oskar and Eli's world. From their prospective, together they create one universe, trying to omit the extraneous, not caring to question each other beyond traditional childish things. And that's really what it comes down to with this film. Any complaints I may have had were rendered negligible by the end. I mean that in two ways: by the end of the film, I no longer cared about those parts; and by the way the film ended, I no longer cared about those parts.

There isn't really a moral point of view; the story is told in such a way that all these viewpoints are possible, perhaps more. It makes it impossible to say if the end of the movie is happy or sad.

As the film goes on, the two grow closer eventually forming an unbreakable bond. The film is so beautifully done. It is a true classic film like no other. The atmosphere around the film is also perfect. Adding that the two child actors were among the finest ever. Their chemistry couldn't have been better. This is one of those movies that will keep you thinking about it for days after you've seen it! From the beginning, right up until the end. This movie reaches so many corners from the innocence of childhood to the darkness of human nature. Hauntingly beautiful is all I can say.",Let the Right One In

It is both violent, gory and spooky and sweet, innocent and romantic. How they writer and director came up with this story is amazing. Minus finding out my first love was a vampire I can really relate to what the kids in this film are going through. I do however wish my first boyfriend had been a vampire that could have ripped apart school bullies! This film is so simple and the young actress in it is both beautiful and ugly all at the same time...I'm not sure how else to explain her look.

If that is the case then the critics that said that have obviously never seen any other movie in their lives. The acting was poor, the visuals were pathetic and the plot was just terrible. In my opinion the director Tomas Alfredson really needs to rethink his career in the movie business and the writer John Ajvide Lindqvist should be banned from ever writing another story.I can not believe anyone would actually enjoy this so called ""masterpiece"" and if you did then you really need to get out more and experience what a real horror movie is all about.",Let the Right One In

573,teamsplattenstein,Very good but highly overrated!,7,4 January 2009,"With the summary above I know I should be more ""accurate"" about my opinions (as this one is getting mostly positive feedback) but let's keep this one as short as possible... Everything about the storyline etc can be found elsewhere so I'll point out the few things that bothered me and surprisingly didn't bother others:The fist half of the movie was PERFECT - the movie was clearly building into something and there was a lot going on ""between the lines"". The pacing was brilliant and the acting suited the movie more than well. The atmosphere was dark and merciless yet with a lot of warmth in it - weird in a good way... I was thrilled! This is a masterpiece!But from the moment Oskar strikes back on the bully the movie kind of lost it. It spend quite a lot of time showing people who actually had very little to do with the ""outcome"" of the movie. The scenes weren't worthless, but they managed to water down what was building - I wasn't bored but scenes kept on coming and going and they didn't seem to breathe anything more in the movie that it had in the beginning - except to underline the lonely and cold feelings of Eli and Oskar. The ending was good and it nailed the bullying theme pretty nicely, but did very little to what had been lost in the past 35 minutes.This kind of pacing issue is rather common with movies in all genres (especially with those that are based on books) and after a strong start it didn't deliver the promises it gave. This was VERY good movie with nice and visually pleasing camera-work (kinda slow yet mesmerizing), but with a little more editing it could have been a masterpiece it at first sight seemed to be - I highly recommend it, though...",Let the Right One In

Having read the book, twice, I knew the potential of this movie, but I kept my expectations low since it was a Swedish movie. Lina Leandersson is good in the role as Eli, other then that this movie has few redeeming features. There is basically no character development at all in the movie, you don't know anything or care about any of the characters in the movie. Oskar (played by Kåre Hedebrant) is portrayed as semi retarded having his mouth open and snot running down his nose in almost every scene.You get to know nothing about the characters in the movie, nor do you care about any of the characters in the movie. The audince is lead to think that Håkan is Elis father, when he is really a pedophile, it just doesn't make any sense in the movie.When Eli takes her first victim he's screaming ""Aj aj aj"", roughly translated to ""ouchies"" in English, like anyone would react like that when they're getting brutally murdered.All the best parts of the book are left out, instead they fill the almost 2 hour long movie with scenes of very slow, pathethic dialogue, and cheap jokes ala' ""Stefan och christer"", ohh look the gym teacher is talking with a weird accent LOL.I never was so close to walking out from a cinema as I was with this movie, the livestock in the audience was laughing the entire movie like it was supposed to be a comedy.This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",Let the Right One In
575,mark_fleury,A Poetic Masterpiece,10,26 March 2015,"In Praise of Let the Right One In, Both Film and Novel As a writer of poetry, for years I've been interested in horror films for helping me to work through my own spiritual concerns, particularly those that deal with supernatural beings, because I've dealt with healing the demon / angel split in my own psyche. Let the Right One In is by far the most powerful, not just horror film, but film of any genre I've ever seen when it comes to addressing my spiritual challenges. The novel, which I read after seeing the film, addresses these issues even more deeply. Let the Right One In is a Swedish vampire film directed by Thomas Alfredson, based on a Swedish novel written by John Ajvide Lindqvist. It concerns a preteen boy named Oskar who is relentlessly bullied at school. He ends up befriending a preteen girl who lives next door who Oskar soon realizes is a vampire. At the end of the film Eli rescues Oskar from the bullies. The word angel is not used in the film, but in the novel witnesses describe Oskar as having been rescued by an angel. One of the powers that vampires have in Let the Right One In is the ability to grow wings and fly. The foundational duality that's addressed in Let the Right One In is that of the vampire / angel. This duality serves as a catalyst for healing other psychological contradictions and dualities on many different levels. On one level Eli is a vicious killer, but, as it's revealed in both the film and the novel, she only does it for survival, like an animal in the wild kills to survive. In the novel Oskar challenges Eli about the fact that she kills and then Eli, correctly, tells him that he would kill his bullies if he could, but for him it would be out of sheer revenge, ""enjoyment,"" as she puts it. The director of the film, Thomas Alfredson said in an interview that to him Eli and Oskar are the same person. ""Two sides of one coin."" What I discovered about the demon / angel paradox in my own psyche is that the demon became the angel when I internalized it and stopped projecting my notions of good and evil onto the outside world. Because the director was conscious about the Eli and Oskar characters being a single psyche, it's even easier for me to internalize what they go through together while viewing the film.Another duality that's addressed ingeniously in both the film and the novel is that of yin and yang, which to my mind goes just as deep as the vampire / angel duality. Because Eli and Oskar are presexual, it's possible for the content of Let the Right One In to address and heal the feminine and masculine qualities of yin and yang without being limited by their sexual connotations. Let the Right One In reveals, albeit more subtly in the film than the novel, that Eli, although seemingly a girl, is actually a boy who was castrated when he was turned into a vampire. So through Eli's love for Oskar, Eli is a guardian angel, who rescues him from the dangers of the world, and Eli is also the unification and embodiment of the deepest qualities of yin and yang, feminine and masculine. And as I discovered with my own realization and unification of the demon and the angel, Oskar and Eli are really about a single psyche being saved by itself. The brutal part of the psyche is actually Oskar, who would kill for vengeance or ""enjoyment"" as Eli puts it, and the innocent part of the psyche is actually Eli, who only kills in the way that an animal kills without morality. Purely for survival. In the film she sobs after she has to kill someone. So Oskar has a desire for vengeance and Eli kills only out of necessity. These less-than-innocent impulses are balanced by the innocent presexual relationship that they share. Hakan, the adult character who starts Let the Right One In as Eli's ""helper,"" a man who kills for her so that she doesn't have to do it, is actually a pedophile. This isn't explicitly stated in the film as it is in the novel, but it is implied. Hakan represents the worst, most horrific sexual impulses and he is dealt with a lot more harshly in the novel than in the film. In the novel he ends up becoming a mindless zombie driven only by his desire to rape Eli. Hakan's representation as the worst of sexual impulses ultimately makes Eli and Oskar's innocent, presexual love that much more powerful. I have to mention the performances by Lina Leandersson as Eli and Kare Hedebrant as Oskar. These Swedish child actors are unbelievably good in the film and their performances are how Let the Right One initially captured my heart.",Let the Right One In

578,alexisful,A very well executed suspense movie (contains some spoilers),7,5 February 2016,"Let the Right One In is a very well written, shot, and acted film. Its more of a suspense movie rather than a horror movie, it keeps you on the edge wanting to know how the tension between the murders and Eli will eventually affect Eli, and her relation ship with Oskar. It does have some horror elements that are very well executed. like the swimming pool scene where Oskar's life was in danger by the bullies he constantly has to face through out the film, and Eli saves him by killing the bullies leaving one alive, so he can witness his future if he continues his ways. the scene shows Oskar holding his breath and limbs fall into the water as music plays in the background, the music fits the scene perfectly as well. The performances were well done the child actors did remarkably well, and the character build in this film was very good too, we see Oskar start from a very intelligent, shy, and quiet boy to a more confident and brave individual. Eli from a shy girl who is scared to show her true colors to being less frightened and happy with her self. the plot is also very straight forward with some symbolic meaning through out. this movie also does have it flaws, like the Rubik's cube scene other than that its an all around well done film I recommend this movie to anyone you don't have to be a horror fan to love this movie.",Let the Right One In

They did an amazing job sticking to the books as much as they could. This movie is so poetically beautiful. Both Eli and Oskar's love for each other is so different from the usual love stories that you see. It's tragic, beautiful, and heartwarming. One of the things I love about it is that it's unpredictable and you don't know what will happen next. Most movies give you bold hints about what will happen next in the plot, but this one doesn't and it leaves you wanting more. I could watch this movie over and over again and I could never get bored of it. This is truly one of the best foreign films.",Let the Right One In

Yes it is a vampire movie but its nothing at all like one would expect. Unlike all vampire films, the soul focus isn't on the vampire. It's about a relationship between and boy and a girl. Just much more dark and twisted. Everything in this film has an uncomfortable aspect to it. There is hardly any colour in the film. Its all whites and shades of grey. A reflection of the cold and haunting tale. Even the supposed lighter aspects of the film such as out protagonist and his relationship with this ""girl"" have an underlining horror too them. If your looking for something different that something that will leave you feeling legitimately haunted, I would highly recommend this film.",Let the Right One In
581,tothian99,Understanding film via book (spoilers),9,29 July 2009,"A few things in the book that help understand the movie better INHO: *the quick shot about of Eli's bottom showing a scar - yes, Eli was a boy, and genitalia removed, to become a ""girl"" for pedophilia purposes - knowing this depravity makes one realize that this can't be some happy ending ""love"" story - the fact so many of the synopses conclude with this makes me cringe - no, I don't hold those synopses writers in contempt, as I first thought it might be a love story when I quickly watched the movie without getting more info from the book.In the book it is obvious Oskar the boy is alienated by mom and dad - dad leaves a pretty messed up life in book - in either case, it is obvious Oskar has a scarred upbring, making him quite easy to manipulate, making it very easy for someone to use him - Hakan, the man getting the blood for Eli, was a servant for Eli, basically ""taken in by the spell of the vampire/predator"" - his use came to an end. He served Eli with his own free will, accepted the killing and the warped life style as he at least at some point was getting his deviant sexual needs fulfilled.Oskar is singularly and only needed to fulfill Eli's blood needs - no feeling, no emotion, no love, zeromundo folks - this is characteristic of our psychopathic society of today, where your production is needed, your life blood is shed either to feed yourself, or to feed a profit-production-based system - no feeling, no emotion, no love there either. Fortunately there are other things that bring love and joy, etc, but this movie is quite devoid of those delightful things. - the laughing on the train at the end is a deception, it is a laugh behind a lie based on manipulation - it is wishful thinking on behalf of Oskar, thinking he has some kind of ""friend"", when that friend is only there to use him. Period. He goes along it, nothing wrong with that eh? Well, it is not a matter of morality, it is a matter of fact. And this is how most relationships are in this world are based: on need.Oskar in the end, one realizes with time after watching this movie, will become the new Hakan, the blood-bringer for Eli - Oskar is chosen by Eli, trained at a young tender age, full of wishful thinking, a perfect candidate alienated by his parents, bullied at school, needing something/someone to cling on to.If you read or get more info from the book, it is more difficult to conclude this is some ""love story"" or ""story of acceptance"". This film has profound undertones about the predatory and feeding nature of our society as a whole, with a small percentage of humanity feeding off the rest (and requiring those being fed upon to submit, and not resist the feeding, to go along with it, and support it, call it ""Stockholm Syndrome"" in light of the production setting of this movie :-).There are also profound undertones in this film warning us about the insidiousness of psychopathy, of the predator(s) in society that are around us. Fortunately they are a small minority, and they don't suck your blood or hang you from some tree and drain your blood, at least not literally, no, but figuratively, yes.Sorry if this popped the ""love story"" balloon for any of you - this is not just some dark, pessimistic view, but over time you will realize the theme of this story is mainly of psychopathy and feeding via others for self-gain.",Let the Right One In
582,eveningpolestar,"Ya, please let the right one in, not this one!!",2,5 July 2010,"It's usually a pleasure for me to find a foreign (non-Hollywood) film in the Hollywood predominated IMDb's Top 250 list. A foreign film adds to the genuineness and reliability of the list I believe. So far non-Hollywood movies I watched from the list had confirmed my belief e.g., Old boy (South Korean), The Bicycle Thief (Italian), the lives of others (German). This first Swedish movie I watched however proved to be one of the major disappointments for me. Don't be fooled by all the glowing reviews it got or numerous awards it bagged. It's a highly over-rated silly movie. Not only is this movie unfit for the list, it is a below average movie, if you ask me! There isn't a clear demarking line to whether to categorize this movie as a horror movie or a romantic movie but either way I found it to be a poorly made, poorly acted flick.If you are a serious movie viewer; sorry, ""Let the right one in"" is definitely not for you! The plot is unusually dull and ridiculous (I considered not finishing it a couple of times), the acting is awful, and the filming is less than desirable. The two child leads are super boring and non charismatic, you would wonder if they could at the very least find two attractive kids to play the role. It's that kind of movie which you are watching hopelessly thinking something good will happen, but NOTHING HAPPENS, NOTHING!! Well, I don't want to scare you but given the super boringness of the plot and awfulness of the acting, at some time during the movie, you might think, it's child porn! Seriously! From the horror movie's viewpoint, it looks like an amateur made movie! I wonder what's the world is coming to! So many awards and honors to this incredibly boring movie.

584,mrn212paul,Beautiful in its simplicity,10,2 October 2009,"In 2008 I had the opportunity to view Let The Right One In (henceforth referred to as LTROI) at the Opera Plaza Cinema in SF. Unfortunately, I was unable to do so before the theater stopped its limited run. According to luck, and where i work, this year (2009) I was able to pull a copy off the shelf and rent it for a few days. Much to my surprise, though differing slightly from the source material, it was one of the most enjoyable films I have experienced in years.Without giving away anything from the plot, since there are synopses and such for those kind of things, we must first start off with the realization that visual media and literary media are quite different in their methods of storytelling. Though characters and subplots are cut from the source material, the length and depth of the remainder fits well with the film's pacing. The ambiance of the film is set well with solitary frames of scenery, quiet spots, and a melancholy underlying score to accentuate certain events of the film. At times, the movie overall seems a bit simplistic in it's approach, however the main child actor and actress of the film lend their talents to their characters well. In instances without dialogue, Eli especially, they convey their emotions of hesitation and worry quite well with facial gestures alone. It evokes more emotion to have feelings expressed without words, as if the viewer should grasp them without having to be told how to react or feel towards a character.I could see that this is not a film for everyone. Despite claims that it is not entirely faithful to the source material or that the trailer is misleading, the film stands well enough on its own merits and may provoke one to seek the literary work of LTROI. For those seeking concrete answers, hearken back to the days when films were open to interpretation and directors didn't hold your hand to lead you to what they wanted you to believe. Enjoy this film, as it tells a tale of a bond that transcends sexuality, age, and even morality and immorality.",Let the Right One In
585,beverley-frost,Much more than a horror movie...,10,23 March 2009,"It's hard to know where to begin with Let the Right One In as I think a lot of people either won't see this because it's subtitled or don't get how emotionally complex the story is which is a shame b/c this is one of the best movies i've seen in a while and a classic for the vampire genre. The details re terrific and along with the classical score really emphasize this cold, dark atmosphere of Sweden where we are thrown into the lives of two young children who are both more than they appear. Oskar is a shy, picked on kid who kind of lives in his own world yet shows a deep ominous desire for revenge against the bullies who constantly torment him at school. His counterpart is Eli, the mysterious fragile girl that moves in next door who over the course of time we start to realize is actually an old vampire who must drink blood on a daily basis in order to keep her strength. As their relationship and curiosity towards each other slowly grows into a loving friendship, I was constantly intrigued by their subtle desire for each other and underlying motives where each of these characters stand to to benefit from one another. Even though Eli has an older man who we find out kills random teenagers and drains their blood, we never know if he is a past lover who has been doing this for a while or just another recent tool for Eli's survival. His awkward and unsuccessful blood collecting leads to eventual capture, yet we never once question his loyalty of killing himself to protect her secret when we clearly see his fear of her. For me, it's the slow buildup of music that accompanies these very quick and intense scenes of violence where we slowly see the changes of each of the characters towards their outside world that make it so intense. It's exciting to read about these underlying themes of morality where Eli essentially molds Oskar to hit back at the bullies and accept her murderous desire to the point where we are ambiguous as to whether it's truly love that binds them or is she manipulating him to become her next killer. In the end, we're treated to a terrific and gory conclusion that is shown off screen making us visualize this terror Eli unleashes to save Oskar and their eventual future where it starts all over again. This movie is just amazing, the atmosphere and realistic relationship of dealing with a child vampire who can only connect with someone who looks like her really is a moral study of corruption hidden as a vampire love story. I can't wait to watch this movie again.",Let the Right One In
586,mlp-24956,"Beautiful, even with the gore",10,7 February 2018,"""Let the Right One In"", is a Swedish romantic comedy. The movie follows Oskar, a twelve-year-old boy, struggling with bullying in school, who meets Eli, another twelve-year-old (""more or less"", in her terms) who Oskar is curious about due to her strange behavior. She is never cold, doesn't go to school, seems to know little about popular culture or teen activities, and answers everything in riddles. The two outcasts form a sweet love based around their inability to fit into society. Oskar comes to discover that she is a real life monster, a vampire to be exact. This fact doesn't destroy their romance though, it evens comes to bring them closer, as they both struggle to survive in this world. 
The movie is shot from a third person view, and allows for the audience to catch onto the fact she is far beyond a human long before Oskar. Scenes show the man who Eli is living with, who is never fully revealed to the audience as to their relationship, is seen draining blood, burying bodies, and watching and attempting to control Eli from attacking publicly. Once Eli attacks, it switches the audiences' idea of Hakan, the man, being the evil force, to Eli being the cause. While this is happening, you can see Oskar collecting the snippets of the news with these attacks, clueless to the fact that his new friend is the cause. From the point that Eli's revealed to be bloodthirsty, the audience is on edge about how Eli and Oskar are going to end- will he be the next victim? It really builds a sense of suspense, as what you thought you knew about Eli is thrown in a whole new direction. And once it is revealed that she is a vampire, and Oskar is able to accept it, it demonstrates the beauty and purity of childhood innocence. Oskar is able to look past the fact that she kills, mostly due to the fact that he has also contemplated the idea, for selfish reasons, compared to her need to live. You can hear the fragileness in Eli's voice when she is pleading with Oskar to just try to understand. Oskar has come to really trust Eli, and see past her imperfections, no matter how large they are, and see that she really cares about him- something that not many others in his life do. 
 Both Eli and Oskar, played by child actors, do really well with their parts. Eli is shown as being both pure and evil at the same time- a very complex mixture. The actor does well with showing that the Eli is a vampire- the graphic scenes of attacks and the impulsiveness towards blood- while still being twelve. Eli likes things similar to normal twelve-year-old such as Rubik's Cubes, tapping Morse code to her neighbor, and getting a crush on Oskar. Oskar's actor does really well at portraying a bullied youth. Oskar is seen as both scared and frightening himself. He is scared when faced with the bullies, but within his own rooms, hints that he is thinking about harming the other kids with his knife. The choice in the overall look of the two really creates the sense of opposing forces as well- Oskar being pale, white haired, with light eyes and Eli having dark eyes and hair. Visually, it really separates the two characters. 
 ""Let the Right One In"" also stands out from many other films in that it is a romantic horror. It brings both the elements of a blossoming teenage love along with the gory, violence of monster movies. In comparison to other vampires, Eli is not violent or looking to attack, she is merely trying to survive. She still portrays a lot of the characteristics of a normal preteen girl, while still holding some of the iconic vampire legends. The scene where she bleeds when she enters the home without invitation leaves you knowing that something bad is going to happen- the invitation inside being one of the most common vampire myths- but what the director chooses to do is beyond what you expect. You see Eli struggling, looking as if she is able to pass out, before one of the goriest portions of the movie comes out- from Eli herself. She is bleeding everywhere before Oskar pleads that she is invited in. It pushes that unknown, as to what happens when the rules are broken, and makes it terrifying but leaves you continuing to watch. The music in the background is very sweet, similar to a romance, even in portions where the violence of the movie really takes over. This makes the movie, even with the gore, beautiful.
 The movie overall is a masterpiece, both in its visuals, and the plot. The way that it is pulled together into a very sweet ending, really makes the film stand out in its genre. For those who say movies with subtitles are not worth the energy, this movie sets a prime example of it being worth it.",Let the Right One In

But while watching this film I found that I could understand fully what was going on and also I found that I wanted to carry on watching it until the end. I like the way the film shows good and evil, the way it shows love and hate. It really gets you thinking about what the characters represent and what is going to happen next. I also love the way we never really know what Eli means when she says some things, we never really find out what she is. Some parts are confusing at times for example who is the guy she was with at the beginning of the film? But that is what I think is element as to why I enjoyed it so much. I'm not usually fond of vampire films but this didn't show too much so I really did enjoy it. I would recommend friends to watch it because I really think everyone should watch this film.",Let the Right One In
