0,CinemaSerf,"Nothing startling, just a good dose of Bill Murray.",7,25 October 2020,"Essentially this is just an outing for Bill Murray (""Felix"") who decides to help his daughter ""Laura"" (Rashida Jones) when she begins to think that husband ""Dean"" (Marlon Wayans) is up to no good on his frequent business trips with a work colleague. Murray is on top form as the debonaire, flashy, man-about-town who has all sorts of cunning wheezes to get to the bottom of the mystery (assuming, that is, that there actually is one) and his performance lights up this otherwise rather humdrum tale of martial wobbles. Jones has her moments, too, though mainly her role is to provide an effective foil for her on-screen Dad, and together they create quite an enjoyable series of escapades that passes for an enjoyable 95 minutes.",On the Rocks
1,ferguson-6,Coppola and Murray re-team,7,5 October 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. Sofia Coppola cemented her place among top filmmakers with the instant classic LOST IN TRANSLATION (2003). Sure, she's had other successes with THE VIRGIN SUICIDES (1999), MARIE ANTOINETTE (2006), and SOMEWHERE (2010), but it's her thought-provoking and self-analytical film with Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson that struck an emotional nerve for so many. This time, she reunites with Murray in what could easily be a companion piece, as it's both familiar and not.Rashida Jones (""Parks and Recreation"") stars as Laura, who is trying to find herself as a writer amidst the fatiguing responsibilities that go with being a mother and wife, and having age 40 staring her in the face. Marlon Wayans (WHITE CHICKS, 2004) plays her charming, just-started-a-new-business husband Dean, who may or may not be cheating on her. Whether it's Laura's concern over how ""boring"" she has become, or the little clues she finds ... well, it's probably nothing ... but doubt grows into suspicion.It's at this point when Felix, Laura's father, enters the story. Felix is a likable cad (probably an archaic word, but it fits), who has never been much of a father to Laura. Instead he chases fun and skirts, and begins convincing Laura that all men are like him. Director Coppola examines contemporary relationships, and the insecurities that come with a long-term commitment. Can one person be enough? Can men be trusted?What follows is an offbeat father-daughter husband-spying adventure, and an ill-advised one at that. Felix pulls up in his Alpha Romeo, and the two enjoy caviar on their stakeout - with the top down on the convertible. This leads to a scene clearly written to take advantage of Bill Murray's talents. As he zips the sports car through the city, he gets stopped by New York's finest. Depending on your perspective, you'll either view this as a prime example of white privilege, or as the benefits of spending one's life being a good listener, attentive to others - a people person making connections.There is a great line from Felix that carries a great deal of weight, although it's easy to treat it as a 'throw away"" line. He advises Laura, ""You need to start thinking like a man."" Spending time with her dad makes her wonder if he's right - do all men think like him? This plays well against the non-stop yapping mother Laura gets regularly cornered by when dropping her daughter for school. Jenny Slate is perfectly annoying as the mother who not only still thinks the world revolves around her, but also that the world is still interested.Of course, we know, and Laura figures it out: her father worships her. He may gallivant around the globe looking for his next notch, but he absolutely realizes what a beautiful soul his daughter is, and what a better person she is than him. Probably the best lesson Ms. Coppola offers is that communication is key ... or lack of communication can cause a thought to spin out of control.Sofia Coppola and Rashida Jones are both daughters of giants in their field, and likely could relate to having a larger-than-life figure cast a shadow. Eagle-eyed viewers will spot Barbara Bain as Gran. Ms. Bain rose to fame as Cinnamon Carter in the 1960's TV series ""Mission: Impossible"". She's now 89 years old and still working! Sofia Coppola has delivered yet another film that's interesting and provides terrific conversation after watching.",On the Rocks
2,blanbrn,Father and daughter like comedy story of companionship.,6,27 October 2020,"""On the Rocks"" is one film that just stays simple as it's a tale of dad and daughter and their relationship. Laura(Rashida Jones) is a successful married lady with kids living in New York city as she tries to write out her next best selling book. Only she starts to have insecure thoughts thinking that her working and often traveling husband has a wondering eye. Now enter her grown and sharp dressed playboy like dad Felix(the wonderful and super good Bill Murray) who visits and starts to play dad in charge and be like a P.I. and do his own work for Lauren. And Felix is witty and smart as he has a movie quoting mouth and knows his stuff plus he provides plenty of laughs and daddy like comfort. And all live happily ever after that pretty much sums up the film nothing great just a comfort feel dad and daughter break like comedy.",On the Rocks
3,lasttimeisaw,Film Review - On the Rocks (2020) 5.9/10,6,26 October 2020,"""Laura never stands a chance to better herself as an independent individual, in the end, she is just passed from one man to another, with the symbolic watch switch, that message doesn't quite swim with our current tide of woman-empowerment. Sofia, being a female and a member of the Coppola Dynasty, has been wearing a Teflon armor for too long, and the ""father issue"" she tries to come to terms with is more personal and regressive than we can give its credits for. Since many other budding women directors are finally thick on the ground, perhaps it is high time that we look elsewhere for the next auteur-to-be from the distaff side.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",On the Rocks
4,MOscarbradley,Shame on the Academy for overlooking this gem.,10,10 April 2021,"Like her father before her, Sofia Coppola is certainly an idiosyncratic filmmaker. She doesn't do ordinary, be it a movie about teenage suicide, a May-September rom-com or a film about a French Queen. ""On the Rocks"" is her father and daughter movie, (and it may have more than a touch of the autobiographical about it), and in some way it's a companion piece to her best, as well as her best-known film ""Lost in Translation"", right down to the casting of Bill Murray . This time round a much older Murray is the dad and Rashida Jones is the daughter whose wedding we see at the beginning. Seconds late she's got two children and is feeling dissatisfied in her marriage. She's also a writer and the way Coppola encapsulates all this information into just a few minutes of screen time is really quite stunning.What follows is a funny, touching and hugely intelligent picture of two people who obviously love each other but who have kind of drifted apart, reconnecting as they play detective to see if her husband is cheating on her, as well as being something of a love letter to nighttime New York, bolstered by two terrific performances from Murray and Jones and Coppola's superb dialogue; you hang on every word. A total pleasure from beginning to end and once again, shame on the Academy for ignoring it and most especially for ignoring Murray's great performance.",On the Rocks
5,Cineanalyst,Neatly Dry,7,1 May 2021,"I get it, ""On the Rocks,"" because their marriage is in peril, or maybe it's her relationship with her father, and they drink alcohol every time they go out (although, disappointingly, oft without ice). Plus, a woman is overheard in one scene describing to Bill Murray's art-dealer dad an artwork that's just rocks. As one might be able to tell from some of my review titles, I don't care a little for such pun-gent wordplay. I care a lot. As for the picture itself, it's perhaps tastelessly dry, but it's served neat in the plotting.Besides a frugal hour-and-a-half runtime, the meta-construction of the narrative is simple and subtle. Rashida Jones plays the writer of the story within the story. She's got writer's block and doesn't know what to make of the mystery of her husband's suspected infidelity. So, she teams up with her father (Murray) who deals in art. It's a clever allusion from a writer-director, Sofia Coppola, whose father, Francis Ford Coppola, is a well-known filmmaker, too. Who cares if the husband is actually cheating or not--this isn't some Hitchcockian suspense thriller where we're trying to figure out whether Cary Grant is going to murder Joan Fontaine. It's as though the morality of monogamy is at play here precisely because it's punishingly monotonous. It doesn't matter, so look for what does matter: the semi-autobiographical creative process as drawn from life and the paternal bond. It's the story of the story that the daughter and dad construct from the boring upper-class family and working life that's of interest--and not so much the bumbling detective work of investigating infidelity, but the mere piecing together of a potential reality or constructed fiction. Double meanings--like the title.Other than a story about storytelling, there's not much going on here as far as I can tell. The casting, however, might be interesting. When Murray was cast in Coppola's prior ""Lost in Translation"" (2003), it merely seemed part of the actor's turn towards a few more dramatic or serious works at the time--occurring as it did when he was also starring in Wes Anderson dramedies, ""Broken Flowers"" (2005) and other such things to distinguish him from a career that also includes voicing Garfield. But, in ""On the Rocks,"" we get quite a bit of comedic talent for a movie that's largely a light drama. Jones, best known for TV sitcoms ""The Office,"" ""Parks & Rec,"" ""Angie Tribeca"" and ""#blackAF,"" is a master of playing off of zany characters, to which one may add Murray's playboy pops here. Marlon Wayans, although he's fine and the part rather demands it, seems wasted in the humorless husband role with a boring job at some boring tech startup. There's even one of Jones's ole co-stars from ""Parks & Rec,"" Jenny Slate, to play a bit part of a fellow mother who drones on about herself as they wait to pick up their kids at school. Maybe this casting of comedians in dramatic roles in a dramedy also plays into the doubled construction. Regardless, they do a fine job--Murray especially in the most fun part and who received quite a bit of recognition on the awards circuit for it.",On the Rocks
6,cruise01,Father/ daughter buddy drama that gets lost in tone but saved by performances.,6,4 November 2020,"3 out of 5 stars.On the Rocks is a fair comedy drama film that has a charming cast but lacks in laughs, humor, and a direction to make this comedy drama worth watching.The plot follows Laura (Rashida Jones) who suspects that her husband is having an affair with a coworker. After being distant, discovering another womans belongings in his travel case, and how close he is with his workers. Her father Felix (Bill Murray) and her try to do a stake out. Hoping to catch him on the act. Until they follow him to a business trip in Mexico. Which her and her estranged father catch up with what they missed out on life.The plot is decent. About a father and daughter relationship which has disappeared through the years. Which they catch up on while trying to catch her husband in the act. The script is flat with its drama. Also lacking in humor and laughs.The film is saved by a wonderful cast. Rashida Jones is lovable and charming with her performance as a mother who is suffering from a writers block. Bill Murray is also charming as her father. Who tries to be that wisecracking attitude. Marlon Wayans is also good as her husband who barely has time with his family cause of his business.It is a drama that is entertaining but very forgettable.",On the Rocks
7,eddie_baggins,A pleasant New York dramedy from Sofia Coppola,7,8 November 2020,"It might not be Lost in Translation or The Virgin Suicides but On the Rocks sees director Sofia Coppola return to some type of solid form as she uses the star power of her two leads to elevate a simple but effective story that will sit well with anyone not in a rush and anyone willing to be taken on a dreamlike ride through rich New York citizen's lives.After the misguided The Bling Ring and the so-so The Beguiled, Rocks is Coppola's most enjoyable film since the lauded Somewhere way back in 2010, dialling things way back to a bare bones story that is deeper than one first expects, Coppola manages to create both a nicely observed father and daughter comedy and a rumination on love and marriage that will hit home with anyone that has been a part of a long term relationship with either partner or parent.Following Rashida Jone's struggling author and mother/wife Laura whose marriage to up and coming businessman Dean (a softly spoken Marlon Wayans) appears to be reaching a tipping point when it seems possible that he is enacting upon a hidden affair, with Laura seeking helping from Bill Murray as her father Felix, a man who has experience when it comes to matters of affairs, Rocks doesn't attempt to rewrite any type of genre rule-book but thanks to its well-handled direction from Coppola and great chemistry between its two leads, this is a constantly delightful little romp.After a few years of more supportive roles its great to see Jones used to great effect here by Coppola and her turn as the likeable and relatable Laura is one of her best lead turns that is joyously enhanced by Murray whose having the absolute time of his life as the extroverted Felix, a role that is extremely different to the last time we saw him in a Coppola film.Many of the films best scenes are simple little slice of life moments between the father and daughter as they talk about life's big issues, relationship matters or wine and dine across the well-filmed cityscape of New York and then the beach-side surrounds of a small Mexican hotel and as the two learn more about each other and come to terms with their flaws and vulnerabilities, Rocks touches on some heartfelt messaging that ensures this is a film that teaches us life lessons, even if we never feel as though they will stick with us too long after the credits have passed.Final Say -Never attempting anything of a grand nature or anything by way of outlandish delivery, On the Rocks is a quiet but effective dramedy from Sofia Coppola who also manages to draw out some of the best work of Murray and Jones in quite some time.3 1/2 poker faces out of 5",On the Rocks
8,howard.schumann,Each person has the opportunity to look deeper,9,1 January 2021,"Film critic Roger Ebert once said, ""All good art is about something deeper than it admits."" On the surface, Sofia Coppola's (""The Beguiled"") On the Rocks is a light comedy about a playboy father and anxiety-ridden daughter snooping on a husband suspected of cheating. The title could refer to Scotch (or Bourbon) on the rocks, a ship foundering off a seacoast, or the downward trajectory of a relationship. In this case, it may be all three. With Bill Murray (""Rock the Kasbah"") as the sleuthing dad, Rashida Jones (""Tag"") as the suspecting wife, and Marlon Wayans (""The Heat"") as the would-be philanderer, on first glance, the film seems to be headed towards sitcom territory, another Woody Allen-Lite tale of over-indulged and well-connected New Yorkers (with a person of color thrown in to avoid stereotyping).A witty and affecting script by Coppola and busloads of chemistry between the two main protagonists, however, reveals depths that transcend such superficial judgments. Describing the film, Coppola says, ""It's the clash between the two generations . . . how they look at relationships, and also how your relationship with your parents affects your relationships in your life."" Speaking of her famous father, Francis Ford, Coppola says, ""It's not my dad's personality. It's not my dad. But of course, you draw on things from life to try to make it feel real and connected."" Laura (Jones) has, in her own mind anyway, some reason to believe that her husband Dean (Wayans) is looking elsewhere to fulfill his physical and emotional needs.A writer who has been unable to put anything meaningful on paper while she juggles her two young children's day in school, preschool, and ballet classes, Laura feels lonely and estranged from her oft-traveling husband. Her suspicions are enhanced by Dean's attention to his ""working"" relationship with co-worker Fiona (Jessica Henwick, ""Love and Monsters"") and bells go off when she finds a bottle of expensive body lotion in his suitcase. Laura is so preoccupied that she has tuned out others looking for support, particularly her friend Vanessa (Jenny Slate, ""The Sunlit Night""), a single mom who is seeking advice about finding a boy friend in the New York scene. As they line up every day to drop off and pick up their children from Kindergarten, her attempts to engage Laura in conversation are met only with blank stares.It seems a bit out of character when Laura calls upon her wealthy art-dealer dad Felix (Murray) to give her advice as to how to handle the Dean situation. This especially raises eyebrows since the very same father is an obsessive womanizer who left her and her mother for another woman when she was a child. Knowing Murray as we do, however, we fall prey to his sly wit and the film rises and falls on the basis of his considerable strengths. Coppola says, ""He has so much heart and he's so funny and in a way that is so unique to him,"" yet it is Rashida Jones who, insecure and vulnerable, provides the human touch, mirroring the truth of their relationship and her engagement in a confrontation with Felix, though low-key is nonetheless powerful.Felix assumes, since he wants a relationship with almost every woman he meets, that every man is the same and Dean must be guilty, without concrete evidence of course, only suspicions. Felix becomes an updated version of ""Columbo"" as he stakes out Dean's comings and goings in New York, aided by cinematographer Philippe Le Sourd (""La Traviata""). He eats caviar along the way as a quick lunch, hides in alleyways, takes in the scenic delights of the city in his convertible sports car that has seen better days and, in spite of Laura's reluctance, the two end up in Manzanillo, Mexico in a scene that could have fit into any screwball comedy of the 1930s or 40s. Inclusion of pop songs of the era such as ""I Fall in Love Too Easily,"" ""I Get Along Without You Very Well,"" and ""Mexicali Rose"" adds to the connection. Equally hilarious is Felix's confrontation with two police officers who pull him over for speeding, but who end up succumbing to his master class in charm and giving his car a push.Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola's last collaboration, ""Lost in Translation,"" was about a connection in a foreign country that hinted at romance, but while Bill Murray's trademark dry humor was present and his character was jaded enough, neither character experienced anything deeper about themselves or the world around them. In On the Rocks, however, each person has the opportunity and the inner strength to look deeper and develop a new sense of understanding and trust. Here, Laura re-evaluates her priorities in life and her relationship with her father, taking responsibility for what works and what does not. As she looks inward, she heeds the words of poet Charles Bukowski to ""Drink from the well of your self and begin again"" or, as Chilean author Pablo Neruda put it, ""To have lived through one solitude to arrive at another, to feel oneself many things and recover wholeness.""",On the Rocks
9,marmar-69780,On The Rocks,7,10 October 2020,"On the Rocks was a solid attempt on to make a cool father daughter storyline to which many people can relate to ,and in some ways Sofia was able to do that and give us one watchable film that can teach us some valauble lessons about life and relationships and how we cant take them for granted cause they can be broken at first sign of trouble.Bill Murray and Rashida Jones were good together as father and daughter and they good solid chemistry between them,but Marlon Wayans was unfortunetly the weakest part ,he didnt had any sign of chemistry with his love interest and end of film was little to on the nose with a happy ending,On the Rocks was a solid story",On the Rocks
10,southdavid,Affair To Forget,5,30 October 2020,"17 years ago, Sofia Coppola released ""Lost in Translation"" a critical hit, but a divisive film for the audience who ether adored or hated it's mix of pathos, character exploration and lack of narrative. Everyone loved Bill Murray though, as everyone should. Coppola and Murray reunite for ""On The Rocks"", released on Apple TV because of the Covid lockdown, which became the first feature film I've ever watched entirely on my phone.Laura (Rashida Jones) comes to suspect that her husband, Dean (Marlon Wayans) is having an affair. The evidence is circumstantial, but the notion fits with her feelings that her professional and personal lives are in somewhat of a rut. Back into that life comes her father Felix (Bill Murray) a gregarious raconteur and playboy who knows every Maître d and Concierge worth knowing. Together the pair explore their relationship and discuss life, whilst monitoring Dean's actions.I didn't like it as much as ""Lost in Translation"", would be my one sentence review. It's hard to say why, Murray is on fine form again - perhaps even better here than he was then, as Felix has most of the amusing lines in this one and his appearances usually mark an upturn in the film. But that might suggest that the fault lies with Rashida Jones, and that wouldn't be fair either - everybody pails in comparison with Murray, so Jones makes Laura into a realistic character who is just easily led into flights of fancy by her father.I think the trouble is, just like Felix's car, the film is stuck in second gear. There are moments when it feels like it might amount to something, but the relationship between Felix and Laura never feel so far apart that it really needs putting back together. She snipes at him about his affairs, he justifies them with pseudobabble about men and women. There's a moment when Felix acknowledges another characters death, that might have been that reconciliation point - but it plays flat, or perhaps realistic would be a better term, which is fine - except this is supposed to be a form of entertainment.There are decent performances, and the film has occasional moments, but ultimately not enough of them.",On the Rocks
11,imseeg,"Slow and mellow. Funny (Bill Murray) and melancholic. Endearing portrait of a married woman stuck in a rut, suspecting infidelity..",8,31 December 2020,"I guess many Apple viewers were suspecting to see a straightforward, simple and funny comedy, which it isnt. So beware, this movie is only suited for the art house movie fans of subtle character portraits.The good: Bill Murray, Bill Murray, Bill Murray.Any bad? Director Sophia Coppola has got a slowburning and mellow kind of directing, which many apperently find quite a bit boring, judging by the many other negative reviews. I love this particularly slow and mellow directing style though, because it gives the characters in this story room to breath and be real persons. So many comedies are only eager to score with making blunt jokes, but this is more of a subtle melancholic comedy/portrait, with real persons, with real life insecurities. Perhaps better suited for an older, middle aged audience?The story: a portrait of a married woman, stuck in a rut, who is doubting if her husband is having an affair. Her (hilarious) dad, played terrifically by Bill Murray, starts acting like a private investigator, following the whereabouts of her suspiciously acting husband. Did he cheat or didnt he?",On the Rocks
12,paul-allaer,"Very much relatable, with Bill Murray in top form",7,11 October 2020,"""On the Rocks"" brings the story of Lauran and Dean, and Lauren's relationship with her dad. As the movie opens, we are in today's Manhattan and we get to know Laura, a writer working from home while also taking care of the couple's 2 young daughters, and Dean, whose company is growing rapidly, requiring him to travel extensively. Laura doesn't feel wanted anymore, not to mention that Dean spends an inordinate amount of time with Fiona, a co-worker. Is he having an affair? Steps into the picture Laura's dad Felix, a guy with too much time and money on his hands. Felix convinces Laura to spy on Dean... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest from Oscar-winning writer-director Sofia Coppola. Here she looks at a marriage that may or may not be in big trouble, and how the wife looks at her dad for moral support. Laura is insecure and her dad is overly secure. This makes for a potential marriage-destructing mix. The joy in watching the film is not really the overall plot (which is quite predictable), but the everyday scenes that play out and are very much relatable to us the viewer. It helps that Bill Murray as the doting father (and grandfather) is in top form. Murray is now 70, if you can believe it, and still gracious and yes, funny. Rashida Jones in more than capable in the role of Lauren. As with many of her other film, Coppola brings ""On the Rocks"" with a wistful tone that is never outright sentimental. What a contrast to another New York City-centric I saw this weekend, ""A Rainy Day In New York"", the latest Woody Allen flick that feels just awkward how out of touch Woody Allen has become, as if the movie arrives beyond its expiration date.""On the Rocks"" opened in select movie theaters this weekend, including at my art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and will start streaming on Apple+ TV later this month. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely: about 15 people in total, which is more than any other movie screening I've been to in the last 2 months (including for Christopher Nolan's excellent ""Tenet"", I'm sorry to say). If you are a long time fan of either Sofia Coppola or of Bill Murray, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",On the Rocks

18,peterp-450-298716,I'm hoping for another cooperation between Coppola and Murray,7,4 November 2020,"You know what's great about her?
She doesn't talk. She just listens.
That sounds perfect for you.Life is full of unexpected turns. As an 18-year-old, I rented the adult cartoon ""Tarzoon: Shame of the Jungle"" just for fun. Probably because of the titillating vamp on the cover, lying naked on a huge platter and carried by figures that looked like penises. No one could suspect that a voice actor in this cartoon would become one of my most popular actors. If there's one comedian who manages to make me chuckle without any problem, it's Bill Murray. Like in ""Stripes"" and ""Ghostbusters"". Or the incomparable film ""Groundhog Day"". However small his role may be in a feature film, he always manages to create an unforgettable scene, such as in ""Zombieland"" for example. Put Murray in a horror, and his typical way of acting makes it a completely different experience. Just watch ""The dead don't die"" and you'll know what I mean. In short, a versatile actor who takes a film to a higher level with his contribution.This year I came to the conclusion that I had never seen the movie ""Lost in translation"". A film directed by Sofia Coppola (daughter of) with Bill Murray and the very young Scarlett Johansson in the leading roles. Even though there was something slightly comical lurking beneath the surface of this film, the subject matter was far from comical. A film about two individuals who are right in the middle of an identity crisis. A film about love and loneliness. Loneliness not only because of the life situation they both find themselves in, but also because of the fact that they are in a country where they don't understand the language, culture, and general way of life. Two lost souls who discover, sense, and encourage each other. I admit, I was moved after seeing this masterful film. Finally, after a long time a film that rocked my socks off. A thought-provoking film that'll resonate for a pretty long time. Yes, some movies do that to me.And then 17 years after the release of this magisterial film, we get a renewed collaboration between Sofia Coppola and Bill Murray. ""On the Rocks"" is not as magical as ""Lost in Translation"". But somewhere deeply hidden it does have points of contact with the latter. Here, too, Laura (Rashida Jones) is in the middle of a crisis. Both in terms of her marriage and her writing career. The suspicion that her husband Dean (Marlon Wayans) just pretends to have lots of work since starting his own company, just to cover up an affair, grows stronger. And writing a new book isn't easy either. The day she tells her father Felix (Bill Murray), a charismatic wealthy art dealer with an untameable flirtation habit, about her suspicions, he throws himself wholeheartedly into the case with full dedication. Before Laura realizes it, she is embroiled in a wild search for the truth.""On the rocks"" isn't such a depressing and melancholic story as ""Lost in translation"". There's more humor in it. How another mother at school tells Laura every morning about her love life. The interesting facts about human behavior and the evolution of relationships between men and women Felix tells about every time unexpectedly. The wild chase in a ""not so suspicious-looking"" red, noisy convertible through the streets of New York. Perhaps it's rather light, uncomplicated humor. Still, it's subtle at the same time. The chemistry between Laura and her father feels unforced and authentic. And this won't come as a surprise: Bill Murray nailed it once more. He demands full attention every time he comes into the picture. His characteristic acting and the way in which he can charm random people with his smooth talk is simply superb. And it's not just the female population that falls for his smooth-talking. The way he manages to turn a police officer's mood from being reprimanding to being helpful is just sublime.""On the rocks"" is about marital troubles, a complicated father-daughter relationship, and also about how people get lost in the turbulent and chaotic society in which they live. It's not another masterpiece of Coppola, but surely it's another successful cooperation between Coppola and Murray. I quietly hope that they will work together again in the future.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",On the Rocks
19,dierregi,Predictably disappointing,1,1 December 2020,"I didn't even know Coppola directed this when I started watching it. I selected it from one of my online subscriptions only because Murray was in it.Twenty minutes into it I was totally uninterested in Dean, Laura's hubby, alleged infidelity and Laura's boring and stressing life as an upper class NewYorker with two young kids.Enters Murray, as Felix, Laura's eccentric father, bringing some sparkles to the stale story. Yes, Felix is a womaniser but he's also charming and sophisticated and basically the only interesting character of the whole movie.Felix forces Laura to go into a private investigation on Dean and the two share some bizarre conversations about the eternal male-female struggle.Half way through, I got a hunch of how this was going to end and caught the bull's eye, so I lost interest because the whole chase is just an excuse to debate trite issues about relationships, with a politically correct twist.On the positive side, the photography is nice, with some beautiful settings but that's all and even Murray cannot save this boring and predictable truckload of cliches.It is now final: Sofia Coppola has nothing left say. She's even started pilfering from Bridget Jones' story line...",On the Rocks
20,jadepietro,Rocky Territory,6,24 January 2021,"IN BRIEF: Despite some nice chemistry between the two lead actors, the movie slightly disappoints due to a script that seems undernourished.JIM'S REVIEW: (MILDLY RECOMMENDED) Is Dean (Marlon Wayans) cheating on his wife, Laura Keane (Rashida Jones)? That is the central question that brings Laura and her eccentric father, Felix (Bill Murray) on the road to find out in Sofia Coppola's unsteady dramedy, On the Rocks.Suspicions seem to be mounting in that direction but all evidence appears to be purely circumstantial. After all, Dean's answers to his inquisitive spouse make logical sense, even if there are some tell-tale signs of infidelity afoot. Their marriage has hit a serious snag as Dean becomes more obsessed with his new business and spending precious time away from his wife. Laura is becoming obsessed too. With her daily routine of motherly chores and feeling romantically adrift, her career as a novelist is in a rut. So Laura goes to her only true source for improper male behavior: her philandering playboy father. His sage advice only confirms her husband's questionable actions: ""Of course, he is. He's a man!""...Start the investigating!The premise begins very promising, but the plot of Ms. Coppola's screenplay tends to fall into a rut too. As a director, she depicts upper society with panache, but as the screenwriter, she assembles all of her shallow characters and makes them aloof and self-centered elitists. Everyone on parade is an unpleasant example of white privilege and. She doesn't try to satirize these people. Instead, she readily accepts their unreal world of unending wealth as the new normal. The attitude is off-putting. especially for any of us common moviegoers who just won't care a fig or kumquat about this 1%. The resulting story ends up becoming slight and far too trivial in its execution.Fortunately Ms. Coppola is wise enough to concentrate on the relationship between father and daughter and their relationship has a winning charm that carries the film. This is due to her casting choices. Rashida Jones' Laura is quite engaging and one can sympathize to her dilemma as a modern day woman juggling her career with her high expectations of wife and mother. She brings the added nuance to her character and Bill Murray is delightful as her flawed but loving dad. He uses his comic timing masterfully and has a confessional scene with his daughter about his roving nature that has a touch of pathos. Their chemistry together is the film's saving grace. Mr. Wayan is fine in his stock role as the possibly dishonest spouse.On the Rocks is a movie on the rocks itself. It's diverting enough, but many comic situations never materialize. Too bad. The possibilities are all there. Yet, the film rarely builds to any real emotional payoff worth noting due to a problematic script that seems barely an outline than a fully developed idea.

21,Amyth47,Lost in Translation Part 2.,6,28 March 2021,"My Rating : 6/10Sofia Coppola teams up with Bill Murray since their 2003 masterpiece Lost In Translation.I really loved this film. The chemistry of Jones and Murray was a real driving force, and both characters were, to me at least, very well-rounded, interesting and funny. I think it was shot beautifully, and all of the short scenes really conveyed the mundanity of her life, and the monotony of adulthood.Good for a one-time viewing.",On the Rocks
22,arungeorge13,A solid lead trio tells a simple story and succeeds at it! [+69%],7,25 October 2020,"Much lighter when compared with Sofia Coppola's earlier works, On The Rocks is a case of a simple story well told. Kudos to the casting choices - a terrific Bill Murray, a warm Rashida Jones, and a restrained Marlon Wayans - all fit into their respective roles with ease. Rashida Jones plays Laura, a doting stay-at-home mom to her two kids and a writer. Wayans plays Laura's husband Dean, who's mostly busy with his newfound company. Murray plays Laura's dad Felix, a wealthy (read: playboy) businessman who re-enters Laura's life at a somewhat crucial juncture.Coppola's writing, while not as layered as some of the other works, lends enough credibility to Laura's suspicion that Dean may be cheating on her with his attractive secretary. Felix adds fuel to the fire by implying that men (just like himself) are more likely to feel attracted to more than one woman. This leads to a rather unusual father-daughter adventure wherein they learn more about each other while Coppola makes gentle statements on relationships, marriages, and ""men-being-men"". Some of the humor seems to have been added on-the-go. You get an amusing stakeout scene featuring Laura and Felix, on a suave Alfa Romeo chomping down caviar.Even when we see Felix's womanizing ways and how he urges Laura into doing things she otherwise wouldn't, his charm (of course, it's Bill Murray!) is undeniable. And Coppola's script fully acknowledges that. Laura is safe in Rashida Jones' hands, who exhibits just the right amount of fragility. Wayans is surprisingly good, proving that he can comfortably handle sober, straightforward roles. The ending may seem a little too simplistic (for an A24 film), nonetheless, it'll make you smile. I really enjoyed it!",On the Rocks

Here he becomes a canvass to paint upon, facilitating a stylus to sketch familiar territories and outlines encountered by many a maturing relationship, albeit with a significant bias founded in his own infidelity. Beautifully performed and full of wit, the dialogue between Laura and her father is a delight to be savoured.",On the Rocks
24,Jeremy_Urquhart,"A disappointment, yet it does at least contain a very enjoyable Bill Murray performance",6,10 October 2020,"While I wanted to like this a bit more than I did, and left the theatre a little disappointed, I can't deny that some of the movie was quite enjoyable, and I certainly wouldn't call it terrible overall.Perhaps that's on me for getting excited that this movie represented Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola re-teaming, and given how solid Lost In Translation was, maybe part of me wanted something that good. Unfortunately, I doubt this one will be as remembered or celebrated the same way Lost In Translation has been. The only other Sofia Coppola movie I've seen besides those two is The Virgin Suicides, and that was quite a bit better than On the Rocks too.One of the main areas this one is lacking is its visuals. Both Lost In Translation and The Virgin Suicides are extremely well shot, and very visually appealing movies. This one has its moments, and certainly isn't unpleasant to look at. It's just that much of the time, it's a bit drab and flat, looking more like a relatively standard episode of a modern TV show than a movie, unfortunately.While the script provides some good comedy, it also might be another one of the film's main issues. It doesn't have enough fun with the fairly out there premise to be a great comedy, but it also doesn't delve deep enough into the characters to make for much hard-hitting, compelling drama. There was the potential to go dark at moments here, if the filmmakers didn't want the comedy to be zany, but the movie lacks bite and genuine emotion at the opportunities where it could inset some. There are funny moments and there are somewhat serious moments, but sometimes it finds itself floundering in the Emotional No-Man's-Land that some dramedies regrettably find themselves in.With that negativity aside, I can say that at least Bill Murray redeems much of this film. He's not in the movie as much as you might hope, but when he is, he's genuinely very funny, and gives what might be one of his best performances in a while. Rashida Jones is also good, but I feel like she's wasted a little, given that her character is a little dull at times. Marlon Wayans is alright too, but Jenny Slate is honestly fairly annoying, and it doesn't help that her character doesn't feel necessary to the overall movie. Her brief scenes every now and then may have only been there to get the fairly small-scale and simple movie to a runtime of over 90 minutes.It's a good movie to watch one night at home, when you can't decide on anything else I guess. I saw it at a cinema, and it really didn't feel necessary, given how it's a relatively small movie, and also not particularly impressive from a visual standpoint. See it for Bill Murray and his unique, signature style of humour, if you're interested, but otherwise, this film is more or less average at best, and an overall disappointment, given some of Sophia Coppola's other films.",On the Rocks

OK some people jot down their thoughts and emotions as to this being boring or do we need this in these dire times and why the happy ending and all of these things, but they are just characters and if the writing is set up like lil' seeds in a garden , the plants grew only one way and it ended the way it had to end! thank god cuase it was one of the finest pieces of film writing I've seen in a long time, I do think she did a great job , it was fun and stylistic and Bill Murray was so much fun from beginning to end!

27,bob-the-movie-man,"Love ""On the Rocks""? Ain't no surprise!",9,23 October 2020,"Bill Murray is astonishing. Not just in ""On the Rocks"", but generally in life. Some actors - Johnny Depp, Mark Rylance, Gary Oldman, for instance - disappear completely into their characters so it takes a while to ""see"" who they are. Whereas with others - Bill Nighy, Tom Cruise, John Wayne, for instance - it's ""Oh, there's the famous actor xxxx in a new movie"". If we were grading on a scale, Bill Murray would be at the far right of the latter category. In every movie, he IS Bill Murray! In ""Ghostbusters"" he was the dry, laconic, wisecracking ghost hunter. In ""Groundhog Day"" he was the dry, laconic, wisecracking weatherman. In ""The Monuments Men"" he was the dry, laconic, wisecracking art historian. (In the ""Zombieland"" movies, he excelled himself by playing the dry, laconic, wisecracking Bill Murray!)For many actors, that would be a problem. But Bill Murray gets away with it, because - - he's Bill freakin' Murray!! And being him is so awesome that however many times you've seen the character, you always want more.Here's a case in point. In ""On the Rocks"", a chaffeured car with tinted windows rolls up. You brace yourself as the window winds slowly down. And there he is... the star. This happens quite a way into Sofia Coppola's new film. First up, we get a leisurely, but intelligent, set-up to the plot. The ""Parks and Recreation"" actress, Rashida Jones, plays Laura; a successful writer (currently with writer's block) married to successful businessman Dean (Marlon Wayans). The couple seem to have it all: high income; large New York apartment; two lovely young children. But Dean is always away, travelling on business - and always with his attractive co-worker ""with the legs"" Fiona (Jessica Henwick). Is Dean scratching the seven-year itch?Laura's rich, art-dealing father Felix (Bill Murray) arrives, and won't take no for an answer in sniffing out the truth.Love, love, love this movie! The pacing, the humour, the witty dialogue (it's Sofia Coppola's script) and - above all - Murray's triumphant performance all fire this well and truly into my Top 10 for the year.Bill Murray's acting is astounding... is there an actor who spends more time in his ""deep in thought"" mode, with eyeballs looking at the ceiling? You could quite well believe that none of it is scripted, and he's pausing in deep thought because he really is trying to compose the next best line! A scene where, through appropriate name-dropping, he charms his way out of a traffic infringement with two New York cops is utterly absorbing.Behind every embarrassing father is a grown-up daughter rolling her eyes. (I should know!) And Rashida Jones is perfect in the role. I'm not familiar with Jones's previous work, but she was just perfect as the foil for Murray's humour.There's dry comedy to be had throughout ""On the Rocks"" which I found delightful. A running joke is Laura's drop-off and pick-ups from the local kindergarten, where she is repeatedly pinned against the wall by single-mum Vanessa (Jenny Slate) and bored to death with her moans about boyfriend-hunting on the New York scene! It's an insight that the project is led by a female writer/director, reminiscing about personal experiences!Coppola's script also buzzes with politically incorrect views of the playboy Felix. (He reminds me strongly of an ex-work colleague: the life and soul of any party and with a charisma that is naturally attractive to women!)For me, there was just one misstep in the movie. There's a sub-plot about the estranged relationship between Felix and Laura's mother, and the unspoken tension that lies there. This all comes to a head in a hotel bedroom, and for me personally it brought the mood of the movie down and wasn't necessary. It's a relatively minor thing. But the result was that it just took the edge off things for me in declaring it a classic.This is one of those flicks produced for Apple, in cinemas only while en-route to their streaming service to make it eligible for Oscar consideration. And it's actually available now. This is Coppola's third outing with Murray, with the most famous being the Oscar winner ""Lost in Translation"". I'm actually not a mad fan of that film. But this one comes with a ""Highly recommended"".(For the full graphical review, please check out the bob the movie man review on the internet, or One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

28,Sir_AmirSyarif,Light-hearted and sweet,7,26 October 2020,"More conventional and modest than Sofia Coppola's other films, but 'On the Rocks' is no less entertaining or profound. It is light-hearted and sweet, capturing an energetic relationship between a daughter and her father thanks to the fantastic on-screen chemistry between Bill Murray and Rashida Jones.",On the Rocks
29,kjproulx,Mumblecore at its Finest,9,23 October 2020,"Mumblecore is a term used for a film that uses an excess amount of dialogue to carry a viewer from start to finish. Whether you're talking about a Richard Linklater film like Dazed and Confused (which is what he's best known for) or an indie comedy like Drinking Buddies, this term is thrown around a lot. Sometimes used to dive deep into a character's psyche or simply because the writer wanted to have a lengthy conversation linger on for a while, there are many ways of explaining mumblecore films. The reason I felt the need to explain that term for those who haven't heard it before, is due to the fact that I'm obsessed with this type of filmmaking/writing and loved watching On the Rocks for that reason alone. Here's why I believe On the Rocks, although pretty bare-bones in terms of complexity, is one of the better films of 2020 so far.After thinking her husband Dean (Marlon Wayans) is acting suspiciously with one of his co-workers, Laura (Rashida Jones) decides to reconnect with her father (Bill Murray). He then sides with her and makes a huge effort to prove whether or not her husband is being loyal to her. At its core, On the Rocks is a fun little New York City adventure flick that has Rashida Jones and Bill Murray stalking Marlon Wayans. From lengthy conversations to heartfelt moments between spouses and family, this film had me invested from the very beginning. It also doesn't hurt that this film is all about the performances of Jones and Murray because their chemistry here is terrific.Written and directed by Sofia Coppola, this isn't her first outing that included Bill Murray in a significant role. Lost in Translation is easily my favourite film she has ever done and that film involved Bill Murray, so it only seems natural that I think her second-best film might just be On the Rocks. I enjoyed her efforts in both Somewhere and The Bling Ring very much, but nothing ever seemed to come close to the precision that came from her in Lost in Translation. I think that's why I enjoyed On the Rocks so much. I felt hints of Lost in Translation trying to come out, but this overall film was too restrained for it to be as thought-provoking as that one.Look, this film is predictable from start to finish and for that reason, it may seem like the film went nowhere to some viewers, but I just loved spending time with these characters. If a film can suck you in with the characters on-screen, it's already done a great job. The ""stuck in his ways"" lines of dialogue that Bill Murray is given only deepened my love for the character and made him more authentic to a man of his age in today's day. On top of that, Rashida Jones played off his quips with easy and I completely bought her rendition of an overly stressed woman with a father like this. Even though some of the dialogue might feel overwritten due to how much of it there truly is, I just enjoyed the short little journey this film took me on.Overall, On the Rocks isn't going to win any awards, but if there was an Oscars category for movies that make you smile, this film might just take that one for 2020. I was grinning from ear to ear throughout the majority of the run time. I would almost say that the core story is about a father reconnecting with his daughter, even though the film suggests on multiple occasions that it's about whether or not Laura's husband is cheating on her. I also just want to add that I have really enjoyed Marlon Wayans lately. His last few performances have been outside of his wacky comedic routes and I feel that he actually has some really strong dramatic talents lingering around somewhere. I thoroughly, thoroughly enjoyed On the Rocks and if you're interested in checking it out too, it's now streaming on Apple TV+.",On the Rocks
30,msbreviews,Rashida Jones and Bill Murray shine in an overall enjoyable Sofia Coppola's film.,6,23 October 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Before jumping into the movie itself, I need to offer my appreciation for Sofia Coppola's career so far. With such a renowned filmmaker as a father (Francis Ford Coppola, the famous director behind the classic The Godfather trilogy, Apocalypse Now, and much more), Sofia was able to create a distinct career, avoiding condescending comparisons with her father's success. Most people in her situation would crumble to the pressure and succumb to a total failure. Fortunately, Sofia started showing her own unique talent early by delivering one of the best rom-coms of the 2000s, Lost in Translation (only her second feature film). Therefore, I was actually pretty interested in the simple premise of On the Rocks.This latest installment in Sofia's filmography continues one of her trademark characteristics: a light movie that addresses not-that-light themes. The main narrative follows the answer to a binary question: is Laura's (Rashida Jones) husband, Dean (Marlon Wayans), having an affair? The two possible outcomes don't allow the film to carry any impactful surprises regarding this storyline, but Sofia writes a screenplay filled with astonishingly captivating character interactions, mostly between Laura and her father, Felix (Bill Murray). The movie's beginning focuses on demonstrating Laura's day-to-day basis, developing this character in an exceptionally smooth manner.These first minutes without Felix in the picture establish Laura's mental state perfectly. Her feelings, thoughts, doubts, everything is shared with the viewer either through clean exposition or subtle expressions from the remarkable Rashida Jones, who delivers a nuanced, extremely rich performance. Then, enter the phenomenal Bill Murray. Felix is a charming yet complicated old man who can't be around a woman without hitting on her or stating dumb things like, ""I think I'm getting deaf to women's voices"". His relationship with her daughter seems quite close to the point of Laura trusting his crazy conspiracy theories based on exaggerated facts.Here lies my number one issue with the film. Until the third act, I could describe On the Rocks in one word: real. Every scene, conversation, or action is displayed in such a realistic way that I struggle to find a single sequence that didn't need to be in the movie. At the end of each scene, the viewer always learns something new, whether about a character, an event, or merely a detail of someone's life. However, the last half-an-hour takes the main characters (father and daughter, to be clear) through a path that crosses the line of common sense and makes me doubt if Laura would truly do such a thing, based on what the film showed of her personality until then.Nevertheless, that's not the problem. The real issue is the revelation that comes with this final act that raises a few questions concerning the father-daughter connection. I can't get into spoilers, but Sofia develops Felix as a fun, entertaining, not-to-be-taken-seriously old guy who makes a few too many jokes that maybe he shouldn't. However, after discovering a certain part of his life and how it affected his family, I partially lost empathy. The revelation is probably the only slightly surprising aspect of the movie, not because it's shocking (the film clearly points in that direction), but due to the viewer's focus being on finding out if Dean is cheating on Laura.This new development makes me question how Laura can be so close to her father without ever showing on-screen how she dealt with this situation, especially at the very end where the subject matter is brought back into her life. Don't be mistaken by this extensive explanation, I still enjoyed the movie! I can't deny the impact of this negative issue, but it's far from destroying the film. It's beautifully produced, with every technical aspect complementing each other. Sofia controls both the pacing and the tone of the movie in a flawless fashion.Still, Rashida Jones and Bill Murray steal the spotlight. Both deliver outstanding performances, carrying the dialogues effortlessly and fully embracing their characters' personas. Marlon Wayans is also pretty good, even though he doesn't have that much screentime. With a short runtime, the premise gets surprisingly more captivating than what I thought it was going to be. I felt significantly invested in the process of finding out the answer to the big question, and despite the partially disappointing third act, this storyline is brilliantly executed.In the end, On the Rocks is yet another success for A24 and Apple TV+. Sofia Coppola continues her already remarkable, distinct career with another film defined by one of her trademark attributes. A serious subject depicted through a lighter perspective, possessing fascinating character interactions, and a premise that ends up being a lot more engaging (yet still somewhat predictable and formulaic) than what's expected from it. Rashida Jones and Bill Murray are genuinely impressive, sharing palpable chemistry, ultimately carrying the whole narrative on their shoulders. It doesn't feel like a movie. It feels like a real story with real people... at least until the third act, where an over-the-top, hard-to-accept sequence leads to a revelation that questions the father-daughter bond, as well as the rushed resolution of such declaration. I still recommend it as a weekend's evening pick due to its short runtime and overall enjoyable story.Rating: B-",On the Rocks

The film offers some parallels besides the famous actor/director reunion. Both films handle roughly about a young woman finding her place in her life and relationship, fearing of betrayal, an odyssey through a major metropole and a man, while age wise beyond, but still being in his midlife crisis. But its still different because it also portrays a very difficult father daughter relationship. Rashida Jones is fantastic and it is good to see her in a leading role, she really carries this film. Bill Murray is very good too and for sure has some of his 2002 spirits. Its more of a supporting role here, but still offers many scene stealing moments and Murray once again manages the balance between comedy and character driven drama. Marlon Wayans was also good in a rather serious role ( compared to his usual portfolio). A calm little film of ordinary and extraordinary people. Very intimate. A nice look at love and human relationships. Beautiful soundtrack.

37,sweidman-28016,Good But Underwhelming,7,3 November 2020,"""It must be very nice to be you.""Sofia Coppola never fails to make a good movie if Bill Murray is in the cast. On the Rocks follows a young mother reconnecting with her larger-than-life playboy father on an adventure through New York when she believes her husband may be having an affair. I had some high hopes with this one. Ever since the project was announced everyone kind of freaked out. First off, it's Sofia Coppola. Secondly, an all-star cast with Bill Murray. And thirdly, the timing of release and it being an A24 movie suggested greatness. After watching, however, I do have to admit I was a little underwhelmed. The movie is good and all, but it suffers from the story. The story is good and has some exceptional writing. Mainly the story is too simple. I kept thinking that something greater would come but it stayed on the same level. That becomes evident about 45 minutes in. Luckily, all other aspects make up for it. Sofia Coppola is a great director. She works well with the actors and crew on set. One thing I typically notice in her movies is the set design. It's never over the top or noticeable. In this case it's a scene in a restaurant. The wallpaper and everything just complemented each other so I well. She just had an eye for everything.Bill Murray steals the show despite only being in a supporting role. His character is reminiscent of his past roles and a typical character we've seen. That doesn't stop him from being great. And Rashida Jones might just make her way to becoming more of a movie star and not just known for her TV roles. She handles the drama aspects well and Murray has the comedy. They are literally the perfect duo. The writing really works in their favor. Coppola makes the humor not laugh-out-loud but just has it flow into conversations. I prefer that than this being a full-on comedy. It's just a real shame that it doesn't get to greater levels. On the Rocks isn't going to work for everyone. It's tame, simplistic plot will turn some away and the ending sort of fizzles out since it's not what we were looking for. I like the end but at that point it just felt like an ending. Not a good or bad ending but it's just an ending. Anyway that didn't stop me from enjoying it.

It puts you on a good mood and expresses the characters emotions very very well (performances are on point). It is the perfect outcome to the script they wanted to make.. and that's where it disappoints. It captured a very interesting daughter and father relationship, but it's in service of a ""fine"" premise that doesn't leave you with much. It's not profound or subtle.. it just is.It's not unwatchable, but it's just not fun or endearing.

46,themadmovieman,"Funny, charming and clever",8,3 October 2020,"I'll admit that I've never been the biggest fan of Sofia Coppola's films, but On The Rocks is a completely different story. A funny, charming and clever comedy-drama with great performances across the board, this is a lot of fun, and still has the same emotional depth as some of the director's more serious works.At first, the movie seems like a sweet albeit unoriginal look at a woman stuck in a rut, with the story relying too heavily on quirky genre tropes to let Coppola's style really run free.Rashida Jones is wonderful from the first minute, but we see surprisingly little of her character's real personality until the arrival of her father, played by Bill Murray. Once Murray enters the picture, both he and Jones are absolute dynamite, and writer-director is really able to stretch her legs.The overarching story follows Jones as she reluctantly begins to suspect her husband of having an affair, while her father excitedly gets in on the investigation. However, more than that, the film's real heart lies in its assessment of family through a complex but thoroughly entertaining father-daughter relationship.Murray plays a confident, charismatic and manipulative older man whose charm is impossible to resist. As he enchants everybody in his sight, Jones rolls her eyes, in the knowledge of his true character.Not only charismatic, but a caring father too, the illusion of Murray's charm is only shattered when you realise what his real angle is - meddling in other people's lives and trying to project his own worldview onto everyone else.The back-and-forth between father and daughter as they become deeper embroiled in a bizarre spy game is what really makes On The Rocks, and Sofia Coppola is able to deliver that story with such great humour and emotional worth.There's something of a Woody Allen movie about On The Rocks, except Coppola plumps for more timely, real-world themes about marriage, female independence and the generation gap instead of Allen's full-blown existentialism.But it's the film's humour that proves the real icing on the cake, as Coppola delivers a sumptuously sweet story that will make you laugh all the way through. Sometimes it's more serious humour, and sometimes it's a little more silly, but it's always grounded brilliantly on the film's characters and central ideas.Overall, I really enjoyed On The Rocks. Though it gets off to a lukewarm start, the film bursts into life when Rashida Jones and Bill Murray combine, as Sofia Coppola's excellent screenplay finally begins to show what it's made of. Funny, insightful, clever and emotional, On The Rocks is right on the money from start to finish.",On the Rocks

Add to that the wonderful 'Woody Allen tribute-type photos' of New York. The device driving the plot is Rashida's ('Laura') mate and his new business venture which is turning him into an absentee husband, too busy to spend much time with his beautiful wife and 2 little girls.Enter Bill Murray, Laura's dad, a wealthy savour-faire man-about-town, who suspects that the husband is philandering of course (he may have written a book on the subject). He offers to assist his daughter in finding out the truth, with a little surveillance ( shades of Woody Allen's MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY).I found the film quite charming.

On The Rocks might not be her best work and yet it gave me exactly what I was looking for which is a laid back drama to enjoy with my dinner.The story deals with a family where a wife begins to suspect her husband of cheating but is not sure how to act as she doesn't have any concrete evidence. Her father, played by Bill Murray, makes a proposal to do a certain ""investigation"" and spend some quality time together while they are at it.To an extent, On The Rocks could be classified as a dry film as it is essentially a journey of human interactions, regrets and feelings. Bill Murray is undoubtedly the best part of the entire experience as his chilled out acting with occasional insights on human evolution make the story flow. The film's seeming lack of a meaty narrative is balanced by it's light nature which is aided by pleasant cinematography.

57,MovieBuff11732,One Of The Better Sofia Coppola Films,9,29 October 2020,"On The Rocks is a new movie from Sofia Coppola. She has previously made Lost In Translation. This film isn't on the same level of excellence but it is still of good movie.On The Rocks is about Laura (Rashida Jones) suspecting that her husband Dean (Marlon Wayans) is cheating on her after he got back from London. She tells her father Felix (Bill Murray) about this and he suggests that they both do a full fledged investigation while Laura doesn't want to make it a big deal.On The Rocks is a new Apple TV film from Sofia Coppola. I bought Apple TV just to watch this film and I felt like I used my money well. It was a funny and investing film. The story was marvelous. There were many funny bits in this film that got a chuckle. If you are looking for a comedy I wouldn't really say this is one to watch though. The comedy just sort of comes with the package you get with this film. The story is pretty well structured though. You feel for Rashida Jones character, you have a mutual respect for Marlon Wayans character, and you developed a liking for Bill Murray's. There was also a side character played by Jenny Slate. She was pretty funny in this film. She didn't really add much to the story but she was pretty funny. The only thing I didn't like about the story was the start to the film. I thought that it didn't really have the amount of energy that the rest of the film did. It felt out of the place from the rest of the film. Otherwise the story in this film is one the better stories of the year.The acting is the best part of the film. I wouldn't say the acting carries the film but it does add a lot to the film. Rashida Jones has the best performance. I haven't seen her do much serious roles so that might be why I really liked her performance but she had many emotional scenes that started to make your nose twitch. Bill Murray also played his character well. Although I thought that he was playing his typical character. He always is the guy who is sort of larger than life. He is still good with that type of character but he just plays his typical character. Marlon Wayans is pretty good in the film too. This is the first film that I have seen him in so I don't really have anything to compare his performance to. As I said earlier Jenny Slate was in this film but she didn't really have much screen time. She was sort of there for comedic relief. Jessica Henpeck played the character that was suspected to be the person that Dean was having an affair with. She also didn't have much time on screen. Although she did make you feel hatred for her character. The acting in this film was fantastic though.The score was something I didn't think I would be saying was that good. You even heard it in the trailer for the film so you should have known what it was going to sound like. Although in the moments of the film, the score added so much needed depth. The score was done by the group Phoenix who also did some music for Lost In Translation. They have also been on Jimmy Kimmel, Jay Leno, Conan and many more talk shows. So they are a band mainly but the score for this film was pretty good. Especially at the end of the film.On The Rocks was a film that had marvelous acting and the score added to the film in many ways but the start to the movie just didn't feel like the rest of the picture. I would recommend this movie to anybody who has Apple TV and anybody who likes Sofia Coppola movies or the sort sort of comedy/drama movies.",On the Rocks
58,TheFilmGuy1,Sofia Coppola's Best Since Lost In Translation,9,26 November 2020,"A womanizer with a heart of gold tries to help his daughter find out the truth behind her husbands strange behavior, learning a lot more about himself and his relationships in the process.I've had an extremely mixed relationship with Sofia Coppola's films. Lost In Translation is a masterpiece to me, but most of her other films just didn't click with me. So going into this one and seeing Bill Murray as one of the leads definitely gave me high hopes. It delivered. It's much more purposefully comedic and goofy than Lost In Translation, but it still holds that extremely strong emotional core. One scene had me shedding a tear, only to be laughing my ass off in the very next scene.Bill Murray may be second billing to Rashida Jones, but make no mistake, his character is central to the whole film. His performance is so charming and hilarious, but also hits those deeper and more introspective moments so perfectly. He's just a joy to watch every goddamn second he's on screen. His character is flawed, but the way he's written and the way Murray portrays him makes him feel so realistic.The reviews on here seem to be a lot less enthusiastic than mine, so perhaps this is no guarantee... but I would say that if you love Lost In Translation, this should do something for you. It connects to certain emotions and feelings that feel so true to life, and it's not often that I really feel that in an authentic way from a film.And to top it all off, there's a brand new track by Phoenix during the credits.",On the Rocks
59,ScoobySnacks66,"Mostly forgettable drama examines father, daughter relationships",7,26 October 2020,"One of Sofia's strengths as a director and storyteller has been her ability to capture unique and dreamy moments in time. In the past they've often been haunting, painting a surreal piece of art that leaves an indelible impression long after the film has ended. Over her last several films, she has often focused on father, daughter relationships; in Lost in Translation, Bill Murray plays a father figure to Scarlett Johansen's lost and lonely ex-pat in Japan. In Somewhere, Stephen Dorff is a well intentioned, but misguided bad-boy, actor, father to his young and impressionable daughter played by Elle Fanning. Even in the Beguiled, Colin Farrell's male presence stirs a bevy of Electra like emotions within an all-female boarding school. In each case, the female protagonist arguably helps her male counterpart correct his path and often his character in an almost Freudian like capacity.On the Rocks is a film along the same vein with Bill Murray returning (an obvious Coppola favourite) as Felix, the philandering father of Laura, played by Rashida Jones, a woman suddenly worried that her marriage may be in jeopardy and unknowingly in need of marital advice and as Felix sees it, some egregiously terrible fatherly wisdom. Bill Murray immediately kicks into overdrive with his notorious charm and zany antics while Rashida plays it safe and demure - to an almost invisible on screen inducing effect. When the film focuses on Felix concocting ill conceived adventures and doling out horrible mansplained advice, the film is entirely engaging and even quite humorous. When the rest of the cast appear, they move through their dialog and the carefully curated New York set locations with competence but the film loses traction. Beyond Bill, the remainder of the cast feel as though they have been handsomely assembled to act as a comic foil against Murray's legendary presence. Sofia's dreamlike magic also feels missing, the New York set locations are iconic but there is a lack of ethereal moodiness and no real soundtrack; the film feels mostly conventional. While the tension between Felix and Laura is believable, well acted and important, I found most of the film a forgettable folly of scenes strung together waiting for Bill to make another Murray-like appearance. He zooms in, does his thing and then he's gone with everything else wilting a bit. This is a good film, not a great one and won't appeal to a large audience. An example of why Apple TV+ will need a much larger and diverse film catalog to become a viable streaming alternative to compete with the likes of Prime, Hulu and Netflix.",On the Rocks

62,mbhgkmsgg,On the Rocks,6,9 December 2020,"On the Rocks is probably the most simple film I have watched this year. Everything about it feels so normal and casual. There isn't much to it and, at times, it feels very hollow. But the simplicity and pleasantness of it make it an easy, and surprisingly enjoyable, watch.This is exactly the kind of movie that you want to put on after a long day. On the Rocks is incredibly easy to watch, and it will, without a doubt, make you relaxed. Very little happens, and there isn't any underlying message to be found. All it is is an overly stylized piece of, quite frankly, nothing. The story is spectacularly simple. But it also feels real. It's easy to fall into this film and the lives of the characters since they feel genuine. Since the story is so plain, it also leaves a lot of time for all these little things. Things that probably shouldn't be put into a movie. But somehow, they end up feeling just right in a movie like this. Indeed, the plot could've been covered in about half the time. But thankfully it's not. Although On the Rocks feels very much style over substance, I didn't mind it too much. Sometimes all I want is to have an easy and pleasant time with a film, and I had exactly that with On the Rocks.The story puts us into the life of Laura, who, lately, hasn't been feeling like herself. She is stuck with her writing and has started to believe that her husband might be cheating on her. She goes to her dad for advice, and the pair are thrown into what becomes a sort of spy story to uncover the truth behind whether her husband is indeed cheating on her. And it's that spy story that keeps this movie going. In fact, it's the only thing that keeps this movie going. Apart from it, very little happens. Outside of the time with Laura and her dad, this movie could be a look into almost anyone's life. It's so ordinary. And while it might make it boring for some, I quite enjoyed it. Certainly, the best part is Bill Murray and his ridiculous character, but I also really enjoyed the simplicity of On the Rocks.But that simplicity is also the worst part of the film. It's was really difficult for me to care about what was going on. And while that kind of approach might have worked, had there been something beneath the surface, there's nothing there. No matter how hard you dig, you won't find any deeper meaning in On the Rocks. It is exactly what you see. It feels like someone just decided to follow a random person for a couple of weeks and film all the interesting bits. And while this random person happened to have a rather unusual father, it's still just her life. It's the type of life that most of us can relate to because we are living very similar ones. And while that sounds boring on paper, it ends up being a surprisingly fun and enjoyable time.Probably the best way to describe On the Rocks is average. There is nothing special about this film. For the most part, it's overly simple and can, at times, even feel a little boring. But as a result, it's wonderfully easy to watch. It's pleasant, it made me laugh, and it's gorgeous to look at. And sometimes, that's all I want from a movie.",On the Rocks

Sofia went back to her Lost In Translation roots after her last outing The Beguiled, a psychological drama. The movie is quite dull until Bill Murray enters which is 18 minutes after the opening credits.

But Bill Murray only does Bill Murray Shtick in this and there are none of the other bright lights, or even much of a script. Perhaps Murray is doing hasty improv, as if he is really reading his text msgs under the table? He can be a great dramatic actor but there's nothing for him in this script and not funny.The older man senior crisis thing, where he tries to be wise but turns out to be just a regular human (perhaps after Francis Ford?) doesn't work this time. Then there's the silly homage to the movie ""10"", thrown in for who knows what, maybe so we can compare Blake Edward's genius to her wannabe? Cough. The same blandness that was in her failed acting attempt, which seemed original in an ingenue director, now kills her films.

Unfortunately, that's already everything there is to say about it, since Coppola's newest basically turns out to be a witty, yet unremarkable rom-com: not bad by any means, but definitely too easy to forget given the talent involved. The acting here is surprisingly mediocre, especially since it cannot benefit from the dialogue, which feels stiff and non-dynamic in too many scenes.ON THE ROCKS is a charming little film, but ultimately unremarkable when compared to Coppola's previous work.

He plays a quirky father to Rashida Jones' character, who is lost deep down and maybe hasn't been there for his kids as much as he should be.Jones plays a writer who is losing motivation to write since she stresses the single mother role since her husband travels a lot, played by Marlon Wayans. The whole thing is taking a tol on her mental health and it shows.Once she connects with Murray he assumes that Wayans might be cheating on her so they go on this quest to find the answers. This is when the plot caught my attention and could've gone either way, whether he is cheating on her or not. During all this Murray and Jones still aren't really connecting, she feels embarrassed of her Dad's off the wall personality and assumptions and Murray complains that Jones isn't fun anymore after they get the answer they were together looking for. The ending puts everything back together, though it did feel a bit rushed, but it was satisfying.The layout is a nice touch. You have the beautiful city scenery and then you have the fancy resort in Mexico. Both really fit in well with the movies tone.I liked Murray a lot in this movie. I liked his character and I think he will decide your rating. If you like him in Translation and in Broken Flowers and even in other drama movies he's been in, then you will want to watch this.",On the Rocks

Marriage Story
Lost in TranslationThis is the latest film by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation; Virgin Suicides; The Beguiled), the already long-established daughter of a cinematic giant Francis Ford Coppola (the director of ""The Godfather 1-3""; and ""Apocalypse Now""). It is a classic dramedy with beautiful cinematography and a radiant performance by Bill Murray.Laura, a self-employed writer and a mother of two, discovers that she is in a marriage where the waters have become just a bit too calm for the people swimming in them to feel safe. She starts casting some panicked looks to the shore after her husband Dean comes home from one of his constant business trips all clouded on Xanax and seems to confuse her for someone else as they kiss. The next morning, she finds another woman's perfume in his toiletries. Hmmm.It's probably nothing, but this is one of those marriages where there's just enough distance between two people for a little imagination to fill the empty spaces. You get carried away by the constant rush that comes with having 2 little kids and a full-day job; and you just seem to not be able to spend time with your spouse anymore. At the same time Laura happens to reconnect with her charismatic, playboy, ever young and flirty father (Bill Murray), who helps her fill in all the gaps she was afraid to fill in herself. Her dad assumes that, like himself, every man is defined by his natural ""urges for reproduction""; that we all are ""hardwired"" like this. And although Coppola clearly disagrees with that idea, the great strength of ""On the Rocks"" is that it doesn't ask the dad to change but is rather interested in exploring what it is he clings to.Now, despite the films seemingly grim topic it is a very nice balance between drama and comedy. The father-daughter duo drives around New-York playing spies while we discover the intricacies of themselves and their peculiar relationship in an amusing and sweet way. It is also very atmospheric; noticeably great camerawork and cinematography will surely bring this film an Oscar nomination. Overall a very enjoyable experience, and SO FAR definitely in my top 10 of 2020.",On the Rocks

But unlike those other movies, she doesn't even attempt any sophomoric pretensions of some deeper meaning. Just the usual, dullsville, ""what is this, and why am I watching?"".Murray is supposed to be the ""larger than life"" father. But the attempts to show this are contrivances that are just not credible. E.g. you don't believe a very attractive woman his daughter's age is hitting on a guy who looks like a 70 yo Bill Murray. Or that he'd get out of a traffic incident because he just happens to know the cop's father - in NYC? And movie cops out by never having a scene with her father and mother...her mother actually seems no more than a prop.Conclusion particularly rings false when Jones blames - clearly her own suspicions and missteps - on her father.

It's like an enigma that I don't want to bother understanding like it is such a miss I'm sure Sophia Coppola meant something by her decisions but frankly I don't care enough to find out what that may be because it won't really make me enjoy the movie that much more.35mm film was the way to go though the movie looked incredible and for a majority of the story's beats it was working well for me, Rashida Jones was great and Bill Murray was excellent with what he was given. The city of New York felt alive and sparkly and again credits to the cinematography. I think if I peeled back every one off thing Murray there must be something Coppola is saying about femininity and masculinity and humanity and what not so for that it wasn't a complete waste of a movie but the execution really missed the mark so completely. If I were a teacher and I was handed this assignment it would be just above a failure like there are plenty of good sevens out there a six is a little much and five below is movies that offended me territory so since for some reason every film on this app is a 7.something this shall join its ranks in average.

98,DocIndy,I was hoping for a better film,7,26 October 2020,"It has been 17 years since Sofia wrote and directed Lost in Translation which also starred Bill but that film is far superior to this film.

That being said even Bill's charm cannot save a weak scrip with every other character in the film being poorly developed. Additionally it is hard to like Felix when he presents a concept that all men are or want to be non-monogamous. This is potentially true for some men and women but not all.
I think Bill is a talented actor and in fact I watched this film specifically because he was in it. I respect his body of work and typically like even his most quirky performances but again the above basic premise makes it hard to like Felix despite Bill's talent.",On the Rocks

I felt the producers missed the boat by trying to focus too much on moralising Felix (Murray) rather than focussing on a satisfying finale.Ps: I only just read that Rachida Jones is a daughter of Peggy Lipton.

Bill Murray and Rashida Jones have a great chemistry in their father/daughter dynamic and basically carry the whole thing in a basket (as I'm sure was the plan.) Marlon Wayans played the work-a-holic, neglectful husband well, but never was able to convince me that he really loved her. The little girls were adorable, and the scenery nice and appropriate. The camera-work was clean, with cuts that helped move the story along.

Firstly I have to mention the bold colour palette and how perfectly everything was captured. A real beauty in the mundane was found here in such a simplistic effortless way, even Laura just sitting at the table in her New York Apartment caught your eye. It's similar to Lost in Translation in how very simplistic shots became so eye-capturing, aesthetics wise. That is however the only comparison I am going to make to Lost in Translation because that is literally the only similarity. I remember posting a picture from Lost in Translation on my Instagram feed and somebody commenting saying that On the Rocks is going to be the unofficial sequel, I don't know if that is/was the general viewpoint on the film that people have, but if so then that might explain the muted reaction to this, but I can confirm On the Rocks is very much it's own film and story. I just loved how plainly everything was shown, you fell in love with the mundanity of the given time and place. Not only that but I think this film makes a really nice comment on the meaning of family, love and trust. One would think love and trust come with the topic of family but these topics feel separate and then seamlessly all together into that one topic at the end: family. All of these very important things are put on the line yet none are lost by the end, if anything they're even stronger and when the credits rolled i realised that and I did just smile to myself for a moment.Considering I titled my review referencing the father and daughter relationship it probably seems odd I haven't actually gone until detail about it. That's because it does just speak for itself, from Laura and her Father's first interaction you know exactly what their relationship is and you just get to see it blossom even more as the film goes on and it's just so encapsulating, Bill Murray shines in this role, I might be as bold to say it's his best performance.Heart-warming in a brilliantly subtle way, Sofia Coppola continues to shine in her directing.",On the Rocks

From his first scene I felt like he was rehashing his old lounge singer character from SNL and his smarminess from those days made an appearance as well. We don't get to see a lot of depth from him which is a shame because some of his recent work has shown he has the acting chops to show us multi dimensional characters. In fact this movie didn't flesh out the characters at all. I like Rashida Jones enough but she seemed as if she was here just to be an audience for Bill while he hammed it up.

Bill Murray should have been in it earlier.Also, his part was kind of crap. He plays an old rich dude - not uncommon for comedians of his age - but the character comes across as a cartoonish caricature of Peter Venkman as an old man.

She's trying to write a book but apparently does not have any idea what to write about or why. Hubby (Marlon Wayans) does something in social media, meaning he started a company that seems to be mainly about getting followers and/or likes, no mention of any relevant product or service. Daddy (Bill Murray) is a rich art dealer who, while travelling across and being acquainted to half the planet, has a life void of meaning and therefore meddles with his daughter's. Even though no-one is producing anything tangible or worthwhile, they're all loaded. There's some children too but they are basically extras.There is hardly a story arc and no character development to speak of. There was one moment where I expected some drama to enfold at last, but that fell completely flat. Each and every character is a cardboard cutout, disengaging, entitled and ultimately boring. The cinematography is only so-so, there is no sound design that I could discern.I went to see this mainly because of Bill Murray, but his natural charm and screen presence do not even come close to saving this dud. Most of his acting in this is pretty pedestrian, it did not feel like he had his heart in it. I'm sorry to say it, but it appears he went for the pay check above all else. The dialog is so cringeworthy, it would have been hard to deliver it though.Just like with Song to Song (2017), I did wonder if the shallowness of the whole affair is a statement it itself, a comment on the navel-gazing self-absorbedness of modern urban life. Alas, I fear that with both films that is not the case, the lack of substance is not meaningful, it's simply the absence of a good story.Bottom line, it has a few good moments but is like a fast-food snack, quickly digested and providing zero sustenance.",On the Rocks

Why would a large electronics company be the blame? Exactly. Because they have more to lose than to gain. In my opinion, this causes a narrow-minded, unrealistic portrayel that comes nowhere near real-world drama that they try to convey. There is no risk, no edge, no emotional message. If there are any messages, they smell pretentious and out of date. For some reason they like to think they created some legitimate cause for spreading cliches about pretty much any topic they choose and reformatting them using their own narrow-minded, conservative style they would use for an Apple ad. Multi-racial relationship without any real difficulties or emotional depth, new york coffee cups and big appartments, creating start-ups, writing books and raising children (or rather have baby sitters), all pretty much stress free. Where is that crucial moment that shows that they actually care for people and have looked into the ways people behave and interact with one another in the real world. A world that is dominated by much larger and more important things than silly relational misunderstandings with happy endings? One might wonder: why would you put that much thought in just another romantic comedy (if you can call it that)? Well, it's because it's movies like these that send out the wrong morals and values in a way that simply does not comply with today's expectations and ideals.

It's a throwback of sorts to conventional studio comedies of the 50s and 60s. Perhaps my expectations were really low going in after seeing some lukewarm critic reviews.Anyhoo, if you're bothered by self-pitying upper class urbanites, you might not enjoy this wafer-thin film. Lost in Translation is one of my favourite movies of all time. That film had real depth. You get the sense Coppola wasn't set in her ways when she wrote it. Alas, On the Rocks comes off like the bored meanderings of a writer who's lost her drive to say something. Occasionally Murray's character is sent off on a pseudo-philosophical commentary about gender dynamics, but it all feels terribly dated and out of touch. Meanwhile, Marlon Wayans does an admirable job in a dramatic role, but there's zero screen chemistry between him and Rashida Jones, who mopes her way through the proceedings.All this to say that it's still a treat watching Bill Murray do his thing.

Even though it reunites Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola, it has none of the charm and atmosphere of Lost in Translation.Murray looks like he's doing it as a favor for Coppola, but would actually rather be somewhere else. His delivery is strangely affectless and his character is utterly unlikeable. The main character is written to be deliberately uninteresting and charmless - I actually felt a bit bad for the actress who had to portray her that way. She has no chemistry with the actor who portrays her husband, and every time they're together it seems more like an awkward first date than a scene from a marriage. Their two children are super cute but have almost no dramatic role and spend most of the movie with babysitters while the main characters are drinking and eating at fancy restaurants and parties.The plot is totally pedestrian and can be summed up as: ""I think my husband is having an affair. Let's follow him and see if we can catch him in the act!"" And then, uh oh, now Lucy has a lot of splainin' to do. Fortunately, the characters are all rich, so they don't have to worry much about the consequences of bad decisions.

156,eaveschristopher,A LIGHT TOUCH COMEDY AND A CHARMING BILL MURRAY,7,3 November 2020,"ON THE ROCKS MICRO REVIEW -
---
On The Rocks is a comedy with a light touch exploring relationships and their infidelities. Laura Keane (Rashida Jones) suspects her husband (Marlon Wayans) of cheating on her while having an interjecting father (Bill Murray) who was himself a ladies man. Sofia Coppola presents an honest self-portrait or an artist dealing with domesticity bringing a charm that shines the brightest through Murray and Jones's exchanges.Coppola constructs an authentic and complex version of masculinity through Bill Murray - one that is deeply flawed through his desire to be loved, his opinions of femininity beauty, and desire to fix in others what he has done wrong. The flavorful overlaying eccentricity of the character withstanding. However, I wish more conversation time was spent between Wayans and Jones which would have solidified the juxtaposition of Murray and Wayans variations on masculinity with Jones being caught in the middle.On The Rocks is everything you think it will be but the journey to get there is charmingly enjoyable and always engaging. Especially from the always charismatic, charming and eccentric Bill Murray.",On the Rocks

I watched it a second time.I think the main theme of this film is mending your relationships and connections. We so often get lost within ourselves that we forget the people most important to us, including ourselves, and are unable to see clearly. You lose trust with yourself and others, which Laura struggles with throughout. And shrugs it off too often.Bill Murray adds a lot of life in this film. His role could be looked at as overzealous, but he is a man that deals with a horde amount of painful nostalgia, mostly because of women. And the parallels with him and what is thought of with Dean is no surprise why he wants to pull this incognito mission with his daughter. He is also brilliant as always.I thought the movie was slow, of course. But atmospheric might be a better word, especially in those outdoor scenes in New York. I viewed the movie the same way I viewed Lost in Translation, and after it made the viewing more enjoyable.Monogamy is often brought up. Sometimes forced, but it does play off well and makes you think by the end of the film. Whether people want to be playboys or settled in, the point is to keep things fun, keep things fresh.

Bill Murray is quite good as one would expect, but other than that there is nothing impressive (Nothing terrible either) from the acting.

While Murray together with the brilliant Rashida Jones and Marlon Wayne deliver good performances, these cannot save the lacklustre and monotonous screenplay.The screenplay decides to play it way too safe, always suggesting and hinting at things, but never delivering on those promises. Or when it actually decides to deliver on those promises, they are wrapped up way too conveniently. Thus, these lead to really anti-climactic moments and can become frustrating for the viewer.Overall, the film is a lacklustre addition to Coppola's quite decent repertoire. Though, her formula of depicting the rather mundane existential problems of the upper class gets quite stale as their problems seem too far removed for the common viewer.

It's possible that the story only relates to some people. If you have a family and know the day to day grind, there is some real amusing reflections in this movie; and it's all really accurate.The actors were all great together. Murray does steal the show, but isn't that why he was hired. He is great with Jones and I was fully entertained by their pairing.Sometimes you have to sit into a movie and enjoy the pacing and try to understand what the characters are feeling or growing through.

It's not a comedy. You can't build the first 30 minutes out of making the main character more and more worried, with zero laughs, and then try to counterweight the balance back into comedic. No way.
But Murray's entry into the film did make it feel more pleasant.
Has R. Jones done any comedy? It was a relief when she revealed how much hurt she had, all caused by father and she let him have it.

The set of New York or California also puts me off... it's just too lazy and out of touch with the rest of the world audience. This movie almost feels like it's a commercial for hotels, restaurants, artists and resorts. All things way out of most of our price ranges, decidedly not bougie but elitist. Do I seem jealous? Enough about me.
The kids were absolutely adorable and the little ones' activities were natural but like most kids in movies they are a furniture. I really appreciated the interracial relationships between all the characters being a non-issue. Finally- now we're getting somewhere!!! Like the kids, Marlon, Jenny, and everyone else we'd just accessories without mush substance. Rashida's character perfectly captured the essence of a worn-out, uninspired, insecure, unfulfilled, uninterested and frankly, uninteresting mom. Honestly based off of the bit of her personality I don't know how she was a writer. She needed attention and an unwanted adventure, with intrigue, and a touch of danger with a sexist older man and her dad delivered. In usual Bill Murray fashion, he carried the movie. I couldn't wait to hear what he would say next; my favorite being allusions to Desmond Morris. I wonder if Sofia wrote his whole character. If she did, kudos... he was wonderfully compelling. It was a bit hard to reconcile a man in power being such a flirt but there was some redemption in that he wasn't chauvinistic. His daughter constantly reminded him how inappropriate he was but I guess some men can't be be tamed, certainly not in their 70's. I grew up long enough ago to know to accept the nature of it and recently enough ago to know women need to take power and speak up, without it being a flirtatious slap on the arm saying you're bad. They already know that.
Anyways... I loved 2 of Sofia's films with all of my heart. Virgin Suicides is top 20 and Lost in Translation top 5. The soundtracks alone made them worth watching and the choices were absolute movie making magic. Perfect movies in every way, color, characters, cinematography. This movie, not so much. A close-up of a tear in a martini is hardly redemption. Was there any music in this other than crappy jazz and Murray singing (which I would have preferred to jazz)? I guess there was... I just checked the playlist. I'm a worn out mom and used to be more perceptive. Not many actors could have made Bill Murray's character endearing and without him I would have turned it off... no disrespect Rashida, you did a fine job with what you were given. Sofia... what happened to you? You used to be fun.",On the Rocks

My wife and I both agree this was basically a wasted 1.5 hrs out of our lives. We were looking for a comedy and it was only able to provide a few short chuckles. Perhaps the worst comedy we've seen in years!Spoiler Alert:
The drama part of the movie also sucked, it leads you to believe the husband is cheating on his wife, and then you find out he isn't, but they never explained why on one night that started all her doubts he went from seemingly wanting to make passionate love with her to suddenly losing interest in her at all.
At a minimum, at the end, when she was becoming convinced he had not cheated, SHE SHOULD HAVE ASKED WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT! I still want to know the answer and feel the movie did NOT realize a good conclusion that was convincing as to why he acted that way on that night. I'm still left with the unfulfilled feeling that maybe he was cheating and got away with it because he just happened to come home early from one business trip!Also, the drama wasn't very good at the drama part, the interactions with the kids were Boring, and Bill Murray cracked a few laughs at his sexist stupidity and moronic comments about how all men are hardwired to cheat, but it was a talking role, he never had to actually act and or change his facial expressions!",On the Rocks

199,mariannaserwa,A wonderful sequel to Lost in Translation,9,21 November 2020,"Lost in Translation is my favorite movie of al time, I have re-watched it over and over countless times and basically grown up with it. (I was 17 when I first watched it). Nothing quite hit this hard from Coppola's repertoire since this wonderful gem from 2003.On the Rocks is not as polarizing of course, not as deep or emotional. But it is some sort of a continuation, at least as long as Bill Murray's character goes, plus Rashida Jones as his wonderful heart-felt realistic partner in crime. You can feel a similarity in Charlotte's character from LIT to Laura, but It's much more grown up this time around, maybe the problems seem also more trivial, but that's life I guess, as it goes on your dreams are not as big anymore. Or maybe that's just Sofia's experience?I liked the movie, I enjoyed it thoroughly, as one of my film director friend's put it ""Sofia can do no wrong"". I agree with that - in On the Rocks you can feel the atmosphere of the city Sofia lives in - she seems to have had a similar life in NYC, although her kids are already older that the one depicted in the movie (also 2 daughters btw!). A similar (real life) situation was illustrated in Lost in Translation, a sequel to Sofia's frequent travels to Japan. Drawn by her feelings and observations of certain moments in life, her new movie isn't to be liked by everyone, but it is, dare I say it? Honest.Honest about the long lost melancholy a the time long gone, of NYC social clubs, rich gentlemen, hanging out at the Carlyle and driving around in convertibles. For me the highlight of the movie is the slow-mo martini glass moment with ""I get along without you very well"" playing softly in the background. A true Sofia Coppola moment.I watched this movie several times, once with a more critical and cynical attitude, with my bf, and for a second time with my mother, which sparked a lively conversation around the topic, if men CAN actually be faithful. Never expected such afterthoughts after such a seemingly, simple-scripted movie.All in all, this movie isn't for everyone, a certain love for NYC and Sofia's peculiar style might be needed here and there to enjoy it.
Murray is wonderfully himself, not always ultra funny, but truly him, I love him singing like in LIT, and spying on Laura's husband like in Broken Flowers. (one of my favs too)To me, all in all, On the Rocks is a beautifully paced slow burner reminding me of how quickly time passes and that Sofia's style is truly one of a kind.",On the Rocks

It is also about communication (much like Lost in translation) and misunderstanding, about growing up and finding the confidence to define oneself as a woman apart from your father's shadow. In the end it is about love and relationships (also New York looks great). This is not a shallow film as some would have it, it is just not pretentious or full of pseudo-intellectual dialogue like most Baumbach or Ethan Hawke films.

The movie is about the relationship of Laura (Rashida Jones) a 30 something old woman, married with two girls, that all of the sudden finds herself lonely because her husband Dean (a wasted Marlon Wayans) travels a lot for work. One night, after arriving from one of his trips, Dean kisses Laura then suddenly stops and go to sleep, prompting the suspicious of his bored and insecure wife that he is cheating on her. After inquiring a little, she decides to take advice from her dad (the always amazing Bill Murray) who says that her husband is obviously cheating and all Laura has to do is caught him on action. Contrary to all common sense, Laura decides to believe her father and becomes more and more suspicious of Dean. Of course, after a series of cheap tricks, the audience is lead to believe that maybe Dean is actually cheating. If you are experienced in this kind of movie, the ending is pretty obvious and the real deal here is the fragile self-estime of a woman who's father cheated on her mother - deep down she believes that sooner or later her husband will cheat on her. She is insecure because she finds herself boring, she is experiencing a writer's block and can progress with her work while her husband's career is blooming. Against all odds she keeps a close and beautiful relationship with his father, close enough to say that they are actually friends.The chemistry between Rashida and Bill as daughter and father is rather believable since it's the only solid relationship in the movie (actually it is the only one that it's truly explored). I couldn't understand the angst of Laura regarding Dean's cheating because we are not showed anything about their relationship: he works a lot, she takes care of the kids and tries to write and that's it. Their interaction is rather dull, they lacked chemistry, to me it was unbelievable that they were husband and wife. Very good looking couple, but it was missing an important piece... Bill Murray played his usual self, were he blabs dialogues and he is funny without even trying. We can see he spill words full of misogyny, hit on women younger than his daughter, patronise his son-in-law and police officers but hey, it's Bill Murray so he gets a free pass on being an awful human being - he actually says to his granddaughters that they should wear their hair long and pretty because men liked. The movie was supposed to be a comedy with hints of reality but fails to it because in my opinion, Sofia Coppola tried to ""posh it up"" a simple story and sucked all the fun. The rhythm was very slow, the action sold at the trailer (father and daughter acting as detectives) it's only 1% of the movie. I believe the real point of this story was to show how a betrayal of a parent can damage a kid's future relationship.
One amazing scene, to me, and very well acted by both leads was when they were in Mexico and Laura inquires her father if it was worth-it for him to leave her mother and cause all of that pain to be with a woman that he never ended up with. Bill Murray answers ""it was heartbreaking"" and says no more, he only stares at Rashida who slowly understands what he meant.

Not Coppola.
This is an expertly crafted script. The direction is tight and incredibly focused. I'm flummoxed as to why the reviews aren't more praiseworthy.
From costume choice to subtext to the right amount of emotion, this film presents subtleties and nuance often lost in modern films. It's beautiful and artistic.
Kudos to Coppola for telling a story about the parts of relationships, both romantic and familial, that often get lost with other filmmakers.
Murray and Jones sparkle while Wayans walks the fine line between villain and heartthrob. And the enigmatic Jenny Slate is a welcomed surprise.
The emotional transitions are natural and impactful at the same time.
Overall, this has gone on the Rewatch List. I'm sure I'll continue to find more depth to it in the many viewings yet to come.

He clearly loved his daughter and wanted to do everything within his power to help her. However, he had also clearly let her and her mother down earlier in their lives. The scene in Mexico where the daughter asked him why was one of the best in the film.Because this movie was a new release from Sofa Coppola and Bill Murray, I compared it to ""Lost in Translation"" which was a much better film. ""Lost in Translation"" was deeper and more honest about loneliness and life in its many phases.""On the Rocks"" was filmed beautifully, New York looked great and some of the conversations between Bill Murray and Rashida Jones were quite funny and true to live. However, I'd give this film a ""2"" and would have rated ""Lost in Translation"" an ""8.""The character Rashida Jones played was unsympathetic. It was hard to really care what happened to her. She was cruel to her dad on a number of occasions. When she visited her mother, grandmother and sister, their behavior didn't justify her frustration at having to deal with them. She was a self absorbed character who whined and bitched through most of the film. I couldn't bring myself to feel as sorry for her as I normally would for the victim of a cheating husband. Bill Murray's character had more charm and more honesty about his own failings in life to balance out his womanizing ways while Rashida's character behaved more like an adolescent. She was a good mother, so perhaps the idea was that her growth was limited in certain ways by her father issues specifically and uncertainty about the nature of men generally.I was glad in the end to find out her husband hadn't cheated on her and that they stayed together, but I think my frustrations had to with feeling like I kept waiting for the film to begin, that it was quite shallow and that the plot twists were forced.

Lost in Translation 2 it isn't. This movie is a disaster from beginning to end. The plot, whatever little there is, is brought to a still-life birth and we're half way into the movie before anything actually happens. I am thinking ""Get on with the story already!"". But there is no story. We already know the ending and don't care one bit about any of the characters. There is no story arc.The Bill Murray character is a lot like an educated Trump. Knows everybody, is liked because of his money, and yet has no real friends, except maybe his driver.I really don't need to see how the rich can beat a reckless driving citation because the cops treat the Murray character so tenderly. C 'mon. Cops aren't that nice, even to other cops. No cop is going to help push start your car. Murray is so rich, he can call a tow truck. After 4 years of Trump, I have had enough of wealthy characters getting away with all sorts of bad behavior and avoiding responsibility.Murray is rich and buys art, but he was also a cop? No explanation.Not one single actual laugh is this snooze-fest. No even a chuckle. I really don't care how the wealthy live in New York, even if they have an inter-racial marriage. It feels like the male lead was just cast as a token black, as there is nothing of black life and black culture in the film. All the other black characters are servers in restaurants.How the heck did this couple ever meet? No explanation.What is the purpose of the character at the school running a boring stream of consciousness monologue about her privileged life that even bores the lead character?I don't think I have ever given a movie 1 star out of ten that was produced by a major studio and written and directed by someone who should know better.Do not waste 94 minutes out of your life watching this drivel. Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. It is so bad, the studio should recall it as spoiled goods and just pretend it never existed.Sofia Coppola probably had a single film remaining on her contract and called this one in from the beach. Coppola was so lazy, she didn't even bother to research if the QE II was still in service.

242,Lanna123,Movie Felt Unfinished and The Ending was Disappointing,6,23 October 2020,"Murray is great in this film, as he always is in every film he is in, but the movie felt unfinished to me. There were a lot of tired cliches in the film, which I didn't like. I guess jewelry and some reassuring words was all it took to convince Laura her husband wasn't cheating on her. I would have liked the ending to be less of a happy ending and more of a realistic ending. For example, after Dean tells Laura that nothing is going on, I would have liked to see Laura catch her husband doing another thing that makes her think he's cheating. Then, Felix, her father, convinces Laura to continue to follow Dean around with him, where they go on more crazy adventures to do so, until the catch Laura's husband smooching another woman. Laura then eventually confronts Dean, and the couple decides to separate and eventually divorce. While following Dean around, Laura meets a man, who she befriends, who helps them follow Dead. This man befriends Laura and eventually becomes her husband. The man is a son of her father's friend, who they run into. The movie ends with the marriage between the Rashida and the new man. However, behind the scenes, Felix suspects this new man is cheating on her and is having him followed. The movie ends with that cliff hanger, and the sequel will follow from there. Although, I'm not the writer or director of this film and unfortunately, the studio maybe decided how the movie would end, which made the film feel unfinished and made the movie seem like something we've seen a million times before. Why is Laura so quick to believe there's nothing going on with her husband and another woman? Why does Laura and Dean have to be such boring characters in the movie? They aren't interesting at all. Rashida and Marlon don't have a lot of chemistry and I wish Rashida was put with an actor she had more chemistry with. I wish there was a lot more drama and excitement in this film. I live Sofia's films and I love Bill Murray in anything, so of course I had to watch this film, but this film just wasn't very good. I have seen worse, though.

I would have rated it higher had the female lead been written to be less obnoxiously spoiled. Laura, played by the consistently milquetoast Rashida Jones, is the daughter of a ridiculously wealthy art dealer (Bill Murray) who is deeply devoted to her and her children, although, like all parents, he has his flaws (he submits to the biological psychology theory-there it is, moving on.) Rashida's handsome and kind husband starts traveling more for work as his business grows which is good news because she's a writer with writing block who states she cannot write in the day but we never see her attempt to write at night either. Laura cares for their two adorable, perfect children who go to bed the first time they are told to do so. Despite Laura having meals in lavish New York City settings with her mother and siblings and later her father, she refuses to smile, sit up straight, wear anything that appears clean, say anything nice such as ""thank you"". She is utterly consumed with the concern that her husband might be cheating on her with a much more vibrant, outgoing colleague, and I mean, Laura has a point considering she is terribly boring, self-pitying and for some reason refuses to talk to her husband about her fears. She does not smile when her father (Bill Murray) drives through New York City in a vintage convertible with champagne and caviar to snack on. She did not smile when he shows up and takes her out for her birthday so she wouldn't spend it alone (she doesn't have friends-the one female that talks to her bore her terribly but she cannot be bothered to verbalize this or take control of the conversation). She does not smile when he flies her to Mexico. It is never explained why she 1. dresses like a dumpster diver 2. doesn't open up to her husband about her concerns 3. why she blames her previously-philandering father for her suspicions thinking despite the father reflecting upon how his cheating was ""heartbreaking"" as it tore his family apart 4. why learning to whistle is important. Only when Laura is given a superb and expensive gift, does she smile. I give their marriage about two more years and I give this movie six stars.

(please be gentle...)Time has not slowed down the legendary Bill Murray, who in my mind is easily the most interesting part of the movie. Don't get me wrong,
Jones' and Wayans' performance are convincing and believable but let's be honest, the ever-suave and charming Mr. Murray is the reason you'd wanna watch this movie. He definitely steals the limelight in every scene he's in (and that's a good thing).
I also think this is Sofia Coppolas attempt to make the movie do better and distract the viewer from the fact that the storytelling isn't necessarily the greatest.
The way On the Rocks is filmed (especially the city parts) is many ways similar to Lost in Translation (one of my all-time favorites), another Coppola-Murray movie from nearly 20 years ago.
Although OtR doesn't convey the same strong feelings LiT did to me, in a way I still consider this a spiritual successor to it.The plot is your average struggles-with-the-family-and-relationships story which is just what it should be about. No unnecessary fuzz, just simple and straight-forward (also predictable) narrative.
Or so I thought...
The last 1/3 of the movie starts to shift from what I considered a decent and enjoyable film that had much positive resemblance to Lost in Translation, to a what feels like a detached and uncharacteristic part. And I'm glad that it did.
It actually manages to surprise the viewer completely (in a pleasant manner of course!). As I mentioned before, most of the film you think you'll know how things are going to turn out and with those expectations the movie might feel somewhat
dull. Luckily the plot twist towards the end manages to save some of the decreasing interest towards the story.Overall On the Rocks is a great movie with some familiar, chill vibes. It doesn't quite manage to be on a par with LiT, but still doesn't fall too far behind.These were some thoughts I had while watching On the Rocks. So if you're a fan of Murray and/or drama movies in general, give this one a chance.",On the Rocks

303,atheyjennings-30678,What's the point?,1,3 December 2020,The script makes no sense. The background music is annoying. Even Bill Murray cant charm his way out of this one!,On the Rocks
