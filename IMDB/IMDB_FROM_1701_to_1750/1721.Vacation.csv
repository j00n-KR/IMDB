0,SnoopyStyle,poops on the original,3,11 May 2016,"Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) has taken his family to the same cabin in Cheboygan, Michigan for the last 10 years. He overhears his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) complaining about it. He decides to relive his childhood vacation to Walley World. The older son James gets bullied by younger son Kevin. The family gets hounded by a trucker. They visit Rusty's sister Audrey (Leslie Mann) and her well-hung right-wing weatherman husband Stone Crandall (Chris Hemsworth). James falls for beautiful fellow vacationer Adena. They get to the grandparents Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) and Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) in San Francisco.This sequel takes a giant dump on the original and it's happy to do it. It's not what I'm looking for and it's not funny. It's trying so hard. It starts with the opening picture montage. It's not funny to me especially since some of them look photoshoped. It's too big and obvious. As for the new family, Helms and Applegate have their moments. The foul-mouthed little one is annoying. At least, the older one has a love interest but it could have done better. Mann and Hemsworth are a disappointment. It is great to have Chevy again. It's too bad that this decides to take the poop road from start to finish.",Vacation
1,Prismark10,Another vacation,3,16 August 2017,"The original National Lampoon's Vacation from 1983 had Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) having a shambolic journey to Wally World. It was a madcap and funny film.This modern re-boot sees Clark's now grown up son Rusty (Ed Helms) a pilot with a budget airline recreating the same journey with his family as he did when he was a kid.Along the way the family has mishaps, being chased across the country by a demented trucker, swimming in a hot spring which is full of raw sewage, going white water rafting with a suicidal guy, having their car ransacked.The humour is more course, cruder and infantile than the original film. Helms might look goofy but he does not have the comedic skills of Chevy Chase and even his screen wife Christina Applegate out acts him here. Worse still were Rusty's kids who were weird and just off putting.Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo make cameo appearances as Rusty's parents but this film is only mildly amusing and a disappointment.",Vacation
2,mark.waltz,Evidence that the wrong people travel.,7,31 December 2020,"Rusty certainly is Clark's son, going from Anthony Michael Hall in the first film to Ed Helms here, a pilot for a third rate airline, now married to the outwardly motherly Christina Applegate whose secretly still a party girl inside. They have two sons ( Skyler Gisondo, Steele Stebbins) who obviously despise each other (the YOUNGER brother is the bully in the most hysterically funny offensive way), and it's not just Helm who embarrasses the kids, Applegate does too. This is especially obvious when they stop by her alma mater where she tries to prove she's one of the cool kids after she learns that her reputation had lived on.Helm decides to liven things up by repeating his childhood vacation to none other than Wally World and there are several repeat situations done with a more modern perspective. One thing where it is certainly not modern is in its comic style which is closer to ""Family Guy"" with its no stone unturned in delicious gross out gags that had me yowling in delight and going ""eew!"" over and over as I howled.
This is one of those comedies where the gags need to be discovered fresh with no spoilers as they are beyond description.Rusty's sister Audrey (played by Leslie Mann) also appears, brought up obviously liberal but married to the very Republican Chris Hemsworth, a good ole' boy who finds pleasure by feeding his prize steer beef ribs. Hemsworth leaves nothing to the imagination, proving that lots of things in Texas are big...well maybe not some brains. Older brother Gisindo keeps on encountering a nice girl also traveling that younger brother Stebbins keeps harassing every chance he gets.This was a perfect way to end 2020, so hysterically funny that I couldn't even pick out one scene as my favorite. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo appear in cameos as their characters from the four other movies, and it reminded me of how much I've missed the still sultry D'Angelo. If you ever need a break from the real world or the opportunity to laugh at it all in good fun, then take a trip to the updated version of the next Griswold generation. It's a trip that goes in the hall of shame along with those delicious photos in the opening with that terrifically now nostalgic vacation theme song.",Vacation
3,nogodnomasters,It's not the destination. It's the journey.,7,19 March 2018,"Rusty (Ed Helms) is grown and an airline pilot for a small airway. When the neighbors are over for dinner, he sees an enormous amount of father-son bonding, that he become envious and realizes his family is in a rut. He decides a vacation to Wally World (and not Paris) is what the family needs and announces to the audience ""The new vacation will stand on its own.""His family is a bit dysfunctional. We discover his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) was known as ""Debbie do anything"" in college. As a side note, I don't believe there is a Memphis State University, but the University of Memphis is a dry campus. Kevin (Steele Stebbins) the younger son swears excessively, wrestles, and likes to bully his older brother James. James (Skyler Gisondo) who ""doesn't have a vag.., but it would be okay if he did"", keeps a wish diary.The film was funny. The humor was cruder, more sexual, and there was a lot of F-bombs, 58 to be exact. The film also allowed itself to draw some similarities to the original vacation, such as the girl in the car, but didn't over do it. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo appeared near the end which was a bit anti-climatic. The best humor came when they did a misdirection from the formula. Perhaps the biggest laugh was provided by the family car.Guide: Plenty of swearing, sex talk, brief nudity.",Vacation
4,kosmasp,Take a break,8,19 October 2015,"Most importantly: relax. Take it easy (as the song goes). But do not watch this, if you are easily offended. It really goes out there and language wise, it does not only cross the line, it catapults over it, with a vicious grin on its face. If you know you can't handle that, better save your money and time.For those familiar with the original (it's been too long since I last saw it), there are a few throwbacks, most of which surely can be read here. They are nice and as ""tasteful"" as they can be expected to be in a movie, that really takes no prisoners. And I only watched the version that was shown in cinemas. I can only imagine where they probably will go in an extended version (that's surely happening, right? If not at least many deleted scenes and outtakes, with more ""fun"" - for those who liked it). Also many jokes throughout the credits, that will either delight you or annoy you more - depending on how you liked the movie",Vacation
5,Sleepin_Dragon,Fairly into the spirit of its predecessors.,6,16 October 2015,"Rusty Griswold now has his own family, beautiful wife Debbie, and two sons James and Kevin. Rusty plans to take his family to Wally World, the same holiday his parents took him and his sister Audrey on back in 1983. A huge car journey awaits them from Chicago to Walley World. As happened last time the journey is full of disasters, but they persevere and eventually get there.The car, they got every possible gag out of that Albanian car that they could, talk about milking it.Some funny bits, I did laugh at some of the car scenes, the visit to Audrey and Stone's ranch. Some of the funniest lines came from young Kevin (Steele Stebbins) he was very funny. Some bits were a bit on the wrong side, the truck driver was a little in bad taste.Ed Helms joins the list of actor's that have played Rusty, I like him as a funny man, he did a good job, Christina Applegage was fun too, very raunchy. The kids were very funny too. It was great to have Beverly D'Angelo and Chevy Chase there too, wouldn't have bad not having those two make an appearance.It wasn't a film I was massively fussed on seeing, Hotel Hell Vacation I didn't enjoy that much, it felt like they'd put more effort into this one, the music helped, it was a mix of fun and nostalgia, immediately after seeing this I wanted to watch the National Lampoon's European Vacation. The photos were a nice touch too.The Griswold's were a big deal when I was growing up, this film won't have the same impact on today's youngsters.Don't tear your hair out in anguish to see it, but watch it if you get the chance. 6/10",Vacation
6,jboothmillard,Vacation,4,9 July 2021,"The original Vacation and Christmas Vacation are the ones that stand out from the popular National Lampoon series, while European Vacation and Vegas Vacation are less memorable, and this recent movie served as a reboot. Basically, Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) is now an adult working as a pilot for a low budget regional airline called Econo-Air, living in Suburban Chicago. He shares a stale relationship with his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) and their two sons, shy and awkward 14-year-old James (Skyler Gisondo), and sadistic 12-year-old Kevin (Steele Stebbins). After gloating from friends Jack (Keegan-Michael Key) and Nancy Peterson (Regina Hall) about a family trip to Paris, Rusty desires to relive the fun of family vacations and holiday gatherings from his childhood. These memories prompt him to abandon his family's annual trip to their cabin in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. After seeing that a new rollercoaster, the Velociraptor, has been built at Walley World, Rusty surprises the family with news that they will drive cross country from Chicago to the theme park, just like he did with his parents and sister. For the trip, Rusty rents a Tartan Prancer, an ugly, over-complicated Albanian SUV. Along the way, the Griswolds take many detours. Rusty stops in Memphis, Tennessee to show the kids where their mother went to college, but mild-mannered Debbie is revealed to have been an extremely promiscuous Tri Pi sorority sister in college nicknamed 'Debbie Do Anything'. After being teased by the new generation of students, Debbie wants to prove herself as the formerly rebellious student and attempts to run an obstacle course while drunk but fails miserably. While staying at a motel, James meets fellow teenager Adena (Catherine Missal), a girl that he saw while driving on the highway, but she is scared away by Rusty's failed attempts to be a ""wingman"". The family next stop in Arkansas, where Rusty hopes to take them to a hot spring. With the line of cars too long, he asks a ""helpful"" local for a shortcut and head up a dirt road. They find what they think is the hot spring and at first it is great, but finding faeces, a syringe, and a severed ear, they realise it is a raw sewage dump. They return to their SUV, only to find it has been broken into, sprayed with graffiti, and their luggage and cash has been stolen. They head to Plano, Texas where Rusty's sister Audrey (Leslie Mann) and her husband Stone Crandall (Chris Hemsworth) live, hoping they can help. Rusty suspects he and Debbie have problems in their relationship, as she is seemingly accepting of Stone's obvious and outward sexual advances towards her, but she rebuffs his suspicions. During the night, Stone walks in on the couple and makes a show of his attractive muscly body and oversized genitals through his underwear. The next morning, the family move on to a campsite in Arizona. Rusty and Debbie sneak away and attempt to have sex at the Four Corners Monument, but many other couples have turned up to do the same. Soon, police officers from all four states arrive, but they argue about who gets to make the arrest, allowing Rusty and Debbie to escape. James encounters Adena again, and, thanks to her encouragement, finally stands up for himself against Kevin, who has bullied him most of his life. The next morning, the family go rafting at the Grand Canyon, but are almost killed by their guide Chad (Charlie Day) who had just been dumped by his fiancé. Returning to the SUV, it runs out of gas in the middle of the desert. Rusty's misunderstanding of the key fob causes the SUV to explode, leading Rusty to walk off dispirited and alone, thinking about the disastrous trip. The family have been stalked since the beginning of the trip by truck with a teddy bear mounted to the grill, after Rusty communicated to the driver on the SUV's CB radio and possibly offended him. The driver (Norman Reedus) catches up to them and looks threatening, but instead he gives them Debbie's missing wedding ring, which he found when it was left behind in the diner in Missouri. The driver gives them a lift to San Francisco, where they spend the night at a bed and breakfast run by Rusty's parents Clark (Chevy Chase) and Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo). They intend to fly home the next day, but Rusty and Debbie talk about their marriage problems and decide to start over again. With some encouragement from Clark the next morning, Rusty borrows his father's Wagon Queen Family Truckster and drives Debbie and the boys to Walley World to ride the new roller coaster. After spending the entire day waiting in line to ride the Velociraptor, they are cut off by Ethan (Ron Livingston), a rival from Rusty's job, and his family before the announcement that the park is closing. A fight breaks out, which the Griswolds win, forcing the other family to flee. The Griswolds finally board and enjoy the ride, but it stalls halfway through, on the butterfly inversion, and they are rescued after several hours. Rusty uses his airline connections to book a vacation in Paris alone with Debbie, while sending the boys home to be looked after by the neighbours. On the plane to Paris, they are seated in jump seats next to a lavatory, and Debbie and Rusty are exasperated that the flight will be twelve hours. Also starring Nick Kroll as Colorado Cop, Tim Heidecker as Utah Cop, Kaitlin Olson as Arizona Cop, Michael Peña as New Mexico Cop, Hannah Jeter as Ferrari Girl, Elizabeth Gillies as Heather, David Clennon as Co-Pilot Harry, Colin Hanks as Jake, director John Francis Daley as Ride Operator, and director Jonathan Goldstein as Hot Tub Guy. Helms is likeable, Applegate gets her moments, and it's good to see Hemsworth make you laugh, it is predictable most of the time, but I could not help laughing hard at the hot spring scene, the road trip element is entertaining, especially as you're waiting to see the next disaster that occurs, so you will have some fun, an amusing enough comedy. Okay!",Vacation
7,paul_haakonsen,A hilarious continuation of the franchise...,6,28 April 2017,"Initially I had some reservations about sitting down to watch this 2015 ""Vacation"" movie, especially since directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein had some pretty big shoes to fill out in terms of the older classic ""Vacation"" movies with Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo.But it turned out that the 2015 ""Vacation"" actually turned out to be a well-worthy addition to the franchise, and it managed to stand out as being its own movie. I was worried about the fact that this was set around Rusty Griswold as the main character, now all grown up, but it actually worked out well enough.There is a lot of hilarious scenes throughout this movie, just as there was with the older movies. And the comedy in this movie was right on the head, keeping very much in the traditions of the older movies. And that was a great thing, because it kept a great continuity to the movie as it carried on the legacy.Ed Helms (playing Rusty Griswold) and Christina Applegate (playing Debbie Griswold) were actually carrying the movie quite well. And they had some good help from Skyler Gisondo (playing James Griswold) and Steele Stebbins (playing Kevin Griswold). Then there were some nice appearances by Chris Hemsworth (playing Stone Crandall) and Leslie Mann (playing Audrey Crandall; formerly Audrey Griswold). But most importantly, there could be no ""Vacation"" movie without Chevy Chase (playing Clark W. Griswold) and Beverly D'Angelo (playing Ellen Griswold). Oh, and I almost forgot to mention a hilarious appearance by none other than Norman Reedus (playing the trucker).I was laughing a lot throughout the course of this movie, and the comedy was great and right up my alley. So this turned out to be a very nice movie indeed. And my initial fears of a failure to carry on the torch were put to shame.If you enjoyed the classic ""Vacation"" movies, then you should definitely also take the time to watch the 2015 ""Vacation"".",Vacation
8,utgard14,Better than I expected it to be,6,11 October 2015,"Reboot to the National Lampoon's Vacation series that's also a sequel of sorts. Rusty Griswold is all grown up with kids of his own and decides to take them to Walley World like his dad did with their family all those years ago. The results are just as chaotic, if never quite as funny. Remakes, reboots, etc. are always tough to make work (as they should be) but this one does surprisingly OK. It's not a patch on the first few Vacation films with Chevy Chase (who has an unfunny appearance late in this movie) but it is good in its own way. Ed Helms and Christina Applegate provide few of the laughs, which hurts more than anything since they are the leads. Most of the successful humor comes from the guest stars like Chris Hemsworth and the two kids playing the sons, Steele Stebbins and Skyler Gisondo. Stebbins is especially funny and easily the best part of the movie. To the movie's credit, it doesn't simply do a scene-for-scene remake and tries to make its own mark. But years of road trip comedies, many of which were inspired by the original Vacation, makes this feel more than a little familiar. Still, it's watchable and provides some laughs if you're in the right mood.",Vacation
9,zardoz-13,Hilarious Hokum!!!,9,3 August 2015,"If you enjoyed the audacious ""Hangover"" movie trilogy and the two impudent ""Horrible Bosses"" epics, then you will probably hoot at the reboot of the vintage Chevy Chase comedy ""National Lampoon's Vacation."" Not only does the new ""Vacation"" qualify as a remake, but it also serves as a sequel to the four film ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" franchise. Ed Helms stars as Clark W. Griswold's grown-up son Russell 'Rusty' Griswold. For the record, Anthony Michael Hall played Rusty in ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" (1983) while different actors have slipped into and out of the same role in the various other ""Vacation"" inspired sequels. Anyway, Helms plays Rusty as a married man, with a wife, Debbie (sexy Christina Applegate), and two sons, James (Skyler Gisondo) and Kevin Griswold (Steele Stebbins). Comparatively, Clark raised a son and a daughter. The basic premise remains similar despite the 32 year gap between the movies. Oblivious Russell cherishes fond memories of the catastrophic cross-country road-trip that his quixotic father charted for the family and its farcical finale at Walley World. Indeed, much of the same thing occurs again. Co-directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein, who wrote both ""Horrible Bosses"" comedies, have ratcheted up the raunch content considerably for bigger, more brazen laughs that may either alienate or engross audiences depending on individual prudery. Incongruity is the cornerstone of great comedy, and ""Vacation"" delivers laughs and gags galore that more often than not ridicule the characters with whom we are supposed to identify. Actually, Ed Helms, who endured no end of ignominy in the depraved ""Hangover"" movies, emerges from ""Vacation"" looking reasonably respectable. ""Thor's"" Chris Hemsworth has a field day poking fun at his masculinity. Happily, as if to bestow their seal of approval on this side-splitting sequel, Chevy Chase appears in a cameo as a bed and breakfast owner with Beverly D'Angelo reprising her role as his wife Ellen.As the action unfolds, Rusty flies passenger jets for a regional airline, Econo-Air, and the plane that he is flying nearly crashes because his elderly co-pilot Harry (David Clennon) has no business in the cockpit. Ironically, Rusty recommended Harry for the position, so it's Rusty's inadvertent fault that Harry is flying. Meantime, Rusty overhears a little boy who aspires to be an aviator. Naturally, Rusty strolls over to speak to the child. No sooner has Rusty started chatting with the family than Harry ascends the jet to a higher altitude. The turbulence that the plane encounters is violent enough to send Rusty sprawling involuntarily toward the mother. Rusty winds up groping the wife's breasts to keep from landing in her lap. An uneasy silence ensues before another bout of turbulence propels him face down onto the little boy while his thumb plunges into the father's mouth. No matter what Rusty does, well-intentioned or otherwise, his actions hasten the worst possible results. For example, like Clark, who got stuck in the original ""Vacation"" with the metallic pea-green ""Wagon Queen Family Truckster,"" Rusty rents a hideous, baby-blue mini-cruiser christened the ""Tartan Prancer."" According to Rusty, this vehicle is the ""Honda of Albania."" Idiotically enough, this outlandish car features four exterior mirrors; the outside rear view mirrors block the front mirrors. During the excursion, Russell discovers a swivel seat control at the worst moment. Later, the vehicle's on-board navigation system scares them when the voice howls directions in native Japanese. Again, like his impractical father Clark, Rusty wants to do more than just motor across America. He wants his family to experience the scenic beauties along the way. They stop at a crowded, Hot Springs National Park, and an unsavory yokel suggests they take advantage of a less traveled road to a private hot springs. Little do our gullible heroes know this local is setting them up for mischief. Moreover, the gorgeous looking hot springs that the Griswolds splash into turns out to be a raw sewage pit. Murphy's Law governs everything that Griswolds set out to achieve. Nevertheless, each of these encounters is hopelessly hilarious, although you'd hate to find yourself in similar circumstances. A Grand Canyon water-rafting guide (Charlie Day) gets a phone call from his fiancée who decides to dump him. After the Griswolds set out on the river, their suicidal guide alters course for rougher waters that terminate in a waterfall. At another juncture in their journey, Rusty lets Debbie visit her Memphis, Tennessee, college alma mater where he discovers she slept with 30 or more guys before they got married. Of course, anybody who saw the original ""Vacation"" should remember Christie Brinkley's cinematic debut as a blond in a red convertible Ferrari. Writer/directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein dream up a different spin involving this character.Sure, ""Vacation"" is both infantile and scatological, but the fearless cast maintains straight faces throughout the hokum no matter how grotesque things get. All too often in lesser comedies, the cast behaves as if they are in on the jokes. Admirably, neither Ed Helms nor Christine Applegate lets on that either know how hopelessly nonsensical their exploits are. Applegate smears feces onto her face and remarks how abominable it smells until she realizes her folly. Furthermore, our heroes cruise for miles without realizing that pranksters have defaced one side of their Prancer with a humongous phallic symbol. When Rusty and Debbie realize that they have a pornographic image on their car, they spit on their hands and struggle futilely to remove it with vigorous scrubbing motions, groaning emphatically with their exertions. No, you shouldn't take their children to see ""Vacation,"" but the Chevy Chase original had some objectionable scenes that weren't fit for young eyes and delicate minds to witness, too. Clearly, freshman directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein have designed their updated adaptation of ""Vacation"" at audiences that love to laugh out loud and keep on laughing out loud at blatantly vulgar antics that leave little to the imagination. If you like to laugh hard and often, see ""Vacation.""",Vacation
10,oscaralbert,Perhaps no Summer of '15 flick embodies more American Values . . .,7,3 August 2015,". . . than does VACATION. If you had some foreign friends dropping by on their first visit to the U.S., you couldn't go wrong in taking them to see VACATION. This film is chock full of vital survival tips (for instance, most long-haul truckers are serial pedophiles) and timely travel advice (such as the fact that Arkansas is our wittiest state, if you substitute and ""sh"" for the ""w""). From Sex Education (a father explaining ""rim jobs"" to his son) to Agribusiness (cattle are cannibals), VACATION will help U.S. newcomers to separate the rocks from the tumbleweeds. Whenever VACATION gets a whimsical opportunity to improve upon the American Dream--whether by planting a nonexistent towering waterfall inside our Grand Canyon or by plopping down an imaginary theme park next to the Santa Monica Pier--it does so. Since ""bathroom humor"" is widely considered to be the epitome of American wit, VACATION inserts some of it at least every two minutes. And for its climax in the ""Velociraptor Ride"" line, VACATION depicts the American Golden Rule: If someone else owns what you really want, just beat the living Heck out of them, and steal it!",Vacation
11,neil-476,"Ruder than expected, but funny",7,28 August 2015,"Rusty Griswold takes his wife and two bickering sons on a road trip to visit Wally World. Things do not go smoothly.This US comedy is full of crude, infantile humour and bad language. It is also pretty funny.It gets off to a good start with Lindsey Buckingham's Holiday Road theme conjuring up memories of the Griswold family's first vacation movie 30 years ago (with a wonderfully funny montage of holiday photos) before going down a similar, but updated, cross-country road trip. Ed Helms as adult Rusty has the same well-intentioned but foredoomed to failure air about him as Chevy Chase did as dad Clark, and the trip itself is loaded up with things which could only ever go wrong, most of which are very funny (and, unfortunately, most of which are heavily spoilered in the trailer). This update, though, is considerably cruder than its predecessor.It was good to see Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo reprising Clark and Ellen. I was less enamoured of the two sons, although there is some wonderfully cringe-inducing humour involving older son James trying to get to know fellow traveller Adena with the ""assistance"" of his father (which pays off in a single line later in the film). Chris Hemsworth is pretty funny, too, in a sequence which underuses the dynamic between him and Rusty's wife Debbie (Christina Applegate, also very funny).If you saw the trailer, you have no excuses – you know what you're in for.",Vacation
12,anaconda-40658,A New Vacation.,7,19 August 2015,"Vacation (2015): Dir: Jonathan Goldstein, John Francis Daley / Cast: Ed Helms, Christina Applegate, Skyler Gisondo, Steele Stebbins, Chris Hemsworth: While most reboots are just horrible remakes under a different name, the latest in the Vacation franchise actually works because it goes to a new generation. It stars Ed Helms as Rusty Griswold, the son of the couple played by Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo in the previous four films. He desires to take his family to Wally World after reflecting on the adventures of the original film. While the premise is a rehash, structure features many hilarious and sometimes crude moments as their vacation hits one disaster after another. The climax lacks the payoff and feels like a scene was cut when they finally arrive in Wally World. Helms is well cast as Rusty who falls victim to one mishap after another until his rental car is blown up by nothing more than a button on the remote control. Christina Applegate plays Rusty's wife Debbie whose first mistake is appearing at her former sorority house where she ends up in a drunken obstacle course. Skyler Gisondo plays their oldest son who desires to be a musician but he is constantly bullied by his younger brother, played by Steele Stebbins. There are numerous cameo appearances including Chase and D'Angelo as Clark and Ellen Griswold who apparently operate a bed and breakfast now. Chris Hemsworth steals scenes as Rusty's sister's husband who herds cattle and struts his manhood in front of Debbie. While this is hardly the best in the franchise it is still a vacation worth taking well into a new generation. Score: 7 / 10",Vacation
13,FlashCallahan,I need a holiday after seeing this rubbish....,3,27 September 2015,"Remembering fond, childhood memories of his trip to Walley World, Rusty Griswold surprises his wife and two sons with a cross-country trip to America's favourite fictional fun park. Following in his father's footsteps, Rusty and the gang pack up the car and hit the road for some much-needed family bonding. Soon, the promise of fun turns into one misadventure after another for the next generation of Griswolds and anyone who encounters them........Just like most films released today, if you've seen the trailer, you've seen all,the jokes that are in the film, just a lost shorter, and not dragged out within an inch of its life like in this maundering comedy.I don't know whether in the past couple of years I lost my sense of humour somewhere, but I haven't seen a comedy that's made me chuckle since The World's End, and that's been a while.It seems that with comedies now, the makers don't want to be clever, they don't want to try something that could make jokes go over a few heads, instead, they go for the perfunctory body part gags, gross out moments, and scenes that are supposed to invoke guilty titters, but instead, proceed to make your frown lines just that little more predominant.Helms once again proves that he's one of the most annoying people in Hollywood, and when the star of the film has a face you just want to slap, the film is in trouble. I was hoping for some sort of Chevy Chase type role, oblivious to his poor decisions and his family just putting up with it and shrugging their shoulders as if to say 'classic Clarke', but no, he's just a whinging little man who let's everyone walk over him.The rest of the family more than make up for Rusty's shortcomings, Applegate is easily the best thing in the film, and the chemistry between the brothers is pretty realistic.And that's the only positive thing I can find to say about the film. Hemsworth pops up for a few minutes in nothing more than a degrading role for him, Chase looks bored out of his mind, and really uncomfortable, and it all ends up with a slow motion punch up with Ron Livingstone.The original was a lot funnier, thanks to Chase and the wonderful way the nuclear family is depicted, sticking together through thick and thin. Here, it separates us from the family and goes straight for the poo gags.Poorer than Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin Eddies Island Adventure.",Vacation
14,phd_travel,Some very funny parts,8,11 August 2015,"This movie is new generation of the beloved Vacation movies. Of course a 2015 comedy has to be cruder. It's funny more often than not. The Grand Canyon rafting scene is really laugh out loud.Rusty is now a regional airline pilot. Ed Helms is competent if a bit old. Christina Applegate plays his wife. She is as always very likable and carries off the less funny parts with enough charm to make them bearable. The kids are okay too with the bullying thing. Chris Hemsworth is quite funny and well cast as Rusty's brother in law they drop in to visit on the way to Wally World. Ron Livingston is well cast as an obnoxious pilot. Beverly d'Angelo and a much heavier Chevy Chase make an appearance.Overall liked the updating, it has enough homage to the older movies and shows the formula still works.",Vacation
15,Wuchakk,The Griswold son takes HIS family to Walley World,6,27 November 2017,"RELEASED IN 2015 and written/directed by John Francis Daley & Jonathan Goldstein, ""Vacation"" details the misadventures of Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) & his family when he decides to take 'em on a car trip from the Chicago area to Walley World in California. Christina Applegate plays the mother while Skyler Gisondo & Steele Stebbins play the sons. Leslie Mann appears as Ed's sister and Chris Hemsworth her hunky hubby, whom the Griswolds visit in Texas.The plot is great for a sequel to the classic 1983 film with Chevy Chase & Beverly D'Angelo, who appear here in the last act. Unfortunately, I was turned off right out of the gate by the younger Griswold's crude verbiage and non-jokes, which seemed more fitting for a nasty sitcom like ""Two Broke Girls."" Thankfully, the punk has a story arc where he eats some humble pie later.Despite that negative, there are about four laugh-out-loud sequences: The sorority episode, parts of the Crandall segment (which feature Mann & Hemsworth), the howling hilarious raft sequence and the closing Walley World brouhaha & roller coaster fiasco. Have you ever waited 2-3 hours for a freakin' roller coaster ride? It's ridiculous. In addition, the flick scores pretty well on the female front, particularly (to be expected) during the sorority segment.While I could do without the tasteless non-humor and profanity (mostly from the little punk), I found this one far funnier than the original movie. Plus the way it supports family and marriage underneath the zany laughs is almost heartwarming. Too bad the creators felt they had to add so much foulness because (1.) it's not funny and (2.) it wasn't necessary. THE FILM RUNS 99 minutes and was shot in Chicago, Georgia (Atlanta, Covington & Six Flags in Austell), North Carolina (Charlotte), Utah (Kanab), Arizona (Marble Canyon) and California (San Francisco).GRADE: B- (6.5/10)",Vacation
16,mm-39,Vacation is in the originals shadow.,6,5 August 2015,"Vacation is in the originals shadow. There will always be a comparison to the classic. What worked: Strong acting and directing. There is some good comic scenes. The sort of remake is different enough story from the original. There is a social message about family, which completes the movie's story. Accepting family because all families are screwed up.All family members have character flaws. What did not work: Some of remakes comic scenes are to over the top ie the rented car. Compared to the original one will be disappointed. Well nothing special with the remake. Still funny. I give Vacation six stars out of ten. I do not believe there will be another film.",Vacation
17,deloudelouvain,As much fun as in the original Vacation movies,8,24 December 2015,"I'm always been a big fan of the Vacation movies. Stupid but great humor from the Griswold family. When I read there was going to be another one I was wondering if it would be as good as the old ones with Chevy Chase. And I have to admit that Ed Helms did a great job as the head of the family. I didn't miss Chevy Chase at all, even though he plays a small role at the end. My wife and I had good laughs during the whole movie and that's what it's all about when you watch a comedy. Certainly one of the better ones that I saw this year. Would I go on a vacation with the Griswolds? Probably not, because there are too much things going wrong. But I certainly would never go on a vacation with the haters of this movie because they have absolutely no sense of humor. Great movie if you like a bit of fun.",Vacation
18,namashi_1,Funny!,7,26 September 2015,"Loosely inspired by the original 1983 cult film by the same name, 'Vacation' is a genuinely funny film, that takes a classic franchise ahead, without embarrassing itself. Its high on laughs & goofy performances!'Vacation' Synopsis: Rusty Griswold takes his own family on a road trip to ""Walley World"" in order to spice things up with his wife and reconnect with his sons.The Chevy Chase Vacation movies have been my favorite, I just LOVED all of them. Luckily, 'Vacation' works well as a comedy & despite all the silliness around, I found myself laughing & enjoying almost throughout. This isn't a memorable film, but what it is, is pure time-pass entertainment! Jonathan Goldstein & John Francis Daley's Screenplay is all-out foul, as most of its jokes would appeal to adults only. The madness & the sequence of events that happen here with the crazy Griswold's, is thoroughly entertaining. Goldstein & Daley's Direction, on the other-hand, is well-done, too. Cinematography is picture-perfect. Editing is just right. Performance-Wise: Ed Helms is a nice match to Chase. Helms delivers a terrific comedic turn & contributes to all the comical bits from start to end. Christina Applegate is first-rate. Skyler Gisondo is perfectly awkward, while Steele Stebbins is completely hammy. Chris Hemsworth & Leslie Mann try hard to make you laugh. But its Chase himself along with fellow Vacation legend Beverly D'Angelo, who stand out in cameos. On the whole, 'Vacation' will make you laugh. Do watch.",Vacation
19,StevePulaski,An adult comedy that will only appeal to prepubescent teens,3,29 July 2015,"Just this week, I was reviewing Peter Bogdanovich's latest film ""She's Funny That Way"" and remarked how it was a rare adult comedy that would actually appeal to adults. Its manic sensibilities and frequently incorrigible characters didn't derail it from being a spirited film, but it did prevent it from being one that got caught up in such empty, dirty-minded antics that it forgot about the characters. Now here comes ""Vacation,"" another sequel (I guess) to the long-running ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" franchise, which started all the way back in 1983 with future installments coming in the form of more theatrical films, direct-to-DVD projects, and even an extended Super Bowl commercial a few years back. ""Vacation"" is a film that, paradoxically, bears a hard R-rating, despite the fact that most of the film's jokes will appeal to those who cannot get into the film at the local multiplex without a parent or adult guardian (both parties would be far more enriched seeing something, perhaps anything, else playing in the theaters at this time).""Vacation"" is the epitome of a lazy film, reminiscent of a sequel like ""The Hangover: Part II"" or even ""Meet the Fockers,"" where the plot is a tireless retread of jokes that worked in the first film because they were fresh, but seeing them now, they are overdone and underwritten. Now, however, the stakes are higher and raunchiness is injected into the film's premise. The original ""Vacation"" film, while carrying an R-rating, still basked in the light of relatively jolly, upbeat humor and was a quietly crass take on the conventional family road trip. This film is a soulless project, so predictable and worn that it'd be a more pleasant endeavor trying to start and drive the Griswold's Wagon Queen Family Truckster from the original film.We focus on Rusty (Ed Helms), the son of Clark and Ellen Griswold (Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo), who is now living with his loving wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) and their two sons, James (Skyler Gisondo) and Kevin (Steele Stebbins). Rusty, who works as a pilot for an economy airline, notices a disturbing disintegration of his family, with his wife tiring of their love-making and her hatred for their yearly vacation to Sheboygan and the constant bickering of his two boys. In a spur-of-the-moment decision, Rusty decides to take his family to the fabled Wally World, the theme park where his parents took him and his sister when they were young.The Griswold's hit the road and, to everyone's surprise, a number of crazy circumstances come their way. For starters, they get a 2015 Tartan Prancer, ""the Honda of Albania,"" so claims Rusty, with numerous buttons, two gas tanks, and an outlet to charge at any gas station. The comedic possibilities are already bubbling. Furthermore, the Griswold's decide to stop at a hot springs and take a roundabout way into the pool that results in them getting in a pool of raw sewage. This forces the gang to show up to Rusty's sister Audrey's (Leslie Mann) home, where she is married to a meathead (Chris Hemsworth) who loves to show off his six pack and his well-endowed package. Ho ho.The stench of desperation in the writing/directing team of John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein's comic possibilities makes ""Vacation"" seem a lot longer than it really is, almost like a real-life family vacation for the viewer. The situations almost always lead to the foreseeable outcome, the jokes rely heavily on vulgarities, making them witless and unconvincing, and the characters carry a blandness despite bearing the name that's synonymous with family road trips, even in the modern day.Some of the most fun material of the film stems from the constant bickering between James and Kevin, with Kevin, the younger brother, constantly harassing James, calling him out when he's trying to talk to a girl and even going as far as to try and have him black out by suffocating him with a plastic bag. This darkly funny absurdity livens up the predictability of the film, but not in a way that can save the sorely lacking chemistry in the film (especially after Kevin ups the courage to defend himself in the face of James, resulting in an entirely laughless and downright bizarre scene).""Vacation""'s problem is its level of vulgarity and its comic setups seem to be ostensibly crafted from what a prepubescent teenager finds funny. While we have sporadic humor from the two kids, and Ed Helms is probably the only person who can play Rusty Griswold with such incorruptible positivity in the face of catastrophe, this doesn't disguise what ""Vacation"" is at heart - a poor cash-in on a franchise that takes a raunchy direction in the most contrived and facile way imaginable.",Vacation
20,Hellmant,Definitely a lot better than 'VEGAS VACATION'!,8,5 August 2015,"'VACATION': Four Stars (Out of Five)A sequel/reboot to the classic 1983 comedy flick 'NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION'. It's the 7th film in the series (5th theatrical release) and tells the story of a grown-up Rusty Griswold, taking his family on a road trip vacation to Wally World; just like his father did, in the original film. The movie stars Ed Helms as Rusty and it costars Christina Applegate, Skyler Gisondo, Steele Stebbins, Leslie Mann and Chris Hemsworth. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo also reprise their roles from the other films; and the movie also features cameos by Ron Livingston, Charlie Day, Keegan-Michael Key, Norman Reedus and Regina Hall. It was written and directed by, first time feature film directors, Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley (the team that also co-wrote the 'HORRIBLE BOSSES' films). I found it to be a pretty funny, and well made, comedy flick.Rusty Griswold (Helms) is now working as an abused pilot, for Econo-Air. He feels like his wife, Debbie (Applegate), and two sons, James (Gisondo) and Kevin (Stebbins), are distancing themselves from him; and each other. So he decides to recreate his most crazy childhood memory, a road trip to Wally World with his family, in order to bring his new family closer together. Chaos ensues, just like in the original 'vacation'. The movie is definitely pretty funny; Goldstein and Daley are clever and witty writers, and I think they've now proved themselves to be equally talented directors as well. Helms is perfectly cast in the lead, and the rest of the cast is good too (especially Hemsworth). It, of course, does not come close to matching the original; but that shouldn't be expected of it. Just looking at it as another sequel, it's more than decent; it's definitely a lot better than 'VEGAS VACATION'.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/ItzCr1Etfyo",Vacation

23,Robert_duder,National Lampoon returns and probably shows its age,7,10 August 2015,"I am a big fan of the original Vacation films and 80's comedy in general. There was something fresh and unique about those comedies and how ""raunchy"" they were for the time. And I happen to think we saw some of the most brilliant comedians during that decade and whether you all agree or not, Chevy Chase was part of that. He has an indelible comedic timing and his doofus, klutzy, lovable Clark Griswold is a legend. So I was cautiously optimistic about a reboot of this franchise. The concept made sense and the cast sounded good for a new generation but I wondered what it would be like. Nowadays comedies go straight for the ridiculous toilet humour and they drive it down your throat. Body functions and sex jokes and nudity and drugs and complete stupidity. Technically Vacation has a lot of that. It is raunchy (though I've seen worse in the last few years) and a lot of the gags seem really stupid but when you look closely you'll see that I think the film makers were actually trying to capture the essence of the National Lampoon films and I think they almost pull it off. I saw so much of the original ideas and gags in this film but the biggest problem is that they feel a little stale now and it doesn't really fit into nowadays very well.Ed Helms plays Rusty Griswold, the patriarch of the family. The biggest issue with Helms' performance is that he tries too hard to be Chevy Chase. In some ways it works because he is supposed to be Chase's son but it feels too much like copying. Helms has good comic timing but he has to have someone else to play off of and no one feeds him right so he is awkward in the role. Still, I'm not sure anyone else could have done any better. Christina Applegate is Rusty's wife and she is very good in the role. She doesn't quite fit with Helms right but they have okay chemistry and this isn't her best comic role but she pulls it off decently. Both actors are trying to find their place in an average script. Skyler Gisondo and Steele Stebbins play their sons and as MANY reviewers have pointed out both boys are annoying. Stebbins go-to gag of being foul mouthed is just obnoxious and not funny at all and Gisondo's geek role is reminiscent of the far better played We're The Millers role of Kenny. Chris Hemsworth and Leslie Mann have small roles that are decent but nothing to write home about.The thing to remember with Vacation is I honestly think they tried very hard. I have to give them kudos because I don't think this was a cash grab, I really think they wanted to pay homage to the original series, reboot it for a new generation and make something memorable. I can see why some people (especially the younger generation) would not like this at all because it does have the same vibe of the original films and in fact has some gags that you simply wouldn't get without seeing the original. You have two guys who co-wrote the script and co-directed and neither one have virtually any experience directing. Jon Goldstein and John Daley try very hard but I don't think they have what it takes at this point to really make this stand out. The film feels too dry and stale and messy. It needs a lot of editing and a lot of experience for someone to fine tune this into what it should have been. I still enjoyed it for what it was and I was able to see the respect paid to the originals. I was most excited to see Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo in cameo roles and both were very small and Chase seemed completely out of place. So if you're a big fan of the National Lampoon's classic then you'll get something out of it, otherwise its mostly a miss. 7/10",Vacation
24,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Ignore the hate, it's hilarious",8,28 August 2015,"When John Hughes wrote Vacation (based on his own experiences as a child, as was Christmas Vacation) he created an iconic character in Clark Griswold and a signature role for Chevy Chase. Clark was the everyman middle-class father who just wants to have fun time with his family. His naïve optimism never wavered in the face of adversity. The series however did, after a strong first out things took a dip with the less-inspired European Vacation, then soared again with Christmas Vacation, then nose-dived with the diluted Vegas Vacation. The less said about Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure the better. Also, the ""National Lampoon"" branding is gone since the name is pretty much mud by this point.Now, 18 years after their last big screen outing, the Griswolds are back. Sort of. Rusty is all grown up with a family of his own. His bored wife and warring sons are sick of the same old family getaways so he plans to recreate his famous trip to Walleyworld. Sadly for Rusty, he has inherited the Griswold disaster gene. As a child he was the perfect foil for his dad, the straight-man, the REAL adult in the household, but now he is a walking calamity zone.Their pilgrimage to visit Marty Moose is a non-stop laugh riot. I was surprised at how savage the critics and audiences reacted to the new Vacation. I went in fully expecting to hate it to the core. But I've never laughed so hard at a movie in a long time. Chevy might be reduced to a bit-part but Ed Helms really does soar as Rusty and Christina Applegate is way funnier here than she was in those overrated Anchorman movies and Chris Hemsworth also proves he's apt at comedy as Audrey's overbearing husband. Many have criticized the low-brow humor and in a way they are correct as the clever darkness of Hughes/Ramis is missing, however the jokes as so numerous you'll still be grinning for ear-to-ear for the entire running time. It's one of those movies that will keep you laughing long afterwards. I have to admit that the marketing of this film was pretty pathetic though. What happened to the Boris Vallejo art of the original and the first sequel? Even Christmas Vacation has recognizable poster art (again copied by Vegas). The poster art for this movie is so generic and unimaginative. They really dropped the ball there and completely failed to separate the film from any other generic comedy in that regard.Give the movie a chance. In a summer featuring dismal failures like Fantastic Four and Pixels there's no real justifiable reason why Vacation is being rated so low. It's funny, it's a good time. I place it in the middle of the five films in the series, ranking it above Europe and Vegas, and it really does get the series back on course.",Vacation

Just when they think they can't go anymore the meet someone that convinces them to finish the journey. The first time I heard they were making another Vacation movie I was against the idea, then I saw the preview. I thought it could be really funny and sat down with higher expectations then I probably should have. The original was a classic and is still funny no matter how many times you watch it. This is....not that. While the movie did have some really funny parts and I did laugh quite a bit the movie had two fatal mistakes for a comedy. One was the movie tried way to hard to be shocking and it came off feeling forced and not funny. The other, and much worse offense was that it showed all the really funny scenes in the preview, which also gave away some of the gags. The ""Griswold Springs"" scene being the main thing. If you haven't seen the original this may be OK and you may like it more than I did. As for me, this wasn't close to as good. Overall, tried way to hard to be shocking and funny and that ruined it.

28,ironhorse_iv,"This Poor's man vacation was still pretty funny! Typical to every Griswold family trip, Hilarity Ensues. It's worth the trip!",6,3 September 2015,"Once again, the film follows the misadventures of the Griswold family, trying to reach their vacation destination. This time, it's Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms), all grown up and with a family of his own. Idealizing past events, Rusty hopes to reconnect with his wife, Debbie (Christina Applegate), and his two kids, James (Skyler Gisondo) and Kevin (Steele Stebbins), by planning a cross country trip to Wally World. On the way, there, the group encounters several missteps that can only bring their family, closer or farer apart. Can Rusty save his marriage and bond with his children or will the chaos of the trip, be, too much for them, to handle? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found this 2015 road trip comedy directed by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein was somewhat hilarious. Serving as both a reboot and a sequel to the National Lampoon's Vacation series, I like how the movie has direct recalls to the original four films; 1983's National Lampoon's Vacation, 1985's National Lampoon's European Vacation, 1989's National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, and last, 1997's Vegas Vacation. Not only that, it has references to the 2003's TV-movie spin off, Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure & 2010's short film, Hotel Hell Vacation. I love all the similar jokes or previous film character cameos. While the movie has all those callbacks, I like how the film was also giving its own vibe. Most of the film's set pieces and locations are different, from the original film, so they're plenty of new humor, coming out of it. Unlike the 1983 version, this Rusty-led version of Vacation has more toilet humor jokes that might be a little too gross for some viewers. For me, I found the overtly raunchy scatological humor, somewhat amusing. It really hit the funny bone. Vacation is also chock full of overtly raunchy crass humor, coarse comments, sexual references, and constant strong language. Still, there were some jokes that really did bug me. Most of them, came from Kevin character. He's supposed to be a little kid, but instead comes off as a complete unwatchable sociopath. The jokes about the truck driver wanting to rape children, the whole plastic bag gag and the mean-spirited jokes from him, are frequently crosses the line into Dude, Not Funny! Territory! His character really hurts the film. Other jokes that fell flat, was cause, by the film quickly abandoning subplots: such as Rusty's brother-in-law, TV anchorman Stone Crandall (Chris Hemsworth) being an extreme conservative. While, some of his jokes were left hanging. Chris Hemsworth still have a very amusing role. I just wish, they had more jokes for his wife, Aubrey (Leslie Mann). She seem underused in the film. Amid the crude/over-the-top content are some positive messages about steadfast marriages and the idea that vacations form lasting impressions on kids. The acting is pretty good. While, Ed Helms might not be playing the same persona of that of the previous Rustys, he honed this role. I like his in-over-his-head normal positive thinking, father know best attitude. He was very likable. He delivers some great, funny reactionary moments throughout the film. Christina Applegate is amazing in her role. I like how her character was able to play to play, into the laughs, as well. In fact, one of the film's funniest moments, was her chug-run sequence. The like of supporting characters played by Keegan-Michael Key, Charlie Day, Michael Pena, Norman Reedus and many others, make this movie, a lot funnier than it could had. As much as the critics, might think, the appearance of Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo toward the end, as lackluster. I have to disagree with them. It was nice to see the two, play their roles, once again. Pretty much all of these cameos are used well, offering a solid comedy beat. I also love that Lindsay Buckingham's 1983 hit single, ""Holiday Road"", the theme song to most of the Vacation series, is include with this film. Overall: While, the movie could quite capture the inspired lunacy of the original John Hughes-written/Harold Ramis-directed film. However, this remake did pretty well for itself. As long, as you don't take it, took serious. You might like it, too. It's time to take a Vacation, indeed!",Vacation
29,Reno-Rangan,When the family vacation turns into a nightmare!,7,14 November 2016,"Having not seen any previous films in this series, I had nothing to compare with it and to blame for. Though I have seen many similar films, but it was not as bad as they say. In this kind of theme, the basic storyline always remains same, the remaining parts like the characters, locations and the diversions in the story developments are the key. I think they did that decently, the two new directors who also penned the screenplay.Well, this is the story of the Griswold family of a couple and their two teen sons. After realising his family is spiritless with the normal life, the husband surprises his wife and the children to go a vacation. The trip is supposed to have fun, but they find hard to come along in a single mood as a family. Meanwhile, their journey begins to face many hurdles, though they are not giving up. So how memorable their adventure becomes is what unfolds in the remaining section.The cast was good. Both, Ed Helms and Chritina Applegate was impressive, though the film is not laudable. Not all the jokes, but some of them were really cool and most of them were adult stuffs. Yep, this is an R rating film, not a family film, despite the impression you get from its posters. So for the grown ups, this is not a bad film to give a try. I can't suggest or reject on the merit of its previous installments, because I've already given the reason. People like me can definitely have a good time with it.6.5/10",Vacation

Unfortunately there are tedious moments aplenty. The scene at the four corners for instance. Another disappointment was the material given to Chevy Chase being totally inadequate. The fight at Wally World was yet another misfire, with Ron Livingston mostly wasted.

31,Floated2,Forgettable and unfunny,2,16 June 2017,"Vacation is essentially an R rated less than family version of several Adam Sandler comedy films. Having been compared to 2013's surprise hit We're the Millers, Vacation is neither as good or funny as that film in roughly every area. Vacation was no hit but having a budget of $30 million and making a little over $100 million worldwide, it made some success. Though studios most likely looked at the success of We're the Millers and that film making over $269 million worldwide, Vacation is a disappointment and the studios must have expected more. It appeared obvious this film was headed for a sequel but having roughly weak numbers, it remains not to receive another sequel to this follow up.Vacation isn't funny and most of the gags come off across as desperate and cringe worthy. Having an R-rated, one can tell they used it to their advantage as there is an overload of cursing and sexual innuendos. R-rated comedies are great and work when the material is funny and the jokes hit, but in Vacation the jokes fall flat and they feel very forced. The plot of this film is relatively simple and basic, with typical ""disasters and problems"" occurring on the family's way to their journey of Walley World (a large familiar theme park). Overall, this film appears to be have forgotten as we hope directors and the studios have learned their proper dues when it comes to r-rated family comedies.",Vacation
32,leonblackwood,Surprisingly Funny! 6/10,6,11 January 2016,"Review: I, surprisingly, found this movie quite funny! Each family member brought something different to this amusing comedy and the jokes come thick and fast, right from the beginning to the end. Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) plays a pilot for a low budget airline and when he returns to his dysfunctional family, they have a meal with there close friends who gloat about there amazing holiday in Paris. Rusty hears his wife, Debbie (Christina Applegate), putting down there repetitive vacations at there cabin in Michigan, so he searches for the perfect place to go on vacation with his family. He finally decides to take them to Walley World in a hired family vehicle and they make many stops on the way to the resort. They first stop in Memphis, at Debbie old college, we're Rusty finds out that Debbie was an extremely promiscuous teenager. After that, they stay at a hotel, were there eldest, shy son, James (Skyler Gisondo) meets a young girl who they passed on the highway but his dad embarrasses him by asking him awkward questions in front of her. They then go to Arkansas, we're they are led to a supposedly hidden spring by a drifter but they soon find out that it's a sewage and when they return to there car, there luggage and cash has been stolen. With no clothes or money, they go to Rusty's sisters house in Texas but her boyfriend, Stone (Chris Hemsworth) has an outward sexual manner which makes him feel uncomfortable. The following night, they stay on a Arizona camp site, we're Rusty decides to try something new with Debbie, in a sexual way but they soon realise that they have an audience and the police stop there sexual encounter. James bumps into the girl that he met earlier and he tells her how he feels about her, with the help of his obnoxious younger brother Kevin. The next morning they nearly get killed by a rafting guide whilst rafting in the Grand Canyon and there rental car runs out of gas in the middle of the desert. After pressing all of the buttons on the remote control, the cars explodes, which leaves them stranded in the middle of nowhere. All the way through there trip, a truck driver has been following them and they expect the worse because Kevin called him a Paedophile over the CB but he hands over Debbie wedding ring, that she had left somewhere on there journey and he gives them a lift to San Francisco. They then spend the night with Rusty's parents, Clark (Chevy Chase) and Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo) with the intent on going home in the morning but Clark gives Rusty his old truckster, which was used in the earlier National Lampoon Vacation movies, and they make there way to Walley World again. After spending all day, waiting to get on the magnificent roller-coaster ride, Velociraptor, they are told that the park is going to close so Rusty fights his way onto the ride but it gets stuck halfway up a loop. It then takes several hours for the passengers to be rescued but the Griswolds grow closer after everything they have been through. Rusty then uses his airline connections to take his wife to Paris, without the kids, but they have to sit by a lavatory, during a 12 hour flight. There are a lot of funny moments throughout the film and the fact that it isn't predictable, made it a joy to watch. It is slapstick comedy with a far fetched concept but if you don't take it seriously, it really isn't that bad. The performances were believable and the various cameos were a great addition to the cast, so I'm not surprised that it made such a profit at the box office. Anyway, is definitely worth a watch if you want a chuckle! Enjoyable!Round-Up: Ed Helms, 41, has blown up since his role in the Hangover in 2009, with movies like Cedar Rapids, We're The Millers and Jeff, Who Lives At Home but he hasn't shown that he has more tools in the box. There isn't any talk about a sequel to this successful movie but he's due to star in a remake of the Naked Gun and a film called Bastards with Owen Wilson and J.K. Simmons. Anyway, this movie was directed and written by John Francis Daley, 30, who also played the ride operator. Jonathan M. Goldstein also wrote and directed this movie and he wrote Horrible Bosses I & II, the Incredible Burt Wonderstone and Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs 2. For there first major movie release, they did do a good job with this film and they got the most out of the actors. I just hope that they come out with a sequel before the characters become a distant memory.Budget: $31million Worldwide Gross: $105millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their adventure/comedies starring Ed Helms, Christina Applegate, Chris Hemsworth, Leslie Mann and Chevy Chase. 6/10",Vacation

Vacation does have many funny moments, some of them, I admit are really priceless, none more funny than the Hemsworth bedroom, intrusion scene, packing a lot of sausage. In between the funny bits though are dry patches, a few intentional bits, jokes, falling flat on their face. Helms as Rusty Griswald, decides to bring family closer together and revisit that unforgettable theme park, just like he did, many yesteryears ago with his klutz father Clark, who we meet near the end (a really beefed up Chevy Chase) Christina Applegate is really good as Rusty's wife, and like the first Vacation, there are moments that we familiarize with the first, and again, like the first, there are some cruelly funny bits here, notably the hot chick in sports car scene. We also have a vengeful trucker on the Griswald's tail. Hemsworth as Audrey's second half absolutely steals every moment he's on screen, we are rudely reminded of how good this actor is. At it's start, I kind of anticipated a much funnier movie, or may'be I hung my hopes too high. The killer roller coaster mishap, I unconsciously predicted, before the line wait out, I couldn't believe it happened. One thing that sucked in this pic, was the slow version of Holiday Road. We can only feel appreciative of the small time we share with Chase, where his part, hardly raises a laugh. I like some of the original touches, gags to the movie, like the beer chug run, and again, I really like what Applegate brought to her role. Still this Vacation, not a bad run, does suffer it's suffer it's faults, and needed to better applied.",Vacation
34,gwnightscream,Not That Bad!,5,16 January 2018,"Ed Helms, Christina Applegate, Chris Hemsworth and Leslie Mann star in this 2015 comedy sequel/reboot of the 1983 classic. This focuses on Rusty Griswold (Helms) who is now an adult with his own family. He decides to follow in his father's footsteps when he takes his wife, Debbie (Applegate) and their 2 sons on a cross-country drive to theme park, Wally World where mishaps and such occur. This isn't that bad, I guess they tried to do their own thing while still pay tribute to the original and Helms and Applegate are good in it. Mann (The Cable Guy) plays Rusty's sis, Audrey, Hemsworth (Thor) plays her husband, Stone and Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo also make brief appearances as Clark and Ellen. Give this a try at least once.",Vacation
35,subxerogravity,It's funnier than I expected.,6,1 August 2015,"You can't help to be skeptical when you hear they're going to remake something that worked so successfully the first time around, but then I herd that the movie was going to focus on Rusty Griswold, and his family making this as much a sequel or spin-off as it is a reboot. Rusty remembers the original Vacation to Wally World with such fondness that he takes his family on a road trip to the theme park as a way to spice up their annual vacation. the movie acts mostly as a series of sketches and gags paste together to make a movie, but each gag makes me giggle and in some cases I laughed out loud.Their decisions to make a rated R film helps a lot as well.Chris Hemsworth was great in the movie. The beautiful Aussie got to show he was more than a pretty face with muscles and did a little comedy that had me rolling on the floor.Me personally, the movie works better if I think of it as a Spin-off than a reboot. It's never going to live up to the original, but it's a fine sequel.",Vacation
36,jtindahouse,Haven't laughed this hard for a long time,9,31 December 2015,"The original 'Vacation' movie was a comedy classic which has the rare ability to remain funny in today's modern, evolved-humour world. The sequels not so much. The sequels lost that magical touch the original had, partly because they were often rated lower to cater to a more family-friendly audience and partly because they were often showing the actual holiday itself as opposed to the journey getting there. This remake/reboot/sequel, whatever you want to call it, finds that magic again for the first time since the original was released 32 years ago.I wasn't quite sure what to expect going in. The poorly made sequels to the original had left me with a bit of a sour taste in my mouth and I worried we could be in for more lame comedy gags that barely make you crack a smile. If I had known just how funny it was actually going to be I wouldn't have waited this long to see it.The first improvement I noticed were just how funny the children were as characters for once. They were responsible for a number of the heavy laughs throughout. When you only have four central characters in your story why waste any of them, right? Secondly Ed Helms and Christina Applegate really bought into the whole thing and actually had terrific comedic chemistry. Helms is always brilliant in whatever he's in. I genuinely believe the 'Hangover' series would not have been what it was had anyone else been cast in that role. A great choice to cast him in the lead role hereFinally the 'R' rating was the best thing that could ever have happened to this film. It let the children have hilarious dialogue throughout and left the audience never knowing just what was going to happen next. Nothing felt out of bounds. Hilarious scene after hilarious scene take place and best of all the movie has a heart at the centre of it all. There's a real story of saving a marriage going on here that is all too believable. Anyone saying anything negative about this film I can only imagine is simply angry that they dared to remake their beloved original. Ignore the haters, this is one of the best comedies released in a long time.",Vacation
37,DarkVulcan29,Destroys what was a comedy classic.,1,3 August 2015,"Remember the vacation movies starring Chevy Chase has Clark Griswald, a family man taken his family on vacation, and everything that could go wrong does. Films that where funny, except for Vegas Vacation which I didn't see. Now this was an attempt to revive the series in this sequel/remake.Ed Helms as Rusty Griswald, don't get me wrong he is funny, but nowhere near as Chevy Chase is. Christina Applegate as his wife is good has Helms wife, but the chemistry feels forced. The actors playing there kids are annoying, if you thought the two kids in Jurassic World where bad, these kids here put one up. Leslie Mann makes an appearance has Audrey, and it reminds me that i'm getting so bored with Leslie Mann these days. Chris Hemsworth is alright as Audrey's husband, seems to be having a fun time mocking his pretty boy looks. The problem for me is that the film spends more time being gross out, instead of just going for laughs.Half the time I wasn't laughing, I was wondering if I should walk out, or stay till the end. This film was missing the style of John Hughes writing, he knew how to write comedy. The only moments I thought where funnier when Chevy Chase appears as Clark Griswald, but other than that this movie is a waste of time, it tries to be a Hangover like film, the gross out gags worked in the first two hangover films cause they had timing to them, but here there is no timing to any of it, it lacks the heart and charm of the original vacation films.Wow I never thought I'd see something worse than Hot Tub Time Machine 2 and Hot Pursuit this year, but Vacation is it.Pixels is looking like a comedy classic compared to this.",Vacation
38,PWNYCNY,Extremely funny movie.,10,31 July 2015,"Here's a movie that casts aside even the pretense of sophistication in favor of bathroom humor. Bathroom humor abounds. Subtle nuances are set aside as the Griswolds, and their friends, wallow in the muck, and generate ongoing laughs. Rusty Griswold is a raunchier version of Clark. Rusty is more than just a doofus, he is the personification of stupidity itself. Rusty is arguably the most stupid movie character in recent movie history. He's up there with Stan Laurel. Lou Costello and Curly Howard. Everything about Rusty exudes a naivety that goes way beyond mere ignorance. He has a stupid streak that even his eight year son can't miss. Everyone knows that Rusty is stupid, everyone, of course, except Rusty. The other extremely amusing character is Rusty's oldest son, who is effeminate. The father-son relationship here is hilarious. Rusty is completely oblivious to his son's sexual identity issues, producing comic situations. It's not that Rusty is inherently mean, rather, he's just too dense to know any better. Remember: he's a Griswold.",Vacation
39,stevendbeard,Passing The Torch,6,29 July 2015,"I saw ""Vacation"", starring Ed Helms-The Hangover movies, Meet Dave; Christina Applegate-The Anchorman movies, Mars Attacks!; Skyler Gisondo-The Amazing Spider-Man movies, Four Christmases; Steele Stebbins-A Haunted House 2, Metered; Chris Hemsworth-The Thor & Avengers movies, A Perfect Getaway and Leslie Mann-The Other Woman, Drillbit Taylor.I guess you could call this a sequel to the 1983 Vacation movie. It is sort of like they are passing the torch for a new generation. Ed plays a grown up Rusty, the son of Chevy/Clarke Griswold and yes, Chevy & Beverly D'Angelo do make an appearance, although Randy Quaid/Cousin Eddie does not- I think he was in jail or something. Anyway, Ed plays a pilot for an economy airline company-their slogan is something like, We're working hard to regain your trust!-and he wants to reconnect with his family by changing up their normal boring vacation at their cabin in the woods and relive his unforgettable childhood trip to Wally World. Christina plays his wife, Skyler is his oldest son and Steele is his younger son. Skyler is nerdy and always being picked on by his younger brother, Steele. Steele also cusses a lot. Ed rents an Albanian hybrid car, which is hilarious because of the high tech gadgets and language barrier that come along with it. On their cross country road trip, they make lots of stops and nothing ever goes according to plan. One stop is at his sister Audrey's place. She is played by Leslie and Chris plays her husband. Chris is pretty funny here. I guess he enjoyed doing comedy for a change. There are several cameos scattered throughout the movie; I remember seeing Colin Hanks, Charlie Day, Norman Reedus, Keegan-Michael Key and Ron Livingston. Oh yeah, they did use the old familiar Lindsey Buckingham song, Holiday Road. It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",Vacation
40,GiraffeDoor,It's as good as it is original.,6,3 August 2019,"Forgettable and derivative piece of crude, disaster comedy that was goofy good fun for a bit.In it's defence, it has no delusion about what it is and plays it for gags.A little girl character was sorely missed though.",Vacation
41,davispittman,Pretty funny movie,7,23 December 2015,"OK first off I thought this movie was pretty funny and sort of entertaining. I loved the cast, I thought that Christina Applegate really was the best one in the whole movie, she really embodied her character and did well with the material. I also really love to Chris Hemsworth in this movie, I thought he was very amusing. He was also not so bad to look at I might add. The underwear scene with Chris Hemsworth was very funny, and I thought it was one of the best scenes in the whole movie. I also adored Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo and their cameo appearance towards the end. This movie did have some throwbacks to the original which were very appreciated. I personally loved the scene where Christina Applegate goes back to her old college sorority, that was funny. OK now for the downsides to this movie. One of my biggest complaints for vacation is Leslie Mann, I just did not enjoy her in this movie, I thought she seemed too idiotic and just unimportant. I like her in other movies, I just didn't like her here, and I thought that she just didn't give a strong performance. I also didn't really appreciate the whole scene where Rusty runs through a cow, I thought that was just a little too disgusting and I didn't care for it. I also was not a big fan of the older son in this movie, he got on my nerves and I just thought he was annoying. So overall, you have a pretty good film with some flaws here and there along the way. 7/10 for Vacation.",Vacation

The story is so much predictable, what else would you expect if from the trailers we are already presented the basic premise of a family road trip comedy movie. None of the story development gives any surprises or any wow moment. But that's really not the reason we watch comedy in the first place, isn't it? The comedy, as raunchy and dirty as it's also unsuited for kids, is indeed funny. I like how the movie kept it balanced between dialog jokes and practical stupidities. The pet rat joke is very funny for me. Yes I don't recommend it highly due to there's many better comedies out there, but it suffice for now as a new release. The acting overall is lame. Ed Helms barely hold out his comic performance.Christina Applegate should have been dismissed and replaced with someone younger instead. And I agree on the casting of the two kids as a bad choice for they look stupid in most of their scenes.",Vacation
44,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Vacation,7,30 July 2015,"In National Lampoon's Vacation (1983), Clark W. Griswold (Chevy Chase) takes his family to Wally World and the journey is shall we say, shambolic. Thirty-two years later, we get Clark's grown-up son (played by Ed Helms) taking that same journey in Vacation (my latest review). This is comedy touted as a generational gap moment. And yet, it still feels like a remake, a same same blueprint of laughs that are forced and fantasized. No matter. In between moments of mild humor and hit-or-miss gags, what's on screen is hella funny. You get to experience a vaca that has movie R & R written all over it.Now for all you facetious aficionados, Vacation has sequences where characters bathe in raw sewage, hang upside down in a roller coaster (that's where it stops), try to erase penis-shaped graffiti on the passenger side of their car, and run into a cow rendering it nothing but obliterated blood and guts. I laughed out loud heartily but remembered something even before the opening credits rolled (which are more offensive than what's in all of the previous Lampoon installments combined). I thought to myself, isn't the mantra of Rusty supposed to be smarter and less of a nincompoop than his dad. At least that's what I picked up with Anthony Micheal Hall, Johnny Galecki, and Jason lively (from Vacations 1, 2, and 3). Ed Helms (mentioned earlier) plays the adult version here. He's an appealing actor, he's goofy and likable (all you gotta do is look at the guy), and basically he's Ed Helms playing well, Ed Helms. Is this how middle age Russ would act? Based on the previous four flicks (six if you count two that are direct-to-video), probably not. Bottom line: I liked Vacation and I'm actually gonna recommend it (God help me). But I feel it could have been even more effective if it was a straight up remake of 1983's monster hit. You get a funny actor to reprise the Chevy Chase role, a blond, bombshell actress to reprise Beverly D'Angelo's Ellen Griswold and so on, and so on. The director yells action, the cameras roll, and everyone freely lets it rip. Just a random thought.Anyway, 2015's Vacation tries to up the ante over all of its predecessors. It does this in terms of vacated grossness, vulgarity, and crass indignation. Two side players even suffer heinous deaths which is something I don't think I ever saw in the Christmas installment from 89', the Vegas stint from 97', and European Vacation (no dying here. A dog falls from the Eiffel Tower and survives without so much as a scratch). Directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein really want to push the envelope. Proof of this can easily be traced back to the forty-five minute mark involving co-star Chris Hemsworth (he plays Stone Crandall, Rusty's well hung brother-in-law). Just revert to Mark Wahlberg's underwear sequence in 1997's Boogie Nights and that will give you a clue.The story of course, begins in Chicago, Illinois. And if you live in the windy city (like I do), you'll be annoyed by how certain characters get around in their respective automobiles (residents in Chi-town don't drive past the The Chicago Theatre then drive north by Wrigley field in or order to venture to Southern California). Russell ""Rusty"" Griswold (Helms) is a family man and a pilot for a second rate airline named Econo-Air (they do those mini flights from Chicagoland to South Bend, Indiana). He takes this job so he can spend a little more time with his family. He has two sons (the younger one is the bully, who'd thunk it), a marriage that seems on the outs, and a log cabin (in Michigan) where his clan goes for summer vacation. When he senses that his better half (Debbie Griswold played by Christina Applegate) is bored in said vacation pics, well Russell decides to quote unquote, ""shake things up a bit"". He wants to relive his childhood memories so he takes his family to the Wally World theme park. This expedition involves a similar blueprint akin to 1983's original. They drive through Missouri (check), stop at a strange relatives house (check), get lost and stranded in the desert (check), have uncomfortable moments in rundown hotel (check), and pass by the Grand Canyon (quintuple check). Chaos and high jinks ensue because the Griswold apple doesn't fall far from the tree. There's a scene where Debbie and Russ decide to have unsuccessful, sneak away sex via the borderline of four states. Spicy.In conclusion, you can enjoy this thing provided you go into it with the lowest of expectations. Truth be told, I viewed the trailer a month ago and figured 2015's Vacation had almost no affiliation with the other vehicles in this long running, Warner Bros. franchise. Boy was I wrong. As a new installment with the Griswolds of a new generation (I loved the family that was cast here, especially Applegate), it has the feel of all things Lampoon. And it doesn't hurt that an extended, Chevy Chase cameo makes the proceedings that more authentic.In addition to Chase, you get some other jocular and rather interesting guest appearances as well. Norman Reedus plays a trucker and alleged pedophile, Charlie Rich checks in as a manic rafting instructor, and Ron Livingston channels an asshat tycoon of a major 747 airline. And in case your wondering about Lindsay Buckingham's ""Holiday Road"" being played on Vacation's eclectic soundtrack, well don't worry. Thirty-plus years later and it's still in there. Here's my rating: A harmless three stars.Of note: In 1983, Clark and Ellen's married couple try to get their kids to sing ""Mockingbird"" by James Taylor and Carly Simon. Now in 2015, Russell tries to get his kids to belt out Seal's ""Kiss from a Rose"". If you decide to take in a viewing, you probably won't be able to get that song out of your head.",Vacation

Every upcoming scene put you on edge for what was going to happen next to the family! The scene with them swimming in raw sewage was just one of the most messed up things I've seen in ages, but it was good despite the unrealisticness of it! Other scenes like with the suicidal rafter instructor or the wally world scene with the Ninja Roller-coaster were pretty awesome!The song used in the opening credits was pretty catchy & made the film I'd say!

Subplot involving son's romance with a cute girl traveller was potentially amusing, but her character disappears after only a couple of scenes. The youngest son needed to be tasered, he was such an obnoxious twit; completely irredeeming character. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo's characters put in brief cameos in the film's penultimate scene, as does the Wagon Queen Family Trickster, looking as grotesque as ever, in this far too self aware rehash/ reboot. Seemingly every other scene's climax was given away in the two trailers, which made me feel as though I had already watched the film before. I give this film a 3/ 10, one point for each time I chuckled during this film's seemingly never ending run-time.",Vacation
47,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Trailer trash will embrace the stupidity...,1,15 August 2015,"Who DOESN'T remember the original Vacation film? I hate crude humor with a passion, but I could overlook the occasional innuendo or sex joke because the original film stayed family-friendly for the most part and never got too crass or offensive. Well, unfortunately it looks like the 21st century is now casting its wave of stupidity across every nostalgic family film, and Vacation gets it especially bad.This new Vacation film, starring the now grown-up Rusty Griswold, wasn't funny, wasn't even remotely humorous, it was just disgusting and pathetic. I was horrified by the number of parents bringing their children to the theater to see this film. The scene with the cow's insides exploding across a car? A little girl in the aisle in front of me began to scream and cry and her parents ended up leaving with her. I heard many adults saying ""what the f*ck?"" and just leaving out the door. It was a nasty film, as if somebody took that Robin Williams RV film, tossed it in a blender with a bad exploitation film and a few episodes of that god-awful Family Guy show.Some people love fart jokes and pervy sex jokes (what's wrong with humanity these days!?), but if you're going to see this film, whether you're into crude humor or not, THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT APPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN. I don't understand why it was being marketed on the radio station here as being a family film. It's the kind of film that drunk college guys and rednecks will fall in love with.I bet it'll be The Goonies or Beetlejuice that gets wrecked by crude sequels next. :(",Vacation

49,Screen_Blitz,"Crude, tasteless comedy fails miserably",2,13 December 2015,"National Lampoon's Vacation was one of the most clever comedies of the 80s, and the Griswald family brought the laughs and fun to audiences everywhere. This year, the misadventures of the Griswalds continue with Rusty Griswald (played by Ed Helms), now married to a beautiful woman named Debbie (played by Christina Applegate), and is the father of two boys: shy, kind-hearted teenager James (played by Skyler Gisondo) and the obnoxious, foul-mouthed youngster Kevin (played by Steele Stebbins), who torments James for his own fun. With the family plagued with troubled relationships with each other, Rusty decides to take his family out on a cross country vacation to Walley World, a popular amusement park in California. Of course as you might have guessed, their trip quickly goes off the rails in a series of mishaps and predicaments that stand in their way. Featuring a supporting cast of Chris Hemsworth, Leslie Mann, as well as some appearances by the National Lampoon veteran Chevy Chase, Norman Reedus, and Charlie Day, this movie happens to be the fifth installment of the National Lampoon franchise, not counting the spin-offs.This raunchy, tasteless, and over-the-top installment to the franchise is an abysmal continuation of the classic Griswald family saga that defined the road-trip comedy genre. This film tries desperately hard to be funny, but it fails miserably to bring the spirit of the previous films. Spewing vulgar sex jokes that are so forced and over-the-top dialogue that often comes off as obnoxious, this film fails to bring on true laughter from the cast, to the point where nearly scene feels like a chore to watch. If you happen to be amused by obnoxious penis jokes coming from the mouth of Steele Steebin's character who is probably 9 or 10 years old; or dumb, awkward sex conversations between Rusty and his son, then you just might be in for a funny time. Otherwise, you are facing an hour and a half of torture. Secondly, this film is a bit miscasted. I do not feel like Ed Helms and Christina Applegate are the best choices for Rusty and Debbie Griswald. While they are some funny actors, they just don't really the same flair as the Griswald parents from the previous movies. There are a few semi-funny cameos from some including Chris Hemsworth and Leslie Mann who play a married couple, who help the Griswald family along the way; then a pointless scene with Charlie Day who plays a safari guide on a rafting tour. It comes to show that directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein clearly do not know the formula of the National Lampoon films. Vacation sits down at one of this year's worst films, and is definitely a failed continuation of the Griswald family series. If you are looking for a decent comedy, you are probably better looking elsewhere because this one is a bit of a flop.",Vacation
50,Pumpkin_Man,A Dirtier and Raunchier Vacation for the Next Generation of Griswolds!!!,10,29 July 2015,"After 18 years, the Griswolds are finally back in action. This is definitely a 'passing of the torch' sequel, not a remake. I've always had a soft spot for the Vacation movies. I grew up with them and saw Vegas Vacation in the theater when I was 7. I was super psyched when this sequel was announced. I just wish Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo had more screen time. They only appear for about five minutes toward the end of the film. There are plenty of references and throw backs to the previous Vacation movies. While European, Christmas and Vegas Vacation were more family friendly and light hearted, this one goes back to the roots of the original with a very hard 'R' rating with lots of cussing, dark humor, dirty sex jokes and crude humor, which I enjoy. Audrey's character felt out of place. Leslie Mann probably wasn't a good choice for her. She was nothing like Audrey from the other movies. She was there just for the sake of having her character in it, much like Chevy and Beverly Ed Helms did fairly good as portraying Rusty Griswold. 18 years after Vegas Vacation, Rusty Griswold is now grown up with a family of his own. His wife is Debbie, played by Christina Applegate. His sons are Kevin and James. Kevin is the mean spirited little brat that cusses like a sailor, and James is more laid back and plays guitar. Rusty soon realizes that his family is tired of going to the same cabin every year for their annual vacation, so Rusty decides to mix things up and take them on a trip to Walley World, the fun park from the original classic film. 30 years later, and everything still goes hilariously wrong. This 5th Vacation may not have the same tone as the previous movies, but in the end, it has the same spirit. I highly recommend you take the Holiday Road to see VACATION!!!",Vacation

53,gizmomogwai,Return to the Holiday Road,7,24 August 2015,"I've been a virtually life-long fan of the National Lampoon's Vacation series. For whatever reason, my parents let me watch those films when I was just a little kid. Yet I never saw one in theatres before today (I was negative 1 when the first came out and only 5 when Christmas Vacation came along; Vegas Vacation was best not bothered with). Vacation '15 (obnoxiously given the same title as the original) is, as one critic pointed out, a hybrid of sequel and reboot. Rusty is grown up and head of his own family, Clark and Ellen are old (we've seen them elderly before this in the short Hotel Hell Vacation), but as Rusty boasts in a self-referential moment, the new Vacation will stand on its own.And it nearly does. There were a few things I liked about this, including bringing back the theme song Holiday Road and the R-rated humour. The sex jokes, strong language and brief nudity are back; surprising people accuse this film of being too raunchy when Vacation and European Vacation had topless women, Clark and Ellen reliving dangerous driving, masturbation references, incest jokes, heavy profanity, etc. The fact that Rusty is a pilot is highly significant, as he learned the value of the profession from the long car trip in the first film.There's other light humour that works- old people jokes with a geriatric co-pilot, the exaggerated importance of Facebook ""likes"" (which are indeed much more artificial than the actual human emotion), and a very foreign car with a swastika button (we saw a similarly unusable foreign car in the Simpsons episode Mr. Plow). The brothers, with the little brat bullying the older, sensitive one with imitation, graffiti and a bag over the head, actually felt more real to me than the token kids in this year's Jurassic World. Conversely, at times it goes to far, with a car crash and a man over a waterfall. These aren't funny, but then, there were things in the originals that I never found all that funny- the dog tied to the car, for example. At least Vacation '15 has more laughs than Vegas Vacation.",Vacation

55,phubbs,Vacation,4,20 November 2015,"The National Lampoon's franchise is a strange beast that includes a wide variety of movies that range from downright cult classics, to utter bottom of the barrel dross. Aside from the odd one or two, the main movies within the franchise have to be the Vacation flicks which have become the epitome of pure 80's Americana and beyond. The original trilogy consisting of a road trip movie, a holiday abroad and being at home for Christmas, literately resonates with everyone (of a certain age perhaps) and never fails to please. They fit right in at the right times, you can't go wrong at Christmas with 'Christmas Vacation'. Now the big question is, could this new movie (sequel/reboot) manage to hold its own, or would it fall into a pit of pathetic fan service and rehashed gags from the originals? Well everything starts off perfectly, how can it fail not too with that classic rock tune 'Holiday Road'. Yes that sounds like they are just rehashing but lets be honest here, how can you not have that song, its a must, 15 love to the movie. So a nostalgic, rose tinted ripple thundered its way through my body as the credits fired up and you get that familiar montage of family photos/images through the years. So far everything looked good, they seemed to have the right vibe going, that is until we see Ed Helms as a grown-up Rusty and the first visual gag. Basically Rusty is an airline pilot and has stepped out of the cab for a moment, he greets a young boy and his parents. Suddenly the plane hits some turbulence and Rusty's hands are thrown onto the mothers boobies, turbulence hits again and his face hits the child's crotch. This really did feel kinda creepy and childish, not that I am expecting intelligent humour here but still...it also gave us the first of a tonne of profanity. Did the original movies use so much profanity? no, the odd word, one or two, but no, it they didn't need to, so why is this full of it?Alas everything goes down hill pretty fast from this point (in my view). For starters, its not too long after that we discover the plot is just another road trip to Wally World (ugh!). Admittedly there is a reasonably funny scene where the characters address this rehash by making fun of the reboot notion, claiming it won't be the same sh*t as before but something entirely new etc...Clever, but unfortunately they lied, because the film is pretty much the same as the original (ugh!!). Alongside the miscast Helms as Rusty there is Christina Applegate as his wife, never a great sign as Applegate is pretty much a B-list/B-movie actress, and two young lads as their sons (amazed there were no young daughters). One of the boys is small, very rude and obnoxious, he swears a lot which is not a funny as it sounds. The other is the older of the two, bigger, but very effeminate, this guy wasn't too bad and had some decent laughs with his wimpiness. There are also some big cameos in the form of Chris Hemsworth as Audrey's husband who is just some stereotypical jock cowboy type, and of course we see Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo reprising their roles but not really doing or offering much at the same time. Supposedly a passing of the torch setup, but I'm not overly sure if we're getting anymore of these soooo...Most everything else we see is merely rehashed from the older better movies I'm afraid, its amazing how Hollywood just never learns. We get another sexy girl in a red Ferrari, sure there's a twist for her, but who cares, still the same bloody joke. Even one of the young boys gets a sexy girl of his age in another car setup, just like the Ferrari girl, I mean come on! The plot does resemble the plot layout of the original movie, with the same type of stop overs and the same type of basic story arc, but of course being 2015 the subplots are more relevant. But again its all predictable stuff such as a really dirty, unhygienic motel, some sort of frat house party scenario, the weird foreign car, a crazy trucker (ala 'Duel'), running out of gas in the middle of nowhere and trying to have sex unsuccessfully. Things become really forced and desperate when at one point, Clark and Ellen give Rusty their old Wagon Queen Family Truckster to continue the road trip. Apparently the same Wagon Queen Family Truckster from the original movie, or so it appears. Just in case you forgot this was a National Lampoon's sequel/reboot and they managed to squeeze every last drop of nostalgia into this project. Why would they still even have that car??This movie has moments of decent entertainment that hark back to the good old days but overall its just a very very average film. I really didn't like the excessive profanity which is peppered throughout, including the soundtrack, I really thought it was unnecessary. There is also quite a bit of gore and hints at gore which again kinda felt unnecessary for this type of flick, they really seemed to go far too adult orientated here. It just felt like they ditched the original charm and made everything more...vile, if I can use that word without sounding too extreme. Pretty big swing and miss for me, you can't just rely on the epic main title tune and two cameos.4/10",Vacation
56,aciessi,Is It Worth Seeing?,5,28 July 2015,"""This vacation will stand on it's own"", Rusty proudly proclaims at the beginning of the film. Well, he's right about that. Vacation stands far away from the original Vacation, and far away from any comedy out this summer. When an update is made on such a classic comedy, you're already making a gamble with your money at the box-office. 99% of the time, it's a bad, bad idea to see something like this. Vacation 2015, thankfully is no Pink Panther 2006.. and thank God, it's no Arthur 2011. But it's something alright. The makers of Horrible Bosses have taken a stab at the Harold Ramis/John Hughes slapstick epic, and seemed to have ran it through the Rhode Island School of Comedy, of which The Farrelly brothers and Seth MacFarlane are alumnus of. What do I mean by the Rhode Island School of Comedy? It's the golden rule to do everything you can to shock, gross-out and offend the audience. Vacation covers all the bases, and hangs from all the gallows. Poop, urine, gallons of vomit, animal cruelty, racism, homophobia, pedophilia, murder, suicide, hairs from the netherlands, boners, booze and mockery of the disabled. Gee, I don't remember the original Vacation being this dark. But what's the most important factor? Laughing, of course. The good news is, you'll laugh. Like the best of Farrelly Bros. and MacFarlane, you'll laugh the hardest when you really want to gasp and gag. You'll leave the theater happy, and immediately take a shower afterwords. As far as how it compares to it's source material, I think fans of the original will find many reasons to rip apart this remake, and I respect that. I mean, the day they make a lazy reboot of Big Lebowski, is the day I cry foul at Hollywood.",Vacation

58,RforFilm,Vacation is no holiday road. It's just a vulgar bore with some landmarks that can't even save this car trip,3,6 August 2015,"In the age of high speed media and quick travel, does car travel even sound fun? Plane travel tends to be the norm when traveling cross country or even a couple of states, but the idea of traveling in a car seem dated. That's not to say it can work, but there better be a good reason why traveling for hours in a vehicle is better then a plane. I myself would rather fly or even take a train, but I've managed to go on certain car trips and even drive the majority of them. The misery of car travel can be emphasized by watching National Lampoon's Vacation. In 1983, John Hughes and Harold Ramis combined their comedic talents along with star Chevy Chase to create the salute and satire of taking a family on a road trip. It remains one of the funniest movies of all time because we still understand plenty problems that were addressed like traveling with an animal, meeting up with crazy relatives and dealing with the disappointment of landmarks that aren't as good as originally intended. This is one film that I always felt could have used a modern remake. Instead, we get a reboot/sequel with Vacation.Rusty Griswold (played by Ed Helms), the son from the previous four Vacation movies, now has a family of his own and is working a meek job as an airline pilot for an economy airline. His wife Debbie (played by Christina Applegate) and two boy, the older and weak James and younger and vulgar Kevin, have a dysfunctional relationship with Rusty and consider him a dweeb. This doesn't help one evening when they have neighbors over and they brag about their trip to Paris while Rusty boasts about the annual family cabin trip. It's clear that Rusty is the only one excited for it as the rest of the family has become board of the trip.When Rusty realizes that the family would rather do something different for the summer, he decides to recreate the cross country road trip to Wally World that he made back in 1983 from the first movie. He secures another ugly vehicle (the Tartan Prancer, the Honda of Albania) and embarks on many sites that lead from a suicidal rafting guide (played by Charlie Day) to a crazy truck driver stalking the family. They even meet up with his sister Audrey (played by Leslie Mann) and her husband Stone (played by Chris Hemsworth) and even his parents Clark and Ellen (played by Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo).What the new Vacation misses about the original movie was that there needs to be a family- like sweetness that makes the trip worthwhile. I saw none of that as the movie's scenes seem to play out in one gross out scene, then dialogue, then another gross out scene and so on until the ending. The original may have had some gross out gags as well, but they were not the majority. The other problem was that Chevy Chase and his family were fun to follow for four movies. This family is the kind you move away from. Ed Helms is trying his hardest to be Chevy Chase but that wasn't what Rusty was like. Christina Applegate and the two boys aren't that interesting either; they are just bland family stereotypes. The best parts of the movie are the cameos, and there are a lot of them. I would rather stay with Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo to see how their bed and breakfast is going. At least their generally funny as apposed to the forced gross humor the movie keeps pushing on us. I'll give this three empty gas tanks out of ten. Vacation is no holiday road and may want to stay home next time.",Vacation
59,Quietb-1,Plan a better vacation.,3,1 August 2015,"If you have seen the many trailers you have seen most of the jokes. Some jokes work if you are into crude gross humor. There are a couple of shock crash scenes that somehow get a laugh. There's a cannibal reference to ""Suddenly Last Summer"" that will be missed by 99.9% of the audience.The problem with the movie is it doesn't touch the not so high bar set by the original ""National Lampoon's Vacation"". The original Griswold family had a softer more likable side. Here the message is, resolve problems with a good punch.This is a written and directed by writers that can't write female characters. Debbie is written like a fraternity guy. Leslie Mann is given nothing to say. Beverly D' Angelo could have been a mime. There are some laughs but way to few. It looks good on the wide screen and it is in focus. Some of the music works while some is just foul. The pictures during the end credits are actually better then the movie.

60,Anurag-Shetty,Hilarious but predictable vacation.,8,15 August 2015,"Vacation tells the story of the Griswolds & is a semi-reboot/sequel to National Lampoon's Vacation(1983). Rusty Griswold(Ed Helms) wants to take his wife Debbie Griswold(Christina Applegate) & two sons, James Griswold(Skyler Gisondo) & Kevin Griswold(Steele Stebbins) to Walley World. Walley World is an amusement park that Rusty visited when he was a kid with his dad Clark Griswold(Chevy Chase), mom Ellen Griswold(Beverly D'Angelo) & sister Audrey Crandall(Leslie Mann). The previous trip to Walley World takes place in the 1983 original. Rusty thinks that this trip will help him spend some quality time with his wife & bond with his sons. However, things don't really go according to plan. With one disaster after the other, the Griswolds' road trip to Walley World turns into a hellish nightmare. Vacation is a hysterical film! The comedic set pieces in the movie are so insane that it will leave the audience chuckling uncontrollably. The highlight of the movie is its cinematography. The west coast of the US has been captured beautifully. You get to see captivating locations like San Francisco, the Grand Canyon & Santa Monica to name a few. The only flaw of this movie is that, it feels like any other funny adult comedy. It doesn't do anything new to redefine the genre of adult comedies. The road trip going awry concept has been done to death in this particular genre. I'm not complaining though. I just would have loved this film more if, it was as unique & non-stop hilarious as, for example, This Is the End(2013), We're the Millers(2013), The Hangover Trilogy(2009-2013) or the Horrible Bosses movies(2011-2014). Despite many bumps along the way, you just know how this holiday is going to end. I can't compare it to the original Vacation films, since I haven't watched them. This movie wouldn't have been half as funny without these talented thespians who have mastered the art of making people laugh. Ed Helms is brilliant as Rusty Griswold. Helms brings a genuine sincerity to his role, that makes the audience sympathize with his character when he wants us to. Christina Applegate is awesome as Debbie Griswold. Skyler Gisondo is great as James Griswold. Steele Stebbins is impressive as Kevin Griswold. Both Gisondo & Stebbins play the parts of the dorky older brother & the obnoxious younger brother, to perfection. Chris Hemsworth is scene stealing as Stone Crandall. Hemsworth will make you guffaw like a maniac by his antics on screen. Be it his Southern accent, his various talents & 'assets', it's Thor like you've never seen him before. Vacation would have been much, much more funny if Chris Hemsworth's Stone Crandall had a meatier role. Leslie Mann is good as Audrey Crandall. Chevy Chase & Beverly D'Angelo are superb in their cameos as Clark Griswold & Ellen Griswold respectively. Charlie Day is fantastic as Chad. Catherine Missal is effective as Adena. Ron Livingston & Norman Reedus are amazing in their small yet, significant roles as Ethan & Trucker respectively. Michael Pena makes a welcome appearance as New Mexico Cop. The rest of the cast are perfect in their roles too. Vacation is a must watch for fans of adult comedies.",Vacation
61,spookyrat1,If You Loved the Original ... !,7,26 January 2019,"... you'll really like this sequel, which pays more than copious homages to the first Vacation (1983). It very studiously and unashamedly just updates things to a 21st century setting, before letting Rusty Griswold's family run rampant across various American landscapes and landmarks in yet another Walley World quest.Ed Helms channels Chevy Chase to perfection, even down to the (disastrous) father/son talks he received from his dad in the first film. Christina Applegate looking like Beverly D'Angelo (1983) also gives a very appealing sexy/funny performance. And the two antagonistic sons, the younger a foul-mouthed bully of the elder, a young SNAG, just trying to find his place in the world, are frequently hilarious in their interactions.Thank goodness the producers decided against trying to tone down the raw humour in an effort to get a PG rating. The adult humour works far better and is imbued with a kid-like sense of fun. I'm sorry, but for me, the PG sequels in the franchise, whilst undoubtedly having their funny moments, always seemed unnecessarily antiseptic in feeling.Some of the cameos are terrific. Michael Pena and friends playing the four clashing interstate cops must have found it hard to keep straight faces. Chris Hemsworth, very much again sending his star persona up, playing Rusty's very wealthy Texan brother-in-law, Stone Crandall demonstrates the comedic credentials, he so well utilised in Thor: Ragnarok. Ironically, the expected appearances of Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo served more as a transition between scenes, rather than as an independently comical episode.The critics generally panned this movie, but if you feel you have the taste, it's highly recommended that you go the full course with the Griswolds.",Vacation
62,bryank-04844,'Vacation' film has already earned the stamps on its passport and is ready for its next vacation.,8,29 July 2015,"""We're on a pilgrimage to see a moose. Praise Marty Moose!"" Those were wise, unearthing words from America's family man Clark W. Griswold (Chevy Chase) as he trekked his family from Chicago to California inside the Griswold family truckster back in 1983. Clark, along with his wife Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), and their two kids Rusty (Anthony Michael Hall) and Audrey (Dana Barron) encountered a variety of hilarious obstacles and problems along their difficult road trip, but they stuck together as a family and proved that any American family can make it across country without killing one another...mostly.The film spawned a number of sequels over the years, which saw the Griswold family celebrate Christmas, fly to Europe, and even gamble in Vegas. It's been about 18 years since we saw the Griswold clan go on vacation or celebrate a holiday, and Hollywood thought it was time to reboot the franchise. Writing team John Francis Daley (Sam Weir from 'Freaks and Geeks') and Jonathan Goldstein struck gold with their scripts for the 'Horrible Bosses' films, and were now given the chance to direct as well the new installment of the 'Vacation' franchise. Instead of completely rebooting the franchise from scratch, Daley and Goldstein made a late sequel, which follows Clark's son Rusty (Ed Helms), who has a family of his own now including his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) and their two young sons James and Kevin.To surprise his family by not going to the same old boring cabin in the woods every year, he decides to take his family to Wally World, the place where he first took that infamous road trip, and of course they're driving there cross country. Well of course, you can imagine, things don't go according to plan. Daley and Goldstein did a great job with the screenplay, by keeping things fresh and original, while paying homage to the original film.There are problems with the vehicle that travels across country, interesting night time talks at a motel, and side trips to see famous landmarks, but that's about as similar it gets to the original. Every thing else stands on its own and is down right laugh out loud funny. For instance, when the Griswold family meet up with sister Audrey (Leslie Mann) in Plano, TX and her hunk of a TV weatherman husband Stone Crandall (Chris 'Thor' Hemsworth), where he can't stop talking about faucets. Through all of the laughs, one things remains constant, and that is what Chevy Chase showed us in the original films.Clark taught us that no matter what issue arises, he will do anything it takes to make his family happy and have a good time on vacation, so they can better bond and love each other. Ed Helms conveys this perfectly, and it's as heartwarming as it is funny. Packed with some excellent cameos, past and present throughout, this new 'Vacation' film has already earned the stamps on its passport and is ready for its next vacation. (I'm sorry about the pun, I'll show myself out.)HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Vacation

71,James_De_Bello,5/10,5,13 August 2015,"There is one word with which I can describe the new Vacation reboot, that word is: harmless. It isn't by any stretch of the imagination a good or intelligent comedy overall, but it is also light hearted and funny enough not to be anything to get angry with and even something from which to enjoy more than a couple of moments.The film does fall into ultra generic territory a little to often and has a dramatic story that simply falls flat, yet despite these problems that stretch throughout it stops in a few parts and has these very cool moments both comedic and dramatic. It is definitely uneven as is Ed Helms' performance which stretches from terrible to perfect comedic timing and everything in between, but when does moments hit they hit really good and deliver the laughs that too often miss from the rest of the film.Chris Hemsworth is absolutely brilliant (as always) and plays the part of the douche perfectly. Plus he probably has the funniest moment and gag in the whole film. Unfortunately that can't be said for the rest of the cast. Some have sparkles of good material, but for the majority they repeatedly miss the mark. That might be due to a script that is sorely missing interesting and brilliant comedy and too often falls for dull gags that don't carry throughout. Moreover the direction is too generic and doesn't use visual to the advantage of comedy enough.""Vacation"" isn't anything to get excited about nor something to weep about.

72,euroGary,"Clearly a 'Marmite' film - you either love it, or loathe it",8,26 August 2015,"'The new vacation will stand on its own!' asserts Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) at the beginning of this comedy. To the lazy reviewer this kind of line is a godsend - 'oh no it will not!' But actually, it does.Remembering - through rose-tinted spectacles - the happy holidays of his youth, Rusty decides to take his wife and two sons on a drive across the United States to Walley World (scene of the original ""National Lampoon's Vacation"", 1983). On the way they get caught up in various comedy set-pieces, including but not limited to a suicidal rafter, hot springs, a particularly unfortunate cow and Chris Hemsworth in his pants.Helms does a good job: retaining from the original films the enthusiastic everyman persona created by Chevy Chase, but not making himself a carbon copy of Chase. As wife Debbie, Christina Applegate is more waspish than was Beverly D'Angelo, but she also gets more comedy moments - indeed, her (and her stunt-double's) drunken attempt at a sorority assault cause is perhaps the funniest sequence of the film, rivalled only by a scene where four police officers from rival states start arguing over who has jurisdiction where.The comedy is broad, and much of it telegraphed - but so what? Sometimes you just want to watch a fun film, and ""Vacation"" is certainly that. Chase and D'Angelo appear in what could almost be a 'passing of the torch' moment - and I wouldn't be disappointed if this film spawned sequels, as did the original.",Vacation

But the truth is the movie doesn't have much to offer. Is there a story to it? Well the name of the movie is just it.You can see Ed Helms give his best shot without a proper script on his table, trying to make things work merely by his expressions and dodging awkward situations with his clumsiness. Christina Applegate tries her best to follow the lead quite well. However both eventually fail to create the magic needed to wrap up a sitcom. Their kids played by Skyler Gisondo and Steele Stebbins are also kind of dispensable as the directors tried to weave a small sideline story to make things interesting. The only problem: They forgot to make it funny.Some of the jokes are really cheesy that we could have lived without. Some are really good though and you are squeezed into a laughter fit at times. Credit scenes contain some funny photographs to bring you in the right mood. There is this Korean GPS system that literally shouts the directions that ices the flick's jokes.Nothing could have saved this flick, not even cameos by Charlie Day, Norman Reedus, Keegan-Michael Key, Chevy Chase, Colin Hanks, Michael Pena, Nick Kroll or Ron Livingston. They do compel you to raise your brows when you realize ""Ah! There they are!"" But soon they shotgun your hopes with their limited screen time. When you see them, suddenly you raise your expectations and then the story spears you right there. Everyone shoehorned to make things funny! Movie runs kind of like a commercial. Abrupt frame changes, lacks focus. Some of the story bits are pretty predictable too, and you almost see things coming. Even certain situations arrive with a promise of something big, but things die down quite abruptly with no power- climax to end them up with.Also, if this was supposed to be a sequel, then we can rule this one out as one of the most average sequels ever made.You can watch it if you want something light to go with your popcorn.",Vacation

79,FallenEye,A Tartan Prancer Scarier than a Velociraptor.,6,22 April 2018,"There were some good laughs, and although at points it was a little ridiculous, that ridiculousness managed to somewhat lend itself to the laughs.Another nice aspect of this movie is that, it kind of tried to steer away to some extent, from the predictability of these type of movies. Sure, a large part of it was very predictable, but, it tried with others, and I appreciated that.Overall, Vacation was pretty much what I always expected it to be, and it met those expectations quite well. Usually these road trip type comedy flicks, filled with a bunch of unnecessary spectacle end up feeling way too long, even with their usual 1 hr 30 min running time, but this film filled up that time with some palatable content for the most part. 5.7/10.P.S. Chris Hemsworth continues to deliver terrible, terrible American accents, and I have a feeling this film was just a disposable/replaceable playground to further practice his accent without consequence.",Vacation

Strange part is, I think Ben stiller could have managed to raise the humor bar a notch or two. And I don't even like Ben stiller. The script is really really Bad. they've just basically tried to copy the first vacation movie. Minus all the fun jokes and the talent.And added bits here and there. It seem to also be missing bits and pieces from the story line. Which again,make it fail build the character,like it's suppose to This time it's Clark's grown son,who's gonna go through hell, and take his family on a cross country vacation to wally world. Only this time is mostly unfunny. There is few times you snicker a bit,but that's about it. There's nothing there to make you burst out laughing.You mostly cringe.

82,CabbageCustard,Adolescent humor at its most gross.,5,6 May 2019,"There are a couple of genuinely inspired moments in Vacation. Unfortunately, they are so grossly outnumbered by segments that are offensively unfunny and cringe-worthy that you may well miss them the first time you watch this film. At times you will chuckle but more often you will wonder if this script was actually written by adults and not a group of fourteen-year-old boys. If your idea of humor is little boys dropping the F-bomb, people slathering themselves in excrement, and drunk ladies vomiting (to name but a few of the 'witty' plot devices employed here) then you will love this. If your tastes are more mature then you will have to work a bit harder to find the humor. It is there, just well camouflaged and infrequent.I don't usually focus on the opening and closing credits of a movie, but these are so abominable they deserve special mention. The expletive ridden music is particularly offensive and totally unnecessary. Still, I guess it lets you know what to expect from the movie to come.Sadly, I can't recommend this movie to anyone.

83,CleveMan66,"""Vacation"" stikes a great balance between honoring the original film and paving its own holiday road.",8,31 July 2015,"""I found out long ago. It's a long way down the holiday road."" Those are the opening lyrics from the Lindsey Buckingham song that is found in all four of National Lampoon's ""Vacation"" movies of the 1980s and 90s. Those movies all starred Chevy Chase as the father who would stop at nothing to give his family the perfect vacation, whether it was a European vacation, a Vegas vacation, a Christmas vacation or a road trip to California's (fictional) Walley World theme park. The holiday road is indeed a long one. It led us to all those places and back and then it led us here. 32 summer vacations later, a movie called simply ""Vacation"" (R, 1:39) is a remake/sequel/reboot hybrid which also features Buckingham's catchy tune. The question is whether this vacation lives up to the legacy of the iconic film that shares its name.This time, the only son of Clark (Chevy Chase) and Ellen Griswold (Beverly D'Angelo) is all grown up. Rusty (Ed Helms) is a pilot for a small budget airline. Like his parents in the earlier films, he's married, has two kids and lives in Chicago. His wife, Debbie (Christina Applegate), is loyal and supportive, but longs for a little more spontaneity and variety in the marriage. They have two kids, boys named James (Skyler Gisondo) and Kevin (Steele Stebbins). James is an awkward, nerdy teenager and his foul-mouthed kid brother teases him mercilessly for it. Maybe a cross-country road trip is just what this family needs to come closer together. After all, as the movie poster asks: What could go wrong? Rusty decides to drive his family all the way from Chicago to Walley World in California, recreating his family's similar (but infamous) childhood trip hopefully, with better results. Rusty starts by renting a ""Prancer"", a car that's even more interesting than the ""Family Truckster"" in the original film. It has two gas tanks, along with a plug which doesn't look like it would fit any outlet in the known universe. This boxy blue bastardized Toyota Previa has a key fob and control panel with a bewildering number and assortment of buttons and a GPS that too easily gets stuck harshly giving directions in Korean.But taking this ""Honda of Albania"" out on America's highways is only the beginning of this Griswold adventure. Their ill-advised road trip involves being followed by an ominous-looking truck, being directed to a ""hot spring"" that really isn't, losing personal possessions, plus father and son having a sex talk that's more conjecture than fact. Stops on the trip include a very revealing visit to Debbie's old college, a river rafting trip with a highly unstable guide (Charlie Day), a visit with Rusty's grown sister, Audrey (Leslie Mann), and her hunky local TV weather man husband (Chris Hemsworth) as well as stopping at a bed-and-breakfast owned by a couple who will be very familiar to fans of the earlier films.""Vacation"" strikes a great balance between honoring its iconic origins and paving its own holiday road. The movie makes use of a few sight gags and incidents from the 1980s classic, but puts its own spin on them. The adult Rusty is every bit as earnest and bumbling as his dad, but Helms makes the character his own. As in the first film, the script makes good use of the comic potential inherent in a cross-country car trip, but doesn't copy any scenarios from the earlier movies. Despite the distractingly inappropriate amount of foul language coming from the family's youngest member, the humor, as raunchy and crude as it is, works well. While the first film's humor was often more subtle in nature, the jokes in this one are often laugh-out-loud funny.""Vacation"" has some self-referential fun as Rusty's family discusses who has heard of the original vacation and whether trying to duplicate it would just result in a big letdown. Whether an on-screen family conversation or a reflection of the thoughts of real-life moviegoers, those concerns are unfounded. The new fictional Griswolds are brought closer together by their trip and the cinematic portrayal of their misadventures is both fun & funny maybe even more than the first ""Vacation"". ""A-""",Vacation

Rarely have i seen a comedy with so many original scenes and witty dialogue, the producers of this movie have really tried hard to stay away from comedy movie cliches to create something fresh and funny. Ed Helms is simply amazing in this movie, if you like his roles in ''The Office'' or ''Hangover'', expect the same character here, he surely has not lost his charm and talent over the years. For some reason this movie feels a bit different when compared to other modern comedies of this type, it certainly brings something fresh to the table in a genre almost impossible to bring anything new to.
 
 This movie is obviously a bit over the top, awkward and cringy at times, but that plays out greatly when Ed Helms is the main character, of course, Ed Helms delivers his classic awkward cringe worthy character perfectly making this into an amazing modern comedy. Do not look at the bad reviews and ratings, this is a great, action packed, funny comedy that is worth seeing!",Vacation

88,stephendaxter,Scraping the bottom of the barrel of original road-trip humour,3,14 November 2015,"Vacation is the totally unnecessary reboot of 'National Lampoon's Vacation', and the last attempt to benefit off the name of a dead movie franchise. It is yet another Road- Trip Comedy as expected, but this time around it is really scraping the bottom of the barrel in terms of original road-trip humour. The film follows the same formula as pretty much every other dumb road-trip film in existence and offers nothing new at all in terms of humour or entertainment. The humour for the most part is terrible, the jokes are predictable and just downright unfunny. Half of the jokes are just dick jokes and poop jokes and another 40% of the jokes are awful running jokes that constantly repeat themselves and sequences that last for like 2-3 minutes each, ugh. That final 10% (and even 10% is generous) are the very few times they got me to kinda laugh a little. But you get one 3 second laugh every 20 minutes or so, meaning that the rest of the time you better be invested in these characters otherwise you're gonna have a tough time staying awake. And the characters were bad, not all of them were completely awful the whole time, but overall, they were all bad. The two kids for example, terrible..... absolutely goddamn unbearably TERRIBLE, everything those two little shits said past the 5 minute mark made me cringe. They have these recurring 'jokes' throughout the entire film and they were maybe a little funny the first time but they drove them into the ground really fast. And the parents also had nothing interesting about them, they were just generic obliviously dumb characters used to take the film to various locations for more crappy jokes. I obviously didn't expect fully fleshed out characters but they were just completely unoriginal and had nothing good or funny to say.I have to say, one positive is that even though the jokes were terrible in all the locations they went to, the film surprisingly didn't spend too long at each stop on the way to Wally World. Something went wrong, they spent like 10 minutes in a location, blurted out a bunch of crappy jokes, and then moved on. Other road trip films do tend to stick to certain locations for like 15-20 minutes at a time and it does drag on. But to give credit where credit is due, they did handle the pace very well. I also kinda enjoyed the 10 minutes they spent with Chris Hemsworth's character. He was actually a fairly likable character and did have all of the best and funniest parts in the film. So in the end, this really is close to the bottom of the barrel of road-trip films, both in terms of humour and originality. I don't remember much from the original 'Vacation' but from what i've heard and what i remember it doesn't do the film any justice. Want a good road-trip film? Check out Dumb and Dumber or even Little Miss Sunshine, just do yourself a favour and stay away from this. - 3.3/10",Vacation

It's almost an R Rated Family Movie. Everything about Vacation works. Even though the movie is not going so successful critically and commercially, I still say go to this one.The movie is about Rusty Griswold who is a pilot now. After hearing behind his back that his family is tired of going to the same cabin every year, he decides to take them to Walley World as the original Vacation movie did. There, they visit Rusty's sister, Audrey's New Husband (Chris Hemsworth), and his parents Clark and Ellen, and get into some serious adventure.The movie is all out hilarious and crude which is why I think the movie is being criticized. I don't remember the old movie being this crude, but hell, it's freaking funny. The movie's jokes are all hits and sometimes there is lots of shocking moments. The film made me go OMG lots of times because I was so stunned by what was happening. The ending where the two rivaling families fight to get on the roller coaster is hysterical.Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are in the movie also as Clark and Ellen. The roles that made them famous. It's nice to see them again even if it might be the last time. There is so much to learn from this movie. I wouldn't suggest bringing young children to this movie as there is some graphic nudity in some parts, but for parents with teenagers, I definitely think you should take them to see the new Vacation film.

He's not the man for the part, but it shows that Ed Helms cannot support a movie on his own. I feel that the cast around him was also not up to the task. The script was OK, but there were moments when you felt that more laughs would get out of them (like in the explosion scene), but they didn't. That's sad for a comedy. You may watch it but it's nothing special. Humour is vulgar and disgusting at some parts, which was not by kind of poison. So, overall, it's better to see the old one than the new. A good, decent effort but nothing more than that. A better casting was in order...",Vacation
93,JPfanatic93,You better stay at home than going on this vacation,3,10 October 2015,"Well, this was positively awful. Of course, the current trend of making a comedy as raunchy as possible by cramming it full of dirty jokes involving excrement and unusual sexual positions has been going for quite a while now, so you can hardly blame this Vacation for that. It's not like the original movie refrained from such shenanigans. But the level of said gags is just abominably low here, making it painfully unfunny for the most part. Too bad, because I know the lead Ed Helms, of Hangover fame, is capable of funnier routines. But even he is hopelessly lost somewhere between the rim jobs and Chris Hemsworth's erection. You got a bad thing going when the holiday car is funnier that the characters driving it. But at least the car doesn't make poop jokes galore. This vehicle of Albanian make is just loaded with silly gadgets and awkward options. Not all of them a guarantee for success, but at least I chuckled over the navigation system's sultry female American voice accidentally being replaced by a seemingly outraged Korean counterpart. If translated however, it would no doubt be revealed to get in line with the rest of the ample obscenities the script contains.As with most remakes these days, this one wouldn't have been missed if it wasn't produced at all. However, recycling the original film's plot and adding Horrible Bosses or We're the Millers type jokes to it likely saved the studio a few bucks. The story is mostly the same as its predecessor's, while some of the situations are even lifted verbatim from some of the other Vacation movies from the Eighties. It's not like this is that well known a franchise these days, so who would know, right? But if you acknowledge the status of this film as a remake by making jokes about that very fact in the actual film, you sure run the risk of people checking out the previous installments and finding out just how lazy the writing is this time around. Even such references to the original are hardly an inspired move. Remember 21 Jump Street addressing its status as a reboot by literally saying nobody at the top has any better ideas than just regurgitating old notions ad nauseam? It's a funny line, until you understand just how poignantly true it is. We don't need to hear the same argument here to hammer the point home. The movie is unhilarious enough without reminding us a better film with the same name and the same plot was produced thirty years ago. Or that we're likely to see another movie with said name and plot in a few more decades. The kids in this feature definitely appear stupid enough to make the same mistakes all over when they grow up.Luckily, this Vacation will be swiftly forgotten. It'll prove a lot harder to get that obnoxiously catchy song Holiday Road out of our heads.",Vacation

It has some well-earned laugh-out-loud moments but what shines through what should have been a complete failure is the way in which Ed Helms plays Rusty Griswold.It's far from a great film but it does a good job of mixing the old 80's absurd slapstick comedy and the modern adult shock humour, creating a unique mix that somehow stays grounded. It never succumbs to the cartoon antics of Dumb and Dumber To yet it doesn't take itself so serious that the drama overshadows the comedy. It's not so much that we are getting jokes we've never seen before, what we are getting is genuine characters reacting to ridiculous situations in a very human way.It's dirty, vulgar, raunchy and completely inappropriate, which is exactly what we need comedy to be right now. Vacation is also surprisingly heart-warming at it's core. In a time when comedies are struggling to stay irrelevant and as politically incorrect as possible, an R-rated family vacation movie is refreshing even if it's far from original.",Vacation
96,jbartelone,Excessive Profanity and Predictability Spoils This Vacation,5,10 August 2016,"The original National Lampoon's Vacation movie withstood the test of time because of the brilliance of the acting, comic timing, and the very realistic situations that could happen to a family on a vacation where ""Murphy's Law"" that ""Anything could go wrong, will go wrong."" is proved. The original Vacation had the proper settings for comic build up, with some levels of raunchy behavior, but at least there was a reason for the behavior, and there was great humor that led up to that behavior.This Vacation shows that the writers main premise was to have a twelve year old kid drop F-bombs and have the main characters often engage in sexual situations for little more than shock value. This story has Rusty as an adult looking to bond with his wife and sons by taking them to Wally World to reconnect with them. Continuity is incorrect as Rusty tells his family what a wonderful time he had at Wally World as a kid. As most know from the original film, this is incorrect, Rusty's trip to Wally World as a kid was a series of disasters one after the other along the way. It is as if the writers of this remake forgot that main point!Some of the situations are funny, but others are not. A scene where the vulgar twelve year old younger brother tries to suffocate his older brother by putting a bag over his head goes too far. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo who had such classic chemistry in the original film exist in pointless cameos, reduced to being cold and lifeless.Having said that, there are some funny situations, the writing however is not original at all. There was so much profanity, even in the end credits song, and that was sad to hear.

99,scott-sw,Vacation Represents the Demise of the Modern Comedy,4,25 September 2015,"The last Vacation venture voyages into a vast void. It is the prime example for the current state of modern comedies in modern cinema. A grown Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) is now a pilot for low budget airline and wants to spice things up for his family by taking a vacation to Wally World to relive his experience with his own family. Guess what happens. The movie has a decent cast, anchored by Helms, Christina Applegate as the faithful wife, Debbie, and Skyler Gisondo and Steel Stebbins as the sons, James and Kevin, respectively. This ensemble is about the only good thing for this aimless, meaningless trip. They have their quirks, and play their parts well - especially Applegate and Stebbins, who almost steals the show. Unfortunately, there is not much of a show to steal. First, is the writing. Today's modern comedy writers have no idea to write humor. Instead of using situation, character and dialog, they use gross exaggeration, excessive disgust, and over-the-top profanity. Even the main theme song has the F-word dropped every second. The disgust ranges from a swim in a sewage-infested pond to driving an ATV through a cow. The gross exaggeration is not just in the raunchy humor, but also in the situations and the characters. This ranges from an idiot brigade of a law enforcement stand-off from each of the Four Corner States to a needless and idiotic family on family brawl in the line for the roller-coaster. Oh, and don't forget Stone (Chris Hemsworth) who has to parade his abs as well as his manhood in tight-fitting underwear. Even Chevy Chase falls into the trap of overacting the part. The sad thing is there were a few moments that shined through. Applegate shows desperation as she struggles in a boring, predictable marriage. Helms, when he isn't overacting, is concerned about the whole family. Even Stebbins and Gisondo's sibling rivalry ends with some mutual respect. All that is lost for the sake of grossing out the audience. The original Vacation had wit in its comedy. You didn't have to see the dog wet on the picnic basket, the funny part was Chevy's reaction to finding out the fact. We didn't have to see Blinky get torn to bits on the highway, but got a real kick out of Chase concealing his joy from the Highway Patrolman. One of the best scenes was Chase's tirade in the car - when we finally hear the F-Bomb - indicating his patience had run out. The descent of modern comedies in this day and age is reaching a nadir and it shows no promise of climbing out of the muck. Vacation is a clear indication that we need a vacation from Hollywood Comedies that are not funny.",Vacation

110,brutzel,Raunchy. Not Funny. Not a Family Movie,1,5 January 2016,"Rusty (Helms) needs to take his family on a vacation to Wally World as he needs to reconnect with his wife, Debbie (Applegate) and his 2-sons.The music in the very beginning is a rap song and uses foul language and the words are clear. At the end of the movie the rap song comes around again and still uses the same foul language.What we have in here are kids using f-bombs, and spouting body sexual parts trying to be funny. And it's just not kids using foul language, the adults also have a hand in this. The main problem is that Hollywood doesn't know how to do funny: site gags or dialogues and they resort to bathroom humor thinking that is what everyone wants to hear. Really?Many may think that this Vacation movie will be the same as the original VACATION movie with Chevy Chase and will be highly disappointed. As I recall the original VACATION was silly and stupid enough, but didn't have the raunchy stuff and foul language in dialogues or in the music. (How did you get roped into watching something you knew was Raunchy?) I blame it on the promos as they don't show the raunchy stuff. I took a chance. Seems I never learn, but I keep hoping.Notables: Chevy Chase, Chris HemsworthI am convinced good humor is only in a drama whereby good funny lines have the desired comedic impact. The only way to stop the kind of abuse we see in here is for the professional Reviewers to let people know exactly what is in the movie. And this will happen when pigs fly.

(Not Wal-Mart)A new generation of Griswold's ride the highway.""I've never even heard of the original vacation."" The kid tells his parents.""Doesn't matter,"" his father replies. ""The new vacation will stand on its own.""The film National Lampoon's Vacation, sometimes referred to as Vacation, is a 1983 American comedy film directed by Harold Ramis and starring Chevy Chase (Saturday Night Live, Hot Tub Time Machine), Beverly D'Angelo (Annie Hall, American History X), Randy Quaid (Caddyshack 2, Brokeback Mountain), Dana Barron (Christmas Vacation 2, Death Wish 4), and 1980s icon Anthony Michael Hall (Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club). John Candy (Space balls, Home Alone), Imogene Coca (her work includes various television shows), Christie Brinkley (model, and various commercials), and Jane Krakowski (Fatal Attraction, Pixels) appear in supporting roles. The screenplay was written by one of my favorite directors, and another 1980s icon, John Hughes (Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club). It is based on his short story ""Vacation '58"" which appeared in National Lampoon.Since then, we have had many Vacation films, the most recent one being the 2015 reboot Vacation. Written and directed by Jonathan Goldstein (Has been a writer for The PJ's and The Geena Davis Show) and John Francis Daley (Freaks and Geeks, Horrible Bosses). This film marks their directorial debuts. It stars Ed Helms (The Hangover, We're the Miller's), Christina Applegate (Anchorman, Bad Moms), Skyler Gisondo (2007s Halloween, Air Buddies) Steele Stebbins (A Haunted House 2), Leslie Mann (Funny People, This is 40), Chris Hemsworth (Thor, The Avengers), Beverly D'Angelo and Chevy Chase. It is the fifth installment of the Vacation film series, the second not to carry the National Lampoon name after Vegas Vacation, and was released by New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. on July 29, 2015. When this film came out it received some nasty reviews, and for that exact reason, I decided not to see this film at the theaters. I decided to watch it at the comfort of my own home, and I am glad I did. I would not have paid full price to see this film, but at the end of the day I am glad I saw it. One thing I did not enjoy in the film is the constant reminder of we are not the old vacation. We are something new. It was trying too hard to be self aware, very much like the 21 Jump Street film. The original film is a classic. It is funny; it had a statement to make about families, American vacations, and the love of the family. It was the family along with the situations that made it great. The filmmakers knew, that the situations cannot out due the character development of the family. With this new film, the situations out do the characters. Honestly, the family comes off a little unlike-able. The yell and use profanity at each other, fight, talk bad about each other behind each other's back (Yes, I'm looking at you Christina Applegate), and like a dysfunctional family. If the biggest compliment you can find about the family is that they are dysfunctional, maybe they should consider some rewrites. That way we slightly care more about the characters.""DON'T SAY WEIRD SH*T!""In my opinion, the best surprises come from the back seat of the car. Whereas ""the original had a brother and sister, this time we've got two boys."" The big twist is that the younger brother, Kevin, played by Steele Stebbins. He is the standout of the film. He made me laugh constantly. Even though he is the alpha, constantly bullying his dopier, sweeter older brother James, played by Skyler Gisondo. It starts out with name-calling, but leads to some shockingly dark places, such as a repeated gag where Kevin manically tries to smother James with a plastic bag. The movie does have some laugh aloud moments. I never knew Chris Hemsworth could be so funny. His comedic timing is perfect, his delivery is funny, and he really surprised me here. Even though I previously wrote that the situations out do the family, the situations are actually somewhat funny. Some of them are a hit and miss, but I personally enjoyed most of them. Even though it is one vulgar joke after another that does not really, lead anywhere, I did laugh more than I criticized. It's not as good as the original, but it is at least a onetime watch.SO HOW IS CHEVY AND THE REST OF THE FAMILY DOING?One word, and that word is just, decent. Do not go in here expecting the old Chevy Chase. I cannot tell if he was acting, or if he really is a crazy old man know. There is a scene in the movie, where Chevy holds up his grand-kids. When he walks away with his kids, it was so obvious it was a stuntman wearing a toupee. I believe, at this point in his career, Chevy should just stick to simple cameos at this point. So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on the film Vacation. The film is childish and badly written at some parts. It is not very shocking anymore to see fecal matter on screen anymore, or hear a kid use profanity, it's been done. I did laugh, though the cameos were well done, and something to watch if you are bored. The movie does have flaws, and is not as great as the original, but it is a good time waster. I believe this film earns a6/10.This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, Don't just get down, but get Boogie.

112,michael-3204,"Decent concept, poorly executed",3,5 October 2016,"You'll need a vacation after watching ""Vacation""! Ha! That's not a line in the movie, but it is representative of the bland, predictable humor that drags down this attempt to reboot National Lampoon's family comedy from 30 years ago. Requisite meta-humor copied from the Jump street films about sequels? Check. Guest appearances from original cast members? Check. Slew of mostly improvisational comedic actors peppered throughout to do bits that make you wonder if you're watching a themed episode of SNL rather than a real movie with a real story to tell? Check.Predictability is not in itself necessarily a bad thing, if a movie is able to make good on what it promises, even if you can see it coming. Too much of ""Vacation"" falls flat, like the weaker sketches of a mediocre SNL. There were aspects that mostly worked, for me anyway - - the bizarrely configured Albanian rental car with the inscrutable remote control, the potentially murderous big rig truck driver possibly pursuing the Griswold family across the country. The story makes a good attempt at integrating Audrey Griswold (Leslie Mann), who turns out to be trapped in a gilded cage with an oversexed and overbearing husband (a pretty good Chris Hemsworth, trying to flex his comedic muscles), but it ends up not giving Mann much to work with. The rest of the film, and the rest of the comedians charged with bringing it to life, fall flat or worse -- especially an execrable Charlie Day as an unbalanced river guide and four actors I won't bother naming who embarrass themselves at the Four Corners.It's possible this would have been okay, albeit uneven, if the central family had been better conceived. Only Christina Applegate's Debbie Griswold comes off as vaguely human and vaguely relatable. Ed Helms, usually so good at striking the right balance between likable and absurd, can't manage to make Rusty Griswold anything but dopey and annoying. His relentless enthusiasm and utter cluelessness is, I think, supposed to be endearing, but it just makes viewers understand his sons' mean-spirited contempt for him. And that's really what sinks ""Vacation"" in the manure -- we need Griswolds we can at least hope might have a good vacation, but in this film, no one really cares.",Vacation
113,keithlovesmovies,Vacation Review,8,23 September 2015,"Realizing that his family and his marriage is in a rut, Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) decides to take his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate) and his two sons Jacob and Kevin (Skyler Gisondo and Steele Stebbins) in a strange foreign car on a cross-country trip to ""Walley World"" following what his father Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) did with him when he was younger hoping to get closer with his wife and to give his family time for some bonding. This trip soon becomes one misadventure for these Griswolds and for anyone who runs into them.I was pleasantly surprised by how funny this film is since some of the reviews I've read have not been to good. Just a warning, this film is not a remake in that it has a new story and the film acknowledges the others and the way it differentiates itself is smart in a meta kind of way. Their vacation will not be like the others because it will stand on its own. Ed Helms is great here as the family's new patriarch. He is clueless and out of touch at times while desperately trying to hold his marriage and family together and his stubborn optimism is infectious. Christina Applegate was solid and had a few good moments as Debbie and she also had great chemistry with Ed Helms' Rusty. They both had their fair share of one-liners and exchanges that were both funny and also real. What really impressed me were the actors who played the Griswold children. Their exchanges with one another are some of the funniest things in the film and they both work well alongside the more experienced actors playing their parents. The chemistry the four of them had with one another kept me engaged and entertained. What I thought also worked was the film's pacing. It kept the story going as they did not stay in the same place for too long and the jokes kept coming and no single joke overstayed its welcome (except for one but that's still pretty good). I can't go any longer without mentioning Chris Hemsworth who is unrecognizable as Rusty's sister Audrey's (Leslie Mann) husband Stone Crandall. His American accent is remarkable and there is one scene of his in particular that you will not forget. We also get to see Rusty's parents Clark and Ellen Griswold (Chase and Beverly D'Angelo) who are still funny after all this time and also have some moments of their own. What I didn't like about the film was that we did not get to spend enough time with either them or Audrey and Stone as each them brought a lot of funny to the film and I just wanted more of that. I found the ending a little disappointing as well but I did enjoy the journey more than the destination. The film has a message about the importance of family and that's a message I can stand by. Despite that message, this film is not for kids and definitely earns its R rating. Be that as it may, this is a funny, smart, and edgy film that should not be missed. This definitely one of the funniest movies of the year and could be the start of a new franchise but I would be okay if this was it.Score: 8/10 keithlovesmovies.com",Vacation

The characters are flat and one dimensional - all exist basically to set up jokes with varying (low) degrees of success. The premise is something you've seen a thousand times evolving into those Hollywood ""smile"" moments you've seen a million times. Most of all... it's not very funny. The movie hesitates between being one of those ""embarassing funny & hard to watch"" humor and something more slapstick and in the end is neither... and is not fun. Ed Helms must be tired of being typecast into those loser type of characters. I am sure he can do better.Pass.",Vacation
115,samgiannn,"The new ""Vacation"" lacks the heart and urgency of the original",4,1 August 2015,"Out of all the reboots and remakes being made today, a reboot of the National Lampoon's Vacation series is one that I would never expect to need a reboot. I love the original Vacation series, even the ill- received Vegas Vacation, and even though I had low expectations for the newest installment in the series, I was looking forward to a new Vacation movie. Boy was this a letdown. This time around, Rusty decides that he is going to take his family to Walley World before it closes forever, and Rusty promises that this time ""will be different"" than the first time he went to Walley World. They set off in their bizarre European car to the amusement park, and the usual Griswold madness ensues. While there are a couple of laughs to be found on this trip to Walley World, the new Vacation is just a raunchier and much more mean-spirited version of the original film, making for a rather awkward and sometimes even unpleasant viewing. A lot of the humor in the first movie was dramatic rather than situational. The jokes would happen while the scene played normally, rather than having scenes that only existed for the punch-line. It more closely resembles Adam Sandler's fun yet disappointing Grown Ups than any of the first Vacation movies. Probably the worst thing about this movie was that, in the first movie, Clark made it seem like Walley World was the greatest place on Earth, so there was a sense of urgency on the trip there, and it made us feel some sympathy for the Griswold's whenever something bad happened to them on the way. In this movie, the destination is never made out to be some spectacular place, which really didn't make me feel like it was that big of a deal when the Griswolds found themselves in a pool of human waste or going white water rafting with a suicidal tour guide. The new Vacation is much more of a misfire than a disaster, since it is a fun movie at times, but you won't find much to like about this movie, even if you're a die-hard fan of the other Vacation films.",Vacation

Footloose was a remake. Aliens and Aliens 2,3,4 etc were not remakes even though they were the same type of movie. They were another part of the story. This is how you pay homage to a great movie without ruining the original. By not recreating the original movie with the same characters you can have a different show. Remember how many people said that Ghostbusters would have been better casting the females in a future Ghostbusters as if they were the daughters of the original characters? It would probably still have been bad but it would have been less bad because it wasn't trying to recreate the original.Sure this movie had some throwbacks to the original but it was not the same movie. They should have called this Vacation 2 to stop people from calling this a remake.Anyway, the movie had it's moments where it was quite funny. It had it's moments where it was kind of gross.

119,botrytis,The second half was actually watchable... kinda,3,28 July 2016,"What can be said about this ... thing?It's not a comedy, people forgot what that is, whoever made this. Is it an actual movie? Someplaces it has structure, and scenes with comprehensive purpose, but ofttimes it's just arbitrary scenes piled up on each other like in many trash Hollywood motion pictures today.It's a typical production based on slapstick ""humour"", in which actually is on the same page with the original '83 one, but definitely with generational difference. The original, of course, as a first entry had to be a movie, with rational storytelling based on action- reaction type of situations, on which this type of humour could easily rely on, because it had satirical quality about everyday people wanting to do everyday things in America in the 80's. Here, actually, is the same situation, and because of that I actually giving points for this movie. It also tries to reflect the ungodly pop-culture society we live in today showing boys mutating into something feminine, people getting simply violent for no reason, kids throwing ""fu**"" for no reason, and of course the all- kinds of social differences between people nowadays. But it also holding these terrible qualities representing the taste movies, or simply people have today: terrible, un-tasteful surface, and nothing or rarely comprehensive structure under that. In other saying: mostly empty.The movie doesn't work as a comedy, because it is not a movie. It's an awkward-fest with actually good cast. The humour didn't work because it had nothing to do with the things I noted above. Any feature that had anything to say to the audience, any-kind of criticism of something was the only thing measurable, problem is, beside this nothing works, it's a mess with sometimes good ideas. However, the second half of the movie could bring up better scenes, by which I actually laughed at or appreciated. The suicidal- heartbroken guy scene, which was actually still poorly written, the violent fighting scene at the end, and most importantly, the evolution of the forging family, a family, which had this weird characterism based on today's social qualities slowly emerged into a classic family with normal attributes, or normal understanding about being a family... or something like that, you know what I want to talk about, it suddenly became the family which was parallel with the old one, they were real people, with real perspectives about social life, the brother-little brother connection got back to normal measurement, the husband and wife found out how to be happy together etc.. So yeah, some layers were actually nice, the problem is, that they were in an ocean of messiness. It's a lazily handled Hollywood flick with no structure.",Vacation

Throwing in a bunch of swear words, animals having sex, and shots of male genitals doesn't necessarily make a movie better. I honestly thought the best scene was the Rafting Scenes and that was all clean. It takes more skill writing a scene like that then some of this other stuff.The movie would have been so much better had it been written as PG-13. The bulk of what was in this movie could have stayed, it would have just been brushed up a little. Nothing would have been lost. There was almost enough here to make a good movie without the dirty stuff.Besides that, I would have liked to see more consistency in the characterization. For example, Rusty was not the same Rusty in the previous movies. Rusty was Clark, but played by someone else. Go back to Vegas Vacation, the previous movie of the franchise Rusty was not even remotely the same character. Same goes for Audrey, it was like they just redid everyone except Clark and Helen. Audrey was more like that dirty cousin (kid of Cousin Eddie) than Audrey.Speaking of Clark and Helen, any real fan of the franchise would have liked to see more than 10 minutes of them, but to a certain extent I understand as Chevy is a different person these days. Still I would have been OK with more.From what I saw here, not sure I am interested in another Vacation movie. It would have to go in the PG-13 direction.",Vacation

The film can get a bit repetitive towards the end as it follows the same formula throughout, but in the the same breath there isn't a single segment within Vacation that isn't simply hilarious.

126,bartonj2410,Nowhere near as funny as it thinks it is...,4,23 August 2015,"I went in to Vacation treating it as a standalone comedy, mainly because I had never seen any of the National Lampoon Vacation movies. Comedy, like any genre, has evolved over the years so this entry in the franchise would surely be different to the one that kickstarted it all in 1983.Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) is a man who lives the simple life with his family; his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate), and children, James (Skyler Gisondo) and Kevin (Steele Stebbins). Every year they take the same vacation to the same cabin and Rusty thinks his family enjoy it as much as him.When he finds out that they don't enjoy it, Rusty decides to take mix things up a bit, taking them on a road trip across country to visit Walley World, the theme park his father was obsessed with taking him to in the original movie.Along the way, things don't go entirely to plan and many misadventures occur.What struck me most about Vacation was just how lazy it was as a comedy. Some people were howling with laughter while others giggled more discretely. Of course, there were moments where I laughed but those moments were all too rare. Funny moments were outweighed horribly by some painstakingly unfunny moments. You know, the moments that make you question why everyone else is laughing and leave you feeling embarrassed for the actors. Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley, who also directed this comedy, simply have to do a much better job with the screenplay of the Spider-Man movie heading our way in 2017.Coming to the performances, Ed Helms is so much better than this. I loved him in the first Hangover movie but he has never really found his feet since then. Here he is reduced to cheap laughs and some of the most unsubtle comedy I've seen in a number of years.Christina Applegate doesn't fair much better in Vacation. A talented comedic actress feels utterly wasted and doesn't really get anything to do except for moan at her husband. The kids are just as bad, Stebbins in particular as Kevin, who just does the same thing the entire movie in bullying his bigger brother, James. The trouble is that not of the Griswold is likable in any way, and this is the family you are supposed to be rooting for.There are some quite funny appearances by the likes of Chris Hemsworth and Charlie Day however, their small participation cannot hide the fact that Vacation really isn't that good a comedy.Finding itself quite far behind the likes of Spy and Trainwreck in terms of quality, Vacation is one of those comedies that will be forgotten in no time at all.

Come on, I have been a big fan of goofy movies, some trash and, OK some language and even people in underwear or no wear but it used to have a point. Bullying between brothers, awkward situations and some make believe dirty used to be put in a context to work and not a free for all or whatever. What happened to movies like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest, Airplane, Ferris Bueller's Day Off or Beverly Hills Cops? Do you really need to get that low to justify comedy? I think the world has become a funny place to be when it comes to humor then. A world where the extreme is justifiable and offensive is the new sarcasm.

Truly the best acting or most realistic feel from the characters came from the ""kids"". At times the adults seemed over stressed in their roles. In all, it was a good laugh. A great movie for a rainy day, a long flight or a kick back and chill moment. The values are pretty wholesome, despite the swearing and sexual innuendo. I love the cameo of Chevy.

Anything against PC is good for me.Anyone that liked the originals will like this, they have nods to a lot that happened in the 1st vacation film, it has Chevy and Beverly in as well which is a plus, and I chuckled and even laughed out loud a few times, which doesn't happen much these days with comedies, as most are so bland and family based.",Vacation

I've read that it's a remake that's trying to stand on it's own well someone better call Life Alert because this comedy has fallen & it'll NEVER get up.. Every scene seemed as if it were filmed in blocks & tapped together to complete the film..

137,RustyShacklefordd,"Not Terrible, But Pretty Mediocre",5,28 July 2015,"After seeing the trailer for this, I went in expecting it to be absolutely awful. To my surprised, it actually wasn't terrible. With that said, it still wasn't very good. The set-up is almost exactly identical to the original Vacation with an adult Rusty wanting to bring his family closer together by taking them on a cross-country Vacation to Walley World. This sequel/remake (whichever you prefer) has a fair amount of heart to it, but is missing the charm and wittiness that made the original a hit. The humor is very hit-and-miss. There are some funny moments. Two or Three scenes in particular actually made me laugh pretty hard. The main problem with a lot of the jokes is that they are either way too predictable or go on for too long. I would say out of all the jokes here, 75% of them you could predict as soon as the set-up started. During the first half, it also felt like they were trying way too hard to be vulgar for the sake of it. The film also doesn't flow together all that great and feels more like a series. of sketchesWhile the original Vacation focused primarily on Clark, this one tries to focus a bit on each member of the family which doesn't quite work as well. Ed Helms is good, but he's no Chevy Chase. Christina Applegate wasn't bad, but her role could have been played by any other actress. The kids were the weakest link with the younger one being one of the most annoying characters I've seen. The supporting cast on the other hand is one of the strongest aspects of the film with many small appearances by well-known actors. One scene involving Charlie Day is one of the funniest scenes in the film. On the other hand, Chevy Chase's appearance felt really forced as he is given almost nothing to work with. Aside from that scene, their are some nice throwbacks to the original film scattered throughout the movie.Overall, while Vacation wasn't the terrible mess I expected it to be, it's still a very mediocre and forgettable comedy that's missing the charm and wit of the original. It has it's moments, but it's a film that's best viewed on a rainy Sunday afternoon when you have nothing better to do.",Vacation
138,VenturousArtist,"""Stay Home.""",1,8 September 2018,"Vacation is a mess. It's an absolute mess. It's a rushed, irritating, and unpleasant mess that shames the Vacation franchise in the worst imaginable way possible. From its lack of coherent humor and storytelling, to its aggravating, bumbling, and disinteresting characters, the movie fails to utilize its potential with lame timing and unenthusiastic directing. Before the movie was over, audiences would immediately regret accepting to join these idiots on their trip to Walley World.The protagonist is an absolute moron and you'll hate him including his stupid family too. Although his wife may have small redeemable qualities, she's however too oblivious to realize just how profoundly stupid everyone among her was. Only their oldest child attempts to question anything but he too isn't saved from being portrayed as a goofy dork. However, the worst offender is their youngest child. The moment this little runt appears on screen it becomes the most hateful experience ever. Audiences would want him dead before he actually commits a crime as with other actual offenses throughout this disaster.Everyone and everything sucks in this movie. They're either annoying, stupid, unnecessary, or unlikable. Nothing goes by unquestioned, nobody receives enough consequences for their stupid behavior, and this was merely an active crime scene for the Vacation franchise. It was a mistake to create this film and this family would be blacklisted nationwide if they actually existed. But that's probably not far from the truth since stupidity doesn't discriminate.Don't take a vacation with these morons. Stay home.",Vacation

While is not a sequel with the original cast for obvious reasons, it's a sequel, and one that tries to have the same appeal of the original, does it succeed?Well i have to say yes, it's a very funny film, not on the same level of the original or some more poignant films like this, but the cast is amazing, they are the biggest stars in this film because they could make everything seem funny with awesome performances.The script is very constant and solid, there's tons of comic scenes, from beginning to end, unlike many comedies, you laugh all the time, and the story while not fresh at all, feels fresh because the actors give it a new feel. There's tons of secondary characters to back the main ones, and they all shine, but the prize has to go to Chris Hemsworth for delivering one of the best characters and scenes of the film, but Charlie Day doesn't stay far behind with hilarious work. Each scene no matter how over-the-top it's hilarious, and is unforgettable, thats what makes this film so good, it just stays with you because you will later remember how funny that scene was. Then there's the original cast appearance and is very nostalgic, if a sequel was possible, it would be so funny to see a vacation with parents and the grown up kids all together in an epic film. But audiences didn't support this one, so thats all but a dream.

145,nick-sultana,Griswold Comedy For A New Generation,9,23 August 2015,"National Lampoon's Vacation is a comedy classic that still stands as popular with audiences and comedy fans alike, screenwriters Jonathan Goldstein & John Francis Daley (who have writing credits for Horrible Bosses) attempt to bring the franchise back to a new generation for this 5th installment (both considered a sequel or even a reboot) and the results are hilarious, fun and really a great nod to its classic forefather.Vacation is set around Clark's young son Rusty (played by the always funny Ed Helms from The Hangover films and The Office) who is all grown up and is raising a family of his own with his wife Debbie (Christina Applegate), and sons; the shy and anxious older son, James (Skyler Gisondo), and the cruel and mean-spirited younger son, Kevin (Steele Stebbins). Seeing how his family life is apart and aching for a real family connection (especially when hearing about their family's friends holiday to Paris), Rusty decides to ditch the holiday cabin trip and take his family to the same place that his father took him (Walley World) and re-take the road trip to make the most with his family. But in tradition in the Griswold family, chaos and utter hilarity are ensured.What makes Vacation a worthy follow-up to the classic is the blend of today's crude humour with the comedic style from the original. This results in the film being cruder, much cruder than the original but then again most comedies today are just that but it ticks the right boxes for what can make the fans and audience laugh out loud. From jokes about foreign cars, sex, collage fraternities, loveless marriage and such, it suits the road trip comedy well and makes it seem worthy as its original.Not only do the original leading characters appear (we see Clark and Ellen in an older state and Audrey all grown up like Rusty) but we get the key elements from the original that made it recognizable; such as the film's original title theme song 'Holiday Road' by Lindsey Buckingham (which as well gets a cover version by country rock band Zac Brown Band in the end credits) and notably the metaphor joke that makes the reboot/sequel stand on its own and being slightly different from the original 'vacation'.The cast here pretty much nail their roles with what looks like to been a fun film to make; Ed Helms as Rusty Griswold seems like perfect casting as his comedic side always proves to be a hit on screen, Applegate having her great quality talent as seen in both Anchorman films and Hall Pass and notably Chris Hemsworth playing as Audrey's husband who shows not only his funny side but a hilarious moment involving a certain part of the male anatomy. Seeing good'ol Chevy Chase (who is much older now but funny to this day) brings the film to a nostalgic point, he doesn't rely on the present style of comedy but uses his trademark quip that makes him funny.OVERALL: Vacation may seem at first that comedies will never be original or like its processors that made them classics, but it does have a strong attempt to be fun, hilarious and introduce a new generation of comedy lovers that the age old franchise can still kick it. Just hope there's a sequel in future if the filmmakers consider it.",Vacation

This reboot/sequel pays homage to the original 1983 National Lampoon's Vacation film in hilarious ways; the story is fun and it falls in line with the last 4 films.The cast is great, Ed Helms plays Rusty Griswold similar to the way Chevy Chase played Clark Griswold, which makes you believe he could be his son. Christina Applegate is a good counter balance to Ed Helms; Skyler Gisondo and Steele Stebbins hold their own as the Rusty's sons but as funny as they are, I never believed they were a real family, although it didn't take away from the film. One thing I loved was all the funny and awesome cameos including Chris Hemsworth, Leslie Mann, Charlie Day, Ron Livingston, Keegan-Michael Key and my favorite cameo I don't want to give away. One awesome way to keep this film connected to the original is that they brought in Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo to reprise their roles.From start to finish this movie picks up and goes and it will keep you laughing hard the whole time. The story is a classic but updated family road trip film . . . just like the original. The only thing I'd like to have seen was a cameo from Randy Quaid.As a fan of the original films I wasn't looking forward to this one until I saw the trailer. I'm so happy they did this franchise justice.

149,hugosoup,A litmus test for bad taste,1,8 June 2018,"I can definitely say that this is easily one of the worst films I ever seen and I'm pretty forgiving to movies. However, this was different, I couldn't even watch the whole movie it was so freaking bad, it is so mean-spirited and painfully unfunny that it's unwatchable. The family is incredibly unlikable and the attempts at humor are excruciatingly painful. Only watch this film if you want to see an absolute trainwreck that fails on every level.

Let's get back to decency and respect. That the parents spoke this way in front of their kids (and obviously in front of the kids who will come to see this movie) is reprehensible. More and more, we're expected to tolerate this lack of decency wherever we go and that's not right. We need to be teaching young people that we do not tolerate this and decent people leave wherever this is going on and make a public rejection of the behavior. The movie was funny and touching and the language did not make it more funny. We need to expect more from movie makers and stand up for the right thing as we raise our children.",Vacation
151,kevin-38242,"Yes, swimming in faeces _is_ funny. It just is.",8,25 January 2016,"One of the negative reviewers of this film made this comment: ""...swimming in feces is supposed to be funny?"" Well, if the idea of a whole family finding itself inadvertently up to their shoulders in radioactive poo doesn't tickle your funny bone, you aren't going to enjoy this movie.It's certainly possible to play a scene like that in a way that isn't amusing; what makes it work here is that we have a situation that is on the one hand utterly absurd, yet at the same time horribly believable. I've been on family holidays and done things that are no more ridiculous than the escapades of the Grisworlds; in fact, every time Rusty did something stupid, the rest of my family looked at me in a sly, knowing way. This is precisely the reaction they gave me in all the other Vacation movies.No, the real humour in this movie doesn't come from swimming in crap, or any of that other slapstick stuff -- at least not entirely: it comes from the latent silliness in family life. In particular, it comes from the utterly unrealistic expectations that we all have of our parents and our children, and what happens if we are daft enough to let those expectations direct our actions. When I was much younger I loved the Vacation movies because I thought they were sending up my parents. When I was older, I thought they were sending up my children. Now, of course, I understand that they were doing both these things at the same time.Yes, it's mucky -- uncomfortably so in places. But, really, it's no worse than the originals. Have you seen them lately? Neither the references to sex, nor the foul language, are any more shocking than the originals, and they all look pretty tame alongside ""Ted,"" for example. But this is much funnier than Ted. I started laughing in the first minute, and I didn't stop until the closing credits. At times I laughed so hard I thought I would swallow my own eyeballs.The only thing that stops me giving this film ten out of ten is that there isn't enough Chevy Chase in it.",Vacation
152,thefensk,The Uncredited Star of the Movie ...,5,5 December 2017,"Okay, a remake is almost always going to pale in comparison to the original and this remake is no different. However, the filmmakers created an unofficial star with the vehicle. The Family Truckster of the original was funny, but only as a prop, but the erstwhile Tartan Prancer from Albania is the most awesome piece of fictional automotive film history I've ever seen. It IS the star of the film, hands down. If you are wavering on watching this film, watch it once just for this mini-van, I implore you. I gotta get me that GPS. Many individual scenes of the movie are not bad, mind you and Ed Helms and Christina Applegate were well-cast. But overall, the movie didn't work.

Otherwise, the cast was pretty decent overall, but nothing to rave about. I feel they got a bit lazy in terms of really finding interesting comedic actors and crafting hilarious memorable characters. I think that is part of what will separate this from truly great comedies like the original. The jokes were funny, but the characters were forgettable. Even when they had potential to be memorable, like with the truck driver at the end, instead it's just your average dude.I will also say that there is a bit of inconsistency in the characters. Like the writers didn't really take the time to figure out who their characters were, but instead were focused on writing stupid jokes. For example, the dad knows what a glory hole is, but has never heard the term rim job?So I don't think this movie will be remembered as anything remarkable, but its still a great way to pass some time if you want to watch a dumb but very funny comedy.",Vacation

158,ghostjunk,What Couldn't Have Gone Wrong?,4,21 December 2015,"In hopes of bringing his family closer together, Rusty Griswold attempts to recreate his own childhood cross-country vacation by bringing them all to Walley World! As you can expect, nothing goes according to plan for this amusingly dysfunctional family.Vacation definitely had its moments and was smart enough to be very transparent in its self-awareness towards being an unnecessary sequel but was that really enough? Well... I have to agree with the bulk of the critics for a change when I say that this flick was nothing short of a let down. I felt like they tried a little too hard to catch us off guard with their politically incorrect humor and while some of it was effective, most of it felt almost too mean-spirited to enjoy. The film undeniably featured some pretty hilarious cameos, including the legendary Chevy Chase himself who treats us with some flawless slapstick involving an acoustic guitar. But when the side characters generate bigger laughs than the main cast does, it's not a good sign. Maybe the directors didn't have their GPS coordinates set properly because they definitely brought this Griswold family off course into mediocrity. I have to hand it to Christina Applegate for going all out with her character no matter how embarrassing her big college campus scene may have been. You can tell everyone really tried to give it their all, but as I previously mentioned, sometimes they just tried a little too hard.Regardless, fans of the original films will be pleased to see the short but fun reunion of Clark and Ellen Griswold for the first time in 17 years, and I'm sure people will get a kick out of Charlie Day's cameo. This It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia comedian isn't on screen for long, but his side-roll as the crazy white water rafting instructor was hilariously priceless! Furthermore, I couldn't resist bopping my head to the classic '70s Holiday Road song that pleasantly supports the clever slide show opening sequence. Unfortunately, my enthusiasm towards the rest of the film isn't so consistent. Sure Chris Hemsworth was surprisingly funny, and the Griswold's infamous 2015 Tartan Prancer, which is actually a fake car created for the movie, proved to be a great impractical highlight, but I can't really think of anything else worth mentioning.Vacation might be leaps and bounds better than comedies like that abomination Date Movie, that came from 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie, but that's far from a compliment. One could say some of their jokes are comparable in style, feeling both forced and like a failed attempt to shock, which equally falls flat from the lack of substance or justifiable payoff. Unfortunately, the highly anticipated Dumb & Dumber To suffered similar problems with its inability to persuade the audience in feeling any form of sympathy for its characters. A little sad considering both the original Dumber & Dumber and Vacation films managed to do the complete opposite with the added bonus of leaving the audience in stitches from their gut-busting humor. Thankfully, at least a few modern flicks like Horrible Bosses and The Heat are around to remind us that great comedy isn't completely dead. I just hope to God they don't attempt to give us another Christmas Vacation or, wait a minute? They already did, didn't they? Aw Humbug! With no memorable lines, grosser gags that your most juvenile Adam Sandler flick and an old Clark Griswold reminding us just what we're missing from the classics, Vacation feels more like a forgettable visit to an annoying relative's house for the weekend. Sure, you may find yourself laughing from time to time, but there won't be any sunsets or piña coladas on this lackluster trip. But hey, at least the slideshows were nice?",Vacation

HORRIBLE ACTING!! HORRIBLE EDITING! HORRIBLE FAKE CGI! Everything from the opening ""plane"" looks fake, like a cartoon, and it plays like a bad Naked Gun rip-off instead of a road trip comedy. Ed Helms can't act and neither can any of the supporting cast including the kids, except for Christina Applegate. I also find it hard to watch Helms as his fake-looking, too-perfect capped teeth are nearly blinding (it's like watching Friends where Ross whitened his teeth!).Then there is the over-the-top, completely out of context use of profanity for no reason other than to get an R-rating. I'm the last one to care about profanity in a movie (and I don't have kids), but the parents and kids walk saying ""F"" this and that like it's nothing. In the first 5 minutes there was so much cursing it was ridiculous. No parents talk this way around their kids, or would allow their kids to talk like that! So unrealistic and jarring. It's so out of context and pointless. Horrible screenplay/writing. Trying to ""shock"" you with profanity from the mouths of babes to get a laugh because nothing else is funny.There is nothing worse than when a director/editor can't even keep an actor on screen to finish 1 sentence of dialog (because he's so bad) that he has to constantly switch cameras. Am I really the only person bothered by this? It's so distracting and unnatural. An obvious chop-shop editing job attempt to cover up bad takes and poorly written/delivered lines.

172,DigitalShark1,Terrible,1,29 January 2016,"""Vacation"" is a movie that is a movie that is so bad, I cringe when I see the poster. I hate every moment, character and joke that's in this movie.I understand the original ""Vacation"" movies had gross-out humor, but it wasn't to THIS level and it wasn't THIS desperate. There is no build-up of these jokes, no technique! It's the equivalent of a 10 year old who just learned what sex is, and now makes painfully unfunny jokes. I'm not kidding, there are scenes in this movie where Ed Helms wipes off blood with a ball of 30 people's pubes. They spend a minute on Christina Applegate throwing up. Is it funny because she's throwing up? I don't get it. Swimming in Feces? Conservative Chris Hemsworth's fake penis? Cow guts? Pretty funny, huh? NO IT'S NOT, IT'S TERRIBLE!Now I know what your thinking. ""South Park"" has a lot of gross-out humor too. Why is something like ""South Park"" so funny, yet ""Vacation"" isn't? Because gross-out humor isn't the problem. ""South Park"" jokes, gross-out or not,come from satire and build-up. You would never see a joke on South Park where something is gross and disgusting just for the sake of being gross and disgusting. I guess I should talk about the story now, so here it is: Rusty Griswold tries to take his bland wife and annoying children to ""Walley World"" and shenanigans happen. The End.

Christina Applegate is always great and the actors that play their kids are so funny. It's not a remake, and it's not family friendly (there's cussing, adult content and a tiny bit of nudity) but those are two things that just make it even better IMHO. The writers and actors just did a great job making it funny and giving it a solid storyline. It also has great cameos and some great call backs to the original. All around, it's amazing and deserves better reviews. People just love to over criticize reboots or new installments of movies from the 80's. That's what's going on here.

In fact, ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" is one of my favorite Christmas movies. And this movie did not disappoint me.This movie was really funny. It was classic Vacation humor and conflict. The movie still reminded you of the Vacation that came out many years ago. The jokes were funny and you laughed quite a bit. And the trouble and all the stuff that went wrong just reminded you even more of the original Vacation films. This movie was very raunchy and it was also rated R unlike the other Vacation films which made the movie even funnier with the inappropriate sexual humor and the coarse language.The cameos were awesome in this film. Chevy Chase, Charlie Day, Norman Reedus, Keegan-Michael Key, and Michael Pena were all very funny (especially Day) and were great cameos to have in the film.Besides the cameos, the film had some good acting too. Ed Helms, Christina Applegate, Skyler Gisondo, and Chris Hemsworth all did great and were funny. But the actor who stole the show was Steele Stebbins. He was hilarious and I laughed at nearly everything he said. He was a great and hysterical child actor and I hope to see him in more films to come.I loved in this film how they gave you little flashbacks of the past Vacation movies because it gave you a good feeling of when you were watching the originals and how much you laughed. It was a great addition to the movie and made the film have that touch of the past that everyone loves.If you love raunchy and dirty humor and you loved the original Vacation movies, then you will love and enjoy this comedy film.",Vacation

The 10 year old boy swore more in the 2 hours of the movie than I do in a week and I don't consider myself a pristine person. I don't think there was a more than 3 minute stretch in the movie that went with out f this or s that. I am not even going to count minor offensive words. Anyway, for whatever reason the makers of this movie thought if they just string enough rudeness together, it will be funny. It wasn't.

I'm a sucker for gutter humor and I'm not easily offended but this was just creepy. It wasn't even easy potty humor. It was just weird. I'm shocked so many people think this is funny.

I'm saying if you don't think these type of things are funny, don't watch this- you won't like this movie; but if you do (obviously people do) then you probably will like this movie.I'm also a sucker for remakes, especially homages to a genre, but this falls flat. It doesn't have the same -I don't know- the same... je ne sais quoi? feel as the Chevy Chase classics. It also doesn't have the originality to stand on its own.

183,Cinobite17,"Standard, Sexualised, Excessive Swearing and Misses the Mark",5,25 October 2015,"As a big fan of the originals, I just wanted to briefly air my thoughts on this film. We've had remakes, re-imaginings and reboots and now Vacation (2015) joins the growing number of, what I will call, re-sequels. Like The Thing (2011), Vacation is a purported sequel to the original films but is, in essence, a remake.This film isn't horrendous, but it is standard. There's nothing special about it. In my opinion, Skyler Gisondo, who plays James, the eldest son, steals the show. His likable and laughable, doesn't try too hard and isn't some young Zac Effron, and that really helps his character and the film as a whole. Ed Helms is Ed Helms, exactly 30 minutes in, he's singing again, rit dit dit di doo!, and again at the 45 minutes mark. I have yet to see an appearance by Helms where he doesn't feel the need to sing.I'm not going to outline the plot because that's pointless. There are quite a few chuckle moments but everything is over sexualised and there is an excessive amounts of the word f--k, mostly by the 12(?) year old younger child. I'm no prude, but it was overdone and really not a requirement.The comedic elements also come from too many characters. The originals worked based on the naivety, and subsequent results of, Chevy Chase's Clarke Griswold as he went about a normal world carrying his abnormal and positively charming ideologies. In Vacation (2015) every character is a comedian, every character has some kind ""zaney"" scene whether it's a rafting instructor or a passing trucker. This takes the focus away from the Griswolds and turns the film into more of a sketch show than a story about family unity.I didn't hate it, but it was run of the mill and felt forced with an over reliance on sexuality and profanity. You'd be better off watching something like We're The Millers (2013) which is funny, natural and, above all, keeps it's focus on the story of family unity.",Vacation

The movie stars Ed Helms as as Rusty, Chrstina Applegate as Debbie ( Rusty's wife ) , Chevy Chase as Clark, Steele Stebbins as Kevin and Chris Hemsworth as Stone. Ed Helms' acting was good. His acting,sarcasm, are good. Chrstina Applegate did a very good job in portraying as Debbie. From the beginning, she managed to keep everyone laughing. And the brothers in the film ( Chevy and Steele ) , are epic. They constantly fight with each for no apparent reason and love irritating each other. Chris Hemsworth's character was amazing.

192,Daman-Malone,"Clearly there is a market for this ""type"" of movie.",2,18 June 2018,"This movie in my own opinion completely missed a perfect opportunity to bring out a new franchise of some future features. But this movie was just bottom of the barrel, pathetic and dumb resorting to an almost humor which a 12 year old would laugh at, a humor not too distant from fart and dick 'n' ball gags. 
I am very fortunate enough like many to love the original Vacations where the humour still stands up to today's standards. 
with the great success of the Hangover Ed Helms played the character well as did Christina Applegate and even the older son, but the younger kid was just over the top and I don't blame him for that, the writing and director take that responsibility. 
The plot was traditional, the 7 minute joke based around the car Rusty had rented was nothing more than a silly filler gag which again for me missed the mark.The CB radio gag, the university stop all seemed ok but again I just feel the writer Jonathan Goldstein as impressive as his resume is just wanted to make a slop movie. 
There didn't seem to be a sense of direction in the film between characters, Rusty is clearly supposed to be the glue, but that kinda just doesn't reflect in the movie. 
I tried hard not to compare to the originals but it's hard when this is supposed to be the ""new"" generations of Griswold's and therefore some kinda of magic from the originals should have rubbed off, but it didn't.

193,DreadfulA,What a freaky movie,3,28 December 2015,"Talk about a let down. I was excited when I first heard about this movie, as I thought it was a reboot. But soon after I started watching I learned the movie was actually a continuation, except over twenty years or so had passed. Probably the funniest moment happened very early in the movie, in the first scene inside an airplane. The father Griswold had his typical awkward moment with a family of passengers and I thought, this might turn out to be a good comedy. How wrong was I.Sadly, all I witnessed was a series of vulgar jokes, which got tiring and repetitive. There seemed to be something wrong with basically every character in the movie. They all came out as freaks and perverts, but I guess we're all corrupted 21st century children. I usually have a thick skin for a lot of sick stuff filmed nowadays, but one bathroom scene particularly disgusted me.Griswold kids were just plain stupid and annoying as hell. What's with the constant cursing and bad behavior of the youngest kid? Wanted to slap him every time he opened his mouth. And what about the state police at the border? Should shoving a firearm into someone's mouth and sucking it make me laugh? Rusty played by Ed Helms was a typical nerd guy who didn't get laid too often as a teen. He admitted it (3 was his number, and a rule of 3 makes it 1 or even 0 partners). He was clueless and not in a funny way. His wife was the opposite and clearly out of his league, and who wanted to grasp that rubber dong and misbehave.The whole movie was quite awful without any redeeming qualities. I loved the original three movies. Chevy Chase has natural comedy talent that Ed Helms doesn't. Clark got involved in a lot of awkward moments, sometimes with the ladies, yes, but Chevy's interpretation was charming and harmless. Clark didn't feel the urge to shag his wife publicly after seeing some breast. After all, it was an early 80's family movie. How the moral values have changed.Can't believe why Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo took part in this movie. Their roles were just five second cameos. Can't really blame them either. Why should they care about anything except a fat paycheck, since the writers didn't let them do or say anything in the first place. Jokes on you. Avoid.",Vacation

For a remake, that's a great premise; it's just too bad they couldn't come up with a better script. There are a few good jokes, including two or three in the movie's very first minute, but almost nothing in the next 98 that tops those. (One highlight: a set piece involving territorial state troopers at the ""Four Corners"" monument; stick through the closing credits to see how that one comes out.)So, overall, it's cruder and less funny than I had hoped. But I give it a 6/10 anyway, because Ed Helms and Christina Applegate are always likable, the Lindsay Buckingham / ""Holiday Road"" opening credit sequence is terrific on a big screen, and there's a sprinkling of apt (though uneven) reminders of the original ""Vacation,"" including one sequence featuring the original Griswolds, Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo. Most of all, despite enough filthy jokes and language to fill several Wagon Queen Family Trucksters, the movie preserves what I have come to appreciate most about the whole ""Vacation"" series: the well-deserved, sentimental tribute it pays to a great unsung hero, the Middle American Dad -- a man on a mission, bound and determined to make sure the whole family has a good time whether they like it or not.",Vacation

Of course the movie wasn't anywhere near as good as the original, but it still wasn't that bad! I just wish that they would have toned down the raunchiness a little bit because none of the original ""Vacation"" movies were so profane and unsanitary! I also hoped that Chevy Chase and Beverly D'angelo would have had bigger parts in this movie. They're only in it for maybe five minutes! Other than that, the film was pretty good! It had a decent story structure, the character development was great, and it was hilarious from start to finish! I would give this movie a chance for those of you who haven't seen it!",Vacation

209,walzer-94804,Forgettable,3,11 December 2020,I was highly disappointed by this movie. About the only thing I recall from it five years after seeing it was how stupid it was that the writers made the younger son so coarse and cursing thinking it would make people laugh. I remember people at the theater even commenting on how lame it was that the only thing the younger son did was curse. The older son wasn't a bad actor though. Too bad he wasted his talent here.,Vacation

Look, I get it. Times have changed since the mid-80's but in my circle of friends and acquaintances most of them just don't talk like that. And to be machine-gunned with that (also in the music) and sexual innuendo is just too much to stomach. It's bad enough that Hollyweird has run out of fresh ideas for movies but with their vain attempt to elicit laughter from people with all the shock talk and innuendo just doesn't do the Vacation franchise any justice.Having said that, there were some truly funny parts in the movie and it was cast well. But it just lacked the production creativity and innocence of the characters in the original movie and some of the sequels.

What a disappointment. If you never saw any of the ""real"" vacation movies, this can be considered funny if you laugh at crude and rude, simply to obtain an R rating when this is otherwise a PG-13 level movie. The language has no excuse except for raising to an R rating. The comedy in many cases would be funny if not anticipated and far below the expectations of a ""Vacation"" movie. If you watch this at home, it is very likely that you won't watch it to the very end - there are no redeeming qualities. Chevy Chase and Beverly make their necessary appearance, but should be ashamed of being associated with this movie that has no connection with the real Vacation movies other than several people that happen to be in it.

214,littleangelik,Pure Rubbish...Big Disappointment.,1,23 November 2015,"I loved the original Vacation movies, so I'm disappointed that I have to write a dismal review, but I feel it must be done.First off, the so called ""humor"" is horrible, juvenile, and disgusting. This movie puts regular ""bathroom jokes"" and the grotesque to shame. Bathing in toxic waste, a cannibalistic cow, perverted sex talk (talks about 'rim jobs' and hearing about how Christina Applegate's character slept with 30 guys before she married Rusty is just sickening-way to spread VD, woman), and the f-bomb (throughout most of the movie)basically summarize this movie. It's sad how society has come to find such things as humorous and goes to show how low class ""modern"" people are. Yes, I realize that the original movies had swearing, bare-chested women, and some crude jokes, but the new Vacation goes over the top.There is little substance to the plot, save that Rusty's character is trying to be there for his family by taking them on vacation. The plot and acting are simply awful. Even Chevy Chase's acting falls flat and does virtually nothing to redeem the horrible script.For those who hail this as a family movie it is not. The 'R' rating indicates that. This is so NOT appropriate for children. There are much better ways to spend an hour and a half than by watching this monstrosity.",Vacation

Each character brought something very unique and funny, no character was felt redundant. I especially enjoyed the chemistry between the two brothers, who were both great. Chris Hemsworth was a big surprise for me in the film. He showed that he has great comedic chops!After the Chris Hemsworth part, however, the film started to fall apart. It got a little too serious, and the jokes were getting repeated and becoming a bit forced. It just wasn't that funny anymore.

This movie was funny and I really believe it is (so far) the funniest movie of 2015 and one of the best comedies of the year. The people I saw this with were really cracking up. They were laughing out loud so hard you would think their lungs would explode. Let's see what critics are saying and let's find out if it can be considered a true statement:""Borrowing a basic storyline from the film that inspired it but forgetting the charm, wit, and heart, Vacation is yet another nostalgia-driven retread that misses the mark.""The movie had charm, wit and heart. Most of the jokes were very ingenious and I found them to be clever, original and inventive. Of course there was some black humor but the movie also conveyed the message of the importance of family and I really and genuinely think the dialogue delivered by some of the characters was infused with interesting and enlightening wisdom.I don't know what is the meaning of charm, wit and heart to movie critics these days, but this movie did have those elements and it was a very funny movie. I mean, this is no GODFATHER or CITIZEN KANE and you can't definitively take this movie seriously since it is clearly a goofy screwball comedy.On the other hand if you want to see some real bad comedies, take a look at LEONARD PART 6, THE LOVE GURU, THE MASTER OF DISGUISE or everything Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have done lately. VACATION (2015) however, definitively does NOT fall into that category.This movie is ten thousand times better than the horrible FANTASTIC FOUR reboot.",Vacation

I was pleasantly surprised though.
The casting is just spot on. Ed Helms picks up the reins of Rusty flawlessly. Also, Christina Applegate is wonderful as usual. The appearance of Audrey and her husband was just hilarious.
The story throughout is predictable but still fun with some good laugh out loud moments, followed by some cringe moments and gentle nods to the originals. It keeps very much to the Vacation spirit of the older films.
Seeing Chevy Chase and Beverley D'Angelo reprise their roles for those few scenes were just great. It really put the cherry on top of a very good and enjoyable film.",Vacation

This one had a lot of the bad language which might turn away some who enjoyed the original movie.Though it's smutty style was similar to the American Pie series (some of the words in the movie could make Steve Stifler blush), the actors were funny (and the lead actor is known for the crude-rude movies, i.e., the Hangover triad), and there was no ""Cousin Eddie"" in the movie to steal the scenes (this was the second Vacation movie without Eddie...the first was European Vacation, which was a bust).

Here we go: When I heard that they were going to be making a new entry into the Vacation series, a movie series that I adore(Christmas Vacation will forever be a classic), I was a little worried to say the least. The casting of Ed Helms, and Christina Applegate did ease my mind a bit. I love Ed on the office and the various movies that he has been in. Same with Applegate. As I sat down in the theater I prayed that this movie would deliver at least a couple laughs. I was wrong. It delivered a TON of laugh out loud moment.I was truly surprised at how vulgar it was, considering the originals were all in the pg, pg-13 realm. This movie had a bunch of laughs from start to finish. It was also helped along by some great quest stars including, Charlie Day, Leslie Mann, and most surprisingly, Chris Hemsworth. Yes, Thor was in this movie, and he was great. To me, him, and day provided the biggest quest star laughs. Although Chevy and Beverly where in this movie, there screen time was only a couple minutes, and not that funny. The two sons, played by Skyler Gisondo and Steele Stebbins, held their own with multiple laughs with the side plot of older brother versus younger brother.Overall, I would say this this movie definitely held its own against the originals. Although I always think the originals will outshine this movie because of nostalgia, this to in time, will go down as a great entry into the series! Recommendation: See in theaters!",Vacation

The second half of the film marks a change. Stupid things still happen, but they are much less stupid, and they come together with some characters backing them up. And the movie gets somewhat more interesting, and funnier. Unfortunately, it is not that funny. The cast are sympathetic, and Christina Applegate is always great to watch even when she has little to do, but that's about it.This is the third film I have watched written by John Francis Daley, and I have to wonder what the hell.

250,RamseyReviews1,Awkward & Awful. Ed Helms Worst Moment.,3,14 February 2021,"Just not good. They tried so hard to make this movie awkward in a funny way. This movie was just plan awkward. Ed Helms character, Rusty Griswold, doesn't represent the Rusty Griswold from the original National Lampoon Vacation movies what so ever. Makes no sense.I really wanted to like this movie because I loved the originals. I was able to suffer through it but it wasn't easy. The funniest part of the movie was the various vacation photos of real families that they showed in the opening sequence. Straight dumpster fire from there.This movie is a comedy about a family that goes on a cross county road trip from Chicago to Los Angles to visit the infamous "" WallyWorld Amusement Park"". The movie is a remake of the hit 1983 classic, National Lampoon's Vacation with Chevy Chase. In the original movie, Chevy Chase's character Clark Griswold, takes his family on the same vacation that his son, Rusty Griswold (Ed Helms) is now trying to recreate decades later with his own family.Comedy remakes rarely work. This one certainly falls in that category. One of the things I hated most about the movie was the dynamic between Rusty's older son and his younger son. In the movie, the younger brother bullies the older one. It just doesn't work. The younger brother is like 8 and consistently makes fun of his older, bigger, teenage aged brother for being soft. I kept waiting for the older brother to kick his ass. Never really happened. Snot nosed brat deserved a spanking. Like the time Michael Scott spanked his adult cousin. That would have made this movie funnier.In all honesty I did enjoy Rusty's brother in law, played by Chris Hemsworth. Dude is great. And the Korean GPS was pretty good. Liked the 4 corner scene between the 4 cops. In fact, every cameo appearance was way better then watching the main characters. Charlie Day playing a whitewater rafting guide trying to commit suicide is funny.All in all I just think that Ed Helms was never going to be able to make this script work. He's a goofy guy that is great in other comedy's but unfortunately he's not Chevy Chase's Clark Griswold. It's not his fault but when push comes to shove, that is what everyone wanted when watching this movie.If you're a fan of the original Vacation movies I can safely say that you can skip this one and watch reruns of the originals.

So this movie is about family going for vacation to rebound their relationship and forget about family problem. This movie has few good laughs i admit that but we saw this hundred times before, its different in a way of vulgarity and cheesy and creepy lines by Ed Holmes. But it's OK to watch it for loose your brain for 90 minutes and just laugh to stupidity of Hollywood and their so called ""originality"".

256,kelly-johnsonlove,Insulting pedophile jokes,1,19 October 2015,"I don't remember I ever voted a movie 1, because I appreciate every creative effort anyone puts in their product, even if the outcome is not the best sometimes. But since I cannot tolerate jokes on pedophilia or raping or violent matters, I absolutely hated this movie. It was not only one or 2 jokes and references about pedophilia. The movie was FULL of it!! Sometimes you had to read between the lines, other times it was absolutely obvious. If I were a cop I would go right away and check the main creators' houses and computers for pedophile material, because I cannot imagine that a healthy, heterosexual man could ever come up with these kind a jokes. A healthy mind doesn't think about pedophile scenes and actions (or only with horror) and definitely doesn't joke about it or make it look like a natural part of life. As if it was some kind a simple, stupid, everyday stuff we can just have a good laugh at. And I absolutely liked Ed Helms... till yesterday, when I saw him giving his name and talent to this. I don't wanna indicate anything but can't help wondering why he thought this movie is something he has to stand up for.OK, I finish my complaints. There were some good jokes in the movie that lacked pedophile references and it was a professionally well-done, high-budget movie. But unfortunately, nothing can justify the message it wanted to spread subconsciously. All in all, I absolutely hated it.",Vacation

There are several scenes which pay homage to the original Vacation movie which was great to see. Fans of Chevy Chase will be shocked to see how much his appearance has changed, even since his role on Community ended. Ed Helms did an amazing job as a hapless father trying to give his family a great vacation, in the only way a Griswold knows how. Along the way he has to deal with his own family's quirks, his extended family, car trouble, a menacing trucker, and numerous other problems. Christina Applegate was also great as his wife, in the same straight-woman vein as Beverly D'Angelo's portrayal of Ellen in the earlier films. I saw this at a preview before it was released and it was clear from the laughter that the audience thought it was worth their time.

The writer/director team clearly hold the original movies in high regards. This isn't just some stupid pointless Hollywood remake of a beloved classic. You can tell just by watching that they are big fans of the original. Many references throughout. If you haven't seen the original Vacation movies you will surely miss many of the jokes and references. Be warned, this movie is a hard R rating. Definitely not for kids. Many cameos throughout the movie. Charlie Day from It's always sunny in Philadelphia was probably the funniest of them all. His rafting sequence had me rolling on the floor laughing. You will definitely enjoy this is you are a fan of the original Vacation movies. The weakest link was probably Audrey and husband. They definitely did not give Leslie Mann much to work with as she can be very funny when given the right material and Thor was just oddly miscast. An Australian trying to do a very bad Texas accent was just not very funny. They probably could have thrown a dart out of the studio window and hit someone much funnier than Thor.

They all got this warm humor with the excellent Chevy Chase in the leading role. Nowadays ""Christmas Vacation"" is a new tradition on our family Christmas evening. That said...This was by far the worst piece of crap I have ever seen. Bad script, bad humor, bad acting. Just really really bad. I know the movie isn't one that wafts of intelligence, but come on. A three year old kid would have done a better job than this. I know that the old character of Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) wasn't the most intelligent man in the world, but he still got some parts that were recognizable for a normal person. We could see some parts of our own dads in him. All characters in the old movies were built like this. With a story built upon a great portion of humor and some part kind of real situations. This movie is just dumb. Really dumb. I was sitting through the whole movie with my mouth open gasping on how incredibly stupid both the script and the characters were. Yikes. The most annoying person in the whole movie isn't actually the leading role played by Ed Helms, but the small son ""Kevin"" (Steele Stebbins). No adult in the right state of mind would have put up with this kids behavior. It's not even a bit funny. At all. That kid belongs in an institution. I don't think I need to say anything else.

Like the mother who was a party animal but ended up settling for the husband, that is only ever funny when it is funny.

The original movie was released when I was 11 and I clearly recall my anger at being told I wasn't old enough to go see it with my brother (though the real reason was probably that he didn't want me tagging along. :-) ). Anyway, this movie has some really laugh-out-loud moments. It's not sophisticated humor - it's ""in-your-face"" humor that doesn't require a lot of effort which is pretty perfect on a Saturday night after spending the day in the sun at the pool. And, again, how is it this film's fault that parents think any movie featuring a family is appropriate to take their kids to see??? Not smart. If you like silly humor, you'll enjoy this. Movies like Snatched, Office Christmas Party, Game Night - these are not life changing movies but they make you laugh and god knows we need that now more than ever.

I saw this Opening Night and I was very skeptic and worried because I loved the trailers but I've seen other comedies in the past were the trailers were so funny but the movie overall wasn't funny and was so disappointing. The story follows Rusty Griswold as he takes his family on a road-trip vacation to Walley World because he went there when he was a kid with his family and he wants to reconnect with his family and spice things up with his Wife. I thought this was the funniest movie I have seen since The Wedding Ringer, which came out in January of this year. I'm a big Vacation films fan and I was so excited about the son taking over Clark's place and Ed Helms succeeded big time as Rusty Griswold. It was great seeing Christina Applegate in this film as Rusty's wife and as well of course seeing Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return. It was also surprising to see Leslie Mann as Audrey, Rusty's Sister, Chris Hemsworth as her Husband and nice seeing a few surprising people appear. The kids in the movie did a great job but the small kid needed his mouth cleaned out, he used a lot of language in the film. The story was so relate-able and was so much fun to see and watch. This Vacation movie also reminded me as well of the 2013 Hit-Summer road trip comedy ""We're the Millers"" which I also loved. Parents should not bring their Teenagers and their young kids, this is not appropriate for teens under 17 because of the constant language, some nudity and the raunchy/crude sexual humor/situations. There was moments in the film where it was awkward and sorta uncomfortable but it was a good, fun, funny movie. There has been so many bad reviews, complaints for this movie since it's been filming, it's not a remake or a reboot people, it's basically a continuation after ""Vegas Vacation."" There was maybe one or two slow parts in the movie but besides that, I loved this movie. If you want to go see this and have a good, fun time, this is the movie to come to, don't come to this movie very serious and expecting it not to be funny because trust me, it's hilarious.

I haven't laughed like this for a good while, so it does however do its job as a comedy. if you are however looking for a calm comedy that takes itself a little bit serious..... stay away XD It contains offensive jokes, foul language (often from the small ones) over-dramatic scenes with plot twists, scrap that! there is plot twists everywhere, but the movie is for some reason able to keep you entertained as you try to pick up all the popcorn you dropped on the floor after laughing hysterically from a really bad line that just turns even more awkward as the other character replies back. A must watch mess for the ones that needs a good laugh, and bring a friend. It makes the movie 10 time better when a cheap but funny line comes up and both of you can relate XD",Vacation

Oh, this could have been such a great movie! The original Vacation classic, starring Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo and Michael Anthony Hall paved the way for this sequel. What could go wrong with Ed Helms, Christina Applegate, Leslie Mann, Charlie Day, Regina Hall, Keegan-Michael Key and even a guest appearance by Norman Reedus? Well, everything. Rusty, who was a cool, laid back kid 32 years ago is now a huge wimp. He's painful to watch. He's a commercial pilot, but gets dumped on at work, his family don't respect him. He's boring and awkward. His wife, Debbie, is miserable. His oldest son James is awkward, shy, says the wrong things at the wrong time. The youngest one, Kevin, is a potty mouth demon spawn. After dinner with the fun, outgoing neighbors, who've just gotten back from Paris, Rusty, realizes that his family's same yearly cabin vacation is boring and plans a spur of the moment cross country Wally World trip. So the ""adventure"" begins. Only its not an adventure, it's painful to watch with very few laughs. Debbie is a sullen the trip who seems to care less about her husband. James is literally abused physically and verbally by his younger brother and neither parent does anything about it. Rusty has none of the comedy that his father, Clark had 32 years ago. Just awkwardness. The actors who were actually funny, Regina Hall, Keegan-Michael Key, Norman Reedus, Chevy Chase, don't have enough scenes to make this movie watchable. Bottom line, good actors, bad, bad script. Not enough great acting in the world could have saved this waste of time, money and film.",Vacation
301,elizabethnightingalesmith,You can't beat the original vacation.,3,20 December 2015,"To be honest, I myself prefers the old vacation, even though I'm 14 and this movie would probably have 'supposed' to make me like it because it's a newer updated version. I was already shown vacation long ago, the comedy in the original was fresh and slapstick with a side of genius, Chevy chase played a great crazy dad with a loving wife and two head-butting kids which acted fairly well and those actors have done great in their lives. This movie in all honesty was crap, and a embarrassment. Given, there was a few laughs I liked, but this was all based on immaturity and guidelines that the first movie had. Not even a slight difference guys? I mean even Chevy chase and Chris Hemsworth only got about 5-10 minutes of screen time in a 1 hour 30 film. Not good guys.",Vacation

Whilst this is not up there with it I thought it was very funny and entertaining but definetly more an adults film than family film like the originals. The little brother who bullies His brother is hilarious and Ed Helms does a good job of playing the awkward father even if that is more like a portrayal of Clark than Rusty. Of course no one can beat Chevy Chase. Chris Hemsworth is also very funny. Overall I really enjoyed it and am surprised by the 1 stars as seems a bit excessive tbh.,Vacation

Not even the nostalgia of the old ""Vacation"" movies could save this atrocity. The script seemed like it was written by spastic 13 year old juvenile delinquents. When the script wasn't obnoxious it was simply just uncreative. The car was so over-the-top that it was eye-roll inducing. The angry Korean voice on the GPS was unoriginal and cliché.

310,david-CD,"Good, but could have been great",6,30 July 2015,"LIGHT SPOILERSIn comedy the main factor is timing. You need a build up, the punchline and then an conclusion.This movie had great potential but due to sloppy writing and bad editing a lot of jokes came short and did not deliver.I watched this movie with my family. My parents and my kid, and none of us mind nudity or swearing, as long as it has some proper use. Be it comedic effect, further character building or an other god reason.In this movie, a lot of the swearing and ""nudity"" was completely gratuitous and at some moments even cringeworthy. For instance the kid. The movie relied too much on the ""foul-mouthed little kid"" cliché and while this can be funny at times, here it at many points it was out of place. The scene with the brother in-law with the big penis could have been hilarious, but I kept waiting for the punchline and it just didn't come. Same with the rafting scene. It was an okay build up but when the joke was supposed to come to its funny part, it basically went the short way and ended the scene.On the other side, this movie also had some hilarious scenes, although most of those were shown at the trailer.It could have been a great movie, as all the actors were casted correctly and it had a good story, but a lot of times the jokes felt forced and cheap.

Its very similar to the old movie where a Family goes on vacation and a lot of funny obstacles on the way to destination. the acting is really good mind you it could get silly in some scenes. Christina use to annoy me when she was younger but I didn't mind her in this movie. Ed Helms was as funny as in Hangover. I really enjoyed this movie and don't understand all the negative reviews. people should have more open mind. the kids in the movie are not known to me but they also did a good job acting. the younger brother is so funny and i couldn't stop laughing at his pranks. watch this movie you won't regret it.,Vacation
312,HipHopHewey,Movie needs some roadside assistance,5,29 July 2015,"Starting off: I've had a couple friends tell me ""well, compared to the original..."" or ""in the first one they..."". I am a fan of the movie ""National Lampoon's: Vacation"", but I don't think it is fair to compare this new movie to the other. This movie is set for a new generation, with different writing, directing, and humor elements, and I will not be comparing it to the original.That being said: I've been waiting all summer for this movie, and seeing this movie opening night, I was pretty disappointed. The cast is pretty well put together. Ed Helms plays the roll of Rusty very well, bringing out his inner dad and husband, trying to spend bonding time with his children and spice things up with his wife. Christina Applegate does a good job as Debbie, and Chevy Chase brings a familiar face to the movie that people will enjoy. Character development wise, you grow to root for the family as they try to make their way to Walley World. However, there are some scenarios and side stories that you wish the writers would have summed up at the end of the film.The problem is with the humor of the movie. Very provocative, and adult rated. There's nothing wrong with that type of humor, but there needs to be some balance. Just dishing out F-bombs when a random encounter happens is not humorous. Also, there's hardly any build up with the humor. While watching, I felt like the joke had no journey to the punch line, and then once the first punch line was out, it was a constant bombardment of more punchlines that just dragged the joke out and killed it. All of the humorous scenes can be viewed in the multitude of trailers. The premise is good, especially since it's a relatable story (everyone's had a crazy vacation). And fans of the original are probably extremely excited to take their (older) children to see what they enjoyed years ago. The half morbid and offset, vulgar jokes, however, leave a bad aftertaste in your mouth, wishing the writers would have taken just a little more time with the film.",Vacation
313,landrykkb,"It's worth checking out,even if only out of curiosity",7,13 September 2015,"I never went to see this movie with the expectation that it was going to top or at least compare to the original,so maybe that's why I wasn't disappointed in it like obviously many others here and in general were.The 1983 Vacation that kick-started this franchise was even better than the sequels that followed,and I'm honestly one of the few people in this world who didn't see the appeal of Christmas Vacation beyond that one scene with Bing Crosby's Hawaiian Christmas song.Anyhow,this was a decent reboot with a now-adult Rusty Griswold with his own family.The crude,adulterated humor and foul language in this one is not so over-the-top in this day and age as it would have been 32 years ago had it been prevalent then.Ed Helms was a great choice for the role of Rusty as was Christina Applegate as his wife Debbie.On top of her obvious risqué humor that we know she conveys so well on screen,she can play the straight woman convincingly enough that you forget for a brief moment that she was ""Kelly Bundy"" on ""Married With Children"" 3 decades prior.While I won't exaggerate by giving this modernization of Vacation 10 stars out of 10,it definitely deserves 7 for sticking with tradition and yet standing out on its own in a Hollywood that's become too formulaic.",Vacation
314,jbrandt3434,This movie proves why sequels can be disasters,1,6 July 2020,Watching this movie is worse than seeing a train wreck. Ed Helms tries far too hard to be funny and the humor is forced.

315,chrisgahanley,Very disappointing continuation of franchise,2,3 January 2016,"Having loved the 1st and 2nd Vacation movies back in the 80's I decided to rent this and I was very disappointed due to the fact that the humor hasn't been updated and most of the jokes belong in the 80's.The story goes that Rusty Griswold who has grown up is taking his own Family on a trip to Wally's world to recapture the feeling of togetherness that he once had.Rusty Griswold is played by Ed Helms who has replaced the original Rusty from the 1st vacation but really here, if you are going for nostalgia then why didn't they use the original actor Anthony Michael Hall ?? Ed plays the character so straight that scenes with him quickly have you reaching for your phone to check the weather. Christina Applegate who plays Ed's wife carries the movie with a believable performance. This brings me back to my comment earlier about the humor not being updated - The 2 kids play basically a jerk and a dumb ass - and they are painful to watch (worse than the 2 kids in the new Jurassic park). The youngest goes off with behavior that makes you scream ""just shut up"" if you were the Mum or Dad.And being not American, I don't find the foreigner jokes to be funny eg: the Albanian made car or the GPS in Korean. Come on ! It's just not funny !!! It just seems stupid and tacky to be having them in the movie.Rent the original",Vacation

I was very disappointed when I finally got to watch them film. I think the funniest parts of the movie where the parts in the trailer. The movie was crude and inappropriate in many areas, as the 10 year old boy constantly using the F word 50 times though out the movie. Before I watched the movie I thought this movie would have me laughing all the way through, but all I could thing was this movie is really lame. The movie played about 5 minutes of inappropriate photos at the start of the film, such as a young boy watching two pigs mating.... At the end of the film they showed a heap of photo/snapshots of the family on their vacation, much like they did at the end of the hangover movies. The whole cinema walked out as they were playing the photos... I gave this movie a 2/10 and I don't recommend wasting your money watching it at the cinemas.",Vacation
317,wlnicolow,Profanity to the Max,3,16 August 2015,"I was really looking forward to the release of this movie. I have enjoyed all the original Vacation movies and thought this was going to carry on with the old Griswold tradition.The prevalent use of four letter words by the adult characters in this movie was bad enough, but the two adolescent boys had very few lines that didn't contain profanity. Children should display a little innocence now and then.The brief scene with Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo was also disappointing. Chevy could not have been pleased with this movie and other than gaining about 150 pounds he no longer has that ""oblivious to everything"" look that made him so lovable.",Vacation
318,harlyrider-08377,Lives up to it's expectations!!!,9,6 August 2015,"From the moment it began and I heard it open to 'Holiday Road' I knew I was in for a great ride! I think there are two types of people that will not like this movie. First, those that see it as a stand alone movie without having seen the original and those who are comparing it too much to the original. You have to go into this movie as a fan of the original Vacation, however you have to realize this isn't a story about Clark Griswold and his family, it's a story about Rusty Griswold and how much he is like his father in how over-the-top caring he is about his family. I think Ed Helms did a much better job than some of the other actors that were considered could have done. As I watched this movie I found myself saying, ""Yup, that's what Clark would do in that moment"", so kudos to Helms. Now, (spoiler alert) you do have to stay seated through the first run of incredibly poor jokes about Rusty being an airline pilot for a low-budget company. This was very tedious and made me wonder what I was in for. Like I said, stay seated! Once you get past this first few minutes the fun begins! The director did an incredible job paying just enough homage to the original to make you respect his ability. You don't get the feeling they are ripping off jokes from the original at all and that's the sign of a great (and rare) sequel. It doesn't rely on old jokes, it respectfully honors the original in ways that you expect and want to see. And yes, when we finally get to see Clark Griswold it is incredible! Chevy's short screen time is definitely worth the wait, he truly is and always will be Clark Griswold with his wacky ways but yet wise words of wisdom for his son. The best part for me (again, spoiler) is when Clark opens the (correct) garage door and you see the pea green wagon-family-truckster. It's almost tear-jerking joy when it happens. So, again, enjoy the homage paid to the original, listen closely and you will pick up on so much like the references to cousin Eddie and even the joke about the first grand canyon visit. The one disappointment I had (last spoiler, I promise) was the girl in the red Ferrari scene. The joke was funny, however it lost a lot of it's translation when they didn't play the song 'Little Boy Sweet' as done in the two previous presentations of this long-running joke. Now beware, it is obvious that the film makers are seeking a new, younger franchise audience so this movie is cruder, ruder and at times can make you literally gag with their brand of humor. It does go over the top in my opinion with the vulgar music lyrics twice during the film which I felt was totally unnecessary, but if you can deal with this you're still going to have a great time! The overall acting was excellent. Christina Applegate is still hot and the two kids that play Rusty's son's are very funny. This movie is even better if you watch the original the night before you see this one!",Vacation

When Ed Helms places his head in the lap of a young boy in the beginning I knew there's something nasty going on in the writer's head. And then it went on and on. Sometimes it was subtle sometimes plain in sight. Talking about dirt roads to ""other entrances"" of the ""springs"" made feel really uncomfortable during watching. And kids talking about the F-thing all the time. Come on, Ed Helms! You can do better in selecting scripts... It's funny to see how blind people are to these problems in sick Hollywood flicks.

320,rocksandgems-82572,Great Movie...Very Funny!,9,14 November 2015,"One of the funniest movies I have seen in a while. I laughed out loud many times. Ed Helm is great in this movie. The Griswold family hire a car to go on Vacation to Wally World theme park. They are driving along the highway in their high tech car and one of the features it has is a CB radio and they talk to a truck driver, The youngest boy asks if the truck driver is a rapist and so they think the truck driver is now after them. When they are trying to get the car to go faster, there are so many buttons on the dash board and they don't know what any of them do, they press one of them and the drivers seat starts turning around, another button makes the back bumper come off then he pulls on the handbrake and rolls the car. They then find a motel to stay in for the night. On the highway the oldest boy sees a pretty girl in the car beside them and falls in love, the younger boy puts a plastic bag over the older boys head and while he's doing that the girl in the car drives away. He ends up seeing the same girl at the motel. They are out sitting beside the pool talking and the boys dad comes along a pretends he doesn't know him, he's trying to help out his son with the girl but ends up talking like a peadophile. I definitely recommend watching this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it!",Vacation

Don't get me wrong, I can handle swearing, but it seemed to me that they threw that in to try and make it funny. But it wasn't. Both my Husband and myself was disappointed.

I was 15 years old when the first Vacation movie(1983) came out and liked it so much that I probably watched it too many times. When you get to know a movie so well over such a long period of time, it would be easy to be cynical about any attempt at a remake. At their core, all the Vacation movies are about how you can never really go back in time and attempts at doing so often lead to disappointment. This movie however, humorously pairs the melancholy of nostalgia with the joy and discovery that comes from the attempt to recapture and share those memories with others. It accepts it's lineage and does an excellent job bringing a very enjoyable string of of movies from then to now.",Vacation

But what it is, is a sequel/remake in a remarkably similar style to the original. The writers and actors really managed to keep the humor as raunchy, off-beat and silly as the original National Lampoon's Vacation.I enjoy all of the actors already, so that part was easy. I loved the modern equivalent to the Wagon Queen Family Truckster, and I laughed out loud several times. You simply can't take it too seriously or overthink it, but you couldn't in the first movie either. If you're really a fan of the first one (and the third one, does anyone like any of the others?)--I mean, like you've seen it half a dozen times or more since it came out--relax, set your brain for a similar vibe and enjoy.If you didn't like the original, you're not going to like this one either.",Vacation

Ed Helms & Christina Applegate are brilliant, as are their sons, and the cameos of Chris Hemsworth and Charlie Day as Sad Chad. Certain scenes actually had me crying with laughter. Also add into this Lindsey Buckingham's classic, driving song and as a package it cannot be beaten. Yes, it's crude, a bit profane, but that just adds into the mix.

I am a big fan of the original and was a bit sceptical when I heard of this reboot. But I shouldn't have worried as they have paid lots of homage to the original. Most comedy movies I see generally have one or two funny moments. This movie has too many to count.

Other than that There was adequate comedy that makes all sorts of viewers of comedies laugh out loud. I highly enjoyed the references as I am also a fan of the previous Vacation films. Although it's clear the movie doesn't have the ""National Lampoon's"" feel, there is still plenty of comedy to go around with just enough awkward to make the movie have some cringe-worthy moments.

Very poor acting if any at all, not even a historic cast member was that off in their original casting.

It felt as if investing in them meant that the movie was making fun of you, as it often does of them.Overall, it lacks the poignancy that set the first film apart.

Where the original Vacation movie spent a lot of time at the stops and mishaps along the way, this one only shows a few stops, none of which was as memorable.

A ten year old dropping 50 f bombs. The Hot Springs scene was to much for me and not believable. So many good scenes and sub stories, it is unfortunate they lost the ability for this to become a classic. I hope this is not what the American public has become and wants. If it is, we have really gone backwards as a society. To bad it had to be an R but this is an R for sure. It would be nice if they would re-release this cleaning up the parts that are way to tasteless and make it a fun family movie for all PG or PG-13. I would love to have a discussion with those that decided the details of this film. I feel they really missed a big opportunity.",Vacation

I was cringing most of this movie as it made me feel as if the laughs were forced and not to mention the thing that stuck with me most, was the horrible cursing son. I understand some people may find that funny, but I find it absolutely unnecessary and not funny at all. Haha, potty mouth kid, hilarious....not really. 
I grew up with the National Lampoon Vacation movies as my families favorite thing to watch together. I will not be showing my future children this movie as it is really not funny and stupid. 
I'd avoid if you are a fan of the originals.",Vacation

I love the originals and grew up watching those films and it's still a tradition to watch Christmas vacation every year on Christmas Day with my family, but this film was hilarious and captures that same type of whacky and crude humor the originals had. Not saying it's the best of the national lampoons vacation films but it's definitely a good and fun film to watch. Highly recommend it.",Vacation

The Director here seems to think that multiple scenes that are not just uncomfortable but are WAY too long are funny. If you think 9 year olds putting plastic bags over people's heads continuously while screaming f@@##ing abuse at all and sundry is funny then see this. If you think ""jokes"" about the disgusting sexual practice of rimming is fit for a family movie then see it. If you think a movie that has many porn references and presents sex as purely lust and never love, see it. It has nothing like the heart and warmth of the original.

This film actually wasn't bad at all. There were some hilarious moments that had me laughing out loud. The older brother played his role excellently. I would have loved it if Clark and Ellen would have had a bigger role in the movie but as a man of nostalgia I appreciate that they were in it at all.I must warn you, the movie is a bit more naughty than the previous ones and perhaps not suitable for small children.

When it comes to comedy the thing you're expecting is being entertained. And this movie really does it. Every 5 minutes you'll have a hard laugh and when they play with the cheap jokes they'll let you know because they're doing it twice like in movies with Leslie Nielsen. When Ed Helms hits the screen you know, it's gonna be fun. And he does a great job. And a road trip movie with a great Christina Applegate like this is always worth to watch. The small details of humor paired with every part of humor you can think of makes this movie really funny. I know you can say you can achieve everything if you lower your expectations but in this case they played with everything. So if you're have any kind of humor, you'll be entertained!",Vacation

The car was freakin' laugh-out-loud hilarious, too, and left you desperately wanting for them to hit more buttons.The only major knock I have against this movie is that Rusty didn't feel quite like Rusty. Ed Helms is awesome, of course, but the old Rusty Griswold we know and love was usually the smartest guy in the room. This new Rusty devolved into his own clueless dad, which made for a lot of good comedy, but just felt a little bit wrong.I'll go see more, if they make them.

348,infinitereckless,One of the most blantely problematic comedies of the last years,1,23 August 2015,"I gave it a three only because there were some simple moments that were indeed funny and did make me laugh. Like anything related to the car (excluding the gps part) or the obstacles run. Otherwise it would be a clear 1. That being said, I want to say I have seen several problematic comedies, actually, most are problematic. But I had never watched one that was so proud of it that they kept repeating cringe worthy jokes every few minutes. To anyone that supports the lgbtqa+ community or even just non cisgender people, do not watch this movie. I had never watched a movie be so offensive about it all. Though there will be one line or two that will make you think they are finding it offensive themselves, they will keep going with the genitals jokes. This is also within the first 10 minutes of the show, do I even have to say I felt like walking out right away? Then the show proceeds to make rape, incest and pedophilia jokes. All things that need to be taken seriously and stop being turned into jokes. If you need prove that Hollywood exploits such awful topics, watch this movie. It's amazing how they take those topics and think ""Oh yes, this sounds like the perfect thing to laugh about."". Then the cherry on top. You see suicidal thoughts and attempts turned into jokes, physical abuse also makes an appearance on a running joke and of course, the racist jokes with the gps changing the languages. Do not support movies like this. Do not let cisgender white people make these things jokes and become even more rich off of it. Enough is enough. If they want to make comedies, they should get educated first and understand that someone's genitalia, language and crimes against children are not jokes.",Vacation

351,gradjordanrandles,'Vacation' is contrived junk,2,8 August 2015,"First off, I walked out of the movie about halfway though. I came back for the end, but I'm just giving you context. That's about 70% of the movie.I thought 'Vacation' was terrible. The characters have no depth. The dad makes no sense. And the annoying little kid in this movie is so foul mouthed you'd have to drink a full gallon of milk to relieve yourself.Let me contrast two pieces of media. South Park, on the one hand, is extremely crude, but its jokes are usually very smart and make you think a little. 'Vacation' on the other hand is crude, but full of toilet humor, dryly acted ""serious moments,"" and ridiculous scenarios that do not even make sense in the film itself. I felt like every joke was a contrived train wreck. The producers simply said, ""Oh look. Let's throw this cheap joke here! That will make the audience laugh."" And it did, but the jokes were so stupid and humiliating, I couldn't stand to be in the room.Don't get me wrong, 'Vacation' is very funny for some people. It is quite hilarious to see a family that doesn't get along with each other trying to get to a place where they don't want to go. You'll be sure to laugh a lot. The movie is fun enough. However, you must be ready for unnecessary cursing. Not for kids. On the other hand, if you are looking for an intelligent comedy or a satire that is meaningful...then you have definitely stumbled upon the wrong movie. The jokes are not meant to be intelligent. They are meant to get laughs. Would make for a good date night.",Vacation

If you need escapism from the daily grind and are not in the mood to over-think anything, this is a good movie for you. It's true; it is crude, much cruder than the original. Most comedies today are just that. The people responsible for this movie were not thinking lets win an Oscar, they were thinking lets make people laugh. According to the theater I was in, it worked. We were all laughing. I wish it had been longer with more situations, but I enjoyed what I saw. I recommend not taking your teen to see it. Let them wait till they're 17, not because they are too young, but as a mom it was really awkward. I will say this about Chevy Chase, he will always be Clark, but keep in mind people age and put on weight. I say so what! The man is funny as hell!

I'm a lampoon fan but I think that the original Vacation was the least funniest of them all with Christmas Vacation being the funniest to me! This movie really did the Vacation movies justice! The whole theater was laughing and any negative reviews on here are probably from religious or conservative people that don't like the really raunchy type of comedy in this latest vacation movie!

Funny that there was an ""older"" couple behind me in the theater, with their teen ""kids/grand-kids"". They were laughing HARD the first few minutes, then the lady says ""this is too much"" and they almost left...but she said ""no, it's funny"". They stayed all the way and we're laughing most of the whole way. BUT it is uncomfortable at times. Still, it was VERY funny.So, I went home and re-watched the original. It was pretty dark, and filthy at times too. Just a little more ""inside joke"" than in your face like the new one. But anyone that says the original was not cutting edge...watch it again.

However, those scenes made sense with the movie and I just rolled with it since the movie never gave me time to think about those stupid scene. Overall, I enjoyed the movie.

The plastic bag over the head is a recurring event. James Griswold's attempt at romance is sweetly innocent with the exception that his father, Rusty's, misinterpretation of a sexual term puts him in an awkward and embarrassing position. Rusty and his wife Debbie's efforts to rekindle the romance in their marriage are also innocent and humorous for the most part.

On the other hand, its much easier to arrange a group movie outing as the chances of everyone watching that is pretty low ;)The ratings for this particular movie are quite bad(reference Rottentomatoes), which is no surprise as most crude comedies are rated so. It wasn't as crude as I expected it to be though.(then again maybe thats because it was moderated in Singapore)To sum it up, we went in with low expectations. But! I could hear the hall filled with laughter through-out the movie! and we came out smiling and discussing about the funny parts as well.

If you do take a mature child to see this movie, I assure you they will hear more offensive things at school every single day of their lives than in this movie, and I live in UTAH! Make no mistake, Vacation is raunchy. But it's hilarious from start to finish and the racy content just adds to the laughs.

But Vaction is just done poorly like when the younger son in the film tries to kill his brother with a plastic bag multiple times in the car. Or when they are in a 'hot spring' that turns out to be toxic waste type materials like human feces , used needles and bodies parts. In which the goes on for five painful minutes. The sexual humor is also atrocious because it's not funny in any way shape or form. Two scenes come to mind when Chris Hemsworth's saying goodnight to the Ed Helms and Christina Applegates characters. He is man spreading his huge prosthetic penis and that's the joke. The other one is when Ed Helms is telling his son about a rim job and by rim job he means kissing on the mouth. Haha isn't that funny he doesn't know what it actually is haha. Kill me. The worst part is that it is a remake/sequel of the classic The National Lampoon's Vacation movies.

But when I heard about the premise and saw that Ed Helms would be in it, I was really hopeful and excited. And then my expectations were really high. And it exceeded them. True, the humor is dark. But Ed Helms is a genius. And the writing and timing in this is so good, my wife and I laughed pretty much the entire time. (To be honest, I have never heard her laugh that hard, and it was so awesome.) Right from the beginning, it is FUNNY. If it helps, I think THE OFFICE is funny, and CADDYSHACK is funny, and the first VACATION is funny, and STRIPES is funny...This movie was way, way better than any comedy I've seen in a long time.

The youngest son, Kevin, will either keep you laughing with his dirty mouth or turn you away. Although I thought it was funny, there comes a point were enough is enough and I wish he would not use so much profanity. The acting of the characters keeps you believing this is anything but a normal family. While the youngest son (Kevin) is consistently bullying his older brother (James), and parents (Rusty and Debbie) are trying to rekindle there romance, this vacation is anything but a vacation. From the crazy mini-van falling apart: to finally arriving to Walley World, this movie does not leave you quiet for long, as it is filled with laughter. If you are expecting something completely different from the original ""vacation"" then you might be disappointed. Although the humor is modern, the story line is very similar.

We also couldn't believe that Kevin putting plastic bags over a person's head (a well-known method of suicide) constitutes humour? Similarly, seeing someone commit suicide and actually seeing their head hit a rock was distinctly unfunny. We could go on but there are just too many examples to pick from. Even the final scenes at WalleyWorld (a real highlight from the original film) couldn't save this one. From now on, we will just watch the DVDs of the originals which were genuinely funny.

371,bebancker,"Mediocre, but a must-see",6,23 February 2016,"Rusty Griswold returns home from his job as a pilot for EconoAir to find his youngest son, Kevin, bullying his uncomfortably awkward older brother, James. Kevin had written, ""James has a vagina"" on his guitar. Later that night, Rusty had the misfortune of overhearing his wife, Debbie, discussing how she hates going on their annual trip to a cabin in Michigan; Rusty decides to change things up in attempt to bring his family closer together. He elects to follow in his dad's footsteps and plan a 2500-mile trip to Walley World in California, a la National Lampoon's Vacation, 1983. Even though Vacation 2015 has essentially the same storyline of the 1983 film, it falls short in both content and connection with its audience.The uncanny similarities between the two films began when Rusty comes home with a gaudy and ridiculous Albanian-made Tartan Prancer. Early in the trip an attractive younger woman driving a red Ferrari passes Rusty; this is the exact situation that Rusty's dad, Clark Griswold, found himself in Vacation 1983. However, instead of seeing her later in the movie as Clark did, she goes head-on with a semi-truck and is presumably dead in an attempt at humor. This is where Vacation 2015 begins to try too hard to be funny in an agonizingly forced manner.Along the way, the Griswold's time and time again find themselves in sticky situations. It begins when Rusty decides to make a surprise detour to the college where Debbie went to school as well as to her sorority house. Unbeknownst to Rusty, his wife is the legendary 'Debbie Does Anything' in the sorority. Debbie quickly realizes after chugging a pitcher of beer and promptly projectile-vomiting in front of a large crowd that she can no longer 'do anything.' This scene is undoubtedly funny, but is lacking the realism of every day life most people can connect to. Ed Helms, who plays Rusty Griswold, fails to fill the shoes of the iconic Chevy Chase playing Clark Griswold in the 1983 film. Helms sense of insecurity is apparent by the way he almost awkwardly speaks and holds himself; this causes him to fall short of the bold and confident Chase. Helms also lacks a connection to the audience, as well as to his on screen wife and kids, which is due to his apprehensive aura. Helms' wife, Debbie, who is played by Christina Applegate doesn't add much to film and definitely lacks chemistry with her husband anyone would find convincing. In my eyes the two characters that really made the movie are their two children; James, played by Skylar Grisondo and Kevin, played by Steele Stebbins. The constant antics between the two are both entertaining and funny. Throughout the movie Kevin constantly bullies his older brother by doing things such as foiling his attempts at seducing a girl he meets, putting a plastic bag over his head, and even throwing a needle at him while swimming in the septic dump they believed to be a hot spring. Stebbins never failed garner laughs; he always had something vulgar and witty to say, which made him a blast to watch.After experiencing some catastrophic trouble with the Prancer, the Griswold's visit Rusty's parents at their home. Rusty's parents, Clark and Ellen Griswold, are played by the original Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo. Chase brings energy and passion through his booming voice and renowned slap-stick, as he did in Vacation 1983. Chase's relationship with D'Angelo also, fortunately, has the same spark it had in the 1983 film. D'Angelo and Chase are so relatable and lovable, it's a bit like seeing old friends for those who have seen the 1983 film; this is the essential element that Vacation 2015 really missed the mark on this time around.Vacation 2015 was full of ridiculous and obscure situations, didn't have the lovable family man, and ultimately didn't live up to the original National Lampoon's Vacation, however, it is still worth seeing. More than likely if you've watched any of the National Lampoon's Vacation films this will be a must-see; not because it is their best film, but because for many it is nostalgic and it will give you a good laugh.",Vacation

373,sarjamlaing,Just don't,1,19 April 2017,"honestly just don't watch this movie. it has the same mean spirit that the original had with absolutely none of the heart or the humor.the cast are all incredibly wooden and by the end you will start to route against them in whatever situation they end up in!this has to be one of the most disappointing movies i have ever seen, it fails at the basic level for a comedy: its not remotely funny.",Vacation
374,ronaldr-01330,not worth the time,1,23 April 2016,"if you enjoy obscene crude movies this is your bag. I had hoped this movie would be a good sequel to the original VACATION that i have watched many times. I am disappointed in Hollywood and its movie makers who seem to stoop to lower levels in comedy writing. This is not for children. I have hoped movie makers read these reviews and understand why they get bad ratings. The language offends me as does the sexual innuendos used by a child. No parent of any normal intelligence would want to raise their child in such a manner as to let them view this film or even act in it. I was able to view the first forty minutes before finally giving up on this. I do not understand the rating system these days that avoids using the term, obscene with prurient interests, that had been used in the past. It seems Hollywood is trying avoid those terms in order to market more obscene material .",Vacation

376,doncronk,Hilarious Fun!,9,16 December 2018,"This isn't a movie for children, obviously since it's rated r, so the idiots saying don't take your kids to see it should be ignored entirely. Things change in the world, movies and television shows aren't going to be the same as they were 30 years ago. Either adapt with the times or stay home and watch something on VHS. It's clearly just a movie so a 10 year old cursing doesn't have to be taken so damn seriously. Ed Helms and Christina Appelgate are great together and I enjoyed their chemistry. They played on a lot of the memorable moments from the originals but also created their own and succeeded in entertaining my friends and I. I always loved the Vacation movies and I still do. This one is definitely a modern take on those movies but like I said it still pays homage to the ones that came before it. If you take movies that seriously then yes don't see it because no one cares if you were offended by a film consisting of fictional characters and events. Otherwise if you're not a snowflake then definitely give this a try!",Vacation

only get's more funny! See It!!!Loved it from the start,it's so crazy,ridicules
and sooo much fun!",Vacation
378,brianger-39263,Simply Brilliant!,10,27 July 2017,"This movie was absolutely hilarious. It wasn't a redo, it did give some nods to the originals but was its own movie on its own. Just a great movie to sit back relax and laugh. For those of you that are slamming it in reviews, you're just straight up trolling, this is one of the best comedies to come out for a while!",Vacation
379,westerenfredrik,In line with the original,9,14 December 2020,The same kind of timing and type or humor as in the original. Have seen it att least 10 times and still laugh as much as the first time.,Vacation
380,memondjonsson,Horrible,1,14 November 2017,"Nothing like the old ones, felt like i was watching American pie or something. They tried to much but unfortunately it just became ridiculous. Sexist, horrible language, bad Jokes and sometimes bad acting made this one the worst i probably ever seen. So sad, could have been a Good one.",Vacation
381,ionianson,"Vile, Unfunny & Hideous",1,20 November 2017,"I loved all the other Vacation movies. They had charm, character and most importantly for a comedy, laughs.This movie 'Vacation', is NOTHING like the others. It's full of filthy unnecessary language, stupid scenarios, and vile, unlikable characters. The youngest son is by far the most obnoxious, unrealistic, unpleasant brat I've seen in any movie. The character is just not funny.No spoilers here, just an opinion that if you liked the previous vacation movies, you're going to be so disappointed in this one. A total let down and a disgrace to the Griswald name.Painful to watch, but I stuck with it to see if it got any better...it didn't.",Vacation
382,jirunkaappleid,I haven't laughed this hard in years :D,10,31 January 2018,The headline speaks for all. I love the Griswold movies and this one was so far the best comedy movie in at least 15 years with so many unpredictable moments. I don't laugh easily as well as i don't get scared easily at all. I loved this movie,Vacation
383,dennis-399,Gut busting moments but gratuitous language kills it,6,30 November 2015,"Vacation 2015 is a very funny movie at times but I was very disappointed in the overuse of vulgar language, especially from the youngest Griswold. It's not cute - it's not funny. I'm nowhere near being labeled a prude, but I think the producers should have toned it down somewhat. Maybe even gone for the PG-13 rating. Even the soundtrack was chock full of f-bombs. I wonder, did the studio just assume they would never get close to the original Vacation movie, so they went all out for the ""B"" movie raunchy genre? They had a great cast (Ed Helms, Christina Applegate were great), a workable script, and some very funny bits lined up. Maybe when this movie hits television and with a little editing it will get to take its place with the others in the franchise.",Vacation
384,egb-35847,Crap!,1,11 September 2018,I tried to like this movie but after 15 mins. I shut it off. No way is this anywhere near as good as the original. Terrible!!,Vacation
385,unitedpain,Seriously Funniest Movie Ever!!!!,10,11 September 2018,"Vacation (2015) is our new favorite movie. We laughed to the point of almost crying the Entire way through. Absolutley loved it. Must watch. The Tartan Prancer was hilarious and Rusty's Character is absolutley amazing in this movie (& any movie I have ever seen him in, love him:) Will be watching this movie over & over for many yrs to come...this is a Classic in our collection now. One of the Funniest movies We have ever seen partly due to the fact that these are real life situations that anyone could find themselves in...especially with my own family...Im not kidding :) From the hilarious Tartan Prancer, The Raft trip, The Hotsprings, & the overnight stay at the sister's house we laughed till we cried...One of the best movies we have ever seen. I am really hoping they make a Vacation 2 with the Same Characters from this one.",Vacation
