0,TheLittleSongbird,"Completely likable and watchable, not without its sentiment, but it is a very pleasant film",8,15 March 2010,"While not Steve Martin's best film or role, he shines in a very likable and watchable comedy film. His Tom Jones impersonation especially is absolutely brilliant. Diane Keaton sparkles as his uncomplaining wife, and Kimberly Williams is sweet and alluring as his daughter Annie(she looked stunning in the wedding dress), while Martin Short gives a wonderfully fluffy turn as the camp wedding organiser. Onto the other elements of the film, while sentimental in places and perhaps a little unoriginal, what lifts it aside from the excellent performances is the beautiful scenery and cinematography, a nice script, assured direction and a pleasant soundtrack. Plus there were enough laughs to satisfy me, going for subtlety rather than wackiness, making it even more pleasant to watch. Overall, engaging and definitely worth watching. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Father of the Bride
1,SnoopyStyle,liked it except for Franck,4,30 August 2015,"George Banks (Steve Martin) has a happy life. He owns a sneaker company and happily married to Nina (Diane Keaton). He's shocked when his 22 year old daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) tells them that she's marrying to Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern) whom she met in Rome. He's picking on everything wrong with the relationship whether it's real or not. Soon the wedding gets too extravagant for George as they hire wedding coordinator Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) and his assistant Howard Weinstein (BD Wong).I really like this movie at the beginning. It has the same feel as Parenthood and this starts off as a kind of continuation. Then Franck shows up and it becomes too ridiculous. The point of this is that George is over-reacting but Franck convinces me that he is not at all. When he's not on the screen, the movie is fun and I can laugh at George. It's also a stereotypical flamboyant wedding coordinator which is bad low brow comedy. I tune out every time he's on screen.",Father of the Bride
2,Hitchcoc,Steve Martin Unchained,6,6 January 2017,"If it wasn't for Steve Martin, this would be an absolute clunker. He is certainly one of our comic geniuses (and could do serious roles if he decided to). In this remake of the Spencer Tracy film, he is obsessed with the idea that he will lose his daughter to some rich jerk. Unfortunately, the ship has sailed and we get to see him at his irrational best. He is outvoted at every turn. Things begin to get really expensive and really outrageous. Now, enter Martin Short as the decorator and wedding planner. His quirky foreign presence really upsets the apple cart. Of course, this is a feel good movie (although I couldn't get over the excesses--I have a real problem with huge, expensive weddings), so I don't think I'm going to spoil anything by saying it's going to work out. There are no mass murders or alien invasions. There are no cancer diagnoses. It's just a sappy sentimental movie and Steve Martin is the star.",Father of the Bride
3,lee_eisenberg,This is what love is all about!,10,24 February 2006,"""Father of the Bride"" was made back in the days when Steve Martin still had a really funny streak (which unfortunately seems to have ended with the ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" movies and the ""Pink Panther"" remake). The plot of course has him as suburban everyman George Banks getting ready for his daughter's wedding, with a series of hilarious mishaps along the way. Some of the scenes just make you die laughing, as you think ""Oh my God! They're really doing that!"" (you'll know these scenes when you see them). A real treat. Also starring Diane Keaton and Martin Short.I wish to assert that 1991 was Steve Martin's best movie year ever. Aside from this, he also starred in ""L.A. Story"" and got a serious role in ""Grand Canyon"". He is a genius, you can't deny that.",Father of the Bride
4,jboothmillard,Father of the Bride,7,22 April 2009,"As far as I can work out, it is after this film that the career of Steve Martin has had very few laughs, which is a shame, he just needs to find the right film. Anyway, this is the remake of the 1950 film, and it sees middle aged father George Banks (Martin) with wife Nina (Diane Keaton) having to prepare the wedding for their 21-year-old daughter Annie Banks (Kimberly Williams-Paisley). They had never met her fiancée Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern), living an upper class with his parents in Bel-Air, but George tries to keep his feelings about wedding preparations and this new man in his daughter's life intact. But it is mainly the thought of never seeing his daughter again that gets to George the most, and it is only after a near cancellation (over a blender) that he understands he has to let go and reunites the happy couple. So the wedding day comes, George walks Annie up the aisle, and the rest of the day he can't even say his final goodbye before they leave for honeymoon, but at least she called him. Also starring Home Alone's Kieran Culkin (Macaulay's brother) as Matty Banks, Martin Short as Franck Eggelhoffer, B.D. Wong as Howard Weinstein, Peter Michael Goetz as John MacKenzie, Kate McGregor-Stewart as Joanna MacKenzie, Carmen Hayward as Grace and April Ortiz as Olivia. Martin does do well, Keaton offers a good support, and Short adds giggles as the foreign wedding organiser, and while there are one or two good gags, it is the mushy bits (which I'm not always up for) that actually do most good. Very good!",Father of the Bride
5,moonspinner55,"It's a feel-good commercial, not a movie...",3,2 July 2006,"1991 remake of the 1950 Spencer Tracy-Elizabeth Taylor sentimental comedy concerns harried family man trying to maintain control while planning his daughter's extravagant, expensive wedding. This story (having been kicked around forever on the stage) is updated in all the worst ways possible, with arms-flailing acting and hammy touches that reek of movie star goodwill gone overboard. Director Charles Shyer isn't a filmmaker (at least not here); he's a purveyor of feel-good sentiments that would fit just perfectly on television, perhaps in a Kodak commercial. Old-fashioned uplift is mixed broadly with slapstick shenanigans for a sticky result. In the lead, Steve Martin works his famous comic neuroses for all their worth, but some subtlety from him this time might've been welcomed. *1/2 from ****",Father of the Bride
6,wes-connors,Martin Short Catches the Bouquet,6,27 August 2011,"Flustered father Steve Martin (as George Banks) is startled when his cute 22-yer-old daughter announces she's engaged to be married, upon returning to San Marino, California from studying abroad in Rome, Italy. Accepting wife Diane Keaton (as Nina) and excited bride Kimberly Williams (as Annie) immediately begin planning an extravagant affair. They hire flamboyant foreign-accented wedding planner Martin Short (as Franck Eggelhoffer). Handsome wavy-haired George Newbern (as Bryan MacKenzie), coincidently nestled in nearby Bel-Air, is the intended husband. Little brother Kieran Culkin adeptly parks cars. A little quaint for the 1990s.****** Father of the Bride (12/20/91) Charles Shyer ~ Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Martin Short",Father of the Bride
7,michaelRokeefe,She'll always be Daddy's girl.,5,28 August 2010,"Charles Shyer directs this remake of the original classic comedy starring Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor. This modernized retake has George Banks(Steve Martin)coming a little unglued upon the announcement of his daughter Annie's(Kimberley Williams)marriage to an independent communications consultant. Groom-to-be Bryan(George Newbern)tries to do everything right to make the best impression; Daddy Banks is just more than sentimental about ""losing"" his daughter, but he completely warps when he finds out what the wedding will end up costing. Trying to not get got up in the wedding planning, George thinks back about the good times he has had with Annie. Diane Keaton plays the mother of the bride. Martin is pretty funny without getting ridiculous. And the bride couldn't be more lovely. Also in the cast: Martin Short, Kieran Culkin, Peter Michael Goetz and Kate McGregor-Stewart.",Father of the Bride
8,studioAT,Steve Martin at his best,6,25 August 2015,"I find Steve Martin's films a bit inconsistent but there is no doubting the talent of the man, and this film highlights those perfectly.There isn't really much plot to talk about really. It's the story of how a father reacts to his daughters upcoming wedding.However what makes this film so special is that it is full of lovely moments and sentimental without becoming cloying.Steve Martin may be the central point for the comedy but credit must also be given to Diane Keaton and Kimberly Williams who do well in their roles. As for Martin Short's role...well, you'll either love it or hate it.Overall a lovely sweet hearted film. I've not seen the sequel as yet but to be honest I think this is one film that could have been left alone.",Father of the Bride
9,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Pretty good Steve Martin comedy,8,7 December 2003,"I re-watched this movie today after seeing it a couple of years ago. I didn't remember half of what happened in the movie, but even the stuff that I remembered amused me again. Steve Martin is his usual self, very funny, great body language...simply great. It's been a while since I've seen such a good, not laugh-out-loud funny, funny comedy. Most of the newer comedies have less realism, less normal subjects and plots, and try too hard to be funny. While this movie definitely has it's share in sentimentality, especially towards the end, pretty much most of the last thirty minutes, but it is still funny, and you don't lose interest in it. A great family comedy, it is pretty much funny for all ages. This is a good movie to sit down with the entire family and watch. Most people will enjoy it, and most people will find at least a few things to laugh at in it, if not Steve Martins nervous father character then maybe Martin Shorts character with the ridiculous accent. There's something for everybody in this one; well, pretty much, anyway. 8/10",Father of the Bride
10,HotToastyRag,A timeless story,7,28 August 2019,"The wonderful thing about Father of the Bride is it's a timeless story. It was true in 1950 when the original movie was made, it was true in 1991 when the remake came out, and it'll probably still be true in 2040 when they do another remake. Weddings are stressful to plan. Children grow up and transfer their loyalty to their new families, and their parents are cast aside as soon as they throw the rice. Fathers have a tough time saying goodbye to their little girls. We hold these truths to be self-evident, which is why both the Spencer Tracy and the Steve Martin versions are favorites in every household.Most of the remake is the same as the original. Kimberly Williams, in her first movie, is the young bride, in love with a nice guy but breaking her dad's heart because she's leaving him for a younger man, which, let's face it, is why fathers have such a hard time saying goodbye to their daughters. Steve Martin has to get over himself and learn to support his daughter, guided by the common sense level-headedness of his wife, Diane Keaton. Really, it depends on what cast you like to know which to start with. Diane has a larger part than her black-and-white counterpart, Joan Bennett, but I've always been a fan of Joan's. Spencer Tracy was always too grumpy for my taste, and Steve gets more opportunities to show off his acting chops. I see upsides in either version, but the original will always be my favorite. There's no comparison to seeing Elizabeth Taylor in her beautiful wedding dress.",Father of the Bride
11,FlashCallahan,He drove too fast....,7,27 December 2013,"George Banks is an ordinary man whose 21 year-old daughter Annie has decided to marry a man she met in Rome, but George can't think of what life would be like without his daughter.His wife tries to make him happy for Annie's sake, but when the wedding takes place at their home and a bizarre wedding planner takes over the ceremony, George must try to handle the fact that people grow up, and move on...Any father with a daughter of a certain age, will take heed with this movie, because its simply so true, and Martin nails it as the titular character.All his worries and quandaries are true and are dealt with in a wonderful way, despite the film being wonderfully hilarious.There are the odd movies that lay on the schmaltz and sugar coat every aspect of the narrative, and you really don't mind them doing it, in fact, you hoped they would do it a little bit more, just to make it that little more heartwarming.The cast are fantastic, Martin in my opinion hasn't been this good since, and the whole film is just nice, funny, and heartwarming.You will want to ring your daughter after seeing this, just to let her know you love her.",Father of the Bride

The preparations for the extravagant wedding provide additional comic moments.'Father of the Bride' is a complete family entertainer. It caters to all ages. Its for everyone.

14,Smells_Like_Cheese,Daddy's Little Girl,7,14 May 2008,"I remember a few years ago seeing Father of the Bride on TV, but of course it's edited and I never finished it, it's sad, I call myself a Steve Martin fan and never finished this movie. It's such a classic in itself and is just a nice family film that's a good watch. So I decided to rent Father of the Bride the other day, I just love this movie. It's one of the rare films that is genuinely good and just means to entertain you, your family and friends as well. Steve Martin makes such a great over protective dad, as much as he drives his daughter crazy in the film, you still gotta love him that he's so protective over his baby girl. Father of the Bride is a great comedy and is a good watch with it's sweet story and lovable characters. Before Meet the Parents, there was Father of the Bride.George has an excellent life: good job, nice home, beautiful wife, and two loving kids, one of which is his daughter who has just come home from Rome getting her masters in architecture and announces she's getting married to a man she met there, Bryan. George is going crazy, loosing his baby girl so fast and now having to deal with not being the main guy in her life that she will go too for help. George has to also deal with the crazy wedding planner, Franck Eggelhoffer, trying to break up his daughter and her fiancée, and Bryan's rich parents.Father of the Bride is a good film and I really recommend it, it's one of those films that you get a few good laughs for and just feel good afterwards. Steve Martin made George such a lovable character, even though he's trying to break up his daughter and her fiancée, you could understand why through his narration and the way he talks, every dad could relate too. Martin Short as Franck Eggelhoffer is a little over done, but still delivers good laughs. Father of the Bride is a just a fun movie that anyone could enjoy, it gives good laughs and might even make you shed a tear.7/10",Father of the Bride

16,cricketbat,This film hits differently when you're a dad,8,23 June 2021,"Father of the Bride hits differently when you're a dad. I was a kid when this movie came out, so I had sympathy for George Banks, but now that I have daughters of my own, I have empathy. Regardless of whether you're a parent or not, this movie is still a lighthearted comedy which comically showcases some of the stresses that can come with wedding planning.",Father of the Bride
17,zkonedog,A Great Family Film,9,12 March 2017,"In today's Hollywood climate, there are very few movies that appeal to an entire family. Children want to see Hannah Montana, teens want Harry Potter and superheroes, while adults want very R-rated drama. Thus, it is refreshing to see a movie that can be classified as a solid family film, which Father of the Bride very much is.While comedic in nature (how could it not be starring Steve Martin?!), this film is also a touching commentary on how families change (for better or worse) when marriages occur. Its blend of hilarious comedy and touching emotions will have you holding your sides one minute and reaching for the Kleenex box the next.The real brilliance of this film, however, comes from the terrific acting. Martin's knack for physical comedy is spot-on as the often-flummoxed ""Dear Old Dad"", while Diane Keaton plays a great ""straight 'man'"" to Martin's wild antics. Even the then-fresh Kimberly Williams (before she became Mrs. Brad Paisley) is able to nail the emotions of a young bride being swept off her feet.Overall, this is a great family film that offers something for everyone. Adults will be touched by the film's message, teens will identify with Williams' character, and even younger children will appreciate the physical comedy. If you are planning a wedding, just finished one, or are part of any sort of family structure whatsoever, you will love this film!",Father of the Bride
18,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Endearing and sweet family comedy,7,7 August 2009,"I suppose if I were anything other than a middle class white American, ""Father of the Bride"" might not have warmed my heart the way it did, but to be fair, family comedies don't any sweeter or more genuine than this story of a father coming to terms with his daughter growing up and moving out.Casting Steve Martin in the role of overreacting and overprotective father George Banks was a fantastic choice. Of all the aging '80s comedy icons to pick from, no one pairs the sentimental with the neurotic and herky-jerky like Martin. The gooey nature of the movie keeps him from going overboard like in ""The Jerk,"" but instead he keeps the movie interesting. Always playing irrational characters, there's the chance he might do something crazy, even if he rarely does, that keeps us entertained.That's helpful, because there's not a whole lot of real conflict going in ""Father of the Bride."" One pivotal point in the film is the bride-to-be Annie (Kimberly Williams) crying that the wedding is off because her fiancée bought her a blender. In an earlier scene, the script entirely avoids a nasty conflict when George ends up in his future in-laws' pool after snooping around their house. He falls in and they cut away to a new scene. Without Martin's help, this movie is about a wedding with your typical father freaking out about paying for it all (when they have a perfectly good amount of money).That's sort of the best and worst part of ""Father of the Bride."" It's so true-to-life, which makes it instantly agreeable but also completely lackluster. Essentially, the more you can relate, the more you will like the film. There are some very simple truths in Martin's narration that sums up what being a father is like (though I can't confirm that from experience)For being overly sentimental, however, ""Father of the Bride"" doesn't drip with sappiness, which is really commendable. It's just sort of honest and genial and easy to relate to. Not many films like it can say it, but this one can.",Father of the Bride

20,FiendishDramaturgy,Some of Steve Martin's best work.,9,5 October 2003,"First, this review is for Father of the Bride 1 AND 2. If run back to back, they run like one beautiful story. This production is great from start to finish. Everything about it is wonderful, including the story, the acting performances and the direction. This is the best example of Martin's versatility as an actor. His comedic style is rather straight with zany insertions to highlight the otherwise serious atmosphere of his performances. He plays a wonderful straight man-turned-comic-turned straight man. This movie is no exception. His performance is comedic, yet startlingly genuine.Martin Short is hilarious and Diane Keaton is just as genuine in her portrayal of Steve Martin's wife as is Martin's. I love this movie. I love its ability to make you commiserate with Martin's character; with how he feels, and what he's going through. This one brings up every emotion in the spectrum, and I love it. It's less about family, and more about life's curves; the every-day things that make us crazy, happy, sad, and ultimately stronger. It's entertaining and at the same time makes you think, consider, ponder the events which have led us to where we are now.Combined, they rate 8.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",Father of the Bride

22,MissSimonetta,Funny and sweet,7,6 July 2014,"The original 1950 Father of the Bride has been on my to-watch list for awhile now, but I caught the 1991 remake on television this morning. It's not a great film, but for a lazy Sunday at home with family, it was an adequate, sweet little film. Steve Martin is great as the stressed out father reluctant to let go of his daughter and the rest of the cast does fine as well.My only criticism is that the film sometimes borders on sappiness. There is a scene before the wedding day where Martin thinks about his daughter growing up and the montage, paired with the sentimental background music, feels a little too saccharine. However, the film never wanders dangerously into this territory and its sweeter moments usually feel genuine and earned.Father of the Bride is not great, but I would not call it cinematic junk food either. It's a cute, gentle comedy that I would recommend for a lazy Sunday or rainy afternoon.",Father of the Bride

Also, I was surprised that Martin Short sported his accent. Kudos to Charles Shyer and everyone involved for a job well done.

""Father of the Bride"" tells the tale, or rather the traumas, of one father-in-law to be and his awkward misadventures in planning (and accepting) his daughter's wedding.Steve Martin fits well into the role of the harassed 'had his day' father who is desperately trying to hang on to his little girl, while Kimberley Williams is an attractive bride-to-be.

26,aidanratesmovies,Underrated classic,10,17 September 2021,"An incredibly charming and heartfelt little comedy- Father of the Bride manages to feel genuine and hilarious all at once thanks largely to Martin's comedic abilities and a well written script. I have little to no complaints about this movie at all. The ending is a bit cheap I have to say, but all in all I did enjoy the film all the way through and was actually tearing up from time to time. What makes Father of the Bride so different from many modern day comedies is that it isn't afraid to get personal and it isn't afraid to show it cares, even despite characters being against that. Martin is absolutely perfect in the leading role, and gives the film the exact kind of energy it needs. The rest of the supporting cast is also rather good, especially the bride herself- Kimberly Williams-Paisley whose father daughter chemistry with Martin feels so natural that it's hard to remember they are not at all related. The film is so incredibly insightful and genuine in its personalization of character that it's hard to not watch the film and see a mirror into your own life. It's a magical comedy unlike no other, and they truly don't make films like this one anymore. In the end, Father of the Bride is among my favorite Steve Martin movies, and manages to get both a smile and tear out of me with every watch.My Rating: 9.5/10.",Father of the Bride
27,RatedVforVinny,A watchable nonsense.,5,1 June 2020,"A remake of a 1950's movie that seemed pretty hard to update. The mawkish material hardly extends the strong cats of Steve Martin and Diane Keaton. Martin an actor of many a fine comedy, just relying here on pulling a host strange faces, whilst Keaton, a star of many Woody Allen classic, just seems to grin a lot. Full of annoying stereotypes but just enough going on to get you through. Laughed only once. Strangely Martin rates it as his second best performance.",Father of the Bride
28,nycritic,Losing the Light of Your Eyes to Adulthood,8,2 December 2006,"Where the 1950 version was as stiff as a piece of wood, the 1991 version is more of a reconfiguration of the initial story than a remake -- even when there are scenes that virtually reconstruct the 1950 movie. Now, while Vincent Minnelli's movie depicted a world no one except those living at that time -- and even then, that's a stretch -- could identify with, Charles Shyer brings those upper-crust sensibilities into a contemporary setting and creates a truly poignant study of a father (Steve Martin) who is about to lose his little girl even though she's already twenty-two and an Architect in her own right and is played by Kimberley Williams. We can relate to the complex emotions he has to go through even when some of the situations he gets involved in are the stuff of perfunctory comedy. However, his narration which opens and closes the movie and his quieter scenes point at a deeper study of a man who is perplexed at what is happening, and who's heart is breaking neatly in two. Another update is having Diane Keaton's character a true person in her own right, and who better than Keaton to play a real woman? After all, she's the one who created and immortalized a performance as Annie Hall, the quintessential New Yorker of the Seventies. Diane Keaton is a perfect balance to the maniacal antics of Steve Martin who has plenty of slapstick opportunities. She imbues her character with a sense of intelligence and practicality Joan Bennett could never bring to her own -- then again, Bennett wasn't an actress known for her warmth, let alone capacity to play a real person. In many ways, Keaton plays her role surprisingly similar to the way Katharine Hepburn did in GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER? in the way she openly embraces her daughters entrance into adulthood.Visually FATHER OF THE BRIDE has a close relation to BETSY'S WEDDING with its warm colors and affluent settings. There are moments in the movie that are so filled with sentimentalism it's a miracle tears wouldn't be shed, and even trivial events -- such as Williams' explosive reaction to a blender she receives from her husband to be, played by the underrated George Newbern -- are rife with realism. This is a comedy that is well aware of the type of story it is telling and is far removed from being an all-out laugh fest. The only moments of extreme comic relief are the ones which introduce and involve Martin Short and B. D. Wong as two bridal consultants from Planet X and while there may be talk that their characters' raging effeminacy only prolongs the stereotypical behavior of homosexual men, I didn't care -- this is comedy first and foremost and neither character was the butt of a joke, but the creator of one.",Father of the Bride
29,dunmore_ego,Bridal Cower.,7,23 July 2011,"A film with charm, grace and laughs, FATHER OF THE BRIDE is a rarity in the pantheon of White American Romantic Comedies (WARC). Firstly, because it's watchable. Secondly, because it is post-comedy Steve Martin and it's still watchable.Remade from the 1950 Spencer Tracy farce of the same name, director Charles Shyer retains that film's original twist on the abominations which would one day be known as Chick Flicks: the film's star is not the focus of the ""romance"" but the outside observer, as love labors on his daughter, as he narrates through the eyes of a doting, frazzled father.Steve Martin is George Banks, the titular Father of the Bride, who plays his part with the aforementioned charm, grace and laughs. Unlike most WARCs, the father of this household is not the least intelligent member of the family; he is not portly, he doesn't wear flannel shirts over white wife-beaters and he doesn't moon over sports programming like it's gospel. George owns his own business, is a loving father and husband, pragmatic, punctual, reliable and knows how to treat women with respect. He seems caught in that timewarp of a generation that was once hip and is losing its ground on the moving goalpost of hipness.The comedy in this lighthearted farce is drawn first from George's unwillingness to accept his daughter as an adult on the pathway to marriage, and then from the wedding planning. This was at a time when Steve Martin was still Steve Martin, on the heels of PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES (1987) and DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS (1988).And Diane Keaton was still a glorious MILF, glowing as George's understanding wife, the mother of his children. (Oooh, I'd like to mother her.) At times, movie stoops to playing Mother Smarter Than Father, and George is incessantly put upon by many of the characters, but the movie redeems itself with George's surfeit of poignancy, that he drivels all over us at regular introspective intervals. Rather than make us vomit, it hits home all the psychological and pragmatic reasons a father holds so tight to his daughter.When daughter Annie (beautiful newcomer Kimberly Williams) announces at the dinner table her intentions to marry a man she met in Rome, all that George sees is his five-year-old girl blathering it. Throughout the film, George makes comments about being ""replaced,"" about not being needed or heeded any more, but it all boils down to feeling like he has lost his daughter's love. And that's another welcome departure from WARCs: we don't feel - and we don't *need* to feel - any chemistry between the two people who are actually getting married! All our hopes rest on the chemistry between the father and daughter.In the final moments, as Annie and her new husband (George Newbern) are leaving the reception, George has reconciled his protective paternal love with his desire for her to feel that same love towards someone else. And we feel his sincerity. If Steve Martin can sell this story to us childless nullifidians, imagine how he's making those fathers in the audience weep like repentant sinners.The usually less-than-funny Martin Short raises his game here to above adequate as the ambiguously-Euro wedding planner Franck (pronounced ""Fronk"") who, along with assistant B.D. Wong, debilitates the English language in his quest to provide the best wedding ever for Annie. (""Ahhh, Mahsta Bonks and Missus Bonks and the lofflay bride!"") The groom's parents were merely devices for some farcical Steve Martin moments with Dobermans and falling into pools.The annoying side of this film is how the father of the bride - George - is treated like a bottomless piggy bank. He is literally extorted by every contractor involved - on the threat that if he doesn't buy what the wife and daughter want for the wedding they will pout a lot. And it must be nice to be so affluent that when obscene monies are changing hands - amounts that would bankrupt most of us for life - your worst reaction is to pull a funny face. And all for the sake of one of the biggest social scams since civilization went civil - a wedding, which is nothing but a glorified party, just with a white dress and a state contract.Maybe it's a sign of the changing times, but remember when George's social standing would have been called middle class? There is no such class in America in 2011; George would now be termed ""upper middle class"" or just upper class.How nice marriage can be when you can afford swans and a $10,000 cake; when everyone is painfully white and has a job that actually pays the bills; in a giant house in suburbia with a picket fence, a picturesque, tree-lined street and a dog trained not to thigh-hump anyone.So now the fathers are all weeping for a totally different reason...",Father of the Bride

31,Hollywood_Yoda,A Remake That is Delightfully Original,9,17 May 2010,"In this 1991 updated remake of 'Father of the Bride', we find Steve Martin as a neurotic, stressed out father, George Banks, learning that his adult daughter is getting married, and it is up to him to make her the happiest bride at the most lavish wedding. Co-starring Kimberly Williams in her breakout role, Diane Keaton in a superb performance as the mother of the bride, and Kieran Culkin as the younger brother, Matty. Martin Short, of course, is the comedic center of the film as Franck, the wedding coordinator, who throughout the movie, is a pest to Steve Martin's character. A highlight of this film is that Steve Martin narrates as well. One of the best wedding movies of the 90's and most likely rejuvenated the wedding movie craze. A wonderful film, and one that should not be missed, 9/10! Also, don't miss Part II!",Father of the Bride
32,stamper,"Pretty good, trust me",7,19 October 2000,"Well this is really a film that you can watch without regretting it, for it is funny, interesting, moving and last but not least because the actors all do their job. Plus in this film you (well I at least) see things like the main character, dad George (Steve Martin). I at first (though not as shocked about the wedding) also thought that the Bryan, who was to be married to George's daughter, was a bit of a nerd and I also believed that the wedding co - ordinator was a fagot f..k. Well my views changed, I got used to the co  ordinator and to Bryan. The thing I liked best about this movie though was the bond between George and his daughter. That whole goodbye thing at the end was really moving (probably because I'm almost that age too, when you start thinking about leaving home). I really thought those moments were sweet and true and it kind of made me regret already that I had to leave home at some point in my life.

33,brookenichole-98054,It's alright,6,29 December 2020,"Father of the Bride is an okay movie. It's neither bad nor good, just right in the middle. The acting is great, the story isn't awful, and the message is nice. Half the time I thought the wedding was way too expensive when it didn't have to be. Steve Martin's character had every right to lose his mind. The girls were not helping at all. I didn't enjoy the narrations, and the part with the blender was completely ridiculous.
I did love Martin Short in this movie. I didn't know what he was saying and it was hilarious.

34,Min111,A wedding is happening,6,16 January 2021,"It's one of many numerous movies I have been watching lately. 'Father of the Bride' is a good movie. I like the name of the movie. The movie is about a woman named Annie Banks who has decided to get married to a man named Bryan. The strange thing is they only knew each other for a few months. She announces the news to her parents, but her dad didn't take the news well. The father's name is George Banks who pretty much has everything a man could want. He pretty much leads the perfect life. He doesn't really want to give his daughter away. There are other characters in the movie such as Bryan's parents. They're wealthy, and they live in a mansion. I like the scene where George and Nina Banks visit Bryan's parents. The scene was funny. George Banks also has a large house. Another character is the wedding coordinator who sounds very funny. George Banks is the main character though. He's the guy who carries the entire movie. A wedding is certainly happening whether the father likes it or not. He really likes his daughter. 'Father of the Bride' is one of Steve Martin's many wonderful movies. He's known for participating in comedy and family movies. The movie wouldn't have worked as well if it was any other man in his shoes.",Father of the Bride

37,Horror-yo,"Does well at being the wholesome, traditional American family comedy (that wouldn't be possible today). Good film",7,29 June 2019,"First of all it should be said the cast was very well put together. Such a comedy that relies on feeling familiar to the audience owes a lot to the faces onscreen. Steve Martin as the cynical sceptic, Diane Keaton as the pragmatic mom , the cute daughter, her strapping young lad husband...perfect fits.Martin Short as Frunk, that was pretty funny. A few good gags along the way and fine dialogue make this hold up. It doesn't try too hard to be emotional, and it does achieve a certain real melancholy fairly well.It's no grand classic but it's a film that definitely stays with you. It's got a little bit of that Home Alone early 90's family comedy charm, a great period for Hollywood films.Yes the premise was obvious from the start, yes you could see the emotional scenes coming from a mile away, yes there's a certain obviousness to the film as a whole but in the end it doesn't come across as totally manufactured and inhumane. If anything it's rather moving with what it represents and the wholesome underlying meaning of it: a stable, constantly regenerating society with minor changes from generation to generation and an intact healthy core at the center of it. It projects the wealth of steady American culture as it was during the early 90's. A film in today's social climate would have to make some sort of political statement and this sort of endearing production would not be possible.",Father of the Bride
38,lagudafuad,Smiles to go around,8,20 December 2012,"All smiles no wrinkles, Father of the Bride 1991 remake of the 1950 movie of the same name, is a movie that touches every area of the heart, making you smile all the way through, as you look forward to giving your own child away.The cast brings warmth, the combination and ploy done by George Banks (Steve Martin) who can arguably be regarded as the cheapest man alive, were all too funny to make you turn away. After seeing this movie at a young age I couldn't wait to get another dose of it again, hunting down the DVD so as to see George, Frank (Martin Short) and Nina (Diane Keaton) plan a perfect wedding to give their beautiful daughter away.My sight for sore eyes in this flick is the beautiful wedding sneakers that George made for his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) just before her wedding. This movie can be said to be the best comedy that Steve Martin pulled, it is all cheers for you and the family.The movie plot is a narration from George Banks to us the viewers about the things that led to his daughter's wedding. George is a successful owner of an athletic shoe company; he hasn't seen his daughter (Annie) for a while since she went to Europe so he eagerly awaits her arrival from Rome. Annie's arrival came with a surprise; she is engaged to be married to a certain Bryan Mackenzie (George Newbern).George who stills see's Annie as his little girl was finding it hard to cope with the fact that his little girl was about to be a woman. To make matters worse he also has to pay for a flamboyant wedding that he did not plan for. George being extremely cheap now starts to think of ways to cut cost, and with the whole wedding plan all going on around him, George was in line for a nervous breakdown.Father of the bride was the breakthrough role for Kimberly Williams, and it was a revival for Keaton who has been having flops after flops for years affecting her relationship with Disney, who didn't want to cast her in this movie in the first place.Father of the bride is both a critical and financial success, it currently holds a 72% approval rating on the aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes and it spawned a sequel Father of The Bride 2 in 1995.Here is a DVD collection that you should buy and keep watching anytime you feel blue.www.lagsreviews.com",Father of the Bride

I've never seen the original 1950s version,although after watching these,I'm certainly going to. In a way this is like Martin's movie,""Parenthood"" but not as serio-comic. It's a perfect vehicle for not just his comedic talents but like so many of his intelligent comedies,it shows he's also a good actor.He's the perfect example of a man who doesn't adapt to change very easily and practically has a nervous breakdown about his ""little girl"" coming home and announcing she met a guy in Rome and is now engaged.He's a gigantic,cheapskate worry-wart about how much his daughter's wedding is going to set him back. Instead of concerning himself with the real issue that this should be the happiest day of her life. In short,he makes her big moment all about him.He does it in great comic fashion,as he gets more and more frustrated and looney until he lands himself in jail for stealing hot dog buns! His wife then sets him straight and he really starts to consider his daughter more.While no father is 100% accepting of their daughter's intended at first,George Banks has nothing but pure suspicion of Bryan at first. He thinks,""There's got to be something wrong with this guy"". Of course there isn't.Martin Short's wedding coordinator not only speaks broken English,it's pretty much torn to shreds funny! : ""Do you lahk this $1200 cahk?"" George: WHAT?!Within all this great comedy is a touching story about the day one's child is grown up and leaves the nest. Done here without a hint of sappiness. The wedding is a spectacular one and the reception is crowded to the point of the house's walls bursting. It's simply a fun little film worth watching,especially helpful for you if your kids are about to get married or leave home.9 out of 10. 1 off for the predictable ""Dad we had a fight & the wedding's off"" scene,sure saw that one coming!",Father of the Bride
43,jakethesnake-42007,Classic 90's comedy,7,7 March 2021,Is Father of the bride an amazing movie no it's not but it's a classic of the early 90's which we don't see these types of movies anymore. The plot is great and it works and the actors are great in there roles. Yes the film does drag at times but it's overall a great 90's film.,Father of the Bride
44,random_avenger,Father of the Bride,5,12 September 2010,"In a remake of the 1950s film of the same name, Steve Martin plays shoe factory manager George Banks whose 22-year daughter Annie (Kimberley Williams) unexpectedly announces her plans of marrying a computer system designer named Bryan (George Newbern) who she only recently met on her trip to Italy. Of course, the new father-in-law gets highly protective of his girl and suspicious about the groom and his wealthy parents (Peter Michael Goetz and Kate McGregor-Stewart). The elaborate and costly wedding arrangements are also a major source of stress for George who must learn cope with the feeling of not being the number one man in his daughter's life anymore.Steve Martin is a decent comedian, so the humour works best when it relies on his screen-persona and puts less emphasis on crazy situations. Luckily, the movie stays pretty down-to-earth for the most part and allows Martin to create the mood with his somewhat realistic performance and verbal jabs that invariably work much better than the more outlandish scenes, such as Martin jumping from a balcony or falling into a swimming pool. However, the characters of Martin Short as the flamboyant wedding planner Franck Eggelhoffer and B.D. Wong as his assistant Howard are so grossly exaggerated that they are much closer to irritating than funny. Since the soon-to-be husband and wife aren't really developed enough to make them very interesting and Diane Keaton plays her part as the mother of the bride with a constant smirky smile that makes her come across as rather unnatural in the role, the movie can essentially be called a one-man show of Steve Martin who fortunately suits the role well.At the end of the day, the appeal of Father of the Bride depends on the charisma of Steve Martin and the perceived touchingness of the theme of letting go of your daughter. Perhaps the serious story can feel moving to those with personal experiences of seeing one's offspring get married, but others, such as myself, may think of it as cheesy and a bit too soft in the end. Still, there are many successful jokes and the tone is suitable for the whole family, so if the premise sounds interesting to you, you may well enjoy the movie more than I did.",Father of the Bride

Of course its predictable, but its meant to be.  martin Short is hilarious as the wedding organiser, and Steve Martin is at his dead pan best.  Kimberly Williams was excellent in her role as the young bride to be, particularly as it was her debut. The story goes along nicely but I must say the wedding seemed like the most expensive and lavish in wedding movie history, particularly seeming George Banks is your normal suburban father- not a multi millionaire.  There are some fairly amusing scenes, but really its a nice movie.  Its the type of movie you watch with your mother, or sister and think if only love, life and family were really that simple.  In other words its escapism, almost like a fantasy...enjoy.",Father of the Bride
46,Benjamin_Cox,A great reminder about how good Steve Martin used to be - 83%,8,12 April 2009,"A mere 15 weeks and 6 days away from my own wedding (not that I'm counting or anything), I felt the urge to view a cinematic wedding in order to allay any fears I currently have about my own. After all, an actual wedding will never be the same as a Hollywood one - for starters, arranging a wedding is rarely a comedic event in real life! But thanks to a genuinely touching script and a brilliant performance from Steve Martin in his heyday, this movie is something of a guilty pleasure for me personally. It may be gentle and inoffensive family viewing but there's nothing wrong with that - this would be the last good film Martin would be in until 1999's ""Bowfinger"" and he hasn't done anything of any quality since. So before he completely wrecks his career with rubbish like the ""Pink Panther"" remakes, take a moment to remember how good he can be at both funny and emotional.In a remake of the 1950 Spencer Tracy original, Martin plays George Banks who is a successful businessman living in LA with his wife Nina (Diane Keaton). When their daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) returns from Europe engaged to well-to-do Bryan McKenzie (George Newbern), George struggles to cope with the news and begins to go off the rails, especially when he feels pushed out by extravagant wedding planner Franck (Martin Short). But as the wedding gets nearer, he begins to realise that his daughter has grown up but letting go is harder than it seems.It's easy for recent movie-goers to discuss Steve Martin after his latest efforts. But here, Martin is brilliant as Banks as he displays heart-breaking affection and comic timing that is nor just effective but the mark of a man at the very height of his powers. By contrast, his ""Three Amigos!"" co-star Short gives it his all as the camper-than-Christmas wedding planner and by any other degree, you'd say he matches Martin all the way. Keaton & Williams provide support for the two comic veterans but what separates this from other wedding-based comedies is the touching, emotional aspect of saying goodbye to your child and relinquishing your responsibilities as a parent and guardian. It's like another great Steve Martin flick ""Planes, Trains And Automobiles"" in that he alternates between splitting your sides and jerking your tears within the same scene and he's the same here. There are moments that don't quite ring true - the scene with the cars parked in the street, for example - but by and large, this is a great comedy that is suitable for the whole family.Hopefully, our wedding will be considerably less chaotic and expensive - if this is Hollywood's idea of a modest wedding then I'd rather get married over here - but when all is said and done, everyone will have a good time and that's how this movie is. It's safe, predictable and about as controversial as a game of cricket and that's fine by me - it doesn't stop it from being something of a hidden gem, albeit a guilty pleasure for viewers like myself. But it's great to watch Martin at his best, before he started to lose his powers completely and appear in dross like the ""Sergeant Bilko"" remake. I can't compare it to the original because I've not seen it but regardless, ""Father Of The Bride"" is a better movie than it has any right to be and for that, it is to be congratulated.",Father of the Bride

54,maxcellus46,A perfect movie...if you have nothing else to do.,3,13 December 2005,"Short and sweet? Steve Martin was great on SLN and that's where his strength is. In the TV comedy sketch format. However, watching him attempt ""funny"" for two and a half hours is more than I can stand. Naturally, bad writing has a lot to do with it to. A performer is only as good as the lines he/she is handed. Personally, I think his talent is wasted on these long winded ""sophistcated"" comedies. He's actually more capable at the one liner and fast paced type situation. This happens to all comedians, historically. In the old days, people like Chaplin and Keaton thought that since they were so funny doing 15 minute shorts, how much more funnier they would be doing an hour long film. In their cases, however, because of their utter greatness, they were much more likely to be able to pull it off, but not all the time. Today's comedians like Martin tend to think the same way, i.e. ""If I'm funny on a sitcom or 2 minute sketch, how much more funnier I'll be with a whole film built around me."" Not true. They should stick to what they do best and leave the ""pathos"" and ""dramatis"" for someone else. Pass on this one. BTW, Watch the original with Spencer Tracey. No comparison.",Father of the Bride
55,advaitkamat,Wonderfully funny and charming.,7,17 May 2013,"I have often thought that Steve Martin always deserved more respect and honor than he has already received, given the fact that he has pulled off both screen writing and acting with unrivaled avidity. And the fact still remains that, if Steve Martin is acting in a film, the film belongs to him all the way. Even if the film is the ruefully boring and a near-disastrous rendition of the 1963 classic ""The Pink Panther"", in which he played the iconic role of Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau. In ""Father Of The Bride"", he once again takes on a role made iconic by Spencer Tracy, though this time he gives it a skin of its own, thus succeeding in transforming a mawkishly-constructed drama into a zingy comedy.George Banks' (Steve Martin) life changes when his daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams) tells him that she has decided to get married to Bryan MacKenzie (George Newbern), a guy she had met in Rome a few months before. Unable to cope up with the idea of living his life without Annie, George finds himself getting increasingly flustered with the preparations for the wedding. His wife Nina (Diane Keaton) finds Annie a wedding coordinator Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short) when she finds out that George isn't quite willing to let Annie get married. The plot focuses on the subsequent wedding and how George embraces the little occasions it brings.Something that struck me before anything else did was how quickly the plot kicked in, not wanting to fool around with the frivolous bits. This, of course, led to the protracted development of a few characters though Martin got enough screen time to imbue his character of George Banks with disarming sincerity and embellish him into a likable and congenial father. Though the story roisters itself through a rather predictable narrative, the funny parts come in little details. And somehow you feel as if they weren't put there to make you laugh because they seem so familiar. That's one way to know how delightful a comedy really is, when it makes you laugh, not because it is funny but because how honest it is. ""Father Of The Bride"" is a commendable addition to that category because it doesn't have to try hard to make you smile. It's a useful little trick and director Charles Shyer sneakily uses it to magnificent effect.One of the many niggles I have with this film is how many insignificant details it cramps in its plot, like the utterly inconsequential scene where George decides to investigate the MacKenzies and finally ends up in their pool after an overlong, overused cliché of wrecking a perfectly set-up meeting. If it was an an attempt to show George's desperation, it came off as a tawdry plea to evoke laughter. The underwritten character of Nina is a minor flaw which could've easily been rectified, had Shyer let the plot unravel at its own pace. At the end of the first hour, George's anguish at letting Annie go begins to take its toll on your patience, and more than once I had wanted to yell ""Get on with it!"", though I couldn't shake off the feeling that the intention was deliberate. Either way, I found it to be vaguely irksome.Of the performances, Steve Martin turns in a supremely well-balanced performance with his portrayal of George Banks, playing the distressed and hesitantly supportive father with a calm demeanor. Diane Keaton is wonderful in her role as his wife Nina, though a little more writing could have greatly helped her character to be as delightful. Kimberly Williams' lack of confidence in her role as Annie is evident though she maintains a dignified presence throughout.""Father Of The Bride"" is one of those rare comedies that don't age with time. If you can get past it's predictable plot, it's one film that has enough substance to make your day.",Father of the Bride

59,JosiReviews,Miss these movies,10,30 September 2018,"Why can't they bring back this genre of movies? Simple, every day life without super drama. Watching a dad have a meltdown over his daughter's wedding is realistic and Steve Martin's character is so relatable. The super market moment with the hot dog buns is hilarious and so dead on. Nowadays it feels like writers/producers have no idea what is happening in the real world. I have watched countless movies where the characters drive new cars and $500k+ houses and are portrayed as the struggling, all-American family lol even though this family has a stunning house, they still come across grounded and humble.",Father of the Bride
60,TomC-5,fluff and nothing but fluff,5,5 February 2000,"I decided to check this out because I was in the mood for something light and because it stars Steve Martin and Martin Short (and also Eugene Levy in a single, but funny, scene), and while Short was excellent as the flamboyent, thickly accented, wedding co-ordinator, and the interplay between father (Martin) and daughter had perhaps a nice moment or two, in general, I was pretty underwhelmed by this big piece of not very funny fluff; there are some much better, funnier wedding movies, if one is attracted to the subject matter, including BETSEY'S WEDDING, MURIEL'S WEDDING, and TRUE ROMANCE. Even the wedding scene in the great GOODFELLAS was a lot more interesting, and funnier. This, however, is barely worth the price of even a cheap rental.",Father of the Bride

62,jamalhugo,A very Funny movie!,8,6 November 2009,"Steve Martin as usual is very good in almost every movie he makes in my opinion. This movie is very funny. The story is very simple, yet, wonderful. In terms of acting its extremely well done. Sets are are also very good, detailed as well. This is probably one of the best ""wedding"" movies ever, something that made it extremely unique was ""Frank"", the wedding planner. Every scene he is in, I promise you will not be able to keep your laughs in, I myself, laughed, till I could not breathe. This to me is what makes a great comedy. The humor is mostly oral, not much physical humor. I highly recommend watching ""Father of The Bride 2"", it is just as funny, if not, funnier, which is quite strange, usually, the first movie is always funnier. Father of The Bride 2 is more the proper ending for the story, although it seems it ends at the first movie. I recommend this movie to people who enjoy a movie that has a simple, yet unique story, and is very funny. Overall this movie is great, there is no particular highlight, everything is excellent, but yes, Frank stands out!",Father of the Bride

This in itself would have been OK, but a film should have some kind of ""spice"", right? This one doesn't. If you need something to warm your heart, this might just do the trick, but otherwise it's useless. It's supposed to be a comedy but on no occasion does it make you laugh. Also, it lacks anything interesting. Seriously, nothing really interesting happens here, there are no surprises. It's all touchy feely, though I suppose plenty conservatives will appreciate how American and ""proper"" it is.",Father of the Bride

66,wsuleifj,Excellent movie; Steve Martin's best,8,12 January 2000,"This was a very good movie.Steve Martin was truly excellent in this movie, playing the paranoid over-protective father.  He was extremely funny, but also very likeable...you were able to identify with him, and you felt bad for him when he finally had to give up and let go.Kimberly Williams did a nice job as Annie Banks, the Bride in the movie. There wasn't a lot of depth to the character, but she acted it well...the character's shining moments were in interaction with her father.Martin Short was very good as Frank, the wedding coordinator.  He was hilarious, and very funny for Martin's character to play off of.This movie will have you laughing from beginning to end, but it goes far beyond comedy....it also reached into the dramatic genre, mostly in the storyline between the title-featured father and his daughter the bride.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone...it's especially fun if there's a wedding right around the corner in your family.  I give it a 9 out of 10.",Father of the Bride
67,angel-273,I'm starting to get it now...,8,12 June 2001,"Having been in on planning a wedding now, I can appreciate this movie all the more.  Steve Martin as absolutely perfect in the role of George, and I don't have to mention how dead-on his comic timing is.  His facial expressions are sometimes the funniest part of a scene.  Martin Short is hysterical as the eccentric  wedding planner whose accent is so unreal, you wonder how Short ever came up with it!  Short and Martin play off of one another splendidly.I think the most over-looked gem in this movie is the radiant Diane Keaton. She is just wonderful as the loving, level-headed Nina... in fact, I think best scene in the entire movie is with George and Nina after he's been arrested for stealing hot-dog buns.  They have exceptional chemistry, and they play the parents with spunk (which keeps them from sinking into a stereotypical middle-aged ""movie couple"").While Kimberly Williams was just fine in the role of the bride, Annie, I found her character to be spoiled and flat-out irritating at times.  There were moments when just wanted to shake her! I thought maybe Williams could have handled the character's reactions a little differently to have a little variety and give Annie a little bit more depth. However, the scene between Annie and George the night before the wedding is very moving... it ranks on up there with a ""Steel Magnolias"" moment.  Any daughter who has a close relationship with her father cannot help but feel at least a little heart-tug during that scene.One minor problem I had with this movie was that it was difficult for me to feel sorry for the amount of money the wedding was costing George... while they may not have lived in Bel Air, George drives a very nice car, they live in a large and pretty gosh darn nice house...in SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA (anyone who has ever lived there should know why this is significant in terms of income).All in all, it's a great family movie with several comedic moments, a few heart-warming scenes, some classic lines,and the realism to tie it all together.",Father of the Bride
68,inlibrislibertum,Sweet and Funny,9,3 October 2018,"You could find worse ways to spend two hours. This is a light, fun comedy with a good heart at the center. Any parent can relate to George's feelings toward losing his little girl. I don't know why people get so confused about the budget in the film. I see these crazy numbers getting thrown out but the math is right there in the movie. $250 a head. The initial head count is 572. George puts his foot down and insists they keep it to 150 people. That's $37,500. Even if it balloons up to 200 people that's still $50,000. Which is a stupid amount to me but to an upper middle class/lower upper class family in a high COL area, maybe not. Even tacking on costs for new clothes and flights for the Danish relatives. George and Nina both seem to own successful businesses, and George is extremely cheap in most areas. They likely have a healthy savings account. It's not the biggest stretch, especially when it comes to movies.People who want grit, high drama, or ultra realism, or are snobby about remakes may not enjoy. For anyone else who just wants to sit with their family and enjoy a sweet comedy, you probably will.",Father of the Bride
69,pfisher-32275,Father Of The Bride responds to negative reviews,9,18 November 2015,"This gets a 6.4, which I struggle to believe is an accurate representation. As I write this I'm aware that it's 25 years old & most people have seen it by now & also read the reviews, which makes mine somewhat redundant. Never the less, I felt it necessary to defend this picture against some of the more negative reviews. Maybe IMDb need to look at the way the ratings work. I've seen this with Thrillers as well like: Copycat, The Bone Collector & Kiss The Girls. All commercial successes & which almost define the 90 minute crime thriller sub genre, or shall we say, are the bench mark in which others are compared. Yet none one of these surpass a 6.6. I've read all the reviews for this particular movie & the majority of people (approximately 80%) give this a positive rating - between 7-10 out of 10. The rest between 3-5 out of 10.The point I'm making is that the average Joe with a healthy, positive outlook on life will probably enjoy this comedy caper. It's heartfelt & humorous & the photography is wonderful. They may however be put off due to the small amount of embittered & cynical reviews on this page. I get that this is a remake of the Spencer Tracy Elizabeth Taylor classic (big shoes to fill). The original was released in the golden era of Hollywood & it's a wonderful piece of cinema. I get all that, but it's not trying to be the original, nor is it trying to out do or improve on the original. These circumstances are timeless, Daughters will continue to get married & this version simply highlights the subsequent issues & challenges that the current generation face.I also understand that the Banks's are middle class. I grew up comfortably too in a nice suburban neighbourhood. But I was taught to speak & act correctly & I was not spoiled, neither are Matty & Annie. Also like the Bank's, my parents are not elitist & are the furthest thing from snobbery anyone could ever imagine. George & Nina weren't always that comfortable, they worked hard to get to where they are & they want the best for their kids, don't we all? Although the Banks's may be able to afford it; $250,000 for a wedding? like my parents, George & Nina grew up in a different time when that kind of extravagance simply wasn't entertained, so I can understand George's reservations. I'm afraid social standing has no bearing on this whatsoever. It seems clear to me, these negative reviews that touch on the classes & sociology come from those that are unhappy with the hand that they were dealt or just simply Jealous. Jealousy is where most negativity stems from in my humble opinion. How can a movie (& a family for that matter) with such a good heart be attacked like this, if not for those reasonsIMDb is amazing, & as a movie fanatic it has been my go to site for many years. However, I think the IMDb fraternity may need to accept a few things. 1: Take negative reviews with a pinch of salt, you can't please everyone. The world would be pretty dull if we were all the same. 2: Although generally speaking in life a 6 or 6 & a half out of 10 may be considered average; don't pass on them due to a few poor reviews bringing the average mark down. That 6 might end up being one of your most favourite movies of all time.I site one more example. Twins, in my eyes a classic, I am by no means a massive Schwarzenegger or Devito fan, but it's feel good, hysterical in places & the chemistry between the two leads is undeniable. In my 38+ years I have yet to meet a single person that has got a bad word to say about it. Yet this movie has been at times a 5.9.Apologies if this sounds more like a mission statement than a review. Don't get me wrong, I love Jaws, Shawshank, Godfather, Schindler's etc But let's face it, we're not always in the mood. Sometimes we just want something goofy we can laugh at. Just because these comedies are not critically acclaimed Oscar worthy 8's & 9's, doesn't mean to say they don't have an equal footing in our hearts and on our shelves.

Steve Martin and Diane Keaton make brilliant performances as well.I don't think the old one is better, I watched it recently and it is indeed good.

College was already difficult, now you have to study Biochem in Italian and the worst part, depending on your future areas of study you'll probably have to retake those classes since many organizations want to see GRADES earned and not just credits.). But, I digress.She meets some guy, was independent enough to 'accept' a marriage proposal to a man her family has never even heard of. Comes home and shares the amazing news and everyone is expected to be happy. I would say any parent whose initial reaction wasn't along the lines of 'shocked to upset' probably doesn't like their kid too much.Then the expenses started rolling in. $250 a head, 572 guests and a wedding coordinator fluent in gibberish. I was already annoyed about this entire pretext but what really got me was the tantrum the daughter threw when the Dad was trying to cut down the guest list. '...Why don't we just charge people? That way we can make money on the wedding.""At that point, what Steve should have done was given her a check for $10K to contribute to the wedding, Congradulated her on her nuptials once more and walked out.She's an independent woman, she'd figured it out.",Father of the Bride

Father of the Bride is a great comedy and is a good watch with sweet story and lovable characters.

George has to also deal with crazy wedding planner, Franck Eggelhoffer trying to break up his's daughter and her fiancée, and Bryan's rich parentsFather of the Bride is a good film and I really recommend it, it's one of those films that you get a few good laughs for and just feel good afterwards. Steve Martin made George such a lovable character, even though he's trying to break up his daughter and her fiancée, you could understand why through his narration and the way he talk, every dad could relate too.

82,jjomendo,Father of The Bride- Letting Go,10,24 January 2010,"Father of the Bride is a 1991 comedy remade after the 1950 version. The film starring Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, George Newbern, Martin Short, B.D. Wong and Kieran Culkin was directed by Charles Shyer and is number 92 on Bravo's ""100 Funniest movies."" Other awards received were Kimberly Williams for ""Best Breakthrough Performance"" and Steve Martin for People's Choice Award for ""Favortie Actor in a Comedy Motion Picture."" He was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for his performance.In this remake of a classic Spencer Tracy film, George Banks (Steve Martin) is the owner of a shoe store in San Marino, California. When his daughter, Anne Banks (Kimberly Willams), comes home from three months in Rome, she tells them that she is engaged to a man (George Newbern) from an upper-class family in Bel-Air that she met while on her trip. Early on in the story George begins to freak out at the thought of losing his only daughter. His wife, Nina (Diane Keaton), tries to keep him sane and happy for their 22-year-old daughter. When the wedding takes place at their home with a crazy foreign wedding planner, Franck Eggelhoffer (Martin Short), controlling the whole thing, George tries to remember that his daughter is all grown up and ready to take the next step in her life. If it weren't for the actors, the film would not be as great as it is. Each actor plays off the other to gave you the full effect of the story. Steve Martin and Diane Keaton worked very well together. But even better, was the connection between Kimberly Williams and Geoege Newbern. When Anne and Brian got in a fight over the blender, I didn't know who I felt I bad for. Both actors stole me from the beginning. The chemistry was so great I found myself tearing up with tears of joy when they wed. One character that really added to the story was Franck. Martin Short did an exquisite job. Although his character was minor, Short did an excellent job making me laugh and lighting up the mood when other characters were angry or sad. His accent was hilarious, and he kept me laughing even when the situation in the movie wasn't exactly funny. The actors did such a phenomenal job, they made me feel like I was actually in the movie. My emotions kept changing with every twist and turn in the movie. One part that really evoked emotion was when George saw Anne in her wedding dress for the first time and he thought to himself ""This was the moment I'd been dreading for the past six months. Well, actually the past 22 years."" That thought had me blubbering.This film has a dose of every emotion. Perfect for all ages, this movie will make you laugh and cry. I laughed at all the twists and turns in the movie, and I cried when George was recapping his daughters whole life in his mind. I love to watch this movie when I need to relax and have a good time. George has a part of every father in him, and it is amazing watching him going through the journey of letting go of his daughter, and finding a part of himself that he never knew. I give this movie five out of five stars, from the beginning of the movie all the way through the end credits.",Father of the Bride
83,lmpetriv,cynical,3,11 July 2010,"I also enjoyed seeing this film however the way that the wife talks to her husband and all the sinister remarks makes it a poor comparison to the original. The original is much more entertaining and sweet - something that is lacking in films these days. Everybody wants to hurt somebody or laugh when somebody falls down and hurts themselves. Never go to the movies because they suck - bad words, nudity, bad scripts - i'll never go to see a Hollywood movie again which is why I watched this movie on TV (and still wasn't as entertained as the original film).

There is a melancholy scene when dad, George goes outside when he hears Annie shooting baskets because she can't sleep due to the impending wedding the next day and he starts to shoot baskets with her and there are moments when, through his eyes, we see Annie as a little girl bouncing the ball and we hear Georges sad voice narrate his longing for his little girl, who is now leaving home never to come back to her old bedroom in her parents home.",Father of the Bride

There are two huge problems 1) the relationship between the father and daughter is CREEPY (the father acts more like a jealous ex boyfriend than a protective father) and 2) the daughter is upset because her dad doesn't want to pay a $1500 wedding cake (don't cry yet, he does, cuz, well, I'm not sure why).

89,lindseycbulfinch,"Cute, but bothersome at times.",6,4 September 2005,"I was nine when this movie was first released and I rented it again recently as I'm now in the process of planning my own wedding. While Steve Martin gives a great performance as George Banks, and while several scenes are hilarious, I take issue with several inconsistencies in this film. The daughter claims to be this independent woman, yet she chooses an ultra-traditional wedding complete with the hideous wad of lace called her wedding gown? Also, in these modern times it is rare for a young adult to live at home until they get married; again, if she is an independent woman, wouldn't she try living with her fiancé before taking the plunge? Other commenters have mentioned that the price of the wedding is absurd, and I agree. George is the only voice of reason when it comes to the cost, however we are expected to laugh at his corny yet more cost-effective visions of his daughter's wedding. It was difficult for me to relate to the problems of these spoiled, entitled rich people.It's a movie, and perhaps shouldn't be over-analyzed, but when movies deal with a subject that many people have experienced, it's hard not to notice these things. It distracted me from enjoying the aspects of the film that were done best; namely, the comedic scenes. The scene at the in-laws' house and the scene in the grocery store are, in my opinion, well-done and hysterically funny.I suppose this movie would be a lot more enjoyable to those who suspend belief don't bother nit-picking its flaws.",Father of the Bride
