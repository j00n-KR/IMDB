0,SnoopyStyle,beautiful erotica but story is thin,5,9 December 2015,"Elizabeth McGraw (Kim Basinger) works in a SoHo art gallery in the hustle and bustle of NYC. She is taken with confident Wall Street trader John Gray (Mickey Rourke). They begin a torrid sexual affair lasting nine and a half weeks. He's a commanding presence and she feels herself breaking new boundaries. Her best friend goes out with her ex.At least, this is better than 50 Shades. Mickey Rourke is simply a superior actor especially at this time period. He exudes the over-confidence of his character. Kim Basinger is beautiful and also very enchanting. The movie develops the world of New York. It's fun, a little wild and very alluring. The cinematography is beautiful. The food eating lit by the fridge light looks sexy and beautiful. At the end of the day, this is a pretty thin story. Despite the nice acting, there is not much more here than an erotica. The montages are beautiful but shows the lack of drama. Also the controlling nature of John Gray can be taken as misogynistic and very off-putting.",9½ Weeks
1,lee_eisenberg,the heat is on,6,29 January 2020,"Is it going overboard to call Adrian Lyne's ""Nine 1/2 Weeks"" the ""Citizen Kane"" of bodice-rippers? Maybe, but movie pulls no punches in its steaminess. As with Lyne's ""Fatal Attraction"" the next year, one could come up with countless interpretations of the movie. Most likely people will remember the erotic scenes (they're enough to give any guy the hots for Kim Basinger).I figure that nowadays, controversy would arise over Elizabeth staying with John even after he performs degrading acts on her, implying that she enjoys getting objectified. I'm not sure if that's what the movie's saying. All that I can say is that you won't forget any of this material anytime soon.Aside from Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke, the cast includes David Margulies (the mayor in ""Ghostbusters"") and Christine Baranski.",9½ Weeks
2,jboothmillard,9 ½ Weeks,3,2 July 2010,"I'm going to be honest in saying that the only reason I decided to watch this film was because of the two leading stars and the highlights I had seen on TV, from director Adrian Lyne (Fatal Attraction, Indencent Proposal). Basically New York city art gallery assistant and recently divorced Elizabeth McGraw (Razzie nominated Kim Basinger) one day meets and is slowly seduced by mysterious Wall Street stock market worker John Grey (Mickey Rourke). He seems friendly and playful at first, but behind closed doors he shows his true lust for her by playing sexual games, starting with blindfolding and rubbing ice down her body. This continues with him asking her to crawl on floors, feeding her loads of food from the fridge with her eyes closed, and (in a scene I never saw apart from on TV) sex in the rain on a flight of stairs. Elizabeth can't help but be sexually lusting for John, to the point where she is almost reliant on him to do things, e.g. being fed, bathing her, but she knows the relationship is dodgy when a Spanish whore gets involved. She finally decides to leave him after nine and a half weeks, even when he says he will tell her everything about himself and not be a stranger anymore, but it's too late. Also starring Margaret Whitton as Molly, David Margulies as Harvey, Christine Baranski as Thea, Karen Young as Sue, William De Acutis as Ted, Dwight Weist as Mathew Farnsworth and The Rolling Stones' Ronnie Wood as Rock Star Party Guest. The three most memorable scenes of the film are Basinger having ice rubbed on her, being fed all sorts of food from the fridge and with honey on her, and her striptease to the song ""You Can Leave Your Hat On"" (the Joe Cocker version). I'm afraid to say that, apart from these scenes, Rourke being cool, and Basinger looking gorgeous with and without clothes, it is a terrible film with no real point and makes you feel weird, it's really only worth seeing the once. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Original Song for ""I Do What I Do (Nine 1/2 Weeks theme)"" and Worst Screenplay. Kim Basinger was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and the film was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Adequate!",9½ Weeks
3,ccthemovieman-1,Don't Kid Yourselves,2,27 June 2006,"This is high-gloss soft-porn; a boring soap opera concentrating on one thing: sex. They actually made sex boring, sad to say, because I defy you to watch this casually and tell me what the storyline was. What this is, is an excuse for Kim Bassinger to show off her great body and for Mickey Rourke to smirk a lot. That's it. Rourke's smugness is so bad it's sickening and Bassinger, despite the great figure, looks cheap more than beautiful.Kudos to the photographer for some nice closeup shots and some wonderful color, but the story is so weak - no character development and no plot - it's unable to compensate. Let's face it: this movie was made for only reason - to titillate male viewers. On that level, it probably succeeded. If I recall, it's why I gave it a look being a fan of Bassinger's looks, but I actually expected a story, too.Those trying to pass this off as ""arty"" and something deeper than soft porn are only fooling themselves.",9½ Weeks
4,moonspinner55,Ice-cold eroticism,6,27 February 2001,"Divorced SoHo art gallery employee meets a coolly handsome, enigmatic Wall Street arbitrator who harbors a kinky side: he's into role-playing and emotional (and sexual) manipulation...also, he's a bit of a jerk. ""Nine 1/2 Weeks"", directed by Adrian Lyne and adapted from Elizabeth McNeill's novel by Patricia Knop, Zalman King and Sarah Kernochan, is almost-sexy, almost-erotic, but never very inviting. The central relationship between Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke is there to be busted up--and Lyne doesn't appear to be concerned with the characters, anyway (his thing seems to be gauzy supplement spreads of apartments and restaurants). The early sexual foreplay with the blindfold and ice cubes is hot stuff, even though the scene is curiously chopped short (presumably so as not to offend prudish Americans). But, as it turns out, all the sexual clinches have been edited in much the same way: the rush of passion, the brief flash of nudity (hers), some heavy breathing, end of scene! There are two or three playful moments (such as a food frenzy in the kitchen), but mostly it's a lot of whispered talk without much action--and unintentionally funny bits like Rourke attempting to get Basinger in the mood by playing Billie Holiday's ""Strange Fruit"". **1/2 from ****",9½ Weeks
5,Quinoa1984,"at times quite sexy, and a cool look at Manhattan life, but it's also shallow and dated",6,8 May 2008,"One of the perks of Nine 1/2 Weeks is that the stars, Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger, provide audiences of male and female sexes to come together; they are both eye candy for each sex, and they didn't look much better than they did here. That's maybe part of the attraction for director Adrian Lyne, actually, the appeal on the surface of these characters. The only problem is that he and the screenwriters dance around some of the tougher questions that comes out of this intense relationship between two people who lust for each other but ""can't stop."" As far as character development goes... I'd guess there was more in the book. We have prototypical 80s New York characters- Basinger an art gallery assistant and Rourke as a wall street broker of sorts (not quite, but 'sort of' as we learn)- and they meet by just chance and soon the seduction begins, and practically doesn't stop. There are some hot moments here and there (the food scene is a little too goofy to work, but the scene after the near mugging on the steps in the alley is quite sexy in a truly 'urban' way), but it's obfuscated by the dated manner of the presentation. Only once does the music correspond rightly with the action on screen, which is the aborted threesome towards the end, which is when the dark atmosphere is complemented. The rest of the tracks, save maybe for Joe Cocker's striptease bit, are all fodder for the soundtrack sales.You also want to hear these characters speak more, for the shallow/music-video style compositions and smoke-filled atmosphere to peer away and for us to see these damaged souls for who they really are. This only happens towards the very end, coincidentally when the characters have gone past the point of no return to normalcy. Rourke and Basinger are good in their roles, but there should be more than what's here. It's a slightly troublesome sign when there's far more interest in the environment they inhabit (we get the point towards the beginning of NYC's once former notorious state, when the typical shot of Basinger walking in a group of people on a sidewalk is disrupted only mildly by a purse snatcher and the chasers) than the state of the relationship drama. It's worth recommending, maybe, but not much for a repeat viewing unless for soft-porn fodder.",9½ Weeks
6,edwagreen,9.5 Weeks- Too Many Hours in the Day for this One 0*,1,6 November 2010,"Hard to believe that Mickey Rourke once looked as good as he did in this film. Of course, it has been 25 years since the film was made.This film is a difficult one to fathom as it deals with erotic sex drives between a couple. The woman (Kim Basinger) seems to have some sort of being hurt wish as she endures physical and emotional abuse while in a very sudden relationship with the devious Rourke. The picture is endless in going on and telling what is happening here. My question: What really is happening here?The ending is also somewhat mystifying. Will Basinger really end this nonsense or will she come back for some more erotic gestures? My suggestion is that the audience not go back.While Rourke comes from a poor family, as he confesses at the bitter end, you'd think he was a gangster before the realization hits us that he is a stockbroker. Don't invest with him or this ridiculous movie. The latter lacks real motivation and the plot is practically non-existent.",9½ Weeks
7,sunwarrior13,For Sex-obsessed Couples,8,15 October 2012,"Nine ½ Weeks is an erotic drama that features Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke together with co-stars Margaret Whitton, Karen Young, David Margulies, Christine Baranski that play key supporting roles.The movie is based on the memoir of the same name by Elizabeth McNeill and it is directed by Adrian Lyne.The title of the film refers to the duration of a relationship between Wall Street arbitrageur John Gray and divorced SoHo art gallery employee Elizabeth McGraw. The two meet and have a volatile and somewhat kinky sex life involving a variety of sexual and erotic acts.Elizabeth is looking for true love, while John is searching for gosh knows what. His notions of lovemaking include blindfolds, ice cubes, chocolate syrup, and rolling around on spent peanut shells. When the allotted Nine 1/2 weeks are up, she has finally come to realize that he has been using her. We could have told her that twenty minutes into the film.The film details a sexual downward spiral as John pushes Elizabeth's boundaries toward her eventual emotional breakdown. He often manipulates her into getting what he wants during sex and sometimes abuses her.This is obviously an essential viewing for sex-obsessed couples.But overall,it breaks many taboos, not just fun naughty ones, but deep- seated cultural ones. There are some unforgettable scenes such as the striptease scene and a great soundtrack.",9½ Weeks
8,Scarecrow-88,9 ½ Weeks,9,21 May 2009,"The exploits of a successful Wall Street business exec(..he ""buys and sells money"")and the Street Gallery assistant who he meets in a little Chinese food store. He wishes to explore her sexual boundaries, seeing how far she's willing to go, until the game reaches a stopping point. It's all exciting and liberating for her, as she does let her inhibitions go to a certain extent, but when his demands become increasingly humiliating and uncomfortable, their 9 ½ weeks could come to an end.Like Zalman King, Adrian Lyne has always been a provocateur, his films dealing with sex and it's consequences on those who partake. It's all fun and games until the relationship begins to evolve into something more serious. All of a sudden, sexual challenges are frowned upon as burdensome, soon progressively disrupting the potential harmony which might've existed if the rules had been mapped out differently. As stands, the whirlwind romance is bound to hit a snag with feelings hurt, perhaps even damaged beyond repair. I figure I'm in the minority because I really liked this movie. While I don't think it's as racy has it's reputation, there are still a fair degree of eroticism. Lyne really devotes a great deal of time to NYC, it's variety of people and culture as O'Rourke and Basinger spend time running around, eating in various places, taking in the many sights to offer. Their lurid sexual relationship is explored exquisitely through the evocative lens of Peter Biziou's cinematography..his use of sunlight and various lights of the city enhances the mood and look of the film, particularly when Basinger's body is explored(..along with an obvious double). O'Rourke is O'Rourke..a handsome, confident, commanding presence who can speak more by saying less, a better performance than he was probably given credit for. Basinger, I felt, was really, really good, often her character is put through a great deal of emotional turmoil, from the celebration of sexual liberty to the throngs of distress when she realizes that her relationship with O'Rourke will not last, often questioning herself..I think she was treated too harshly by many in the critical community in what was a very difficult performance. It's a balancing act really for Basinger, and we see a series of emotional peaks and valleys as any relationship would take if it were like hers with O'Rourke. Very attractive leads lovingly presented on screen, I thought their work together generated a fair amount of erotic heat. I adored Basinger's little grins, attempting to hold them and unable to do so because she obviously drawn to her pursuers quiet advances. I also like her range of reactions, surprise and unease, when O'Rourke proposes certain ""tasks"" for her to perform. The film follows Basinger's life apart from O'Rourke, too, her ex-husband's budding relationship with her pal & co-worker(..also presented subtly, and interesting enough this relationship blooms because the demands are less potentially abusive) and the reclusive artist whose works she is able to get a gallery show for.I think what impressed me more than anything else was the titillating camera work showing a lovely woman's body turned on by her partner's various experimental methods(..such as the ice cube and honey ), also admittedly enjoying Basinger's ""performances"" for O'Rourke. This could be because I love how Basinger looks in this movie and the camera just worships her. But, most importantly, I loved how Basinger and O'Rourke often communicated with each other using facial expressions and limited words..it's this kind of communication that's often unappreciated when we look at performance by actors.",9½ Weeks
9,Hey_Sweden,See it for Basinger.,6,9 December 2015,"This memorable sexual drama is an adaptation of a novel by Elizabeth McNeill. Kim Basinger stars as a character named Elizabeth, a divorced art gallery worker. One day, she chances to meet John (Mickey Rourke), a charming young Wall Street financier. She finds out that he likes to play sexual games, and realizes that she's vulnerable to his manipulations. Ultimately, she finds this strange relationship taking dominance in her life.""Nine 1/2 Weeks"" is a largely two character film that is not degrading or ""pornographic"" as some people might have you believe. It's actually rather restrained, and even in its full length uncut version is never overly concerned with nudity or depravity. This may come as a disappointment to some potential viewers, but most of the time it's concentrating on detailing the evolution of this sex-based relationship.Unfortunately, we never get to know our two principals all that well. But since she has more to work with, Basinger definitely comes off better. Rourkes' character forever remains an enigma. Also, for a film running close to two hours, it doesn't seem to have all that much story going for it.The sex scenes will stick in the mind, even if most of them aren't particularly imaginative. The exception is the notorious ""food"" sequence, which was later parodied in ""Hot Shots!"". But the choice of song in the sequence kind of kills the mood.Basinger looks positively ravishing throughout - the camera loves her - and she delivers an appealing performance. Familiar faces turn up - Margaret Whitton, David Margulies, Christine Baranski, Karen Young, Julian Beck, Dan Lauria, Ron Wood of The Rolling Stones, etc. - but the supporting cast has little to do in the grand scheme of things.Fairly interesting but not all that successful, this marked a stepping stone for former actor Zalman King (who co-wrote and co-produced); he went on to a prominent career as a soft core auteur.Six out of 10.",9½ Weeks

Kim Basinger plays Elizabeth, a beautiful woman who works at an art gallery. Mickey Rourke plays the mysterious John whom she encounters at an outside market. Their chance encounter leads to some pretty steamy sexual activity that are stylized with well placed lighting, locations, and innovative sex. Elizabeth is open to romance but is open minded to John's sexual world of blindfolds, public sex, dressing up, and even a scene at the refrigerator to the tune of ""Bread and Butter"" that is both erotic and hysterical. Things tense up when sexual levels rise and John begins do demand activity that boarders on abuse and demeaning. Elizabeth is surrounded by an array of interesting personalities at work. Margaret Whitton plays her co-worker and roommate who confesses to be dating Elizabeth's ex-husband. David Margulies and Karen Young round out the art gallery personalities. Dwight Weist plays Farnsworth, an artist whom they are celebrating but whose existence is sheltered. Adrian Lyne previously made Foxes and Flashdance but here he creates a stylishly explicit view of the more adventures forms of sexual activity, and after the tears dry, it is those nine plus weeks that spark memories never forgotten.

12,namashi_1,"Erotic, Dull and Interesting!",6,24 March 2009,"Lyne's 1986 flick '9 1,2 Weeks' is erotic, dull & interesting. This filmmaker loves sex, as all his films are based on sex and lust between human beings. All in all this flick has pluses and minuses. A abrupt climax spoils the fun completely!Lets go ahead with the pluses first: Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger are Icons of Hollywood. This film is very old, both of them were young at the that time and both performed so well. Rourke is excellent. Basinger on the other hand, looks damn hot and delivers a classy performance.Minuses: The climax is abrupt. Leaving the viewer unsatisfied and confused.On the whole, '9 1,2 Weeks' is a good watch. Go for this one, but watch it alone.",9½ Weeks
13,Smells_Like_Cheese,"You know, Mickey Rourke always creeped me out... until now :D",6,19 November 2006,"As much as I know that this is a pretty silly story that really makes mostly no sense whatever, but this movie was just so sexy, blah! I'm shallow! I'm sick! I liked it! Shame, shame on me! Mickey is just so hot in this movie, I couldn't believe it! He always creeped me out in his new movies, but once I saw 9 1/2 Weeks, he's just so beautiful. OK, I'm sorry, I just had to get that out.Elizabeth is a young beautiful woman who meets John, a smooth talking business man, and they hit it off naturally and passionately. They start a very intimate relationship pretty quickly and she ends up moving in with him, under the condition that he can take care of her have her to himself at night time. But of course since she doesn't know him that well and he keeps silent about his past, she begins to question him. Not to mention that the games are getting more and more scary when he's asking for more from her sexually.OK, movie wise, 9 1/2 weeks is no Oscar winning story, in fact, I even deny if there is a movie in here, but it was Mickey that drew me to the story... and that accent... and that hair... and that smile... Oh, God! I need to go watch this movie again before I give it back to the movie store.6/10",9½ Weeks
14,blanbrn,Fun. A tease of erotic obsession that's tense and complex. A nice 80's visual.,7,24 July 2009,"After all these many years I finally watched ""Nine 1/2 Weeks"" and clearly it is a dated piece that captured the times of the 1980's well. Also many may find the film a bit overstated for the way it tries to prove it messages of love and feeling. Still this is a film that is fun and very enjoyable to watch as it proves just how complex and tense that love making can be really this film showcased it as a dangerous and mysterious game of obsession.Set in New York City, with the hustle and rush of big city life you see Elizabeth(Kim Basinger) a young single and attractive woman who works at an art gallery showcase. Then one day while strolling the city by chance and fate she meets a handsome and strange man his name is John(Mickey Rourke). John is the perfect man who has a successful job as a wall street broker, he dresses nice has a nice place. Yet the big thing missing is love. He's just so emotionally empty that it hurts inside.When the relationship progresses the love making leads to extremes as their ways of pleasure are strange. The scenes where food were used as support were interesting! John had clearly showed a side of being a risk taker and that is seen as even being more evident when his erotic love making ways with Elizabeth push her limits and boundaries. You name it from blindfolds to whip creme to another woman for hot turn ons for John! This film really proved just how fun love making can be true it pushed the limits, but it showed just how far someone will go like the John character who was so emotionally and physically empty for so long. Yet in the end as with most cases the passion wears off as it couldn't last proving that love hurts and it must be a special kind for it to last. Overall good film that may be a little to dated, still it's a nice treat for it's take of pushing love making to new erotic and obsessive heights. As it proved love can be so complex and which passion feeds from one's emotions. And the on screen chemistry between Basinger and Rourke made it a watch.",9½ Weeks
15,gridoon,"Rather good, but it runs out of steam.",6,8 January 2000,"This film often becomes the target of hostile and sarcastic comments; while it is no masterpiece, it certainly doesn't deserve that treatment. It's surprisingly thoughtful, with many offbeat touches here and there (which somehow never seem pretentious), and many realistic moments and ""everyday life"" observations that add dimensions to the characters. Maybe people are disappointed because the film doesn't really score in the ""erotic"" department: Mickey Rourke is magnetic but Basinger just doesn't cut it - her only really ""hot"" scene is her strip-tease, which is also the least explicit one. Although the film suffers from a repetitive story, and eventually, exactly like its characters, runs out of steam, it still seems somewhat underrated.",9½ Weeks
16,Irishchatter,Very sexy and full of emotions!,8,16 September 2016,"This is my first time ever watching Mickey Rourke in a film properly. He has done quite a few films in recent years and I never got to sit down to watch any of them. I have to admit, he really did look handsome in his early days. He doesn't look like that now I'm afraid! Kim Basenger looked very gorgeous in this, she really does know how to dance for Mickey Rourke haha! Although I was a little disappointed that her character was a bit whingy. Also the fact herself and Rourkes characters weren't together anymore in the end. I honestly did expect the pair of them would live happily ever after instead of Basenger running for her life from him. Well I have to admit, he did cheat on her with a prostitute so he deserved that but still, it was a downer that she left him at the same time!Really good erotic movie, I give it a 8/10!",9½ Weeks
17,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,30 April 2017,"9 ½ WeeksThe best thing about a one-night stand is that you don't have to sleep at the shelter.The lucky devil in this erotic drama, in fact, has been living cot-free for months.When Wall Street financial whiz John Gray (Mickey Rourke) encounters art galley employee Elizabeth (Kim Basinger) they have an instant sexual connection that will soon find Elizabeth stepping outside her boundaries.Over the coming weeks, John enforces his dominance over his new submissive, yet is unwilling to meet her friends socially. As their explicit encounters intensify, Elizabeth's work and wellbeing begins to suffer, while John's mysterious past slowly reveals itself. Although not the first erotic romance to grace celluloid, this provocative piece of BDSM from 1986 remains a touchstone of the sub-genre.

18,ironhorse_iv,"Nein! Nein! Nein! I know some people like this movie, but this film will never be a flavor of the week to me. It's a below average watch.",5,6 March 2019,"Based on the 1978's memoir with the same name from Austrian American author, Ingeborg Day, this motion picture tells the dangers of sexual obsession of New York City art gallery employee, Elizabeth McGraw (Kim Basinger) through her stimulating yet disturbing relationship with the mysterious Wall Street stock broker John Gray (Mickey Rourke), during the two month and a half timeline of knowing each other. Without spoiling the movie directed by Adrian Lyne too much, this erotic thriller was made during the most conservative time in America since the 1950s: the 1980s. Because of that, this supposedly provocative and steamy film sat on the shelf for nearly a year after it was finished, because the original distributor, TriStar Pictures dropped it, due to its controversial content. MGM did picked it up, but they couldn't figure out how to market a Rated X movie. After a few months, they finally decide to cut it down, to be available for public viewing as a Rated R film. They really did censored the kinky sadomasochistic & sexually explicit scenes to death before its US release. To the point that 14 hours of deleted scenes were never shown, not even in the Director's Cut DVD Edition. Despite, declaring this film as one of her favorite movies, she has ever done, I really doubt Kim Basinger whom own the clips, would ever release them, as she found the whole shoot as emotionally draining to the point that it contributed to marital problems with then husband Ron Snyder. It didn't help that the director used emotionally manipulative tactics on Kim during the shooting to get the performance he wanted from her. For example, Lyne didn't allow her to talk to her costars, off camera and off set. Not only that, but he spread hateful misogyny type rumors about Kim during production, in order to unnerve her, so that Basinger's actual lonely emotional breakdown over time would be effectively translated to the screen. To me, those tactics didn't really work, because most of the mental anguish scenes involving her character were omitted from the final product. So, we the audience really never got to see her act in a psychiatric breakdown matter. Despite that, both Rourke & Kim does have a little bit of likeable onscreen chemistry during the more absurd, cheesy and dumb moments like the food tasting montage and the Joe Cocker's 'You Can Leave Your Hat On' striptease sequence. Those sequences had spawn a number of tributes & parodies because of that. However, most of the other notoriety acts of eroticism between the two performers in the film, felt more over the top painfully awkward, rather than sexy. There is no better example of that, than the lovemaking on the street scene. The positions they were doing doesn't seem accurate. It looks somewhat rough & unpleasant. I don't know about other audience members, but the scene made me worrisome about them catching some sort of a deadly disease like Cholera from the contaminate rain. I really couldn't find that sequence to be arousing. The same, goes with a few other scenes. I guess, the rest of America kinda agrees, with me on that. This film didn't turn them on. Truly, its subject matter of sexual desires was such a turn off, that it bomb at the box office. Nevertheless, the romantic film did performed very well overseas, particularly in Europe & Latin America. Still, that begs the question, what was so stimulating, that it got these people to come back? It's sure, wasn't the nudity as there was hardly any of that, both in the male and female stars. Plus, body doubles were used for Kim throughout the movie. So, it wasn't really her expose self, in those sexy scenes. I can only guess, internationally, foreign viewers leaned more on the positives moments in the story's dominant & submissive relationship than Americans. In the US, most audience people probably wanted to see a more tragic morality tale tone than anything else. After all, in the novel, one of the characters is basically a sexual prisoner, being tied up, slapped and whipped, forbidden to do even the simplest of things for herself, such as brush her own hair or eat. Because of this, she ended up in an extreme trauma and had to be hospitalized. Instead of going with this downer prudish tone that most Americans at the time, wanted to see, the film screenplay by Sarah Kernochan, Zalman King, and Patricia Louisanna Knop, ends on a lot more positive & tamer somber tone, which somewhat betrays the source material's warnings of getting into a relationship like this. No wonder, why this movie got mixed reviews at the time of its released. Regardless, the film did developed a cult following, which resulted in two spin off movies, 1997s 'Another Nine and a Half Weeks' and a 1998 direct to video prequel, 'The First Nine and Half Weeks'. As for the film soundtrack. Lots of famous catchy tunes from a variety of musician artists are featured here. It's one of the best movie tracks, ever released in the 1980s. Give it a listen to. It's beautifully worth hearing. Overall: While, this motion picture about a woman forfeiting her sexual freedom to a man, she hardly knew, in order to push the boundaries between what is consensual and what is abusive; is not a great watch. It's still a lot better than the 2015 sexual film with a similar premise, 'Fifty Shades of Grey'. In the end, see this movie over that. Regardless, both films will never leave you happy on cloud nine. More likely disappointed.",9½ Weeks
19,videorama-759-859391,Spend some really weird weeks with the powerful Rourke and lovely Basinger,6,14 January 2014,"As 86 R rated flicks went, this was the most successful, and certainly a different kind of movie experience. Beautifully shot with style, the most weirdest, yet engrossing relationship between these two characters from two then hot stars, one of course whose looks have sunk, is truly something to behold. The enigmatic Rourke is way too weird for words, a bored stockbroker, who likes to play manipulative games, with his lovers, some which turn quite nasty. His new love Basinger, an assistant architect, truly bored with her job, like Rourke, just can't get him out of her head, her old lover, with who'm life was normal, but not exciting. Just wait til you see him, andR then you'll understand. Rourke makes the relationship, such a dizzying one, Basinger just can't think straight, so ultimately she has to let herself go. And that's alright for us to do that. Some scenes are so weirded out, one involving Rourke leaving Basinger on a ferris wheel while it's at it's peak and him and the operator go off for a coffee, whatever. One scene that stood out in my mind, okay, apart from the blindfolded one, involving all these condiments and fruits, whatever, was the one where she went out and saw that old artist in the country, an unnecessary yet beautiful scene, beautiful as how Basinger describes this old codger's work. Slave to love, a song I first heard in this, in the montage, was one I grew to love. We also have an adventurous scene with our two being chased by some drunken thugs. This sex drama, is well acted by everyone, a lot of the small players, particularly good, Rourke cool again in this role, as first coming across him in the electric action thriller, Year Of The Dragon, with Basinger, just as good, if a tad less. It's a film you wouldn't expect to be this well acted, especially if a first timer, seeing it today in it's near two hours running time. It's certainly something different, yet the same could of been said for Angel Heart. It's resolution caught me in a bit of downfall as to the expiration of the relationship, which in no way was ever normal anyhow. The film will affect you in many ways, as viewing relationships, or drawing on your own personal ones. Not as explicit as people have been led to believe. Haven't people heard of 1990's follow up, Wild Orchid. Followed by a totally pointless and terrible sequel.",9½ Weeks

He may have picture-perfect hair, but he sure ain't no Romeo..... And meet Elizabeth McGraw, the ceaselessly pouting ho from Soho. She may have sexy, flyaway hair, but she sure ain't no Juliet.And when John and Elizabeth get together for playtime in 9 1/2 Weeks - It has got to be some of the dreariest sexual-obsession soap opera that I've seen in a mighty long time.If you can believe it - Back in 1986 this laughable, $17 million production, whose story was clearly 80% style over substance, was taken so seriously by its sexually-obsessed audience that it actually made back 6 times its initial costs at the box-office in no time flat.On a side-note - I think it's really scary to see just how drastically Mickey Rourke's looks have deteriorated over the last 30 years.

Director Adrian Lyne, a veteran (obviously) of TV advertising, mistakes gimmicky photography for style, undermining the already skimpy plot and shallow characters by overemphasizing superfluous detail to no apparent purpose.

22,MBunge,Surprisingly good but notable more for the trends it sparked in American erotic cinema,6,20 June 2011,"Nine ½ Weeks is probably one of the most culturally and economically influential box office bombs in movie history. I t established that there was no real market for high class, mainstream erotica in American film, and also helped spawn and define a cottage industry of lesser quality, niche erotica that continues to this very day, primarily on cable TV. When you add in the fact that Nine ½ Weeks is pretty entertaining as well, you end up with an impressive motion picture.Here's the plot. A divorced New Yorker named Elizabeth (Kim Basinger) falls under the sexual spell of a mysteriously cool man named John (Mickey Rourke). They have a lot of sex of varying physical and emotional quality. Elizabeth eventually tires of their unhealthy union and leaves. The end. That's not an awful lot to sink your teeth into, but that's sort of the point. This was an attempt to make a legitimate movie about the sexual relationship between two people without delving into the realms of softcore porn. It basically uses their sexual encounters to tell us who these people are why they bond.Elizabeth is lonely and stuck inside the degenerate artifice of the New York City art crowd. If John had thinning hair and a beer gut, he'd be an obsessive, controlling pervert. Since he looks like what Mickey Rourke looked like in the mid 80s, he's like a fantasy figure come to life to liberate Elizabeth from her inhibitions. His need to command her and her sexuality at first lets her enjoy parts of herself she would never admit to. Eventually, his need to control expresses itself in more and more deviant behavior and Elizabeth finally rebels in order to hold onto the very awareness that John helped stir in her.Director Adrian Lyne did a very nice job her, though much of the look and all of the music of the film is about as dated as you can get. There's never any doubt what decade Nine ½ Weeks was made in. The scenes of foreplay and sex here are so stylish and powerful that they've been imitated in the sex scenes of countless movies made after this one. And Lyne effectively compensates for the paucity of plot by immersing the viewer into the rhythm of New York City street life and the adolescent culture of the New York City art world.Basinger and Rourke are stunningly attractive but neither becomes lost in their respective beauty. Basinger's silkily conveys Elizabeth's journey of self-discovery and Rourke is magnetically quiet and calm. What's best about their work here is that each always lets you see that their character is thinking about the games they're playing with each other and choosing to go forward with them.Stylish direction powerful performances and a good bit of media sensation weren't enough to make this film a hit. I t became a film in the 80s that a lot of people heard about but not that many saw and there's been very little in the way of high class, mainstream erotica out of Hollywood ever since. What did happen is that co-producer and co-writer Zalman King went out to make a few more erotic films, all dumber and much closer to softcore porn, then made his way into cable TV with Red Shoe Diaries. That was an anthology series that did a more prurient and less sophisticated version of this movie over and over again. It proved their was an audience of middle brow erotica, just not one that would go to the cinema.I quite liked Nine ½ Weeks. I also liked that Basinger got naked but it spared me any sight of Rourke's ass. If you're looking for a smart and graceful movie about two people getting it on, this is it.",9½ Weeks

This is a movie that's definitely controversial and there are some pretty hard to watch scenes but this is by no means your typical ""sex and that's it"" movie, it makes a powerful statement.Anyone who's ever been in love-passionately in love-and had the feeling they'd do anything for that person even if that meant giving up their very self-even if that feeling was fleeting and only lasted 5 minutes-should watch this film. I believe it is based on a true story, though I'm not absolutely sure of that-but the question that this movie will have you asking is:could this ever happen to me?I saw this a long time ago and found it very tough to watch but fascinating too.

There are some unforgettable scenes (don't miss the striptease scene, which is amazing two decades later!) and a great soundtrack. The film's photography is gorgeous, using darkness and rays of light to set the shifting contexts of sensuality and sensation throughout. Rourke and Basinger are both superb in their roles, John who is painfully frozen in his incapacity to feel, and Elizabeth who grows visibly in self awareness over the course of the film.The chemistry between Rourke and Basinger is electric. You can practically see the sparks fly off the screen. Is Rourke's character a nice guy? Not really. However, is he sexy, and would he make most women melt? Yes he would without a doubt. The story is compelling and absolutely fascinating as you watch the couple's relationship spring up and then unravel. Highly recommendation for all erotic movie lovers.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",9½ Weeks
29,DeeNine-2,Kim Basinger makes this worth seeing,7,20 March 2004,"What one realizes while watching this is how limited and ultimately unsatisfactory is a relationship based purely on sex.I imagine that the familiar dominance/submissive psychology at the heart of this visually stunning movie--and it really is beautifully shot--comes from the novel by Elizabeth MacNeil. I say that, not having read the novel, because the seduction of Manhattan art dealer Elizabeth (Kim Basinger) by the smooth and supremely confident financier John (Mickey Rourke) is so very well done with the expensive presents, the well-timed flower deliveries, little endearments, etc., that it amounts to a woman's fantasy. The partial debasement of Elizabeth and her eventual triumph over her darker instincts and her realization that there is a difference between love and submission is also something that one might expect to find in a woman's point-of-view novel.However when we get to the actual sexuality and how it is acted out, it is unclear who dreamed up the scenes, MacNeil or director Adrian Lyne or the scriptwriters. I say this because the scenes were so predictable and so ordinary, and when not ordinary and predictable, were bordering on the just plain dumb. Making love in the rain, at the top of a tall building (inside the clock tower), blindfolding the woman, making her crawl, feeding her strawberries, etc., bring nothing new to eroticism. And the scene requiring some imagination--baiting the gay bashers--was not realistically done. Why directors insist on allowing a man holding onto the hand of woman to outrun the men chasing them never ceases to amaze me. And then to have Elizabeth and John stop in the middle of the street to allow the bashers they have outrun to catch up was just plain stupid, not to mention the phony fight that followed.Not only were the sexual scenes predictable but clearly Lyne was in harness (and I am glad of that) since he stops well short of what might happen if this sort of theme were fully played out.Putting all that aside what makes this movie worth seeing is Kim Basinger. She is absolutely stunning, and it is clear that Lyne and his camera adored her. More than that Basinger does a fine job of acting in a demanding role.I was impressed. Before seeing this film I thought she was a rather ordinary actress, but her ability to combine grown-up New York chic with little-girl vulnerability and to make absolutely clear the psychological dilemma her character's heart faced really held the movie together.Lyne's insistence on whispered dialogue difficult to hear was consistent with the theme of the movie but not kind to these ears. But that was okay because much of the dialogue was secondary to the visual exploration of the woman's sexuality. The peek-a-boo and off center and shadowed shots of Basinger's face and her silhouette, and the studied smile from Rourke combined with the stark black and whites of their clothes and the furnishings served to highlight and emphasis the flesh tones of Basinger's skin while lending an appropriate artistic and fashionable atmosphere to the movie, which after all has an art dealer at its center. The many scenes that were began and suggested, and then cut away from, allowed a richer texture of experience for the viewer than would have been possible had the scenes been played out. And that was doubly good because again it is the visuals that make this movie worth seeing, not the originality of the story and its development.To those viewers who thought that this was some sort of high class pornography, I can only say you missed the point entirely, and indeed, you may be projecting your own sorry mentality. For those others who were not, shall we say, sufficiently stimulated, I can point you to a graphic novel with a similar theme (written by a man) entitled The Story of O which will NOT be coming to a theater near you anytime soon.See this for Kim Basinger whose sensitive and robust beauty dominated the screen.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

30,Howlin Wolf,Vacuous film is just an excuse to get the lead stars naked... (MINOR SPOILERS),4,9 May 2001,"This is a perfect film for the 80's. Why? It's shallow, self obsessed and arrogant. Much like how I see one of its stars...Since making this film, Adrian Lyne has developed a reputation for tackling projects that explore a sexual theme with reasonable amounts of intelligence and restraint (""Fatal Attraction"", ""Lolita"") The makers of this film would doubtless claim that ""9 1/2 Weeks"" is an early example of that trend. Don't be fooled. I believe that my summary is a more accurate assessment.Contrary to Roger Ebert's opinion in his review, to me there seemed zero chemistry between Rourke and Basinger. Perhaps this is the fault of the director. IMO, to generate true sexual chemistry, you have to have a sustained build-up, where it is clear that both characters are attracted to each other but must control their urges. The restraint that the material requires is not shown by Lyne. To be a little crude, he seems to have the common problem of getting excited too early; and then the audience - much like the familiar frustrated female - is left whining ""Is that it?"" Contravening normal rules for a movie of this type, the sex scenes don't get more exciting, they get more DULL as the film progresses, despite Lyne's pathetic attempt to excite us by throwing in bondage and rape elements. To give you a better idea, I was 15 or so when I watched this, and instead of being aroused by the 'alleyway sex', I found myself laughing at the ridiculousness of it. It was impossible not to. There was the cheesy synth music in the background, the laughable idea that the rain would make the scene more sexy, the almost prudish cutting away every time flesh was exposed, the ripped 80's 'fashions'... I could go on. Needless to say, laughter is hardly the reaction you'd expect from a hormonal adolescent while watching a supposedly 'erotic' film...In criticizing the central relationship, I suppose I'm conveniently forgetting Rourke's obvious inability to convincingly portray a man in an obsessive relationship with anyone but himself. Is it any wonder his career went to the dogs? (EDIT, as of 2005: Having seen more of his work since, I no longer impugn his skills; but I still dislike his attitude... )Basinger has shown she's at least capable of being a good actress with 1997's ""L.A Confidential, and I suppose she's not awful here; but any thoughts that this role champions the sexual empowerment of women are ludicrously pretentious bearing in mind the quality of the material on show. The film was directed by and co-written by a man, so it's hardly groundbreaking 'women's lib' stuff. I'm not saying that men are incapable of being sensitive about these matters, but I would be willing to bet that the only people who have a true conception of what women want are other women, and even then in less cases than you'd think... !A totally hollow and not even very titillating flick that deserves a reputation... As an indisputably trashy movie. Avoid.P.S. To think, the 'ice-cube scene' showed such promise as well! Now that WAS sexy; pity that the rest of the film couldn't continue in the same vein.",9½ Weeks
31,baumer,A fascinating study of sex and how it affects some people,8,15 August 1999,"May contain some spoilers:What I find incredibly ironic about our society ( North American that is ) is how hypocritical we are when it comes to sex.  I mean let's face it, many people over the age of 18 have had it at least once and many people are consumed by it.  And as long as it is consentual, protected sex and intentions are never misleading, then what is wrong with sex, even if it is with someone that you are not in love with.  Sex can be a powerful thing. Because if you think about all the feelings that you can experience during the act, they really range perhaps more than any single act that you can think of. Everything from pure lust to passionate love can be felt at one time or another during sex.  And I find it funny that certain institutions or groups try to deny or at least restrict people from fulfilling one of the most basic needs they have as an animal.  Nine 1/2 Weeks explores the power of sex.  It examines it and doesn't shy away from what it wants to say. And for a film that is almost 14 years old, I have to applaud it for pushing the envelope of what is acceptable and what is loathed.Kim Basinger is a successful but lonely woman living in New York City. She meets a stranger who buys her an expensive item that she could never afford. But he buys it because he can.  This starts the intrigue between the two. He is the tall dark mysterious man that doesn't really reveal much of himself.  He is obviously incredibly wealthy, but it is not really revealed what it is that he does.  And that feeling of subserviance is paralleled when the blindfold scene is presented to us later in the film.  He controls his life by controlling others.  He has his world under his control and that includes his sexuality towards her.Some say that this film doesn't really have a point or that it has no plot but to show a lot of soft core sex scenes.  But look at it a little more carefully and you will see that it does have much to say.  It just has to say it about sex, and many people can't handle that.  Sex is topic that is taboo.  It is something that shuold stay in Pandora's box buried in some ancient Egyptian catacomb, never to be unleashed on mankind.  But Adrienne Lynne is a bit of a renegade, that, or he grew up in Europe where sex is like eating.  They are both necessary to live.This film also has a perfect mood setting soundtrack.  Songs like Slave to Love and Eurasian Eyes are just as important to the film as the lighting and the set design.  Then there is Joe Cocker's famous "" You Can Leave Your Hat On"" melody that is the perfect song for Basinger's strip tease.  These songs heighten the mood and make you feel a part of the world that you are voyeuristically watching.I'm not going to comment on the plot and the acting and the direction or tell you what this film is about.  It is a film about a relationship that is doomed because of it's sexuality, that is all you need to know.  Judge for yourself how good or how bad it is.  I personally liked this film very much and I do recommend it.  It has a lot to show and a lot to say about our psyche when it comes to ""doing it"".  But don't take my word, make up your own mind.",9½ Weeks
32,classicalsteve,A Film About the Destructiveness of Sex Obsession,8,16 May 2010,"I think most people don't understand this movie. This is not a love story, at least not in the conventional sense. ""9 1/2 weeks"" is about sexual desire and intimate sensuality run amok and becoming the monopolizing forces in a relationship, and the ultimate demise of that relationship as a result. Certainly the physical pleasures and sensuality of sex are aspects that make a relationship fulfilling and gratifying but they are not the only facets. A relationship purely based on sexual desire is doomed to failure. At first it seems like a game, but later on the intensity is too much for the relationship to withstand, largely because if love and caring are sacrificed for the sex, it will die.You almost couldn't find more suitable casting than Mickey Roarke and Kim Bassinger. Roarke plays John, a sexually-driven finance executive who is not satisfied with winning over the woman he wants. He craves continual heightened sexual excitement from his ""lady friend"". And he uses subtle coercion to achieve his goals. For Elizabeth, played by Bassinger, John is the ideal lover. He makes her breakfast, buys her clothes, brushes her hair. He takes care of her in an interesting role reversal. But nothing is free. In return, John wants Elizabeth to be in his complete control and engage in sensuous sex games. And each game is more intense than the last.At first the games seem innocent enough. He likes to blindfold her and play a touchy-feely game in which he introduces objects that she feels and/or tastes. But then the requests become more intense. He wants her to enact a strip-tease, to dress in a certain way without her consent, and to receive a spanking for being a ""nosey parker"". They have sex in the oddest of places, sometimes engaging in intimate contact in public. At first Elizabeth enjoys the attention and the excitement until she begins to lose the sense of herself as the relationship intensifies. And John eventually goes too far. At one poignant moment in the film, Elizabeth speaks with an artist-recluse. Because her job is at an art gallery, she helps coordinate artists for exhibitions. When she finds him in a rural area, she asks him if he remembered that his exhibition is coming up. He replies that when he is hungry he remembers to eat and when he is tired he remembers to sleep. She has lost the simpler pleasures of life, and this old man reminds her of that. Late in the film there is an interesting scene where Elizabeth's former boyfriend comes to the place she works--not to see her but he is now dating one of her co-workers. He's a plain man who does not have nearly the sexual allure of Roarke. But he seems kind and honest. Liz watches her co-worker and her former boyfriend leave and there is an expression on her face that speaks volumes: maybe she misjudged him after-all. For a moment, the two stare at each other from a distance, and you get the feeling that she was the one who left him. He is not the Mr Exciting that John is, but maybe he has other qualities that John could never have.This is quite a stunning film, certainly not for all tastes, and some of the steamy sex scenes could be misinterpreted as being only for pornographic sake. What saves it are the incredible and absolutely believable performances by the two leads, Roarke and Bassinger which strangely complement one another. Roarke plays his character right on the money, always enigmatic, never raising his voice, but always mysterious. His character is always just outside of reach. He constantly smiles, even when he is noticeable disappointed. Basinger is a perfect complement as one of the few actresses left who can be vulnerable and elicit a willingness to be under control that you don't see in many female performances anymore. Despite what may appear to be pornography, there is a point to the film I think, and that is that constant sexual control and nurturing relationships mix like oil and water. In the end you wonder if it was all a game.",9½ Weeks
33,hall895,Painful,2,13 November 2012,"A sadomasochism tale in which the most pain is inflicted on the audience. This is one truly awful movie. A woman meets a mysterious man who pushes her sexual boundaries. This mystery man is the dominant type and he leads the relationship into some dark places. He's manipulative, at times abusive. She goes along for the ride. Happily at first, less happily later. She gets emotional, he does some more stupid and bizarre things, and then the movie just fizzles out. Tension and drama are in very short supply. What little dialogue there is in the movie is mostly laughable. Basically the movie just careens aimlessly from one ""daring"" sex scene to the next. And while the film has achieved a somewhat notorious reputation it's really not that daring at all. Any of the really dark stuff is only hinted at, not seen. What's on the screen is not explicit at all, by today's standards it's downright tame. Watching people play with their food is not particularly erotic. Mickey Rourke turns in an atrocious performance, smirking his way through the whole thing. Kim Basinger comes off slightly better but she's not nearly good enough to save this dreck. How they ever stretched this movie to a length of nearly two hours is beyond me. There's not even enough story here to sustain a 30-minute TV show, much less a full-length feature film.

36,oneloveall,Too much focus on the now stilted sensuality takes away from any real story,6,28 May 2007,"One of erotic cinemas more successful outings, wonderfully captured in the mid-80's, nevertheless remained the glorified soft-core escapist piece of sexual indulgence it distracts us from acknowledging. Hoping the film would have offered more complexity, being it came from sexual-sophisticate Adrian Lynne, the screenplay, offered by (skinemax regular) Red Shoe Diaries creator Zalman King, should have been the first clue as to this film's carnal intent.Even so, what perhaps might have been considered red-hot back when Nine 1/2 Weeks debuted now only seems pink-hot when all the silly datedness is factored into the calculated ""sensuality"". It is this objectionable line that feels stubbornly trampled over; when the film finally begins to find it's lust-craven stride it almost always becomes derailed by the over-inflated and self-conscious nature of these performers whilst on their, by now, textbook sexual adventure full of every clichéd endeavor that has likely been borrowed from this important, though also irrelevant piece of Hollywood sex history. Each of the two leads justify the film's staying power through their unique personalities making for unique chemistry, but the whole thing smacks of just some cheesy Hollywood casting gamble then anything more. Mickey Rourke seldom looked better, but remained consistently annoying and frustratingly underwritten, all in proportion to compliment the film's high-porno vibe I suppose. Kim Basinger also looked the part just fine, and you could tell Lynne knew just how to coax the notoriously shy star into one of her most naturally vulnerable performances. But short of excessive gazes that wear out their emotional meaning way too quickly, these two performers are not able to take anything to the higher level their actions desperately try to convince.To Nine 1/2 Week's credit, the film does becomes slightly more meaningful near the end. When all the increasingly unbelievable, kinky sex scenes have been exhausted, King's script finally has something to say about lust, relationships, and most importantly the male psyche. It is the ambiguously creepy tone in relaying Rourke's actions which will maintain any level of interest after any sexual repetition sets in. Whether the movie retains much purpose for the individual viewer will be questionable, but what is not questionable is that Nine 1/2 Weeks remains one of the classier soft-core escapades of modern mainstream film.",9½ Weeks
37,skay_baltimore,Still one of my favorite movies,8,3 January 2012,"I saw this movie over 15 years ago, and was impressed with the way it handled the complex human emotions that permeate all romantic relationships. I was curious if I'd like it as much now as I did back then. And the answer is: yes, I did. Maybe even more so.For some reason this movie is loathed by many critics and viewers. I honestly do not know why. The interplay between the Type-A, controlling, cold power player John, and the lost, insecure divorcée Liz is palpable. Slowly, sensually, John begins to probe past Liz's defenses as he opens her up to things she'd never experienced before. The movie highlights how passion, while not always pretty, is an integral part of human emotions. And how once a person enters that dimension, it's necessary to keep upping the ante in order to keep experiencing the thrill that was so welcome at the start.

42,dataconflossmoor,Where He Puts His Hands is Her Business!!,10,3 April 2007,"The eighties was a decade which gave illusion to the fact that old values were back, and, the sexual revolution was reminiscent of the values which were seemingly more pertinent to the radical, counter culture era of the 1960's! In 1986, Ronald Reagan was President, and the oxford clad camaraderie, which was indicative of the 1980's, sparked a resurgence in naivety!! The avaricious demeanor to the eighties evoked an interpretive translation to wanting everything, once the bedroom door closed, these same ambitions prevailed!! The fact is, that in the 1980's, novice sexual excursions with the non conventional were alive and well, and, the proverbial horse was let out of the barn for good and keeps!! The truth is, that after punching straight Republican ticket, this same person could have gone home and engaged in a wild orgy! Socially salacious isolation afflicts virtually everyone, and sexual proclivities satiate all walks of life, no one cultural stereotype is immune! This is what the movie ""Nine 1/2 Weeks"" dealt with! Suffice it to say, this film fascinated the core 18-32 movie market audience!!Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger are WONDERFUL! in this movie! It is all about a ghoulish curiosity concerning the taboo!! What titillates the hedonistic carnal fancy? How far are we allowed to go? However far, let's go further! They might use the aspects of variational experimentation as a sophisticated subterfuge.. however, the fact remains.. these lustfully induced desires have made these two people no more civilized than timber wolves who happen to have a Fifth Ave clothing budget! The moral disengagement which has besieged both Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke has left a bevy of unanswered questions that they are petrified of responding to! Kim Basinger's perpetual subservience to everything has welcomed in an onslaught of psychological repercussions which have precariously nurtured her overall insecurity! A dangerously lethal prerequisite to cosmopolitan living seems to encompass the element of intricate sexual detachment from day to day living...For both parties involved, New York City has provided a cold shoulder which is null and void of scruples! This objective imperviousness has accommodated these emotionless charades of sexual deviancy all too conveniently!! Mickey Rourke's callous gratification finally barrages him with recriminations!! At some point, he may not have his cake and eat it too!! (Literally!!) Those are the ground-rules!!I loved this movie!!! Kim Basinger is absolutely beautiful!! In so many of her films, she is so beautiful, that the rest of the movie usually seems uneventful!! This movie's double-entendre to so many food items, accommodates an intrigue to this film that captivates the movie goer, (particulairly if you are a man)... The bottom line is that this film illustrates how sexual depravity often times makes you uncomfortable with the type of person you have become!! By and large, your sense of immediate fruition is very dehumanizing.. For Mickey Rourke and Kim Bassinger, their dubiously intuitive dispositions seem to assuage their decrepit sense of moral imperatives! These two characters were victimized by their own indulgences, and decimated by the causes and effects of clinical debauchery, but once again, those are the ground-rules!!!""Nine 1/2 Weeks"" is an Eighties classic!!! Conservative values were for magazine covers...Perversion is a candid activity for people who have had more than four drinks in an evening!! Terrific acting, and the artistic unconventional-ism to the entire genre of this film, makes ""Nine 1/2 Weeks"" totally fabulous entertainment!! See it if you have not seen it already!! While this movie is mild by today's standards, there is a mystique to this film that sufficiently quells the yearning to partake in the very macabre and nonchalant recreational activities associated with casual sex! ""Nine 1/2 Weeks"" expedited a myriad of deranged sexual mannerisms very effectively! Ultimately, ""9 1/2 Weeks"" sufficiently conveyed its deliberately disconcerting message of: The fact is, sordid sex, is indeed, an ersatz alternative to a healthy relationship!!",9½ Weeks
43,Kakueke,Glass more than half empty,4,20 November 2001,"Yes, the substantive nonsexual elements of this movie are not much.  Plus, the dialogue is trite and the characters other than the principal two are city-blah, certainly not compelling.  The smile of Mickey Rourke (he plays ""John"") is intriguing but bores after a while.  As for Kim Basinger (""Liz""), her acting performance is not the best in the world.  The ending is not good, much is inane.  But let's grant the film the favor of commenting on what it is really about.Nine 1/2 Weeks is is an exposition on sexual fantasies, quite a variety of them, but strictly soft-porn -- more like soft-soft porn.  It really is not very revealing and does not have hot sex scenes.  The movie is about male dominance, female submission.  The assumption from many would be, yes a man can certainly get into male dominance, of course, although that is not all men either.  However, Nine 1/2 Weeks is seen by much of the intelligentsia of both sexes as something a woman can get into, too, while some women resent it.  But for one thing, I just think the movie, to fulfill its purpose, could have included some female dominance stuff too. You know, men can get into that too, some anyway.  For women with their antenna out, that would not be so bad, would it?  But I guess it would, if the overall premise is criticized and consistency is observed.  Anyway, the movie could have been a bit longer to accommodate this desire for those who wanted it, with scattered nonsex junk cut as well.Another issue is camera work, camera choices (I won't say cinematography). Readers can trust me, I hope, in saying it is not my fantasy for a women to crawl on her hands and knees, rear up, to me.  When it comes to food substances, perhaps there can be some broader-based appeal.  In other words, I am suggesting that, based on the variety of things it can offer, maybe more men would enjoy some aspect of wet and messy than they do a women crawling.  Maybe not.  But on this premise, I suggest that a problem with the scenes involving food--cherries, honey, other liquids--was that the photography was too close up.  Maybe the ice scene was OK as is.  But for the rest, it appeared the director wanted to be restrained--less coverage, no broader, more elaborate images.  No whipped cream (or other things one could think up), limited facial coverage, in these scenes, no nudity.  Like the lack of regular sex content.I liked the outdoor rain/shower scene, and the dance-and-strip (sort of) -to-music scene.  The ""spank"" rape scene?  Even if someone has some deep-seated fantasy resembling this in any way, I question whether anyone can be entertained by such a basic (or, base) and immediate presentation as was made here.   I also question whether most men like this sort of thing at all.  It is just not nice, and unimaginative.A similar comment on the blindfolds.  I did not like these scenes, and the close-ups again hurt.  Again, who knows what everyone's bondage fantasies involving ropes or string are?  But this was not explored.All in all, though, I think the main shortfall was that this was basically fantasy without much sex.  Lisa, with John, clothed, spreading her legs on a bed in the store in front of the middle-aged women was amusing, but also a metaphor for the movie.  Something more could have been worked in, and more thought (not just mine) could have been put into it, and, at least for me, some things could have been taken out.  The grade is mixed:  good, bad, and incomplete.   Men will do better if they watch movies in the Ginger series or Shannon Tweed movies.",9½ Weeks

But I guess I knew that even before starting to watch this movie and that may also have been my real agenda. Still I tried to give it a chance. Waiting for something good to happen that will negate what other reviews say about the movie. But sadly that never happened. Finally I did go past the point of no salvage.After that it was just skipping the scenes and watching Kim Basinger. If you are coming for just watching Basinger in compromising positions, then this is a very good movie for that. There are a lot of memorable scenes. Playing with food, a bit of S&M, exhibitionism and a little gender bender. A little perverted but still sexy. Just understand that this is all you are going to get. It is made to appeal to male viewers. But I am hard pressed to guess the age. Basinger is too old for a young audience and the movie is a little juvenile for older audience.

Adrian Lyne's expertise is revealed in every shot. Sensual and full of detail, the film goes beyond the eroticism, or whether if it is about domination or not. Apart from persistent sexual references, the film centers (in a subliminal way) into the inner world of Liz. It is easy to identify with her, thanks to the importance given to gestures, looks, emotional reactions, her private life when she is alone, ... all this (and more) makes the movie has an introspective approach.Adrian Lyne has the ability to turn a banal situation into something beautiful and interestingIt is a portrait of a woman wanting to experience and let herself go, but also very sensitive and able to empathize. This can be seen in her interaction with the painter, who is an artist largely disconnected from the world, living in his house in the country. When she goes to visit him to remind him his appointment with the exhibition of his paintings, she sees and understands that it is a man who lives in another reality. This is confirmed and creates a parallel in the painting exhibition, when Liz is already broken because of her relationship with John, she sees and empathizes with the painter who is totally lost and baffled at the art gallery exhibition.I do not want to get into analyze what happens to the relationship between main characters (although actually it's quite simple) because like many of the films in which there is shown or suggested sex, we should try to see a little further.8/10",9½ Weeks

Some of the stylish scenes seem embarrassing now. As for 'risky' acts, these seem tame compared to what European filmmakers (I believe Lyne is British) were doing in the sixties and seventies. There are attempts to make the story profound, but Lyne can't make a compelling narrative even with all his fast cutting and moody lighting (he's the granddaddy of all the ADD directors on MTV, like Michael Bay, etc).

49,stodruza,"From a paper thin pocket-book, Lyne takes a clumsy first draft script and makes an impressionistic masterpiece.",10,12 January 2006,"I remember this film from the great and exciting cinema of the 80's, it quietly invigorates one, tethers the soul, and makes you ask the question, ""Where have all the thoughtful and powerful movies gone?"" 9 1/2 Weeks stars Mickey Rourke as John, and Kim Bassinger as Elizabeth, as a post-modern couple smitten with each other in New York City. Through a series of erotic adventures, the young and stunning Rourke manages to estrange Elizabeth, pushing her to the edge of her sanity and her emotional boundaries.What makes this film so great is the simple dramatic story, the fact that it is so visual, and that it is shot so well. It constantly uses close ups without seeming intrusive, the casting is superb, the montages are to die for, and the camera work is excellent, as is the cinematography. It is, I believe, everything one could ever want from a film; thoughtful, smart, visual, sophisticated, and very entertaining still. What 9 1/2 Weeks is also, is a thoughtful indictment of post-modern and consumer culture, not that it did any good. From a paper thin pocket-book, Lyne takes a clumsy first draft script and makes an impressionistic masterpiece.Through many modern abstractions, what constitutes modern living, the people in this film loose the connection to their core being. This is constantly being played with in the film, from the fish motif started in the very first scenes, to the art gallery showing toward the end of the film, which spreads out post-modern decadence and its foibles for us like a buffet.This film, by the way, anchors beautifully in the subplot of Elizabeth's friend, Molly, who, with her average looks, average intellect, and lack of sophistication, by the end of the film winds up in a better place than our protagonist. By contrasting the main theme in the subplot and paying off the script resonates more completely, adding another dimension to the theme.",9½ Weeks
50,Nolamoviedude,50 Shades of the 80's,4,27 December 2018,"Mickey Rourke plays a mysterious 80's yuppie who gets involved with a somewhat sexually inexperienced art dealer played by Kim Basinger. He plays a lot of mind games with her. He blind folds her and pours a bunch of food products like milk, honey, and fruit all over her. Is this sexy? I thought about the stickiness of it all and the mess on the kitchen floor. Anyway, she's very submissive to him. He makes her stay at his apartment (she could leave if she wanted) on multiple occasions. There's a scene where he tells her to lift her skirt and remove her panties because she needs a spanking. She is pissed, tells him no, then fights him. He pins her to the kitchen table, rips off her panties and takes her. At this point she is an active participant but very fine line between role play and rapey.There's another odd scene where Basinger wears a mustache and tux then makes out with Rourke in a fancy restaurant. What's the point of this scene? I get how the movie is about the dark lusty side of people but this scene made me think the film is just one big production for shock value.All is well between our two young over-sexed professionals until Rourke hires a cheap hooker for a 3some.

I think that this plot should have been developed above all as a psychological drama. But it is exactly psychology that is missing here. Instead, it relies on visual teasing. But a film is more than mere photography. Rourke is totally inappropriate for this role. His sweet smile, being on his face time and again, starts looking idiotic as the plot develops. Elizabeth, who is the central character, is also unrealistic. What is it that drives her into this dangerous and humiliating relationship? Taste for danger and adventure? Loneliness? Greed to catch a Wall street man? Masochism? We are not told to the very end. This film is a very pretentious attempt to reveal female eroticism but I think it fails in this.

54,notaprincess9,Way too good to be true,5,14 September 2017,"Kim Basinger portrays an ordinary woman with an ordinary job whose life is so boring she's ready to be swept off her feet by an attractive rich man. Right from the start he comes off as very sure of himself, playing the macho man who knows he can have any woman, places his arms around her, holds her hand and they haven't known each other for an hour. The film is so smooth though someone may miss the signs. We see them having fun, we see him playing tricks on her, buying her expensive gifts, playing with her like a little child, chasing after some children all smiles and joy. We also see them having fun in the bedroom where he always takes the lead. But at moments, there are scenes in which we see him get mad at her when she doesn't follow his orders like she always did and throw or hit things. He doesn't stop even when she's crying and afraid of him. He only tries to wipe the incidents out of her memory by kissing her and having sex with her. No apology, no talk over the matter, no self-examination in order to become a better man.That is because he simply does not care about what she wants. This is a game to him. He finds vulnerable women looking for a thrill, he manipulates them with his charming ways, gifts and money and then he asks them to do things they perhaps would have never done if it were not for him. When they do not comply, he loses control and shows his bad side. It is easy for someone to fall for his good looks, soft voice and great sense of style and the film does exactly that: it puts you in Kim Basinger's shoes. You fall in love with John (Mickey Rourke) like she did, so you do understand why she hasn't left yet or why it took her so long to leave him but you also feel the heartache she experiences when he doesn't show up like she asked him to -do something for her for a change. It is easy to judge her character in this film or any real woman over their decision not to leave a toxic or abusive person, but the truth is, every human being doesn't want to believe their partner does not love them. We try to find excuses to justify their mistakes, we hope they will change over time, we tell ourselves the good times are more than the bad ones and we've become so emotionally attached we can't just throw it all away for a couple of flaws.

Of course Basinger's acting is also impeccable, although I believe that Rourke does brooding /introspective better than he does happy. I have to say that the sexual games do seem to come across as a little one-sided - always Rourke directing a game for Basinger - and not the other way. It would have been interesting to see a role reversal on occasion.This film has been compared to 'Last Tango' and the obvious similarity is that Brando and Rourke only open up about their personal lives at the end - and ONLY when Maria and Kim - DON'T want to know ,are not interested and are in fact ready to leave. Very interesting that Rourke says 'I love you' AFTER Basinger has left and the door is closed.

This film is classy, arty, stylish, romantic, sexy and have a deeper meaning. The way Mr Lyne has directed the film I know Kim Basinger went through a lot but if she didn't, this film wouldn't be this good and chemistry between those actors wouldn't be this superb. This film has been my all time favourite. I have always been open about sex as I am not shy to say I enjoy it a lot, open about it and like to explore and I am sure a lot of people do and there is nothing wrong in admitting it, it's one of the joy which life has given you, enjoy it until you are able to. I believe in films these days, sex should be exposed more than it is now without being labelled ""porn"" and censorship system should change too which restricts the directors and producers and limits the audience and limits the promotion. That's why I am a big fan of European cinema than American as they have more tolerance and I have great respect for directors like Lars Von Trier, Gaspar Noe and Paul Verhoeven. This film is way better than that boring 50 shades which has the exact story but wait which film or book was released first? no no actually which book is based on a true story (do your own research on that).

If you are looking for a good love story, or a more or less suspenseful erotic thriller (such as Basic Instinct), forget it. This movie features a number of sequences of sexual contents, the story is somewhat between them and plays a completely minor role in my opinion. The ice-cube scene lost its attraction, but the scene Kim Basinger stripping to Joe Cocker's ""You can leave your hat on"" is still pretty cool I think. Whenever I hear this song - it's actually one of my favourite songs - it has reminded me of that scene througout the years. The soundtrack is completely 80's stuff, so if you like Cocker, Eurythmics or J.M. Jarre, it will fit your taste.

In other words, the movie too often gets off on what it opposes--much like films that purport to be against rape, yet linger too much over a rape scene.I don't wish to say that ""Nine 1/2 Weeks"" is always too explicit, but it is on enough occasions to merit the word ""hypocrisy"" or the term ""soft porn."" These instances not only make the message a lie, but the movie itself suffers as a movie on its account. This film is a hothouse of fetishization--it is almost worldless. I mean who is this John?  For a half the movie we ask this but after that I mean does anyone really care about his ""mystery.""

Like its predecessor, critics and audiences were divided in regards to the films artistic value. Some saw it as exploitive, soft core pornography. Most audiences were evidently so distracted by the firestorm of controversy of both films, that they either side stepped around the artistic merit of Nine 1/2 Weeks, or they were simply distracted/repulsed by it and chose to dismiss its worth. Perhaps the most surprising aspect to me about this film was how tame it is. Perhaps our over stimulated, over sexualised, desensitised present day has numbed my inner prude, but I really fail to see how the sex in this film was such a big deal in 1986?At the very centre of this film is a love story without the happy ending. It's also a sentiment on surfaces, and how the 80s were all about appearance. This could not be more relevant in 2014, a time when we seem to have taken a few steps backward rather than forward in regard to artificiality, greed and vanity. John and Elizabeth could very much exist in today's world... John, a man motivated purely by money and sex, and Elizabeth - a lonely woman probably looking for an exit from her superficial life. Her exit is provided by John and an exhausting, passionate and at times aloof and disturbing affair begins. It's a relatively simple story, but its execution and performances are where it succeeds. One of the most amazing things about this film is its cinematography. New York City never looked so enticing with its fog shrouded, Canyon like rain swept streets, to its wet and misty alley ways, it really as important to the film as its central characters. Only in New York can a man meet a woman at a market in such a fleetingly brief encounter, fall in love, and have it all disintegrate in a matter of weeks.

I can't imagine why MGM has not came out yet with a director's cut. It'd be great to watch the harder scenes. They would make the movie even powerful. Unfortunately an American studio in the 80s was not brave enough to make a pharmacological sex drama harder. Nowadays these topics are much more accepted at least in Europe. If you've read Elisabeth McNeill's novel you can imagine what is missing from this movie. It's funny that they call it soft porn in the US. I hope that Adrian Lyne will make his own version on a DVD, this film deserves it. Kim Basinger once told in an interview that this movie was the hardest for her and made her stronger than ever. I can imagine. Painful, sensitive, intelligent with so strong contents... a masterpiece!!!",9½ Weeks

And it's strange that their relationship went on only 9 and a half weeks and whole 9 and a half weeks. The relationship like their had to finish and to finish by break.

72,kristy_chan,Queer Content & The Rape Scene,4,3 March 2005,"Overall, I think this movie is sexually inventive, especially by 1986 Hollywood standards. The suggestive cues imbued in sounds, textures, and food, combined with actual nudity, is so hot. Basinger and Rourke are still hot, despite a radically changed fashion landscape. It's not the best movie of all time, but it wasn't painful, either. There's a few points that caught my attention: 1. First, there is a scene in the film that definitely queers heterosexuality. Kim Basinger's character Elizabeth in one scene is dressed in (shabby) drag, and as she and John (Mickey Rourke) leave the restaurant, they are gay-bashed. The suggestion that straight people can be victims of homophobia, or that straight people involved in BDSM defy notions of normative heterosexuality, is a radical suggestion for a 1986 Hollywood film. In the following scene, a flamboyant man is talking, and he seems really gay, also, so again, there is another subtle suggestion...2. What's up with the little girl sitting on the stairs at the Chelsea Hotel? What does she symbolize? Someone on IMDb.com thought it meant Elizabeth was pregnant, but I took it as an expression of Elizabeth's power position in the relationship. She kind of became ""a little girl"", but not so much that she was below patting an actual little girl on the head.3. When John throws Elizabeth down on the table, is he raping her? The ambiguity here is frustrating to me, especially considering that the 1980's were still full of actual cases where women were blamed for their rapes. It is frustrating to me that we cannot discern whether or not Elizabeth is being raped (and that ambiguity is projected as acceptable to an audience who might not otherwise be sympathetic to rape victims). It is also frustrating that if Elizabeth really is being raped in this scene, it ends with her ""enjoying it"". Again, not the most socially responsible scene. For people who adhere to the ""safe, sane, consensual"" ethos of BDSM, it might be a hot rape play scene, but I think it's not really socially responsible to just sneak it in a movie that Joe Date Rape might go see.",9½ Weeks
73,Faimadio,Movies as psychotherapy?,5,21 March 2005,"This is one of many movies that were 'prescribed' to me by my shrink who believed in their effectiveness in therapy. At first I could not understand the connection between a film and a psychological problem. But then it became clear that both are about a 'fantasy'. Almost everyone in society is living a fantasy that can be as far removed or as close to reality as the person wishes. Of course, if the that person is a head of state dragging his country into war or running after Utopian dreams then the harm done is that much more greater.Now a film is also a fantasy, but it is the very exact and deliberate fantasy of the director. When we see a movie we are transported into that fantasy and we live it in vivid detail and color in all our visual and mental senses. We also live it in our subconscious senses as well, and herein lies its value. Seeing what has been thus far deeply embedded and intertwined inside us now on screen and out in the open helps begin the separation process (between reality and fantasy). Since the distinction between the fantasy of the movie and your current reality is very clear, and since you willingly entered the movie fantasy by your own choice until it overlapped with your inner similar fantasy; you can get to experience the willful 'exiting' of the movie fantasy that would subsequently help you to 'exit' your inner fantasy in the future. Well, it's a little more complicated than that, but this isn't the best place to discuss in deep psychotherapy techniques.Of course I'm not suggesting that, in and of its self, a movie would cure anybody of anything; that has to be the work of a professional, and it's his or her decision as to whether or not to incorporate it into the therapy process. But I am curious as to whether anyone else has ever 'used' movies in this sense or at least experienced their psychological effect either consciously or subconsciously.",9½ Weeks
74,lovely1249,Interesting movie and great,8,3 January 2006,"This movie was very interesting and had a great background story. I had never seen this movie before but I kept on hearing about it after nineteen years. I had to see the movie "" Wild Orchid"" and I fell in love with Mickey Rourke. I wanted to see what he looked like before he had the implants in his cheeks. I thought he looked sexy and so did Kim Basinger.But it was Mickey that kept drawing me to this movie. The premise of the movie is about an art dealer named Elizabeth that was going through a divorce. She did not think very highly of herself and she kind of lost her sensuality. She meets this man named John and he buys her this expensive gift to start off their rocky relationship. The viewer can tell the man is rich but you really do not know what he does for a living. He wines and dines her. Before she knows she is doing things that she would not do. She lets him blindfold her to show that she trusts him and lets him buy her clothes. I love it when he says that he wants to cook for her, bathe her, dress her and etc. I guess it sounds very good that a man wants to all this but then you realize that she is a grown woman that can do all this herself. The second interesting part is when he picks out a suit for her and she says don't you want to know if i like it. he says no. It was all about manipulation all through the relationship. The breaking point was when he had her blind fold herself in this hotel, only to let a hooker try to feel her up. He was watching the whole time just to see if she was going to let this happen just to please him. Finally, she fights back and refuses to let this happen. She starts to leave and he starts getting it on with the hooker. Elizabeth breaks it up and tries to show him how she feels by going into a strip club to kiss a total stranger. But she does not have it in her to be like him. In the end she gets out of the bed in tears and starts packing her clothes.She is strong enough to leave this S&M relationship because it is not healthy for her. This movie surprised me in the end because I thought he was going to run after her. Mickey was very sexy and fine in this movie. He sold this movie to me. Kim was great at the feeding scene in front of the refrigerator. Even though this movie was not a block bluster movie it still has a good plot and point to the story. After really thinking about the movie I realized that he loved her in the end of the movie. Although he made her go through all these things, he was testing her on how strong she cared for him. During the movie,it portrays John as this heartless and mysterious man that you can not understand. But in the end you realized that he was a man that hid behind his games so he did not get hurt. John got hurt at the end even when he tried so hard not to. I highly recommend this movie because it was a great movie.",9½ Weeks
75,jd_movie_luver,poorly executed,5,29 April 2014,"I just saw this movie for the first time without reading the book. I was familiar with the specifics of the story though so I knew what to expect. I was very disappointed in the movie though. I don't know if this is just the way 80s movies are or what, but there was so much potential for this to be a great movie but in my opinion fell way short.For one, I was majorly confused throughout most of it. They had all these little weird scenes with or without conflict and then cut away to another time with no explanation on what they were doing and why, or how the conflict was resolved. And the multiple wordless scenes with blaring music did not help.----->also in relation to this, every plot point was so subtle and shown in such a lack of detail that if I hadn't read a detailed synopsis and multiple book reviews with spoilers, I would have had no idea what was happening or why.Also, was I supposed to like John? Cause I didn't. I wanted to, but he was such an insensitive, insincere creep. I'm not sure if Mickey was trying to portray him this way or what....if he wasn't then I have serious doubts about his acting abilities. John always had that slimy fake smile on his face and never talked, and when he did it was so soft-spoken and hardly made sense. I don't know, I think the movie would've benefited with another actor, someone more charming and charismatic. I was really disappointed because I feel like this has the potential to be a really great, thought provoking, almost painful and beautiful movie, but almost every aspect of it fell short, from the writing to the acting to the editing to the music. They need to do a remake. In the mean time, I'll read the book and try to get the picture of creepy movie John out of my head while I'm doing so.",9½ Weeks
76,njashanmal,An ignored and Marginalized Film,8,1 April 2000,"Except perhaps in Paris where, until recently, it played in a cinema just off the Champs Elysee.  This film has been condemned from just about every possible, so I will not try and defend it blow by blow.  There is much to appreciate here, particularly when the film is looked at in the context of it being the '80's ""Last Tango In Paris"" - perhaps even self consciously so. The opening shot of ""Nine 1/2 Weeks"" echoes the famous opening of ""Last Tango In Paris"" and there are many parallels, but never to the point of it becoming overt.If one accepts that form is to mirror content and apply that here it becomes clear that efforts were made to do so.  The visual 'look' of both films not only mirror their content (for 'Tango': a muted color pallette, yet somehow lush, there is a layer over everything) but also their era.  Both films deal with similar subject matter, in the context of the time in which they were made.""Nine 1/2 Weeks"" IS the '80's in much the way that ""Last Tango..."" is the '70's - the obsessions of an era are embodied in the struggle of two human bodies.  Motions, touches are imbued with something beyond what is happening in the here and now.  Very much in question here is the internal landscape of the characters involved - something one, as a filmmaker, would rather expose in a visual way as opposed to having characters pontificate about it (though Brando TALKS in ""Last Tango..."" it is very often what he doesn't say, the silence between two lines of dialogue, that SAY more) - in ""Nine 1/2 Weeks"" there are many visual cues/pointers as to the characters' states of mind, i.e. their apartments, the manner in which they are decorated stark, all straight lines (John) vs. cluttered and dusty (Liz).  Elements like that make a film work.The only moments of relief that Liz experiences in the film are when she is away from the city, away from John, amidst nature with the painter - in fact, one almost never sees John outside, just like Paul in ""Last Tango..."" - all these little cues about character should raise the questions in the viewer's mind - what sort of person would?...",9½ Weeks

79,Tuki-Clothespin,underrated for sure,7,23 September 2005,"I agree with the writer who mentioned that this film is too often underrated because it deals with a very dark side of sexuality that many people deny in society and in themselves. The relationship portrayed in the film is an adult one, and as such it is not a Little Mary Sunshine portrayal. It is a mature look at sex, not love, and it never pretends to be a romance. The characters find each other and they enjoy each other in a way that many people cannot accept, and therein lies the reality, the truth of this film, as well as the reason that it is consistently overlooked. For an established actress like Kim Basinger to accept this role and play it as naturally as she did speaks to her talent as well at to her willingness to explore alternate ""romantic"" ideas on film. Mickey Rouke has always been a maverick force in film. Look at him in ""Diner"" and you will see what I mean by that. He is much more talented than people give him credit for, and younger filmophiles should discover this early work and try to perceive him as an actor, not a joke.",9½ Weeks
80,Ezekielwheelwork,A Senseless Exploration Of Male and Female Lust,3,26 August 2005,"The only reason I bought the DVD was to satisfy my curiosity about the scene when Liz (Kim Basinger) strips to the music of Joe Cocker: You Can Leave Your Hat On! That was the best part of the whole film. Not because the scene was any good; only the song. I am not saying it was a terribly bad film just not that good. Disappointingly so!Especially when the exploration of male and female sexuality could have been expanded upon. Instead of expanding on the dangerous side of lust, obsession and infatuation and where it can lead to it drags its heels obscurely from one idea to the other. For example when John (played by Rourke) is able to leave her on the top of the Big Wheel, Liz (Kim Basinger) is unconvincingly rattled at the bizarre experience courtesy of John's sense of humor but less rattled at his sexual exploits involving the ever willing Liz; and like one reader mentioned, that for a woman to enjoy sex she has to experience the dangerous side is unconvincing. This ""dangerous"" side is not exploited enough in the film and one gets a sense of anti-climax from the view point that it all could go horribly wrong. The theme of bondage makes an appearance often but only just takes one to the brink of danger and then all goes well.Is the film sending the message out that this kind of ""foreplay"" is FINE! If the film was making a point about the pitfalls of bondage and by extension the ugly ramifications of sad-masochism then maybe it would make a good moral point. Instead the film awkwardly jumps from one ""sizzling"" scene of Rourke feeding Basinger and blindfolding her to another. In a film that could have been good it falls flat on its face because it does not expand and extend the themes the film is MAYBE trying to relate; thus for me it doesn't have a plot nor a theme just a mixture of ideas.",9½ Weeks

85,tram7573,my thoughts,8,10 December 2007,"I've always been crazy about this movie. I first saw it when I was 14 years old (in 1987, a year after it came out). At that time, my hormones were raging, and frankly I just got off on it. However, I also thought it was a visually beautiful film with a cool soundtrack. Not to mention, Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke are great to look at. I think the acting was decent on the part of both, but stronger from Kim Basinger. You really saw and palpably felt her vulnerability and overall anguish. I personally think it is her best performance to date.My main critique of the movie has always been that it didn't strike me as all that severely ""shocking"" in sexual content. Even for 20/25 years ago, none of the sexual activity that took place struck me, even then, as so incredibly ""S & M."" Most of the stuff they did is stuff that I'd like to do, and I'm a far-cry from being into S & M. The ""rape"" scene wasn't much of a rape, and I would argue that LOTS of women, even ones not into S & M, like the idea of being thrown on a table and a hot guy sort of forcing himself on you, especially if it's your boyfriend who you're attracted to but just happen to be mad at for that particular moment. The food in front of the refrigerator -- granted, not everyone gets that playful with sex -- but is it really so evil and dominating/submissive? Having sex standing up in a clock tower after running up several flights of stairs? Sounds great... Even her dressing up as a man...that seems more dorky than it is domination/submission. The fight they had with the thugs...didn't seem like something ""John"" planned in order to humiliate her or dominate her; it's just something they ran into.In essence, the film always left me thinking ""What's the big deal?"" I couldn't even imagine why she'd leave him, based on most of the stuff they did. (SOME things were out of line and scary, but not most...and the things that were a little shocking were things he SAID, not anything they actually did)I recently read the actual memoir by Elizabeth McNeil, and liked it a lot. It's an amazing book. Well-written and didn't strike me as outdated for being written in 1978. I loved it...It even reinforced my view that the movie was not anything jaw-dropping. The book is much more serious about the S & M activity. The movie was done much more like a romance, and that's okay, really. But even if you're going to turn the book into more of a romance, it still could have stood to be a little more faithful to the book as far as seriousness of sexual activity.",9½ Weeks

Rourke was hot, better than his ""just been hit by a truck look"" in Wrestler. This is in my top 25 best. I am sure this could have been made today and it would be more graphic. Some things are sexier when some mystery remains intact. I hope they never remake this.

This movies was a very big hit in Europe when first came out. It was the most talk about movie of the year because of his extremely unique and modern approach to sexuality in a film. I was very young when this movie came out, but i still remember the big fuss about it. The director is one of the best director, he challenged himself constantly, his movies are never boring or dull and he like to take chances which many directors are very afraid to do it. Nine and 1/2 weeks is a very interesting movie to watch, because it is about what is going on between this 2 people, in an emotional level. Which can be pretty scary for the intensity of that. It is not about sex, it goes beyond that. It is a very innovative movie that it would always be remembered for changing the rules about making movies that are considered erotic.

They meet, they hook up and before you know it, embark in a very passionate, sexual relationship. A lot of people misconstrue as to what the film is actually about - it's not just an excuse for us to have glimpses of Kim Basingers extremely sexy body, but in fact the movie is about control - simple as you say it. John is very controlling and he found the perfect partner in Liz's submission. However, once his controlling tendencies stretched beyond the 'norm' (him inviting a prostitute into their 'games' without her permission) she realised that this isn't who she is and that she had to get out. Unfortunately this was when John decided to tell her about his life - too little too late. The ending used to have me in tears because you felt for both characters by this stage.

98,rolfie77,Mickey Rourke completely underrated,8,6 March 2009,"What amazed me about this film was the underappreciation for Mickey Rourke's performance. After watching the film a couple of times I am far less fascinated by Kim Basinger than by Rourke's character Jon. Sure Jon was very aggressive sexually with Elizabeth, and many seem to understand this as being crude or offensive. Instead Jon strikes me as being more honest than slimy. While other men in Jon's position, a wealthy commodities broker, would try to use his position to win over Elizabeth, Jon just straight-forward lets her know that he wants her. I also don't think Jon merely wants Elizabeth for sex. Clearly he enjoys her company for more than just that, in fact he shares a great deal of his world with her. I think what is offensive about Rourke's character is that Jon is so unapologetically male. First, Jon has a high-powered job which at the time was extremely risky and lucrative. Yeah, while Jon lives in a fancy apartment and buys Elizabeth nice things, it is clear that he is not a trust-fund baby but a guy who worked his way to the top with determination and balls.That helps explain the most difficult scene in the movie. Elizabeth has been snooping through his stuff and Jon returns enraged and semi-rapes Elizabeth. Earlier that evening Jon had promised to take care of Elizabeth and provide for her every need, which is quite a commitment, and he leaves her alone for a short time but finds that he already cannot really trust her. His response to her actions is bizarre, first he wants to spank her then he forcefully makes love to her. Is it abusive? Yes probably. What the hell does it mean? Well, here you have a guy who is in an extremely competitive position where he has scrapped his way to the top. In his position weakness and vulnerability get you decimated in your job, and most women you meet probably only want you for your money. Jon takes a chance with a girl he meets randomly who he seems to have a real connection with, and almost from the get-go she compromises his trust. He forces himself on her because he is desperate to have connection with somebody who will be a refuge for him, yet from his perspective he already cannot trust her. The rest of the movie, all of the sexual escapades, including the sex scene at the end with the prostitute is Jon trying to determine how much he should really give himself to Elizabeth. The scene where Elizabeth shows up at his work is indicative of this. Clearly he is not happy at first that she showed up there. Judging from the size of his office this guy is at the pinnacle of success, and letting somebody he isn't sure he can trust into that world is very risky for him. Not only does it reveal himself to her, but it reveals to the other people around him that he is vulnerable. For men of power in that kind of position, vulnerability can destroy their careers.The prostitute scene at the end wasn't just some other kinky escapade. I think it was a final test for Jon so that he would know whether Elizabeth was really committed to him or not, or if she was only viewing their relationship as a sexual game. To him it was the only way to know how exclusively she cared about him. When she reacted by making out with the random guy in the porn theater, Jon finally understood that she really did care about him. By that point, however he had destroyed any trust she had in him.Basinger's character, Elizabeth in contrast, was far less complicated. She enjoys her friends, has a good relationship with her parents, and even has a decent relationship with her ex-husband. If you contrast the type of jobs the two have in the movie, it is easy to see the dramatic differences in their lives. Elizabeth casually jokes with her boss and co-workers, and the biggest pressure in her life is whether an artist will show up at a show. This movie was about all of the things that sex communicates, and ultimately Rourke brilliantly pulls off a complicated character who is unabashedly male and dying to be vulnerable at the same time.",9½ Weeks
99,wbbmh,Pretty Awful,1,29 January 2011,"My wife is out of town this weekend so I thought I would look at film I might like and she might not like. Well I was wrong on my estimate. This is the story of two people trying to feel something, so they play stupid games. On the first date, he tried to spook her, so she should have known better and run for her life. Instead she goes on a second date in which he abandons her on top of a wonder wheel while she is screaming--wow the basis of a meaningful relationship. She is obviously an educated women, so why she would put herself into this situation escapes me. I admit that there are many relationships I do not understand and this is one them. Save yourself 2 hours and (in my case) $2.99 and skip this looser of a film.",9½ Weeks
100,h_mazarakis,9 1/2 weeks is an underestimated film,10,9 February 2010,"I saw this film back in the 80's when it was released for the first time. I was 14 when I saw it but that didn't keep me from taking a deep look in the story and what was about. I saw a very nice drama and not a soft porno or a cheap music video (these things I've heard on the way). Rourke and Basinger are making the perfect shining couple. You just cant stop looking at them. The acting is good, not excellent but quite convincing in my own eyes. The magic about this movie is this sense of the beloved 80's that runs through it. Jack Nitzsche's music is excellent! The way it takes you in the story is really something else. Andrian Lyne makes you listen to the heartbeat of the storyline and guides his actors in a talented way. 9 1/2 weeks is a movie that left its mark and it's there 24 years now.",9½ Weeks
101,nicholas9k,piano piece -background music.....????,10,13 June 2005,"Ever since i saw that movie, for nearly 20 years ago.i have from time to time tried to find that piece of music. That are played at the end of the movie.. it is a very slow and nice.. :o) -yet sad piece... i think it might be played in the movie in short pieces.. it is played only on piano.. if not..? -it is the piano music from the end i am looking for.. I have found several places on the internet, stating it should be by Michael Hoenig (which not appears on the soundtrack) (-nor credited at the end of the movie..) i have search, and search literally for years.. and many of the young persons who work in the different music/CD shops, have never heard of that movie, so i keep on running towards a ""dead end"" do ANYONE out-there..!? -know if it is possible to get the piece of music on either:CD, tape, free download, pay download..nicholas9k@ hot mail.com",9½ Weeks
102,ilytiffburger,Wow..,10,24 July 2013,"It's interesting how both characters find themselves together, It's pure chance, you can see instantly that John is intrigued by Elizabeth, during the meeting stage you see that she is scared of him, because she doesn't know what to think. During there time together and there sexual games Elizabeth's desires entwine with John's and they head towards a disastrous ending... I was confused about the hooker part though... Was it about control? I don't know but you could see that Elizabeth definitely had enough I was gob-smacked about the ending, shocked really, It was only at the end that John tells Elizabeth about himself but she still leaves, I wanted her to go back so badly and I was stunned when she didn't... As I said wow great performances from both Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke this is definitely one of my favorites left me with a mix of feelings... Wow is all I can say thumbs up to Adrian Lyne for this movie about A women spending 9 1/2 weeks with the perfect stranger... Amazing !.",9½ Weeks
103,silky-1,Incredibly Thought-Provoking,10,7 August 2006,"This movie still rates high in my Top 10 Favorites. Basinger and Rourke have the right chemistry it takes to make this movie a success. I can't see anyone else playing either role. In this day and age of accepted nudity, 9 1/2 Weeks leaves enough to the imagination to make this movie highly-erotic by most standards. It leaves the imagination wide open to explore our own inner-workings and desires. Everyone of legal age should watch this movie, more than once. I've watched it at least a dozen times since 1992 and have gotten something 'different' out of it each time. Everyone will get something different from this movie, but it must be watched with an open mind. The movie had to end the way it did or it wouldn't have made sense otherwise. It's incredibly thought-provoking, and left me with various emotions throughout every scene. For anyone who hasn't seen it, it's worth every highly-charged minute.",9½ Weeks
104,ken_jennings-1,Porn flick trying to disguise itself as mainstream entertainment.,2,21 August 2005,"Not much more needs to be said. The subject matter is something that belongs in the hidden, adult-only section of the video rental shop on the corner. It is merely a porn flick trying to pass as mainstream entertainment. Considering it was filmed during an era of irresponsible sex (at least in entertainment industry circles), it is almost understandable why the producers thought it was a good idea. Almost.Of course everyone finds sex enticing and this is the reason why everyone I know watched this movie. Only people in the entertainment industry might have considered the plot and character motivations realistic. (My primary purpose for watching this was to locate the performance of an extra who I personally know and was not credited with the cast.)",9½ Weeks
105,Elizabeth-M-1972,A favourite!,10,8 March 2018,"This film is really special.
I've seen it many many times. I've found if I'm having a bad day I'll watch it but only about half way through, you get caught up in the early stages of their relationship and feel what the characters are feeling. The second half starts to get a little heavy and you know it won't end well. A beautiful, complicated, sensual film that seems to get better with time.",9½ Weeks
