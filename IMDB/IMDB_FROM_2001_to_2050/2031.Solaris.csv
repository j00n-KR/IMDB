0,Leofwine_draca,"A lot more watchable than the Russian original, that's for sure",6,23 December 2016,"The good thing about SOLARIS is that it's a darned sight better than the OVERLONG Russian original – a four hour film in which three things happened. Steven Soderbergh's remake shaves away half the running time and focuses more on the emotional aspects of the story, and as such is by far the better film. It's gorgeous to look at, bringing to life a beautiful view of space travel and existence, and full of the director's trademark stylish flourishes. Essentially, this is a two-hander between George Clooney and Natasha McElhone, two extremely handsome actors who are accomplished performers to boot. I couldn't think of a better cast.The film delivers an eerie atmosphere despite not a lot happening. It's definitely a mood piece. The romantic scenes between Clooney and McElhone feel authentic, and the many flashback scenes are pretty moving. This is a film that explores all the aspects of the human psyche: love, lust, withdrawal, madness, acceptance, suicidal tendencies, and more. Clooney is great, but McElhone is even better, playing a flawed and sometimes frightening woman. The sci-fi trappings are kept to a minimum, which is good, and the supporting cast members are also particularly fine – most notable is Jeremy Davies in a role just as kooky as the one he took in RESCUE DAWN. I liked this film, but I didn't find it particularly enjoyable. It goes on a journey of the human soul so to speak, but I wasn't left with much in the way of insight afterwards; I didn't feel that it had developed the characters very much. Still, it's worth a watch for fans of this stuff.",Solaris
1,SnoopyStyle,you'll love this (or hate this),8,19 January 2004,"Psychologist Dr. Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) is sent to a space station to investigate an unusual phenomena experienced by his friend Dr. Gibarian. He arrives to find Gibarian and most of the crew dead. Survivors Snow (Jeremy Davies) and Dr. Gordon (Viola Davis) are mercurial. Chris Kelvin starts having visions of his dead wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone).This is a great film but a terrible movie. You love car chases, big explosions, laugh tracks, or big emotional cues. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!!! YOU WILL HATE IT. Soderbergh said it right. ""If you hate the first 10 min, walk out right away. It's not going' get any better."" The acting is terrific. Soderbergh uses all of his cinematic tricks in a minimalist vision. It opened my eyes to both GC and Soderbergh. In GC, I thought you had a popular guy who uses his charm to act his way thru most of his projects. In this, his range and acting ability is complete. Without a doubt, it is his best performance. In Soderbergh, I thought you had a good mechanical director who's able to produce hits. His best film ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"" was well behind him. In this film, he shows his experimental side and love of cinematic. There is no shot that was sub-par. This looks beautiful. The movie is able to move in some sections even without dialog. Only a true master could pull that off. Add to that, you have Natasche McElhone and Jeremy Davies in their top performances.",Solaris
2,Hitchcoc,Science Fiction Without Weapons and Starfighters,9,10 January 2017,"Once again we have people complaining about their boredom. It's so slow. A true psychological drama may appear slow because the person watching has such a short attention span and a limited world view. There, I've said it, Mister 1 out of 10. I prefer the Russian version of this book by Stanislaw Lem, but this is a worthy interpretation. The planet Solaris has an affect on anyone that approaches it. It is a sentient organism and so it isn't there to be exploited; it's there to protect itself. When George Clooney's character is called to investigate the goings on at a space station that has been set up to investigate access to a water planet, he walks into a surreal mass of images and tricks. Something is causing personages to appear on board the space station. A child who should not be there runs down a hallway. People are committing suicide or running away, frightened or overwhelmed by emotions. Clooney, despite being a rock, still succumbs to the planet's trickery because of his great love for his lost wife. I often like to look to movies for an intellectual challenge. It doesn't always work, but there are few that don't offer something to think about.",Solaris
3,claudio_carvalho,"Highly Recommended for Insomnia - Do Not Use Sleeping Pills, Use Solaris",5,6 December 2003,"In the future, Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) is a psychiatrist sent to Solaris to analyze what is happening with the crew of a space station. There, he meets his wife, who committed suicide a few years ago. Yesterday (Friday) night I watched this movie and slept along many parts. In respect to Steven Soderbergh, I decided to watched it again today (Saturday morning) and I found it very  boring, with a monotonous soundtrack. I called a friend of mine, who also loves movies, and he told me that he slept in the movie theater and was not able to see `Solaris'. Therefore, it seems that the intention of Steven Soderbergh was indeed to make a substitute for sleeping pills. And he was very successful. My vote is five.",Solaris
4,classicsoncall,"""We're a mathematical probability, and that's all.""",7,6 December 2017,"Oh, how the mighty have fallen. This movie was a Top #250 film on IMDb in 2015, and now registers a '6.2' rating as I write this. Funny what a difference a couple of years make with the inclusion of additional visitors to the title.Before watching this picture I had no knowledge of the novel by Stanislaw Lem or the original Russian movie based on it. So without contaminating my review with the perspectives of those two works, what I thought started out as a pretty good sci-fi mystery turned into an illogical love story aboard a space station. I thought there were all kinds of problems here, principally starting with the main character, Chris Kelvin (George Clooney). He was introduced as an intellectual and level headed psychiatrist who was invited to Solaris because of unexplained occurrences that were driving the scientists on board insane. Fair enough, but when he himself experiences the impossible, he abruptly turns off his brain in order to resume a failed relationship with the woman who was his wife (Natascha McElhone) on Earth. Why? How does that even make sense? There's also inconsistency with the character of Rheya. The 'first' Rheya who appears on Solaris has memories of her past with Kelvin, but the 'second' Rheya' doesn't. Until she does again when flashes of life on Earth intrude on her memory. I'm really bothered by internal consistencies in a story, and the two I just mentioned were big time ones.What I really like about well written sci-fi flicks though, is the scientific gobbledy-gook that writers come up with in service to a story. You could have blown me away with that description of the Higgs device - a high energy proton accelerator with a matter phase modulator, which by adjusting the tuning frequency, you could get an enhancement of Higgs anti-bosons at ninety gigahertz, and even better, an almost pure beam at a hundred sixty gigahertz.See, if I were writing the story, Kelvin could have saved himself a lot of trouble by cranking up the Higgs to a full one eighty, thereby reversing the mass exponentiality of the Solaris gravitational field. Then, by switching to decoupled internal power, he could have calibrated the external high-grain antenna and set a course back to Earth, one that wouldn't have jeopardized the possibility of bringing an alien life force back with him. If he wanted to see Rheya again, he could have depressurized the spin turbines on the Athena, settled back with a brandy, and made love to his heart's content. I guess the simplest explanation is just too obvious.",Solaris
5,gavin6942,Why Can't the Dead Just Stay Dead?,3,7 August 2006,"I'm not sure why I was asked to watch this film, but I don't think I will ever watch it again. At least, one can always hope. It was recommended to me by a young man who freely admits he could not stand it despite his love for George Clooney.We have George Clooney as a psychologist who must go into space to examine members a of a space crew orbiting the planet of Solaris. Most of the crew is dead and then his dead wife appears. The remainder of the film seems to revolve around flashbacks of his wife, which are boring and seem to go nowhere. A great actor like Clooney and with the creative genius of Steven Soderbergh? How do we get this level of horse apples? I also want to mention George Clooney's tush. Because this film has the tush roughly three times. And while I respect Clooney for adding to the realism, I'm very sorry for the Clooney admirers who have to sit through this just to see a firm, shaved tush.But seriously, I should have known this film was a dud as soon as Corey Feldman showed up. In his first scene, he's listening to Insane Clown Posse (Because obviously in the future everyone loves rapping clowns). And throughout the film, he acts like a lunatic with wild gestures. It looks exactly like David Duchovny's impression of Jeff Goldblum from Saturday Night Live's ""Celebrity Jeopardy"". Only in this film, Feldman is supposed to be serious.If you want to watch this film, promise to let me know how you liked it because I would rather not have suffered alone.(You should also be aware this film a is a remake of an older film with much higher ratings.)",Solaris
6,jboothmillard,Solaris,4,27 October 2010,"Producer James Cameron and director Steven Soderbergh (Erin Brockovich, Ocean's Eleven) take the Russian 1972 Andrei Tarkovsky two hour forty five minutes long original and turns it into an Americanised hour and a half, enough said? Basically, if you don't already know the original, Dr. Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) goes into space boarding the station studying the ocean world of Solaris, after being asked to go by Gibarian (The Lives of Others' Ulrich Tukur). The main reason he is going is to investigate the unspecified phenomenon aboard because the original security team has gone missing, with Snow (Lost's Jeremy Davies) and Gordon (Doubt's Viola Davis) the only two survivors. They explain that Gibarian committed suicide, and they have been acting nervously since Chris arrived, and soon enough they were right to worry. Not long after arriving Chris is seeing two unexpected people aboard the space station, Gibarian's son Michael (Shane Skelton), and even more worrying his deceased wife Rheya (The Truman Show's Natascha McElhone). They had a good marriage before she committed suicide (I don't think it isn't really explained why), and of course it is exactly what Chris is experiencing that was brought to investigate. Snow and Gordon argue that Chris is having feelings for a memory only and that what he thinks is his wife with realistic feelings isn't human. Towards the end Chris questions whether he is going mad or whatever, and after something happens to Snow, Gordon almost convinces him to back to Earth with her, but instead Chris stays behind to stay with his ""wife"". Also starring American Pie's John Cho as DBA Emissary #1. The charm of Clooney is easy to see, McElhone is alright as the vision of his dead spouse, and the special effects are reasonable, but of course the must see original is much better, but not a bad romantic science-fiction drama. George Clooney was number 72 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols. Okay!",Solaris
7,rmax304823,"""Deep"" space.",5,23 April 2005,"At the end, George Clooney is reunited with his dead wife. He stares at her unbelievingly and asks, ""Am I alive or am I dead?"" ""We no longer have to think like that,"" she replies with a smile. ""We're together -- and we're happy."" Well I would insist on knowing if I were alive or dead. Instead of ending with a big smooch, the movie would end with my whipping out a notebook and giving Natascha MacElhone a long interview aimed at finding out what the hell is going on.I never really could figure it out, but here's my best guess. Early in the movie we have a scene of Clooney, MacElhone, and some friends having an intellectual post-prandial discussion of evolution. ""Nothing special about us,"" argues Clooney, ""because it's all a matter of probability. We are a statistical inevitability."" (MacElhone frowns. Maybe this is why she shortly commits suicide.) Okay. So Clooney believes in a mechanistic universe. And now -- remember that I'm guessing -- the movie sets out to prove him wrong. The universe is designed after all. And the planet Solaris, which Clooney and a few others are investigating -- is GOD. Yes, God.Actually this would be a kind of relief because it would end all the power struggles around whether God is a male or female figure. Since Solaris is a planet, it has no gender and can properly be called ""it,"" unless there is a lot about planets that we don't know yet.In the end, Solaris seems to absorb the space ship and everyone and everything on it. In other words, at the very end, when Clooney asks his formerly dead wife whether he is alive or dead, the answer is that he's dead. Specifically, he's gone to heaven to be reunited with his loved one.Now, I hope that's true. That our spirits (and maybe our bodies) go to a nice place called heaven, but this idea has been around for years and the movie raises all the old questions about heaven. Did Vlad the Impaler go to heaven too? Did Adolph Hitler? And what about my dog, Phoebus? And my cat, Oscar the Wild? My delicate delphinia?The movie seems like a long one. It goes on and on. Clooney reaches the space ship to find out what's happened to it. The two surviving crew members give him nothing but elliptical answers. ""You'll find out."" Or, ""If I were you I'd just keep my door locked tonight."" It turns out that the planet is reproducing figures of loved ones from the crew's memories of them as kind of an experiment. (I guess, but cf., ""The Martian Chronicles."") The other crew already know this when Clooney gets there. Why didn't they just tell him? As it is he has to discover it for himself. The locked door doesn't help.Well, okay. So MacElhone is nothing more than a simulacrum of reality, although she doesn't know it. When this is made clear, she asks to be deconstructed because, after all, she doesn't exist anyway. But Clooney can't dispose of her even though she's not human. (Cf., ""Blade Runner."") MacElhone is neat looking. She has high zygomatic arches, a bony nose and pointed chin, and enormous dark eyes. She's a knockout. And she's photographed splendidly. In fact the whole movie is photographically super-par. Clooney seems a likable guy, enough so that, even though I've heard him described as devastatingly handsome, I can forgive him for it. He has the everyman quality that Clark Gable or Spencer Tracey had. He'd be a good guy for a fourth at bridge and a couple of beers.The movie, though, whew, it's confusing and dreary. Not a single shot is taken outdoors in daylight. And the absorption of the space ship into Solaris seems patterned after a similar scene in ""2001"" but without the psychedelic whammies.It aims to provoke thought and I suppose it does that, but it is anything but emotionally gripping. We never get to know the other two crew members, one of whom seems nuts and the other downright hostile. And the relationship between Clooney and MacElhone is sketchy.It's worth seeing -- once.",Solaris
8,Tweekums,Decent remake,7,23 December 2009,"Having watched the 1972 Soviet version of this film I was curious to see how the recent American remake would compare. The most obvious difference is that this film is much shorter, cutting out most of the scenes prior to Kelvin's journey to the space station over the planet Solaris.Set in the future psychiatrist Chris Kelvin is asked to go to the Solaris space station where something odd is happening to the crew, when he gets there things are stranger than Kelvin could have imagined; the person who'd requested him to come there has killed himself but his son is there... a son who was never taken there from Earth. The two remaining crew members are behaving very strangely. That isn't the strangest thing though, as he sleeps he dreams of his wife and when he wakes up she is there in the room with him... despite the fact that she'd committed suicide many years before. At first he believes he must be hallucinating but when he realises that she is real begins to believe the others explanation that she is a creation of the planet below.The style of this film is very minimalist, if you like your science fiction full of giant robots or laser battles this might not be the thing for you although it you want something different; about ideas rather than action it is well worth watching. The actors did a good job and it was nice to see George Clooney in a film that was never going to be a blockbuster but who's presence will have brought in some viewers who wouldn't have thought of watching it otherwise.",Solaris
9,moonspinner55,Both beautiful and irritating...,4,19 June 2017,"Steven Soderbergh's remake of the 1972 Russian film ""Solyaris"" casts George Clooney as a psychologist who is sent a message by an old friend pleading the doctor to join himself and the crew of the space station Solaris for reasons undisclosed. Once aboard, Clooney discovers obvious distress and his friend's dead body--as well as a warning that what is happening on Solaris will soon happen to him. Good-looking picture with wonderful art direction, fluid pacing and precise editing in the dream sequences; however, the main character isn't very intriguing, and nearly all the performances are underwhelming. As a member of the paranoid surviving crew, twitchy Jeremy Davies is used as comic relief. Though the picture could certainly use some levity, Davies nearly sinks the movie with his low-key hipster ranting, annoying gum-chewing and distracting tics (also the fault of Soderbergh, who allows Davies too much screen-time to go into his pothead arias). I don't think Clooney is ever in character here; he seems overly conscious of the camera, working his handsomeness--his externals--tenderly as a way to connect with the audience. It doesn't substitute for a gripping characterization and, by the end, most viewers will feel indifferent to the romantic plot twist. ** from ****",Solaris
10,blanche-2,A man grapples with his own beliefs,7,13 December 2009,"George Clooney stars in Steven Soderbergh's ""Solaris,"" a 2002 film also starring Natascha McElhone and Viola Davis. Clooney plays Chris, a psychiatrist, still grieving over the suicide of his wife (McElhone). He is asked to travel to a space station orbiting the planet Solaris. Strange things are going on with the crew. When he gets there, he finds some of the crew have killed themselves; dead loved ones have appeared to people in the space station, and shortly after his own arrival, his late wife Rheya shows up. Is she real? Is she a figment of his imagination? Is she some sort of planetary manifestation? Rheya remembers their life together, but no emotion of actual involvement. Helen Gordon (Davis) thinks she's a destructive facsimile, while Chris wants to believe she's real and wants to be reunited with her.Though slow-moving and dialogue-heavy, ""Solaris"" is still an effective and thought-provoking film, tapping into something very universal - the desire to be reunited with those we've lost. Chris isn't a religious man and has to question his own belief system as he looks back on his life with Rheya, while Rheya suspects that she isn't really Rheya at all. Meanwhile, Helen is pushing for Rheya to be destroyed as a dangerous entity that can make trouble on earth.I haven't read the book or seen the Russian film - I understand this is quite different. Thanks to the depth of Clooney's and McElhone's performances, the movie works on its own level. It's not for everyone, since it's about concepts and ideas rather than action. I found it intriguing.",Solaris
11,Quinoa1984,"works better as years go on, and more experience (emotionally more than intellectually) is gained",9,1 July 2010,"The first time I saw Solaris, I was turned off by it. Maybe it wasn't the right time or I wasn't in the right mood, but it just felt cold, distant, like it couldn't connect, and that Clooney's performance was stoic but that he didn't do much except pose with wide eyes at his dead wife re-incarnated on a space ship. But life changes, times change, and my appreciation of film has grown in eight years (and also emotionally maturing from late teens to twenties does some difference as well). The film works now like a poem for loss and love, as opposed to a stilted science fiction story. It also rings with resonance since it feels like Soderbergh, as director/writer/DP/editor, has gone through similar or just exact emotions as characters in this film, or at least his surrogate in Clooney. He's gone through love and loss, and time, much like his main character (and like for many of us with memory), becomes splintered. The backdrop is fantastic, but is just right for what is emphasized in the story.It's also a gorgeously shot film, I should add. While it probably might not trump its predecessor of the material, Tarkovsky's 1972 film, it comes close, closer than would be expected. Again, what seemed like a cold style seeing it years ago changes with coming to it with a better appreciation of the technique that's employed here. It's significant that primarily the scenes inside the spaceship are all locked-down, only pans and tilting with the camera, and the scenes back on Earth- the memories of Clooney and McElhone's characters on Earth when they were married- are hand-held in camera, frenetic, more emotionally harrowing in the realistic breakdown of a marriage over time. Soderbergh's emphasis is direct, and he wants us to feel it as well, especially when the characters' minds break off into those memories, and as a time-line becomes one.The acting is also a great measure of Soderbergh's trust in the material. It's deeply emotional work, usually in the way that character do or try to hold back what is really going on, but when it comes over a character it's harrowing. I loved the moment when, for example, the 2nd version of Rheya is resurrected after she tries to kill herself with liquid oxygen on the ship. This should be nothing new to aficionados of science fiction (and indeed it was also a key scene in the original Tarkovsky film, done equally with passion and terror), but its handled solemnly, like this itself is sort of a tragedy, knowing how real-but-fake this Rheya is, especially when she becomes aware when waking up (watch her eyes in that moment, it's really extraordinary). Other supporting work from Jeremy Davies as a slightly crazy but intellectual comic-relief comes in (maybe the side of Soderbergh that's intelligent but erratic?), and Viola Davis as the real captain of the ship, trying to stick to reason.It's further impressive to see how Soderbergh, via James Cameron's fx company, utilizes the shots of space. There is wonder and awe, and certainly the music (co-opting off of 2001: A Space Odyssey, particularly the Jupiter Landing) works with them like attachments. But it's not used to overcome the viewer, just as a means of 'this is where they are'. What matters here are the characters; even if it is gorgeous and spectacular to look outside at the sights of space, what will happen to these people first? Soderbergh's film, one of his better ones really, focuses on the scope of human experience set in light and dark, reality and nightmare, like a poem suffused in what is haunting and bizarre. I hope to revisit it every so often. 9.5/10",Solaris
12,sunwarrior13,Not A Movie For Everyone,8,1 October 2012,"Solaris is a science fiction-psychological drama starring George Clooney and Natascha McElhone. It is based on the science fiction novel of the same name by Polish writer Stanisław Lem, which also inspired Andrei Tarkovsky's critically acclaimed 1972 film of the same name and a 1968 Soviet TV film.It tells a story of a therapist travels to a distant space station to treat a group of astronauts traumatized by mysterious entities and ends up having to deal with an entity of his own.It was written and directed by Steven Soderbergh.Chris Kelvin is a psychologist still mourning the loss of his wife Rheya when he's implored by a colleague named Gibarian to investigate the increasingly weird goings-on at the Prometheus space station. By the time Kelvin gets there, Gibarian has committed suicide, leaving only the cryptic, babbling Snow and the paranoid, guarded Gordon, both of whom are holed up in their respective rooms. As Kelvin interrogates the skeleton crew, he learns that they've had unwanted ""visitors,"" apparitions of long-dead friends, family, and loved ones who are apparently being generated by the interstellar energy source Solaris. The doctor is dubious of their claims until one night he, too, is greeted by his wife Rheya, whose death still torments him. At first skeptical of the new Rheya, Kelvin gradually becomes obsessed with her and with the guilt that he feels over their troubled marriage to the point where the others begin to fear for his sanity.Slow-moving, cerebral, and ambiguous, this is not a movie for everyone as a solemn, splintered meditation on lost love and finding personal space oddly in space.Scripted, shot, directed and edited by Soderbergh with his customary intelligence and assurance, this is perhaps the most sophisticated Hollywood movie in nearly three decades.",Solaris
13,dbborroughs,Masterpiece,9,19 January 2008,"The film is a MASTERPIECE.I still don't know what I think of it but I think its a masterpiece.Its been ages since I've seen the Tarkovsky film, not since it came on tape had I watched it from start to finish. I have the DVD but the last time I actually tried to watch it was on IFC when sunspots were messing up reception. I gave up when the picture kept skewing.Regardless of when I saw the first film it has haunted me ever since, its mediations on memory and going home again have stayed with me since I saw the film some ten or fifteen years ago. I'm so haunted by the film I was curious what Soderbergh and Cameron would do with the film.The plot essentially is the same as the first film, which is such a stripped down version of the novel by Stanislaw Lem that he all but disowned it.Actually the film follows reasonably closely Tarkovsky's film for the first 35 or 40 minutes before adding new bumps to the story that spin it off into new directions.What the film is about is a meditation on love and god and existence and other stuff. Its an equally valid take on the story as Tarkovsky's and equally intriguing.Of course the film bombed- with the people involved people in America wanted action.But there is none, or little. There is more alluded to than in the first film, but basically this is 95 minutes of people talking and brooding and emoting and simply being and trying to come to terms with life. There is no car chase or shoot outs or anything other than a planet, two spaceships and people. This is a film that requires an investment on the part of the audience and if you can't or won't work with it and meet it half way you're going to think its awful.Yes its pretentious twaddle but it still is asking some very interesting questions and providing no answers.I can only imagine what people going in expecting a scifi thriller made of this film which is like the best scifi not really about the sci or the fi but about us here and now. Soderbergh and Cameron had ideas they wanted to explore , ideas which simply could not work in a realistic setting and so grafted them into a scifi story which would allow their ideas to grow.No the film is not perfect. There are bumps and jumps and oddities, at least I think their are since I saw this in three parts broken by two interruptions. But flaws or no the ideas flow through.If you can see the film letterboxed the compositions are very deliberate and balanced. Also see if you can see it with a good sound system because the sound, the music mostly creates and excellent mood and audioscape.Go in clear minded and know that you may have to see it a second or third time simply because its similarities to the first film are at times distracting since you lean towards one way while the movie goes the other.What is the plot, I hear you asking...Kris Kelvin goes to a space station around the planet Solaris to investigate strange happenings there. Things become even more complicated when his dead wife shows up.Its really not much more than that. I could tell you the whole plot, and even then it wouldn't make a damn bit of difference since the plot is incidental to the discussions.Forgive me I'm still pondering this film over an hour after the fact...If you love to think or question see the film. If you love films with out any answers see the film.If you want it all explained, then stay away, this is not for you. The same thing if you want a film that is more than talk.If you are adventurous and open see this movie....",Solaris
14,Boba_Fett1138,Mumbling in space.,4,30 July 2008,"What a miss from the otherwise successful duo Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney.It takes a slow approach, you know with static shots and all but nevertheless still doesn't feature any real long sequences. Because of this the approach just doesn't really work out for the movie. The movie also doesn't ever really properly build up things. Things just happen as they come along, making it all the more harder to understand or find ever realistic. It's also the reason why the movie is fairly short. It's especially short when considering the movie its source material and when comparing it to the 1972 first version of the movie, that is over an hour longer. I'll bet that the movie is even worse and more confusing to follow when you haven't read the Stanislaw Lem novel, or have seen the 1972 Soviet version of the movie, by Andrei Tarkovsky. Since then you'll probably have simply no idea what this movie is all about.The movie doesn't feature any deeper meanings to it, as if Steven Sodenbergh didn't really understood any of the meanings of the original story. Or perhaps he simply tried to make a simplified and more mainstream version. It just totally misses its mark and fails on basically every level. For a mystery it's just way too confusing and doesn't have the right atmosphere for it, for a drama its not involving enough and for a romantic movie it just isn't credible, mainly because of Natascha McElhone.Of course the movie is still great looking and Steven Soderbergh is of course still a very skilled director, despite really missing the mark with this movie.It's also nice to see the actors at work, despite not being given great material to work with. George Clooney is always great in any movie and in any type of role. Most other roles in the movie though sort of leave a pointless impression, or at least not significant enough for the story, with the exception of the Natascha McElhone character of course but I don't know, she is just an actress who always sort of annoys me.Confusing, non-engaging mess, that misses its mark, despite it's wonderful and powerful source material.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Solaris
15,view_and_review,Claptrap,5,16 February 2021,"This plodding, boring, vacuous movie was so hollow. Visually, it was stunning. It's clear they spared no expense on the set, design, and effects, but all the beauty in the world can't replace a soul.A psychiatrist named Chirs Kelvin (George Clooney) gets an emergency summons to a space station orbiting a planet called Solaris. He doesn't get any information other than he's perfectly suited to handle the situation on the space station. When he arrives he sees a blood trail leading to a laboratory. He also sees two dead bodies in a freezer being used as a temporary morgue. The only two people alive on this vessel are Gordon (Viola Davis), Snow (Jeremy Davies), and a boy. Snow is a spaz and Gordon won't offer up much information.And that's as interesting as this movie would ever be.Kelvin slept and had a dream of meeting his wife and them being intimate, then he woke up beside her. His wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone) was a manifestation of his dreams, kind of like the 1998 movie ""Sphere,"" but less interesting and less suspenseful. What they did with this premise was just criminal. They dragged it into some philosophical mumbo jumbo about what's real or not, and what's dead or alive. ""Solaris"" just inched along relying on pretty people, a pretty set, and pretty music. Except that doesn't make a movie anymore than slapping random sounds together makes music.",Solaris
16,neil-476,Leave it alone if you are shallow,7,24 June 2011,"I'm pretty sure I am an anti-intellectual. I have read Solaris (in English translation). I have watched the Andrei Tarkovsky Russian movie. And now I have watched the Steven Soderbergh version with George Clooney.I think I understand the story, which is fairly simple. Kelvin (Clooney, in this version) is on planet-watching duty in orbit around the planet of Solaris. What nobody realises is that Solaris is able to feed off Kelvin's thoughts and memories and create, from them, a replica of Rheya, his late wife. And this forces him to re-examine memories which we would rather have left buried. So, much of what follows is flashbacks to incidents in their life together, and his reactions to the memories of then and to the replica Rheya now.It is an interesting science fiction notion and, to a more rigorous mind than mine, I am sure it is a very rewarding journey. Sadly, I have a complete absence of profundity. I am as shallow as a puddle. And, quite frankly, I found Kelvin, his problems, Rheya (both the original and the replica) and her problems, extremely tedious and boring.I've given Lem's novel a fair hearing, I think, having read it and watched two versions of it (in the grounds that I must be missing something, surely), but with a complete lack of engagement on each occasion.Solaris is not for me.",Solaris
17,anaconda-40658,Mind Warp.,6,3 February 2016,"Solaris (2002): Dir: Steven Soderbergh / Cast: George Clooney, Natascha McElhone, Jeremy Davies, Viola Davis, Ulrich Tukur: Ominous film starring George Clooney as a psychologist receiving a message to travel to a space station. He arrives to sheer silence with dry blood painting various areas. Eventually he finds two individuals who attempt to provide information and warnings but Clooney chooses to remain. Jeremy Davies attempts to explain the situation without really explaining it. Viola Davis prefers to remain in her room. Clooney's sleep is interrupted by memories of his wife and her suicide. Intriguing despite questionable conclusion but director Steven Soderbergh is skilled at its mystery in terms of its cross over from reality to dream like state of being. Soderbergh and Clooney both previously worked on the entertaining Out of Sight and the overrated Ocean's Eleven. Clooney is in his element playing an individual shocked at the experience yet faced with haunting memories. Natascha McElhone mirrors the fragile confusion of his wife whose image enslaves his thoughts. Jeremy Davies and Viola Davis seem to evaporate but they steal their scenes when they are on screen. Other roles are much less broad and not very interesting. An unsettling visual achievement ripe with ideas, but it addresses how others are presented in our mindset. Score: 6 ½ / 10",Solaris
18,mm-39,The movie made no sense,4,14 August 2003,"Spoiler...    This movie is directed well, and George Clooney acts as his incredible self.  This film has this 70's feel to it (ie The Terminal man) and confusing script.  People's memories come to life, and Clooney has to deal with this emotional impact.  Drawn out story with little explanation. Why would Clooney not freak out, and I believe his character is too strong to live in this little delusion utopia.  I believe the hippie message is one of delusional utopia. I am glad I did not see this one on the big screen. Why would Clooney do such a dud? 4 out of 10.",Solaris

George Clooney,(Chris Kelvin),""Ocean's Eleven"",'01, played a head shrink and wound up almost a complete Nut Case. Natascha McElhone(Rheya),""City of Ghosts"",'02 played his wife that was with Chris one minute and off somewhere in space the next. There was a clear message in this film, which they called a Poem, that some what mentions the fact that real love between two people never dies after Death and continues on into the Spiritual world or simply Resurrection.

20,MovieAddict2016,"James Cameron was originally going to write and direct this film, instead of produce it. He should have.",1,20 August 2003,"I don't think anyone can say that Steven Soderbergh hasn't broadened his range of directorial efforts. We've had horror (""Out of Sight""), drama (""Erin Brockovich""), gritty realism (""Traffic""), comedy (""Ocean's Eleven""), and now romance in ""Solaris,"" a film that blew me out of the water - in terms of I was so surprised it sucked.I think this may be the very first film that Steven Soderbergh made that is bad - followed by that stinky ""Collinwood"" movie. It is a nod towards Stanley Kubrick, but most of the film - especially sequences like the docking ship - just seem like hopeless rip-offs. James Cameron was originally going to write and direct this film, but then Soderbergh jumped on board so Cameron produced it. I wish they had let him write and direct it. Not only would it have been much more...hmm...how should I put it...INTERESTING, it would also be about ten times more meaningful than this sorry mess.The film (based upon a novel and previous film titled ""Solaryis"") takes place sometime in the future, when a pshrink named Chris Klein (George Clooney) is sent to a space station on the planet Solaris to rescue a crew of space explorers. Once there, he realizes why no one wants to leave. Chris' dead wife comes back to him in the space station - she looks real, she feels real, she acts real - but she is undoubtedly an image from his memory, extracted by the mysterious planet. Soon he realizes that he cannot take her back to earth, and he must cope with the fact that she must be destroyed. But she seems so real he refuses to do so. Oh my, the suspense, the suspense.What an intriguing idea we have, completely wasted with an incompetent script and style of direction. The characters act weird throughout. For example, when Chris first arrives at the space station and finds people dead, he also finds a survivor named Snow. Chris doesn't seem to ask many questions. He asks what happened, and the Snow character (who is also very weird) doesn't answer correctly. Chris just kind of walks away, and finds another survivor. Once again, he gets no answers. So what does he do? He goes to sleep. Everyone in this movie just acts weird. I can't describe it in words - they just don't act right. Even the humans. This may very well be George Clooney's most washed-out performance to date.And the actor who played Snow, Jeremy Davies, is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. He plays the exact same characters (notice the similarities to his character in ""The Million Dollar Hotel"" to his character in ""Solaris""). In fact, ""Solaris"" is a lot like ""The Million Dollar Hotel."" I hated that movie with a personal vengeance.On the DVD commentary track for ""Solaris,"" James Cameron said, ""If I had made it there would be a lot more car chases, more gunfights."" Quite honestly, I wish there were. Cameron would have made this film interesting, with or without violence and extravagant special effects, even. Soderbergh simply makes a melodramatic snoozer that is as boring as it is odd and ridiculous.1/5 stars -John Ulmer",Solaris

24,paul2001sw-1,American Solaris,6,10 May 2006,"The age of the first moon landings was a time when, for space exploration the sky (to choose a deliberately inappropriate metaphor) seemed to be the limit: what would we find out there, and what sort of physics (and metaphysics) would we need to understand what we found? This mood gave rise to a genre of thoughtfully speculative science fiction films, a world away from the explosive blockbusters of today. Stanely Kubrick's '2001: A Space Oddesey' is of course the prime example of this genre, but Andrei Tarkovsky's 'Solyaris' is widely regarded as its Russian equivalent, and has now been re-made by Stephen Soderbergh. Soderbegh has a liking for telling stories achronologically (a preference in evidence again here), and to my mind, his films often favour style over substance. And this is certainly a stylised film, all silence and shadows. The good news is that there is an interesting idea at the movie's heart, but the pace is slow, and I found all the characters annoying: George Clooney's is woodenly sympathetic, Natasha McEllhone's is radiantly feline but never wholly real (though this is intentional); Jeremy Davis plays an annoying American weirdo and Viola Davis's character is simply tough and hard. Apparently, the original (which I haven't seen) was even longer and less coherent; this version is distinctive, but it's a hard film to warm to. Behind the futuristic setting, it's essentially a love story; but I've never seen a Soderbergh film with a real emotional core, and this one doesn't break that mould.",Solaris
25,dromasca,Where Real Science Fiction Meets Hollywood,8,16 August 2003,"In one of the special features documentaries coming with the DVD, director Soderbergh explains his 'Solaris', as a science fiction work 'as it used to be': less about robot fights and laser guns, more about humans. He is correct, with one observation - Real science fiction always was, is, and will be about human beings and their emotions - fear, hope, love. It is Hollywood who hijacked the genre and transformed it in a commercial pop-art based mainly on effects, at the expense of what real art is meant to be. But not all cinema is done at Hollywood, thanks God, and directors like Soderbergh find ways to do good films even in the Hollywood system.
For example, this 'Solaris' is a legitimate attempt to reconcile the two approaches. It takes the classic 'Solaris' book (by Stanislaw Lem) and picture  (a real masterpiece by Tarkowski) and  gives it a Hollywood twist - the story is more about relationship and human emotion, less about the experience to discover a new civilisation and world, with different rules than ours. This works no bad, and 'Solaris' is a good film. The robot fights and laser guns fans will be disappointed, but they have many other films to satisfy their lust.Compared with the classical film of Tarkowski this 'Solaris' loses in depth - but it is probably on purpose. Staging and camera are good, though reminding too much of Kubrick's '2001'. Casting is interesting - most of the characters including George Clooney seem slightly mis-casted, but it somehow helps, adding to the strange atmosphere of the film. Clooney always seems to act better than you would expect, and I wonder why. It may be his looks that are too close to the 50's legends (Carry Grant, James Stewart). But then, as in 'Brother' he surprises the audiences for the good. I kind of dis-liked the final. It tried to be at the same time original and happy-end-ish, but it looked confusing and cheap to me. However, there was a lot of good stuff in the rest of the film to make it worth watching. 8/10 on my personal scale.",Solaris
26,secondtake,A beautiful high romance with existential issues of identity and reality thrown in--what an amazing trip!,8,24 February 2010,"Solaris (2002)Some might find Solaris slow, or slick, or opaque, and I think it is all those things and for a good reason. Unlike Moon (2009), which is like a Tom Waits (and simplified) version of the same core theme, or 2001 (1968), which has something utterly impersonal to distinguish it, Solaris is a love story. And you are meant to float--or better, you are meant to be weightless--in the experience.The music (evocative dreamy music, by Cliff Martinez) alone makes clear we are in suspension. It's a trip, in the druggy sense and in spiritual sense. We have to figure out what these other beings really are (they look human, and some of them are) and we have to decide what it means to be alive (is it simply self-awareness?). We have to even decide whether the characters should live in the lie of some invented reality that feels utterly real, or to go for the old fashioned real thing and leave love behind.If it's love at all. After awhile you realize it's a kind a narcissism. And then you wonder why not? Whatever works, right?The movie is gently confusing. The lead is George Clooney. The whole movie is George Clooney. His love interest (undefined for here) is played by the big-eyed Natascha McElhone. If her staring eyes and gentle loving neediness seem a little overdone, it's for good reason. As you'll see (blame George). And the planet itself, exerting some kind of power over the consciousness of the humans on this floating (large) spaceship, represents something approaching God in its power and mystery. It's an atheist's movie, I'm sure, but filled with spiritual and human optimism.Most viewers don't know that this is a remake, and hard core film buffs dismiss this American Steven Soderbergh version as Hollywood at its worst (big budget, sentimental, pretty beyond reason). The earlier Soviet version (from 1972) is really interesting, too, and parts of it are even slower. On purpose. Other parts seem dated, to me, and if I think of the effects and the idea as ahead of its time, I remind myself that this earlier one is after, not before, Kubrick's Space Odyssey and so the whole progression is skewed. The Soviet version also seems more sexist, more male dominant, and whatever demeaning qualities exist in this more recent one, they seem more in balance, man to woman, at least in a less male gaze way.But academic analysis creeps in on a movie that is really much more about experiencing its mood, its tragedy and hope, and its delicate floating beauty, which I seem to enjoy without thinking too hard. There are moments, including the Michelangelo creation scene with the boy (yes!), that push it far too far (and seem Kubrick inspired, without Kubrick's icy sensibility). You might also be able to edit it differently to make it more compact. But these are debates to have once you've seen the movie. A warning: it's depressing to some people. To me, though, it's soothing. And the open ended qualities might make you want to see it again.",Solaris

One of his closest friends, Gibarian, who introduced Chris to his now-deceased wife, Rheya (Natascha McElhone), is presently on distant Solaris. A group of scientists are studying the planet to see if there are minerals or other elements that would be valuable on earth. Since his wife has not been dead very long, Chris has been living in a semi-funk. But, by teleview, Gibarian suddenly asks the doc to voyage to Solaris, for there are strange happenings afoot. Having no other choice but to try to help his friend, Chris makes the journey. But, when he lands, tragedy hits him in the face. Gibarian is in a bodybag and there are only two living members of the team on the space station in orbit. Snow, a technician, tells Chris that some members committed suicide, like Gibarian, others died and one vanished altogether. The planet itself has been giving off bizarre signals and may be responsible. The other survivor, Dr. Gordon (Viola Davis) locks herself in her room and is paranoid to the point of hostility. Chris settles down for the night, where he dreams of his wife. He recalls meeting her, marrying her, and finding her dead, a result of suicide, too. Suddenly awake, Chris is startled to see Rheya at his bedside. How is this possible? She doesn't know and Chris is so frightened, he sends her off to die in space, thinking she's some kind of alien being in disguise. Snow and Gordon are not surprised to hear his tale and relate other beings, including Gibarian's son, who have shown up. But, as Gordon tells it, these creatures are ""copies"" of the original humans, made by Solaris, from the memories of folks such as Chris. What a concept! Unbelievably, Rheya shows up again, in a new body, and this time Chris wants her to stay. But, Gordon insists nouveau-Rheya cannot return to earth and the remaining team members need to leave as soon as possible, for she, Gordon, has developed a ""ray gun"" that will get rid of the replicants forever. She will take them down, one by one, and then they will leave, for the space station is getting pulled closer and closer into the Solaris surface by gravity. What will result? This amazing, beautiful, tantalizing film is a triumph for Stephen Soderbergh and all of the actors. Based on a Polish novel and a classic Russian film, its story is a labyrinth that has to be seen more than once to truly appreciate. The photography is sensational and so is the very moving score. Clooney, McElhone, Davis, and Davies are all nearly perfect as the humans trapped in the space station. Add on great costumes, sets, and direction and you have a film worthy of robust praise. Yes, its somewhat slow in nature but its the best tempo for a film that needs reflection and discovery at every turn.

28,tabuno,"A Great Experiential, Thinking Sci Fi Movie",8,26 January 2019,"29 November 2002. This version as well as the original Russian version are no action adventure (Star Wars, Matrix, Independence Day) movies. This sci fi movie is definitely for the cerebral and humanistic type of audience who like strange, mysterious alien influences that seem to get under your skin - to feel and experience what's going on in a movie. It is definitely a relationship movie about what it means to be human and to make human choices. This is going to be a great cult movie in American science fiction (though a bit overly simplistic and too cute for the taste of the intelligent, International, sci fi community. The relationship between Kelvin and the first appearance isn't given nearly sufficient screen time and the female scientist on board the space station isn't given enough depth and ""almost"" becomes more of a stereotypical character. However, on the whole, this sci fi movie is a great substantive, a heavy-weight in science fiction, much like ""Forbidden Planet"" or ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" were classics of the 1950s. But that doesn't mean that it will be a popular hit with the general public, it definitely won't be because most of the audience won't understand what's going on and it,s way too slow for the average American filmgoer.",Solaris

It makes you think long after the final credits have rolled. Plot in A Paragraph: Upon arrival at the space station orbiting an world called Solaris Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) a psychologist discovers that the commander of an expedition to the planet has died mysteriously. Other strange events soon start happening, such as the appearance of old acquaintances of the crew, including some who are dead. Klein struggles with the questions of Solaris' motivation, his beliefs and memories, and reconciling what was lost with an opportunity for a second chance.Gripping, absorbing, thought provoking and wonderfully filmed, I enjoyed this an insane amount. I use it as one of my relaxing movies on a night to help me fall asleep (I don't mean that as a bad thing) as there are long periods of no dialogue and just beautiful music which I drift off too. Another movie I do this to, is the Burt Reynolds movie ""Sharky's Machine"" and his character is on stakeout duty. Again little or no dialogue just the score and I nod off. Clooney and Natasha McElhone make a wonderful couple and have some good on screen chemistry. I'm surprised they have not worked together again, but when a movie tanks like this did, actors like to distance themselves as much as possible. I think whoever was behind the promotion for this movie dropped the ball as they didn't know how to ""sell"" this movie, as the trailers and posters do not represent the movie at all, and can see why people thought they were going to see something else.",Solaris
30,Dr_Coulardeau,Amazingly unfinished speculation beyond alpha and omega,9,15 April 2007,"Since one Space Odyssey everyone is trying to find out what is beyond the black holes, or inside the black holes, and they just can't imagine anything new at all. Sooner or later they will come to some more innovative ideas, since it is our human nature to entrap our minds with purely evanescent and mental unreal inexistent virtualities that we can real, but right now they are obsessed by this Space Odyssey. So the computer is no longer crazy. And we are not regressing back to fetal preexistence. We are floating away from what we may call life into some kind of beyond zone where time does not exist any more and where life is nothing but eternity, eternal timelessness. In other words we go beyond the alpha and the omega. We rant and rave into what was before the alpha and what will be after the omega, or so we think, so we think we remember, so we flatter our egos with pretending we know. The slow motion in this film, the lack of dialogue or even speech, the floating music in between two uncertain firm vaporous void shapeless inexistent non entity, everything makes us believe we are what we are and yet nothing but what we imagine we are because we can only be anything when we cease being at least according to our criteria of existence and saying what I am saying is already based on an illusion, is an illusion in itself, the illusion that anything I am saying right now has any consistence, existence, real essence. I am the illusion my very illusionary self is pretending to have and is calling life. We are nothing but some kind of conglomerate of particles whose existence is purely mathematical and what we call consciousness is nothing but some kind of chain reaction between these particles that cannot be controlled, dominated or simply identified. If there is one thing that is sure it is that we are in the whole universe the only animals who pretend to know the world and be conscious of our existence hence of our death since life does not exist if death does not, and we are not alive if we are not conscious of our death, even though we cannot be conscious of our death before being dead, and then life will be terminated. A vicious circle that Clooney locks around our eyes and brains and we fall in the trap and Solaris can finally eat up our sanity, leaving behind some bloody finger prints for the Scotland Yard officers who will investigate our disappearance in thin emptiness.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",Solaris
31,johnnyboyz,"Slow, confusing and ambiguous like these sorts of films are but there is plenty here to keep you busy once the film has ended.",6,10 November 2007,"Science-fiction is one of those tough little genres that offers plenty to chew on in the form of content and ideas and yet you can have two extremely stark science fiction films; there are your Star Wars films and your films like Starship Troopers and Aliens that are able to tie in the war and romance genres, amongst others but then there are your more drawn out science fiction films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey which in themselves can be something spectacular whilst remaining ambiguous. Other films like Blade Runner and Alien can also use familiar narrative structures and yet are able to deliver on an entertaining and sophisticated level; at least to the masses, anyway.Solaris is a film made by Steven Soderbergh, a man who I am rapidly developing a split opinion of; Sex, Lies, & Videotape was brilliant as was Ocean's Eleven albeit for different reasons; this twinned with Traffic which I thought was slightly overrated and Ocean's Twelve which was a mere exercise of cinematography and star power, if anything. Solaris is probably Soderbergh's most interesting film but that isn't saying it's his best in fact it's far from his best. Solaris actually emphasises 2001: A Space Odyssey's brilliance as a sci-fi film but also reinforces the fact that art can sometimes be entertaining as well as eerie  Solaris may have been a bizarre and confusing film as 2001 was but it wasn't particularly eerie and at times at least to me, felt slow and dreary since I wasn't exactly sure as to what was going on.The film takes on a range of themes and attempts to reference previous sci-fi films from the past. The situation is straight out of Alien although the 'enemy' is a force that is not physical but psychological; Solaris also tries to use the idea of mental illness and psychological disturbance as its underlining theme since most of its character will suffer from hallucinations or seem to suffer from very random bouts of anger with pretty much the whole crew acting like they've got some horrible, dark secret locked away inside them. This actually moves me onto my next item: the hallucinations. It would seem that a massive ball of glowing energy is bringing back people from the crew's past lives and putting them on board with them in a sort of sick, Big Brother sort of a twist. This is where Solaris falters because Rheya (McElhone) and Chris (Clooney) begin to fall for one another yet again and the film quickly turns into a mere love story that's set in space with the bulk of these flash backs taking place on Earth; suddenly it's not so much a sci-fi as a character in a romance film having flashbacks.It's also worth noticing that within these flashbacks, there are numerous conversations between people and friends of Chris and Rheya about God and religion; this being significant since most of the flashbacks are these two peoples love stories. Flashing back to the present in space and Rheya herself says that she is 'unable to communicate with her creator'  is this suggesting Solaris itself is indeed God? That this ball of energy can create life? because we are never sure if Rheya is a hallucination or indeed, a clone. This energy ball can clearly read minds and recreate organisms from raw memory right down to the colour of the person's eyes and their accent. This is where Solaris works because it's challenging the viewer to work out why certain people or things are there and what they're purpose is. The reference of the quote being that Rheya can't communicate with her creator since we can't communicate with God and the Solaris energy ball puts her in the same situation.It's worth saying that Solaris does not cover a lot of what it is. The purpose of the space ship, the reason the types of people that are on board were selected in the first place and why more people aren't sent remains unanswered. Also, the massive ball of energy is never really utilized as an element in the film: it is the reason there even is a film since it enables Chris to reconcile with Rheya both on Earth and in Space; remember that no one ever thinks to investigate Solaris further. I said it earlier but it still counts: Solaris is not a great film of sorts and only emphasises 2001: A Space Odyssey's brilliance since Solaris is a basic love story with a bizarre twist in the way it looks and feels. It's premise is interesting as a detective story but ends up as and consequently falters as a love story that's actually already happened down on Earth. Solaris is a film for people who will enjoy a good 'trip' but just like most sci-fi's, should never be a film you'll just 'pop in to give a watch'.",Solaris

33,howard.schumann,Resonates with a quiet beauty,9,7 March 2004,"In Soderbergh's leaner and more accessible version of Solaris, George Clooney is Kelvin, the psychologist whose wife has committed suicide. He is sent to the space station Prometheus to investigate the loss of contact with the Solaris mission after receiving a plea from Commander Gibarian (Ulrich Tukur), a Prometheus astronaut. When he arrives he finds that Gibarian has committed suicide, Dr. Helen Gordon (Viola Davis) has barricaded herself in her room, and scientist Snow (Jeremy Davis) is barely comprehensible in his attempts to explain what is taking place. Kelvin quickly learns that Solaris is not just an inert planet but a sentient being (perhaps a metaphor for Heaven) that creates exact replicas of people from the crew's past including Gibarian's young son and Kelvin's wife Rheya (Natasha McElhone).
Increasingly drawn to the double of his wife, Kelvin is forced to complete the past and take responsibility for her suicide. Enhanced by a lovely score by Cliff Martinez, Soderbergh's is a moody and deeply spiritual version that pares the story down to its essence. As told in numerous flashbacks, much of the film is taken up with Kelvin's memories. In one crucial scene at a dinner party, while Rheya defends the idea of a higher intelligence, Kelvin plays the role of a coldly rational scientist and scoffs at her ideas. Ultimately, with the guidance of the intelligent ocean of Solaris, Kelvin is provided a second chance to confront his demons. Allowed to take responsibility for his past, he is able to embrace the spiritual harmony of the universe. While perhaps less poetic than the Tarkovsky version, it's theme of the pain of love and memory are deeply moving and the film resonates with a quiet beauty all its own.",Solaris

This would tell you a lot about the quantity of the commercial movies which drown us, to the extent where the viewers feel madly happy for the appearance of any noncommercial film, even if it is something boring, tasteless, and without anything catchy like Steven Soderbergh's (Solaris)!",Solaris
35,BeneCumb,Slow - and a couple of catchy performances only,6,10 February 2013,"This movie has limited sci-fi spirit left, most of the depictions are about human relationships, guilt etc - the issues that ""profound and deep"" filmmakers are so interested in. But they can be easily dealt with on Earth, no need to move onto a spaceship and then forget about the rest of elements the sci-fi movies should include. Flashbacks become annoying soon, moreover, they are confusing as well. As for the cast, the strongest performances are carried out by George Clooney as Chris Kelvin and Viola Davis as Gordon; the remaining are rather ordinary.Remakes are usually worse than original versions and this is no exception. Steven Soderbergh is a great director in other genres, but he is no Andrey Tarkovsky who was a master of similar movies.",Solaris
36,dfranzen70,Thoughtful and thought-provoking sci-fi,7,20 October 2003,"Based on the novel by Stanislaw Lem, this cerebral sci-fi yarn has psychologist Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) being sent to investigate strange happenings on a remote space station orbiting an odd planet. Kelvin has ghosts of his own to deal with, as he is haunted by memories of his wife, a suicide victim. His mission is to find out why the crew members have not come home and to explain their bizarre behavior (as evidenced by their plaintive messages imploring Kelvin to visit).There have been many movies that depict what happens when strange happenings are investigated, and as in most of those movies, nothing here is really as it seems. The tone for the tension and suspense is set almost immediately, as Kelvin awakes onboard the station next to his dead wife!Who is she? What is she? Is she really his wife, returned from the grave? What affect does Solaris the planet have on this.... this entitity? Is Kelvin turning as nutty as the remaining crew members? Is he hallucinating his wife? Is he even on the space station - is this a bad dream?
Devoid of outlandish special effects and with a threadbare cast, the movie must lean on the solemn plot and the stoic acting of Clooney. This is his show all the way - his is the flawed hero and the willing victim combined into one multilayered character. It's some of Clooney's best work; he cannot rely on his whiplash smile or suave charm. Neither of those qualities, although surely valuable in other films, can help his character here.Like the best thinking-man's sci-fi, Solaris doesn't answer every question. It's mystical without being too abstract, and its quiet strength lies in what one doesn't see.The only drawback is that it's often tough to understand the actions of the crew members, including Kelvin. Are they insane, or merely acting? Hamlet himself may not have been able to discern the truth here. Compounding this is the sometimes unlikeability of Kelvin himself. It would be taking the easy way out, however, to have made him into some sort of superhero. Therefore even though it's tough at times to relate to Kelvin and consequently to root for him to succeed, this is a successful, well-made film, thanks to its complexities and multilayered main character.",Solaris
37,Chris_Docker,George's Bottom (2001 Mk 3 with Deep Meaningful Thoughts),8,9 March 2003,"This film pulls off a double whammy  it has sufficient intellectually stimulating material (of the what-is-reality and what-is-intelligence brand of sci-fi mind games) and it also has George Clooney's naked charms artistically photographed on more than one occasion. This means the ladies can spin on endlessly to us guys about what an interesting movie it is but break out into an enthusiastic glow when describing its more basic appeal to one another. Clooney goes off to investigate a space station where the radiations from the nearby planet turn people's dream characters into tangible reality. Enter Clooney's dead wife, now alive again (several times) in the curvaceous shape of Natascha McElhone, providing emotionally-challenging love (and lust) interest as Clooney struggles with the nature of reality. Directed in classy Soderberg style with Space Odyssey' type music to provide lots of Deep Meaningful Moments  who cares if the storyline gets a bit fuzzy at the end? It's one of those Bring Your Own Meaning films, far too clever to be dismissed as popcorn fodder, and entertaining enough to make everyone feel they've got their jollies in respectable art-appreciation style.",Solaris
38,jimbo-53-186511,A pretentious bore,1,23 January 2016,"Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) is approached to join a crew on board a space station. The crew are studying a phenomenon known as Solaris and Kelvin is asked to join the remaining crew members to discover what is going on there and also to recover the remaining crew members - only two crew members remain on the space station as the other members of the crew have either committed suicide or simply disappeared - this includes the Security Task Force who were originally assigned to the task. What seems like a seemingly ordinary task for Kelvin soon proves difficult when he witnesses the phenomena of Solaris first-hand.Solaris markets itself as a film full of intrigue and mystery, but the reality here is that it isn't really any of these things. Here are some of the problems;For a start, all the characters are bland here with Doctor Snow starting every sentence with the words 'Hmmm' 'Yeah' 'Well' 'Hey'. He never has anything interesting or useful to say (although him being part of Solaris all along does explain why), but even so as a character he annoyed the hell out of me - he both sounded and looked like a stoner. Doctor Gordon was given very little screen time and as a result made very little impact on the film. Clooney and McElhone were sleepwalking through the film most of the time, but I think this was due to the dull script which clearly limited their performances. The dialogue was also dull and rather meaningless for the most part.The bulk of the film revolves around Kelvin and his wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone). The film flits between his memories of their time together and his existence with a carbon copy of his wife that has been created by Solaris. This could potentially have been interesting, but Soderbergh seemed more pre-occupied with giving the film long silly dream sequences which often contain little narrative content meaning that the film often seems pretentious rather than insightful or interesting. Another thing that angered me about the film is the sheer arrogance of the whole thing; I got the impression that Soderbergh genuinely believes that he's actually made something clever and thought-provoking when in reality that just isn't the case. I suppose the only thing that can really be taken away from this is that it asks the question 'If you had another chance to go back and put things right would you do it?', but this whole concept is tackled in such a boring manner that I just didn't really care by the end.It's no surprise that the critics mostly gushed over this as it's the sort of film that they can claim that they get because it's deep and meaningful and intelligent and that if you're thick you won't get it. All I'll say is that I did understand what the film was trying to say, but still thought that it was a pretentious load of baloney.",Solaris
39,NateWatchesCoolMovies,The kind of science fiction film we should see more of,10,18 November 2011,"Steven Soderbergh's Solaris is my personal favourite sci fi film of all time. It abandons aliens, pyrotechnics and spectacle for a much more mysterious, soulful and ponderous approach, and at times seems like an impressionistic painting or a symphony set in the havens of space. It uses the ultimate vastness of space to ironically focus inward to the soul, and attempts to tackle some really difficult questions of identity, the origins of emotion, and the composition of a psyche and how others perceive it. George Clooney strips away his charm and suave antics for an emotionally raw, staggering portrayal of a broken man named Chris Kelvin, who finds himself spiritually and emotionally challenged beyond anything he has known, and the guy is a psychiatrist. After a brief, ambient prologue set on earth, Clooney is beckoned by an ambiguous message from his friend (Ulrich Tukur), urging him to journey to the distant planet Solaris, where strange phenomena is plaguing the members of a research vessel in the planet's orbit. Curiosity prevails and he makes the trip. Things get strange when he realizes the ship is in desolate disarray, and the crew members are disturbed by the arrival of 'visitors', replicas of deceased loved ones that appear out of nowhere. Chris's visitor is his deceased wife Rheya (Natasha Mcelhone), who has little memory or cohesion, and no answers for him. What does Solaris want? Why has it chosen to bring these lost loves back to the crew? Is it curious? Malevolent? Soderbergh's version of the book by Stanislaw Lem is the better version in my opinion. There is deep, deep contemplation at work here, that affects you on another level. The nature of a soul, in its complete form, as opposed to the image we reflect unto others with our actions, resulting in a version of ourselves held onto by our loved ones, incomplete and altered by their subjective perceptions. These intriguing themes are explored by the two leads with stunning depth and compassion. Clooney paints a vivid portrait of heartbreak and haunted memories. The underrated Mcelhone is angelic as both the visitor version, confused, emotionally stunted, and as Rheya herself in flashbacks, flawed, loving and scared of life's possibility. Visuals of the planet itself watch over the unfolding revelations, painted in deep gorgeous purples, sonic blues and ethereal, scintillating swaths of cosmic red. The look and design of the ship is built on practicality, and humble, muted colours. One of the key factors in the films atmosphere is the genius score by Cliff Martinez. It's a spacey, moody electronic jangle that hovers on the fringes of our awareness like galactic, auditory lace, and puts out a beautiful musical carpet of stars for the characters to wander and wonder in. The supporting cast is wonderful too. Tukur strikes a noble chord and nails his scenes. Twitchy Jeremy Davies gives his trademark weirdness. Viola Davis is dynamite, her terrified astronaut delving into scary primal places. Soderbergh gives his usual polished, mature approach to the visual aspect and direction. Sci fi films this ambitious, beautiful, deep and affecting all in one package are all too rare, but I constantly find myself wanting to revisit it's poetic, emotional grandeur and intimate, heartbreaking performances again and again.",Solaris

41,rooprect,One of the rare remakes that is superior to the original.,7,23 February 2007,"Listen up, you punks who think this is boring. Try watching the original Tarkovsky version and you'll be asleep within the first 20 minutes. (As I recall, the original begins with 20 minutes of pond scum closeups, followed soon after by 20 minutes of a camera mounted to the hood of a car driving down the interstate.) Thank your lucky stars that someone made an attempt to bring the novel of Stanislaw Lem to the big screen without all the esoteric Tarkovskian fluff like closeups of men's earlobes. This (2002) version takes us back to the literary basics of good storytelling, and it did an admirable job. It patched up the loopholes and ""wtf moments"" that Tarkovksy left in his impressionistic 1972 version, and it introduced some fantastic--and I mean FANTASTIC--character twists and plot twists that were not just some schlocky Hollywood gimmicks for a change.I think you'll really enjoy this. Don't expect action. Don't expect scifi. This is a powerful psychological drama, and the most memorable scenes for me don't involve spaceships or life/death situations but rather, they involve the complex and frightening workings of a man's tormented, guilt-ridden conscience.Great performances by George Clooney, Natascha McElhone (most haunting eyes ever) and especially by Jeremy Davies who plays a minor but unforgettable character. Jeremy goes on to play Charles Manson in the 2004 remake of Helter Skelter. I haven't seen it yet, but I'll be on the lookout.",Solaris
42,Agent10,Almost as long and as dull as the original,3,11 June 2003,"Steven Soderbergh must have thought this was a good idea. The big difficulty with this project was that it had too much pontification about love and loss that it forgot to focus on the cool eeriness of the situation. Thus, a cool idea for a science fiction film went down the gutter over a basic fundamental flaw. Does George Clooney have to have a love interest in every one of his films? While the idea of love certainly pushed the idea forward, it just felt like the middle of the film was too much timeless brooding between Clooney and Natascha McElhone. What was even worse, while the original was something in excess of five hours, this only felt like it, even though it was a rather elyptical 99 minutes. I never felt more bored and disgusted with a sci-fi film. This proved to be the worst film of this genre since Battlefield Earth, and that's a rather sad distinction. I think Soderbergh should stop trying to touch every spectrum of the film style rainbow and stick to a couple of stylistic approaches that best suit him.",Solaris
43,rbverhoef,Looks amazing,8,1 June 2003,"'Solaris' is a remake of the Tarkovsky version from 1972. This one is much shorter and I think a larger audience will like this movie. It is a very fascinating movie, raising all kinds of questions.Director and writer Steven Soderbergh does a pretty good job, presenting us all kind of beautiful images. Some scenes did remind me of '2001: A Space Odyssey'. The arrival of the spaceship and the way George Clooney looks in his helmet. In a way it is the same kind of science fiction movie, both without the usual sci-fi action, both inviting the audience talk about it after it is seen.Soderbergh and Clooney take a risk with this movie and I like it. It is no block-buster like 'Ocean's Eleven' or a intelligent movie but still made for large audiences like 'Out of Sight'. For some reason Soderbergh can handle a lot of different things and Clooney as an actor can as well. Fortunately there are still people who like to take the risk to make this kind of movie.Like I said Clooney stars as Chris Kelvin. He must visit the planet Solaris because strange things are happening. When he gets there he meets two survivors both a little strange. The first is Gordon (Viola Davis) who doesn't want a discussion with him until ""it happens to him"". The other is Snow (Jeremy Davies), who seems to be nervous whole the time. After Kelvin's first night his wife wakes up next to him. She committed suicide a few years earlier. In nice flashbacks we see how they met and hooked up on earth, where it is raining in every scene. His wife, played by Natasche McElhone, knows there is something wrong. She remembers things but she doesn't remember experiencing those things. She is not an imagination by Kelvin. Snow and Gordon see her and both had their own visitors. From this moment the story gets interesting every minute.I can understand many people will not like this movie. It doesn't come with a real solution, it moves slowly, there is not much talking, most things are not sure. But it also looks amazing, is very fascinating and you can talk about it for hours. If you liked the last sentence you will like this movie.",Solaris
44,Samiam3,Sloppy,4,13 June 2009,"It was said that Jim Cameron was the original director on this project, but chose to remain a producer. I think that Solaris would have been competent in Cameron's hands. Instead that task goes to director Steven Soderberg, whose attempts to craft an emotionally complex story just turn sloppy and dull, with torpid performances from a descent cast, and no life.The story is essentially about an astronaut sent out to explore an abandoned ship orbiting a celestial body known as Solaris which has mystical powers, once on board, he sees hallucinations of his long dead wife, and his past slowly comes back to haunt him.Solaris does succeed in looking mystical and sometimes dreamy, but many of the sets feel just as hollow and empty as the story.

Steven Soderbergh shouldn't be allowed behind a camera. The man just can not direct anything with a budget of over 10 million dollars. Anyway, the biggest problem with this movie is that it is needlessly boring. The acting is wasted thanks to quick camera work sprinkled with bad angles, over exposed close ups and basically everything a fresh out of film school director would do when he is trying too hard to be artistic for the sake of being artistic. The actual story that this movie is based on is a solid enough novel with an actual plot but we only get to see it during the first 5 minutes and the final 7 minutes of the film. The rest of the film is just filler. Avoid this film. It is pointless and you'll get nothing out of it.",Solaris
46,JuguAbraham,"After 30 years, Hollywood has yet to learn from Tarkovsky",7,27 March 2003,"I congratulate producer James Cameron and Steven Soderberg for deciding to film Stanislaw Lem's book. I congratulate Soderberg for being more intelligent than George Lucas and company who reduced Hollywood science fiction in space to literally loud films for the aural senses and special effects feasts for the visual senses. And yet...what a disaster Soderberg's Solaris turned out to be!!If you liked this film see Andrei Tarkovsky's film made 30 years ago when most moviegoers around the world thought Russians only made third rate propaganda war movies.Tarkovsky's film gripped you in so many ways that Soderberg cannot. Tarkovsky's choice of Bach's music ""Chorale in F minor"", his casting of the brilliant Estonian actor Yuri Jarvet (Grigori Kozintsev's choice of King Lear that had Lord Laurence Olivier doffing his cap) as Dr Snauth a character Soderberg tried to recreate ineffectively in Snow (Jeremy Davis), Tarkovsky's brilliant visuals (Soderberg does copy the rain on the windows)--give you sufficient reasons to realize that Andrei Tarkovsky remains one of the finest filmmakers of the century--a filmmaker who most moviegoers do not adequately know about in the US and elsewhere.What amused me is that before the film was released there were the publicity about how Soderberg wanted to make the film as one superior to Tarkovsky. Soderberg is no Tarkovsky and will never be.Tarkovsky did not use nudity to make his film sell--his film has made waves even when the Communists were afraid of Tarkovsky's messages and suppressed his work in the Seventies in many ways--all because of the care he took with the direction, the script, the editing, the photography and the music. His script, so different from that of the Soderberg film, delivered more punch without a Clooney and his fabulous voice. Hollywood's answer to Tarkovsky is probably the late Orson Welles and in recent times, Terrence Mallick. Cameron probably knew his limitations as a director and cleverly opted to produce the movie. Soderberg thought he was bigger than he is and attempted to remake Tarkovsky's work without even acknowledging the work of the Russian genius in the few press statements I came across.If the Soderberg film appeals to you, it is Stanislaw Lem that gets you not Soderberg. While the film is better than the average Hollywood product this film does not stand up to great cinema elsewhere in any department save for the above-average sound editing.",Solaris

Some CGI shots were subtle. The whole love story (which is used for the plot) was bad, in my opinion. I did not feel, whatsoever, that George Clooney and Natascha McElhone had any chemistry together, although their performances were great.Well, there are different perspectives on the film from different people. My perspective on it was boring and uninteresting but others might actually pay attention to the movie and love every bit of it. What also made this film boring is that the film's pace was SLOW. Still, I liked the ending.There are some good moments in the film but mainly many boring and dull moments which did not catch my attention. The performances and cinematography were good and subtle.

49,Maciste_Brother,A cafe house/minimalist version of Stanislaw Lem's story,6,18 November 2003,"SOLARIS, directed by Steven Soderbergh, and starring George Clooney, is one of those pointless remakes Hollywood has been making these past decades that adds almost nothing to the original classic. The movie itself is good. Not great or even close to being bad or a misfire, just good.  Soderbergh basically boiled down the complex and epic story, as seen in the Russian film, into a simple MINIMALISTIC love story. Which made me wonder why did they even bother remaking the movie if all the science-fiction and metaphysical elements were thrown out? The story could have easily taken place entirely on earth. And instead of Solaris, the story could have been set in a mystical setting, like a haunted castle or an ancient archeological find. If you're going to set in space, might as well give the outer space aspect some sort of meaning to it. The minimalistic approach is interesting but the result is pointless. Having Rheya come back from the dead, sort of speaking, and her problems adjusting to her new reality reminded me a lot of the replicants' plight in BLADE RUNNER, which is what I think Soderbergh tried to do here. Who's reality is it?My only criticism about the movie is the use of dreams and flashbacks. In the film, the Solaris planet takes a person's main dream while they're sleeping (there's even silly close-up shots of Clooney's cranium). These dreams are seen as ""flashback"" in the movie. Dreams are rarely that linear. One doesn't dream about one specific thing or person (in this case Kelvin dreaming about Rheya) all the time. And dreams are impressions of reality. So when Rheya comes back, looking exactly like Kelvin's wife, for me this points out to an obvious weakness in the whole concept of the Solaris planet going into a person's mind and grabbing their version of reality. If this was the case, the reincarnated Rheya should have looked slightly different that the Rheya on earth. Oddly enough, the way Soderbergh approached the idea of a planet reincarnating a long lost loved one into flesh reminded me of the SPACE 1999 episode, A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH, more than the Tarkovsky movie. But I find that the SPACE 1999 episode, even with all its faults, was more epic and poignant than Soderbergh's version of the Stanislaw Lem's story. There's just something anal retentive about Soderbergh's direction which prevents any kind of emotions to seep to the surface.Unlike most people though, I wasn't bored at all with SOLARIS. In fact, movies like ARMAGEDDON, THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK 2 or THE CORE were a thousand times more boring than this  flick. It's just that the film's outcome is so predictable and that the script and filmmaker did nothing to alleviate this predictability that the pointlessness of the whole project comes to the fore. Good beginning. Predictable and flat ending.And then there's another odd point about Soderbergh's SOLARIS: where did the money go? The film reportedly cost $80 to $100 million to make. The cast is tiny (four or five actors). There are very few special effects and the sets look like your standard spaceship sets you see on a TV show like STAR TREK VOYAGER. Why spend that huge amount of money on a simple, predictable love story? The film should have cost $30 to $40 million, not $100.I love the Russian film a lot. But I can't say that Soderbergh create a disaster here or disservice to the Russian version or the book. It is a typically Soderbergh flick, which, on this aspect alone, sets it apart from the Russian movie. And like I've said, the film by itself is good. But in the end, it looks more like an episode of SPACE 1999 or THE TWILIGHT ZONE than a real movie.",Solaris

52,mstomaso,"Powerful, thought-provoking metaphysical journey - A great remake.",9,4 May 2005,"My two favorite examples of Hollywood utterly destroying GREAT foreign films are Vanilla Sky and City of Angels, which were abominations of two of my favorite films - Open Your Eyes and Wings of Desire. If you've seen Tarkovsky's brilliant ""Solyaris"" this film will seem more like an Americanized tribute than a Hollywoodization of a great piece of Soviet cinema. Some will likely ask why Soderbergh bothered to make this film if he couldn't improve on the original. Personally, I could not care less. This is a great film, and shows that it is possible for Americans to remake classic non-American films sensitively, intelligently and well.To cut to the chase - if you like sci-fi with a soul,which stretches the boundaries of imagination, explores the uncharted realms of the human condition as much as the unknown realities of the universe, and swims upstream against the currents of ethics, physics, and even metaphysics, you will probably enjoy this moody, slow, multi-leveled and heavily textured film. If you're looking for light entertainment, stay away from this. This is a slow, intense film - dominated by dialog - and there is no action to speak of. Also, you need to let this movie pour into you slowly, so if you're not in the right frame of mind to pay attention and be receptive, you should save it for another occasion.The cast is exceptionally good. This is unequivocally the best performance I have seen out of George Clooney, but the supporting cast and the female lead all blew me away. Soderbergh does have a talent for making actor's look good, even mediocre actors, but there is nothing mediocre about any of the performances in this film.Though I recognize his talent, Soderberg's dialogical technique has worn particularly thin with me. The once fresh fast-paced, rapid-fire cuts and close-ups with the low-toned exchange of sentence fragments, and the myriad Soderberg imitators, particularly in television crime drama, have really gotten on my nerves. Solaris, however, is a bit different. There are only a few ""Soderbergh moments"" in this rich remake of the classic bit of 1970s soviet SciFi ""Solyaris"". Both films are based on a novella by the brilliant Stanislaw Lem. This film, perhaps even more than Tarkovsky's 1972 edgy, dark, and intense original, will appeal to exactly the sort of movie-goer that Lem's writing appeals to. Neither film captures Lem's quirky sense of humor. I am quite glad that Soderbergh chose to make Solaris with very much the same atmospheric eeriness, plot, and intellectual and emotional depth as the original. It is a tribute to his artistic integrity that he recognizes the brilliance of the original work, and imitates it wherever he can do no better, adding subtle and appropriate nuances and embellishments to make it his own. Some examples are the wonderfully minimalistic soundtrack, and the very Soderbergh symbolic use of lighting and color saturation to shift from the retrospective to the live-action shot. Perhaps the best tribute I can give this film is the fact that I am going to watch the original again in a few days for comparative purposes.In other words, this isn't going to be for everybody, nor, even, for most. I am hardly surprised by the very low (in my opinion) ratings received by this film here on IMDb. Solaris is a love story, a story of exploring the fringes of sanity, and of questioning the very nature of reality, and much more. Enjoy it!",Solaris

The story was brought to life by Soviet director Andrei Tarkovsky in 1972. I saw Tarkovsky's version for the first time recently, and it blew me away. I actually prefer it to its Western counterpart, 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). So I was curious about how a remake of Tarkovsky's film would hold up.Steven Soderbergh's 2002 version of Solaris doesn't have a lot wrong with it, but throughout I kept asking why the remake was necessary. The original is good enough, why do we need a new one? A desire for a shorter film? A preference not to read subtitles? An old inclination to boycott communism? Such reasons sound lazy or silly to me. At its core we have an intriguing and resonant story of a protagonist who is forming a sick emotional attachment to an illusion, but it's nothing we haven't seen before. All Soderbergh really adds are some extra scenes with the psychologist and his wife on Earth, with glimpses of George Clooney's butt. On a side note, the planet Solaris itself looks dull to me in this version, turned an unimaginative blue and purple. I'm not automatically against any remake. I actually enjoyed King Kong (2005), but that film sufficiently re-imagined the story (better love story, scarier natives, etc.) to be worthwhile. Again, Solaris (2002) doesn't have a lot of problems, but is mainly redundant.",Solaris
54,mentalcritic,An interesting statement about the inability to let go,7,18 November 2004,"As a science fiction film, Solaris follows the same rule as the best of the genre, namely that it isn't the creatures or technology that makes the viewers want to watch, it is the human drama. Which is just as well, because the film itself is slower than the proverbial wet week, in spite of being less than a hundred minutes in length. Nonetheless, I will be very interested to see future projects from Steven Soderbergh.The plot revolves around a psychologist who is suffering deep emotional problems, which mainly seem to revolve around the suicide of his wife. So when he is floating aimlessly around a spaceship that orbits the titular planet, apparitions of his wife begin appearing. From what I am able to discern, an alien intelligence is trying to take over the ship's crew, in the hope that the ship will return to Earth and take them with it. Of course, the crew have other ideas.In essence, it sounds a lot like the basic plot for Alien, minus the violence. Alien has a degree of violence, most of which is implied, and so too does Solaris. The difference here is that the violence is not essential to the plot. In fact, aside from a couple of corpses, you never really get to see any. Instead, we are given a good deal of exposition regarding the doctor's feelings regarding his wife and what he would do to have her back in any shape or form. When the Solaris alien appears in his cabin, it tells him everything he wants to hear, and appears exactly as he desires.The big question posed by the film is whether we are the sum of how we, and more importantly other people, remember us, or whether there's more that defines our reality. Having struggled with other people's wrong impressions of me for most of my life, I have often pondered this question myself. When the apparition-clone of Rheya is suddenly deciding that it would be best for her and Chris if she no longer existed in this form, she asks simply if she has simply been slapped together from Chris' memories or desires. Nobody ever knows all there is to know about another person, and that's what makes the surrealism of the story so compelling.I gave Solaris a seven out of ten. It was slow, and it could have been at least ten minutes longer, but it works as a nice little piece of thinking entertainment. Give it a once over, and you might be pleasantly surprised.",Solaris

It has all the pretensions, some of the visual gimmicks and none of the significance of 2001, A Space Odyssey. Maybe they could have called this 2002, A Space Odd-see.

58,TOMASBBloodhound,A real downer.,5,6 February 2006,"Solaris is a film that probably would only be appreciated by hardcore George Clooney fans. If there are such fans, that is. Hey, at least you get to see his butt twice. The butt shots, however, may be some of the more interesting details of this film. The film touches on some interesting ideas and will definitely pull at your heart strings a little. Unfortunately, the sum total elements of the film are only slightly engaging.As far as the plot goes, imagine the film Event Horizon. Now take out the gore and suspense. Turn up the emotional issues for the ladies out there, and you pretty much have Solaris. Clooney plays some sort of a psychiatrist who is called out to a space station to examine some of the odd goings on experienced by the crew already there. It seems that the nearby moon ""Solaris"" is playing mind games with the people sent to observe it. Basically, the moon can create clones of loved ones for each person that comes to close to it. Clooney, after his first night in the space station wakes up with a clone of his dead wife, for example. Another crew member is visited by a clone of his son. Another by a clone of himself, and so on. Clooney is still very much in love with his wife who committed suicide back on Earth, and now finds himself unable to say goodbye to a woman he knows is not really nor should be there with him.Rather than focus in depth on any possible scientific explanation, the film takes the emotional road more than anything else. We feel Clooney's pain, and that of the other crew members. That leads to a depressing experience watching this film. The film cheats in terms of its futuristic settings by having the majority of its shots be internals. The few externals we get are impressive (Jim Cameron was on board as a producer), but there should have been more of them. Also, too much time is spent with flashbacks to Earth where only people's clothing shows any sense of a futuristic setting. And once again, there are too many internal shots and the sense of wonder that should be found in a science fiction film is all but lost.This is one of those ""high concept"" sci-fi films, so we are left with some big time ambiguity toward the end. It worked for Stanley Kubrick, but not so well in this case. At only 99 minutes, the film seems half an hour longer. The character played by Jeremy Davies was most certainly meant to be weird, but he comes off more annoying than anything else. The scenes with him are like running over a big speed bump you weren't able to avoid.The film lost a small fortune at the box office, and I find that unfortunate. Not that Solaris is a good film, but it proves once again that films which don't pander to those with tiny brains often fail to make any money.The film had potential, but will ultimately go down as a failure. Too bad. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Solaris

This one isn't much better.Set in the future, psychologist George Clooney has some terrific post-Post-Modern Martha Stewart appliances and furnishings in his apartment (note that in the end the zucchini still winds up sliced the old-fashioned way).  Today's therapists and neurotics will be relieved to see that his group sessions attract the same type of losers always to be found in that setting.  And the government hasn't changed either.  In a crisis, two grim visaged men in black come knocking to inform the busy doctor that he must return to service instantly - no one else will do.Clooney is shot into space to investigate a strange call for help from the commander of a research station orbiting Solaris, a distant planet.  Upon arrival he finds the station honcho dead by his own hand and two remaining crew members in need of some kind of rapid intervention therapy.  Weird stuff is happening on the Good Ship Solaris.Sleeping alone hasn't been fun for Clooney since his wife's untimely death so imagine his surprise when the beautiful spouse appears next to him as he awakens.  Natascha McElhone IS beautiful but her appearance makes sense only to those who, after the movie, doggedly invest it with myriad layers of spiritual and humanistic interpretations.Clooney struggles to make sense of his wife's appearance and other strange events on board.  Symbolically, his slightly elevated and well defined naked posterior indicates that director Steven Soderbergh is suggesting that someone is an ass.  Is it the viewer? :)The special effects aren't any big deal and the film moves in fits and starts before ending in a way that allows anyone to proclaim its specialness by finding meaning hidden in the fog of celluloid debris.3/10.

In the futuristic world of his that doesn't get too over-the-top (such as Minority Report), he must go and try to solve bizarre occurings that are happening on a space station that is around the planet Solaris. He goes up, and, of course, sees a vision of his dead wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone). Soon he becomes transfixed and believes that she is the real deal, while other members Snow (Jeremy Davies) and Gordon (Viola Davis) try to convince him that it's a ""visitor"" from Solaris. Oddity ensues.This movie is unlike any others I have ever seen. Unlike the mindless blockbusters in the summer or the drek of the fall/spring, this movie is an original piece of work that really makes you think. Don't put your mind on hold. As soon as the art begins, you're transfixed with the escapades of Chris and co. Going into it, I was feeling somewhat apprehensive, because of the mixed review it has been garnering. All of the nay-sayers must not be able to think deeply and consider The Animal the greatest movie of all time.Clooney gives a compassionate performance, while McElhone is also incredable. The supporting characters were great and we can hope that their names go out in the future. The sweeping cinematography was so magnificent-the turns and the flashes and everything else. Its 99-minute runtime seemed long, but I wished it could have been longer.The music score proved that you don't need large booms to make effective. In fact, the point is made with silence a lot of times. The ending was perfect. It isn't cut-and-dry, but also it isn't so muddled and mucked up. It's open to debate, like all good movies should be. You can't really argue about Eight Crazy Nights. Like most classics, the ending is left to the imagination (2001 comes into mind again).Solaris is a spectacular achievement of mind and body with superb acting and an awesome script that leaves much to the imagination.

I like Solaris, especially with it brilliant concepts and idea combine with good acting and directing(weird editing - as least to me). But with no doubt the movie is damn slow and would for sure make you leave your seat after five minutes into the movie. Don't!! . There are more to offer at the last part of the movie.

64,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: moving, powerful, but poor ending",6,30 November 2002,"Solaris is a powerful film about the nature of what it means to be human. The acting is good, but the cinematography is especially amazing. The camera jitters a little while filming, and the sets are not brightly lit and clear, which works well to give a visceral sensation of ""being there"". So it was a moving experience for me, and I'm glad I saw the film.Unfortunately, there were some flaws. Compressing such a large story into a regular length film glossed over some details (how far away is Solaris from Earth?), and the pacing was somewhat slow at times. Like Memento, this is a brainy movie that you have to be paying attention to ""get it"" throughout the film. I actually prefer that.Solaris is not really a science fiction film. It's really a ghost story mystery like The Sixth Sense, although science elements are present in the background. I was really set to love this film, and was definitely captivated throughout, but without spoiling any of the plot I can tell you that the ending left me very unsatisfied. This makes it unlike The Sixth Sense which came with a snappy, clever ending that wrapped up all the mystery but retained the power of the film. This is the main reason I gave the film a low-ish rating even though I did find it moving and well-produced. It was the story that disappointed me.Who should see this film:-- arty types, definitely-- science fiction fans, well, I can't stop you. It won't hurt too much. Save it for a rainy day. But not if you hated 2001: A Space Odyssey, which was much more substantive than Solaris.-- anyone from an Eastern European culture who wants to see some famous literature on the big screenI'll give Solaris a 6 out of 10.

It always jumped out at me so I decided to get it on DVD.The movie is about a psychiatrist who gets a strange video message from his friend asking him to go up to a space station called Solaris to investigate some strange happenings.I did like this movie, but it was very slow. This movie went at a very steady pace all the way through. There was no action, there was no heart racing moments. This is a space drama. There are lots of dialogue and lots of flashbacks from when he was still on Earth. You will need to really concentrate on this film to fully understand it.The movie stars George Clooney, Natascha McElhone, Viola Davis & Jeremy Davies. The acting was very good throughout. Everyone did a great job. The emotions that these guys are feeling was very well played out. I can imagine that if I was going through what they are going through it would be very emotional and confusing and that is what I was getting from every one of these actors.This is not the best sci-fi film I have ever seen. Personally I prefer a film to have a little bit of action, or at least a bit of suspense to keep me gripped. I did not get bored watching this, but as I said before, because it is a very slow moving movie, it is easy to get distracted. It is like watching someone reading you a story. It is a very good story, but it felt like it was missing something.Visually it was very beautiful in places. I love space movies anyway. I always think the stars and space looks beautiful, so when it is made well in film I find it very fascinating and awesome. The planet that Solaris was near looked very pretty. The colours and effects used to make it were brilliant. I could sit and watch that for ages.All in all this film was not brilliant it is a good story, but very slow. Make sure if you watch this it is completely silent and you can concentrate on it 100% otherwise you might miss part of the plot and not understand a thing that is going on.I will give this movie 6 out of 10.""Or maybe you're my puppet.

67,rooee,Solaris vs Solaris,7,24 January 2011,"Having just watched the trailer for Steven Soderbergh's remake of Andrei Tarkovsky's Russian sci-fi classic, it seems to be some kind of action-horror hybrid. In fact, it's a solemn psychodrama about a psychologist named Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) who travels to a research station orbiting a planet called Solaris, where his late wife is brought back to physical life by an unseen alien intelligence.Tarkovsky's creeping meditation is more conversational and a (very) good hour longer than Steven Soderbergh's terse remake. Perhaps if Soderbergh and (producer) James Cameron had known it wouldn't break profit, they'd have gone easier in the editing room. Or perhaps they wouldn't have made it at all, which I suppose might have saved us from Ocean's Twelve.Tarkovsky's vision is my favourite of that director's films, and is also, arguably, the most accessible. It contains a more straightforward narrative than The Mirror, a slightly quicker (though not quick) pace than Stalker, and it's less dense and stagey than The Sacrifice. I feel it's the most successful blend of story and character in Tarkovsky's canon; the best balanced both emotionally and philosophically.Soderbergh's version, while seriously truncated, is an intelligent and often elegant work. Gone are the former filmmaker's Oedipal motifs, the existential monologues, and the weightless ballet. This is a taut film about the romanticising, catastrophising power of memory.Soderbergh dispenses with the now infamous 10-minute car journey sequence taken by Henri Burton (Vladislav Dvorzhetsky). Is Burton's car journey a reference to Bowman's ""Stargate"" experience in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey? Later, aboard the space station, Snaut (Jüri Järvet) makes a speech questioning whether man should be exploring new worlds before he has learned to truly communicate with his fellow man. Burton's terrestrial ""journey"", after his experience with Solaris, is every bit as profound as Bowman's.Natascha McElhone, while not the match of Natalya Bondarchuk, who acted everyone off Tarkovsky's screen, delivers an eerie, uncanny performance as the almost-human Rheya, ""remembered wrong"". Clooney's Kelvin is a more glaring, shell-shocked presence than Donatas Banionis - whether you prefer the former's range to the latter's subtlety is up to you; each belongs to their own film.Soderbergh regular Cliff Martinez provides the bubbling, electro-orchestral score, lending the images a delicate sense of the lost, the wistful, and sometimes the dread. Where Tarkovsky's script was as cold and sprawling as space itself, Soderbergh's is warm and focused. And as for the ending - well, let's just say that the young buck doesn't try and take on the elder directly, choosing instead something softer, less awesome, yet still ambiguous and fascinating. Which fairly sums up the film, I think.",Solaris

Psychologist Chris Kelvin is pleaded by old friend Gibarian, to fly from earth to space station Prometheus, where something terrible has happened. Prometheus orbits around the beautifully enigmatic planet Solaris. On arrival, Kelvin discovers scattered blood and two bodies, along with the only two survivors; Gordon and Snow. Solaris is a hushed, introspective film on the boundaries of human mental stability, isolation, loss, existence, the power of a high being, and emotional withdraws of letting go. Images and silence speak louder than words; echoing 2001: A Space Oddessy, where piercing stares tell all that is needed. The mystery of Solaris lies upon the enigmatic planet, Soderbergh only supplying little hints and clues leading to what is behind this majestic planet; strengthening the fact this demands repeat views and open thinking. The emotional drama is gripping, as Kelvin is haunted on the apparition of his deceased wife, flashes of Kelvin's memories during his time with Rheya, and the unseen visitors of Gordon and Snow. Much to the vast cold of space, Solaris seeps a coldness from its core, that bars an emotional detachment. A haunting ambiance lacking in spine chilling. Not completing the emotional bridge, a central presence of George Clooney, holds a gravitas to the proceedings. Natascha McElhone doesn't reach Clooney's presence yet haunting as Rheya. Viola Davis and Jeremy Davies as the remaining survivors are great in their supporting roles.

72,bix171,An Experiment,5,6 April 2004,"Steven Soderbergh's Americanized remake of Andrei Tarkovsky's Soviet 1972 science-fiction/philosophical space opera is a bold project, given that the material he's adopting--taken from the novel by Stanislaw Lem but directly inspired by Tarkovsky--is subdued and grim, with plenty of inertia (even though more than an hour of the tedious original is lopped off). Here, Soderbergh departs from the source material and wisely concentrates on the relationships between his characters rather than the philosophical concerns that grounded Tarkovsky's film. But the material remains perhaps too daunting for modern audiences, with George Clooney (rapidly becoming one of our most introspective actors) as a psychiatrist who travels to a space station surrounding a mysterious planet that sends emissaries representing the troubled pasts of the station's inhabitants; in Clooney's case, it's the apparition of his suicide wife (Natascha McElhone) that rekindles his dormant but conflicted emotions. Although it's clearly a personal film for Soderbergh about the ephemeral nature of interaction, it's unfortunately not compelling enough to be little more than another experimental challenge for him (as studied and careful as `Full Frontal' was spontaneous and indulgent), albeit a beautifully shot one (filmed, as usual, by the director under the pseudonym Peter Andrews; he also edited the film as Mary Ann Bernard) with a production design by Philip Messina that pays subtle homage to Tarkovsky's original.",Solaris
73,Dockelektro,Exclusively for movie lovers,8,16 March 2003,"""What if?"". This is the question of Solaris. More specifically, ""What if we could bring back our lost ones to our side?"". That is the question flowing throughout Sodebergh's movie. I've never thought that I would watch a film based on a single rethorical question, but indeed, the nature of this question is what gives it the juice. And, indeed, the juices are flowing on this one. Made by an acclaimed director which is first of all a movie addict, this movie is Steven Soderbergh's gift to every people that shares with him a true passion for cinema. And nobody else. The general audience will hate it - slow paced, slow acted and slow all the way, the movie is almost like a play, tightfully enclosed in its capsule. But these few characters, these few situations are only an apparent face for an overwhelming reality - emotions are the sheer canvas of this picture. The story is so simple it reaches the most minimalistic heights in an american movie since Kubrick went into space - Dr. Chris Kelvin (Clooney) is sent to a space station near gas planet Solaris to investigate the strange occurences on it and to rescue the remainder of the crew. But when he arrives, it's clear that this is no simple bail-out mission and soon he will know that the reasons to return are far more difficult to find than the reasons to stay. The movie ends up being a strikingly lensed space drama, with the freshness of some choices (the fact that the movie has so few characters and only 93 minutes gives it a mood that is based on essence). And its simplicity is its greatest asset. Some would consider a remake of Tarkovski's work pure heresy. But Soderbergh suceeds in paying his respects, and accomplishes what every remake should be - a new insight into a known movie. A true tour de force, and a proof that when there is a will to stay out of the studio system and its sometimes corruptive formulae, there is also a way.",Solaris

It's a good plot, but the screenplay is extremely slow in it's pace.  In an attempt to be intriguing and enigmatic, it ends up being boring.

George Clooney puts that on the table and shows us how most of us felt. Solaris is a weird film with a lot of emotions running through , it touches on themes of loss , grievances and not to mention acceptance which is the the most important part of the ordeal. George Clooney and Natasha McElorne do a wonderful job of taking us on a journey , I also believe in an artistic way that it is not made to make any sort of sense but in a way Steven Sodburgh wants us to just delve into our-selves , nothing gained and nothing lost...well for me anyway.

Steve Soderbergh's lastest masterpiece, SOLARIS, ask the question, can a person love a being that looks, acts, and has the memory of a deceased loved one, but really isn't that person?SOLARIS is based on the Stainslaw Lem novel that was made into a long, but very well done film by Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky.  The story is set in the future, psychartrist Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) who has been suffering for the last couple of months after the sucide death of his wife Rheya (the very beautiful Natascha McElhone).  Chris is asked to go out to the space station that is above the water planet of SOLARIS where all but two of the crewmen have died.  When Chris arrives on SOLARIS, he sees that the two survivors, Snow (Jeremy Davis) and Helen Gordon (Viola Davis), are still having psychological sufferings.  As Chris investigates with what happened at the station, he wakes from sleeping one time to see a person or creature that is exactly the splitting image of the deceased Rheya.  In one of the most heartbreaking scenes in cinema, Chris dismisses this person or thing being his dead wife back from the dead and sends her out into space as he breaks down into tears.  Then a few hours later after Chris goes to sleep again, the appearance of the thing that looks and acts like Rheya appears again.  And should Chris believe that it is Rheya back from the dead?  Or is this a hallucination that is created by Chris' mind?SOLARIS is like Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, in being a film that is full of philosophic questions.  I feel the reason why nimrods are dismissing and getting angry with SOLARIS is that they believe it will be as fun filled like OCEAN'S ELEVEN, or action packed like ALIENS since Soderbergh and James Cameron worked on the film.  It's not.  If there is any movie where your brain is required to be used before seeing the movie, while seeing the movie, and after seeing the movie, SOLARIS is that film!  If you don't like using your brain while watching a movie, then catch the next showing of DIE ANOTHER DAY or MAID IN MANHATTAN.SOLARIS is a film that proves that Steve Soderbergh IS one talented and versatile director.  Most entertainment shows and film audiences think of Soderbergh as the director of easy to understand films like OCEAN'S 11 and ERIN BROCKOVICH.  But this is the same brillant mind behind complex films like SEX LIES & VIDEOTAPE, THE LIMEY, and TRAFFIC.  While I personally find TRAFFIC to still be Soderbergh's best film, a hair-line fracture behind TRAFFIC is now SOLARIS.  I was so glad and pleased to see that Soderbergh respected the story and sci-fi genre by making SOLARIS into a highly intellectual film where thoughts are required, characters are the key element to a film, and technology and location are used with what they should be used for, background support!Georgy Clooney proves that he IS one of the best and underrated actors working in Hollywood.  Clooney does a fantastic job with his acting of the in-pain and confused Chris Kelvin.  But the scene that really got me emotional was the scene when Chris breaksdown in tears.  Natascha McElhone, I have always seen to be a very beautiful and underrated actress that should be given more leading roles.  In SOLARIS, McElhone manages to have one can't help but to think about their significant other (being male and female) and just wanting to love them even more.  Jeremy Davis does a fantastic job as the some-what disturbed and confused Snow, who might or might not have to answers to the happenings on the station.  And Viola Davis is good as the strong minded and conflicting Gordon.If SOLARIS proves anything, it's that Soderbergh, unlike most Hollywood directors, hasn't sold out to the evils of box office success, and continue to make films the way he wants to make them, and tell the stories the way he wants to tell them.  Why are people walking out of this movie angry and upset?  I believe it is because the film requires a lot of thought.  This same exact thing reminded me of a film that was released last year that I loved but people looking for a brainless film hated, VANILLA SKY.  And for those who hated VANILLA SKY, then stay away from SOLARIS.  But for those who like intelligence and symbolism as a main ingredant for a film, then SOLARIS is the ideal film for you.   Right now, most people will be dismissing SOLARIS as a slow, weird, and pointless film.  But ask me this question, what movie will be more talked about and praised twenty years from now, SOLARIS or XXX?  Only time will tell, but I'll be hoping it's SOLARIS. Since SOLARIS is becomming to be a box office failure, hopefully like another intellectual sci-fi film that suffered the same fate, BLADE RUNNER, SOLARIS, WILL be the next cult favorite.  This is one of the best films of 2002, and please see SOLARIS the way the film should be seen, on the big screen.  ***** (out of five) ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF 2002!!!",Solaris
79,Ric-7,Faulty memory,4,6 December 2002,"It was a very well-produced, exceedingly boring movie.  I was not expecting an action film (thank God for that!), but this was the exact opposite.  What would have made a moderately entertaining 30 minutes on the Twilight Zone (with commercial breaks) is here expanded far beyond the call of necessity.",Solaris
80,smellthecult-com-1,Isolationist sci-fi wayardness.,7,25 December 2009,"George Clooney plays Chris Kelvin, a psychologist who has recently suffered a bereavement following the death of his wife. A friend suggests that he should go and help the crew of a research station orbiting an ocean world known as Solaris and, upon arrival, it seems all is not as it should be. The crew are on edge, talking about a phenomenon they cannot understand, glimpsing individuals they thought long dead. Chris is skeptical, right up to the moment his own dead wife turns up and starts talking to him.Creepy, unnerving and with a sense of plain oddness throughout, this was pitched as a romance in space, and that's way off the mark. Whilst there is a clear romantic angle, it drips with eeriness and dread, hardly something to cuddle up on the sofa to.Soderbergh's direction is excellent, evocative and surreal and making use of some breath-taking special effects to enhance the storyline, not detract from it.If sci-fi should always be ideas driven, this sets out to do precisely what it achieves, though the slow pace may be a struggle for some.You know who you are.",Solaris
81,iwatcheverything,Thought Provoking,7,4 October 2003,I thought this was an real good film.  It was a great thought provoking film.  Sometimes I like to watch films that make me think and I don't know the ending to half way through the film.  Some people did not like this film at all.  Those people are probably not thinkers.If you like 2001: A space Odyssey then this is a film for you.  Although slow it is definitely worth the watch.  I will probably add this film to my collection.,Solaris
82,loco_73,A return to classical science fiction,10,8 June 2006,"Though many may prefer the 1972, three hour(or more) Russian version of Solaris, I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed this updated version of Stanislaw Lem's masterpiece sci-fi novel by the same title. Produced by James Cameron and written/directed by Steven Sodebergh, this version of Solaris is an intelligent, thoughtful and reflective movie, a triumph of the narrative and visual which co-exist in this case in a wonderful balance. Steven Sodebergh's script, though lean, does not ignore the the essence of the book, which is that this is a love story, a search for redemption, a second chance, one to undo passed wrongs and mistakes.I won't delve into the plot of the movie or the book, save to say, that many of us could identify with the plight of the principal character, doctor Chris Kelvin (George Clooney), a man beset by the demons of his past. The sorrow, regret and pain that he carries within himself is aptly disguised by a facade of melancholy and sadness. I was very impressed with George Clooney's performance. If I ever had any doubts about his range and talent as an actor, this movie truly put them to rest. While before I used to see him as just another pretty-boy-wannabe-TV-actor, after his turns in ""Three Kings"" ""Out of Sight"", ""Good Night and Good Luck"" and my favourite ""Syrianna"" and of course ""Solaris"", in my mind he has cemented his acting abilities and talent beyond a shadow of a doubt. George Clooney is bar none one of the best actors working today.The cinematography is beautiful, while the CGI/F/X are excellent, supporting the movie and its overall atmosphere and look, never being intrusive or taking over. ""Solaris"" is a fine example of what true sci-fi can be, and can thus join the pantheon of sci-fi classics as ""2001 A Space Odyssey"", ""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Gattaca"", ""Dark City"", ""Strange Days"" and others.Natasha McElhone (Rheya) is great (and beautiful) while the rest of the supporting cast is very good (Jeremy Davies is really weird...but in a good way).The soundtrack totally captures the atmosphere and mood of the movie, which is one of melancholy and sadness. Cliff Martinez is one of the most talented musicians in the business today. Steven Sodebergh's direction is great and as expected, of great quality.If you are a fan of grand, epic scale sci-fi opera like Star Wars (not to take anything away from Star Wars and its significance for sci-fi), or prefer action and a high body count a la Starship Troopers and Total Recall, then perhaps this movie is not for you. If you want a movie with a deeper meaning and more thoughtful structure, then ""Solaris"" is that movie. Its appeal lies in the fact that it goes beyond a movie specifically classified as science fiction. ""Solaris"" is one of the best movies out there!",Solaris
83,johnny-08,Very interesting story,7,29 November 2007,"I never read anything about ""Solaris"" before viewing it and after its end the whole movie was great experience for me. Story is very interesting and it makes you think about few things. What is actually happening on board? Why are this visions coming to the main characters? And lots more. Beside story, actors are also on top. George Clooney plays main role and I have to say that this is very difficult role to play. In my opinion Clooney was very good, just like Jeremy Davies and Natascha McElhone. I didn't watch the Russian original ""Solyaris"" so I cannot compare it to this American one. But the story is simply great and I bow to the people who wrote this, so I probably guess that original is better (I have to find the original). If you never watched it, you will be pleased with ""Solaris"". It isn't long, it is interesting and very good SF movie.",Solaris
84,ilovedolby,Nicely Done By Soderberg!,8,18 January 2003,"This movie was directed by Steven Soderberg, who has directed such films as Traffic, and Ocean's Eleven. It's a remake of a 1972 Russian film with the same title from director, Andrei Tarkovsky. This film stars George Clooney as a therapist who is troubled by his wife's suicide, and while on a mission to investigate a strange occurrence on a space station near the planet of Solaris, he encounters his own strange occurrences; the appearance of his dead wife. The film was not very popular among audience due to the fact that it is a slow moving film. However, I couldn't help but love it for that. It takes its time to explain the strange events on this doomed space station, and Soderberg did a fine job in directing this film. I found its dialogue, and acting to be pretty good. I only wish that I were able to compare it to the original film. ***",Solaris

A psychiatrist is called to meet the space station crew, who had gone to study Solaris, but unexplained events occur. A unique idea where a dead loved one regains flesh and blood through Solaris. He is trying to understand on the one hand, but on the other hand he is sinking more and more into that. A special script and idea, slow pace, something common for a space movie, and an ending that really confuses the viewer. Maybe if they invested more in emotion and effects it would be one of the strongest of its kind. However, the movie is still quite mild overall. Nevertheless, an interesting recommendation to all fans of the genre.",Solaris
86,arthurclay,Pure crap the worst Clooney movie,1,14 June 2005,This one had bomb written all over it. I knew when they tried to do a remake of a movie that nobody had even heard of much less seen you knew it was gonna be a turkey. Clooney just doesn't cut it it's as simple as that. I knew one woman who just got up and left 5 minutes into it she could not take it anymore. Boring and thought deprived it's like Star Trek on dope. I can name you twenty sci-fi movies off the top of my head that were better without any difficulty at all. Don't watch it and I'm not telling you that so you will watch it. I mean it. Don't watch it. The word sucks doesn't begin to adequately describe how bad it is. If you do watch it you do so at the expense of your time and sanity.,Solaris
87,Come-and-Review,No remake beats the original,8,3 December 2014,"Okay, I add the fact that I saw this before seeing the original one and reading the book, as I wasn't able to do any of those before.I must say, I liked the original one more. This has more romance, almost is only about the love story between Kris and Rheya (in the original one Khari), and deals less with the ocean of the planet.Now, I must add that its depiction of the solaris' appearance was very intriguing, though is far from both the original movie or the book's concept of Solaris.Now, I must say this could have been a good remake, if they added that corridor we see in the '72 one, and if they sticked a little closer to the tarkovskij plot or the lem plot. Because on the love story side and the FX side we were on the good way, just the choosal of taking out the plot about the ocean the way we see it in the book or The '72 movie could have worked. Also with an actual landing scene on the planet, that we didn't have in the previous one.This was overall a good take, just it's not as good as the previous one from the plot- message point of view.",Solaris
88,Ronin47,Strange and powerful (***1/2),8,2 December 2002,"Director Steven Soderbergh continues to challenge audiences with his remake of the 1972 Russian epic, ""Solaris"". The original was a strange, very demanding movie, and the remake is no different, only much shorter. This is not a sci-fi film for the people who think ""Independence Day"" is a sci-fi film.The year is not given, but it is clear that the story takes place sometime in a pretty distant future. Something strange has happened aboard a space station orbiting a glowing ocean planet called Solaris. Before the crew cut off contact, they were exhibiting bizarre, seemingly paranoid behavior. Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) is summoned to go to the space station and find out what happened, and upon arrival he finds a trail of blood and two of the crew members dead.In a more ordinary film, this is probably where slimy, fanged aliens would start jumping out of the shadows, but this is not that kind of movie.Apparently, the planet of Solaris is conscious. It responds to tests as if it knows it is being observed. Most disturbingly, it has the power to reach into your subconscious and replicate any person, living or dead, from your life and put them right there on the space station. This is what Kelvin finds out when he wakes up next to his wife, Ryeah (Natascha McElhone), who killed herself years ago, but is now here, seemingly in flesh and blood. What is she? Is she human or alien? The catch is that she doesn't know, either. She exhibits emotion, believes she is Ryeah and doesn't remember dying. This obviously is a moral dilemma, as she is clearly not ""real"", yet is a conscious, emotional being who is seemingly the same person as his dead wife.""Solaris"" gets even much more complicated than that, as it inter-cuts scenes of Chris and Ryeah's tragic relationship on Earth with all the confusion aboard the space station, with the ever-present glowing ocean of Solaris seeming to silently observe them the whole time, like rats in a moral maze.The movie is undeniably slow-moving and strange, and a lot of people will not like it. Some people enjoy watching movies like this that force you to examine the very nature of humanity, and some don't. If you don't like movies like that, then you will not have a good time.But for a patient and open-minded movie fan, ""Solaris"" is riveting, powerful stuff.",Solaris
89,Hang_All_Drunkdrivers,Slow but thought provoking,7,21 September 2005,"SPOILERS ---- Solaris is a planet-sized super-intelligent life form able to create flesh and blood facsimiles of people drawn from the memories of other people. This it does to the researchers on board the spaceship that is probing solaris. Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) is the shrink sent up to investigate the madness afflicting the ship. Immediately he is confronted by a copy of the gorgeous Rheya who used to be his wife or maybe girl friend and soon he is crazy too. At the end, he is back on earth and after he accidentally cuts himself and the wound immediately heals, he realizes that he himself is a creation of solaris.Fascinating how the Rheya creature becomes so depressed when she realizes that she is not really a human. She knows there is something artificial about her and at one point says something like, "" I remember things but i don't remember experiencing things."" I love that line.This is a remake of the 1972 Solaris which i tried to watch once and gave up due to extreme boredom. This 2002 version is slow too but it's pretty good.",Solaris

Maybe he was on a profile-building frenzy at the time?The original, real Solaris has a lot of artistic padding in it, and the real SF action doesn't start going until well into the second half. That's Tarkovsky, he was always style over substance.But man once the original bites into the substance, it gets there. That stuff stays with you.

92,pontifikator,"Good, but it can't quite carry the weight of Stanislaw Lem's complex novel.",7,6 March 2010,"This film, directed by Steven Soderbergh, is based on a novel by cult favorite Stanislaw Lem. I read the novel after I saw the movie, and Soderbergh made a film that is different from the novel, not unexpected but perhaps unhappily for Lem's fans. George Clooney plays Dr. Kelvin, a psychologist or psychiatrist, who is called out to deep space to find out what's gone horribly wrong on a space station. People are killing themselves on the station, and the survivors are clearly insane. Kelvin soon finds out why.The movie unfolds like a flower blooming, but we're still left confused, I'm sorry to say. Lem's point in his novel (at least as I understand it) is that aliens and humans will have absolutely no way to establish communications. Zero chance. None. Totally alien creatures have no basis for understanding, no way to grasp what is intended, and no way to communicate effectively. Soderbergh takes a part of the novel and makes his Solaris a love story of longing and loss. Although Soderbergh does this quite well, he still has hung his story on the frame of Lem's novel, and there's no fit. The alien novel can't support the human film.As a love story, Soderbergh's Solaris is compelling and heartbreaking as the story of Kelvin and his dead wife Rheya (played by Natascha McElhone) unfolds in bits and pieces of flashback and dreams finally becoming fully developed, and we learn what Kelvin's problem is. Clooney is masterful with his tired, sleep-deprived face showing all Kelvin's internal confusion, loss, and anguish.But the ship is staffed by the remaining crew of lunatics. Jeremy Davies is particularly good as the totally insane Snow, and Viola Davis does a competent job as Gordon, the only one with a scrap of sanity left. Whatever damage has been wrought by the alien presence is left unexplored and unexplained, and the ending is terribly unsatisfying, despite the tinkling music by Cliff Martinez, which I enjoyed.Overall, I like the movie, but it can't quite carry the weight of Stanislaw Lem's complex novel.",Solaris

94,jrfranklin01,A Strange Trip Nowhere,4,1 August 2004,"After watching this film I felt as if I had taken a strange trip nowhere.  I was confronted with so many flashbacks and flashforwards and flashgordons, that I was in limbo for a while, much like the characters in the film. Perhaps the director wanted to achieve this effect, I don't know.  I can tell you it seemed to place such emphasis on George Clooney and his character that it felt similar to a space version of Cast Away with Tom Hanks, as it specifically hyper-developed one character above all others for much of the film.  George is a good actor, that's not my complaint.  I just felt that I was looking too long at something other than what the movie should be about.  This film is about the discovery of a spacial abnormality, a nebula-like cloud known as Solaris.  But rather than placing the film's emphasis on Solaris, we are quizzically confronted with the torments of the main character's (George Clooney) life.  But here is the rub.  The director, in wanting you to understand Solaris, makes you go through all the extensive character conflict and development.  Trust me, while you can watch this in a oxygen-rich environment, you'll feel as if you're stuck in some empty pod on the planet ""What the Hell"".  This sort of reminds me when all the big underwater thriller flicks were coming out that displayed both the good and bad to the unknown (Deep Star Six vs. The Abyss).  This film was an Abyss that just went too far off into the blue yonder.  And the ending felt as if it were quietly attempting to creak into the depths of 2001: A Space Odyssey.  But there aren't any stimulating afterthoughts in this one though.",Solaris
95,merrywood,Solaris: Seth Revisited,10,4 December 2002,"Before writing word one on my comment on Solaris its filmmakers, people who have accomplished much success and mucho dinero making highly commercial and successful, standard Hollywood entertainment deserve a most hearty salute. Here, they calculated an entry into the world of limited audiences as most people alive have no interest in or grasp of existence.   They took it further by also venturing into the fear-ridden world of the Religionist with a dialogue on Creation. Most Religionists mistake the metaphorical, instructive, inspirational and motivational tales of their various Scriptures with actual world history. Thus, they are fearful and defensive to the point of wrath.  In pursuing this cult of the closed mind they are not open to any question of their various Scriptures.  It wasn't too long ago that a death sentence (Ayatollah Khomeini's declaration of a ""fatwah"" against Salman Rushdie in 1989 after his 1988 publication of Satanic Verses by Viking, a New York publisher) was imposed on the extraordinary author.  At this writing the Middle East is aflame in a conflict based on this fear.  Thus Solaris filmmakers, you have exhibited valiancy and generosity of spirit, mind, and purse.  For that, you are to be congratulated.Now for the product: Although the ""I Am"" concept of mind construct of our reality is as old as the earliest of Hindu philosophies, demonstrated even in the early Upanishads of 5000 years ago and carried on through the latter ones called the Vedas, only in the 20th Century did two human events finally occur to help us grasp their essential truth. The first was Albert Einstein, who in 1905 began his first publications on Relativity and more than half a century later, in 1966 after three years of experimentation and documentation with the publication of her first book (with husband Rob Butts) Jane Roberts, a woman in Elmira, New York. Through mental focus Jane locked onto a formless body of knowledge named Seth.  This body, published with embellishments as The Coming of Seth, a decade later, reverberated throughout the world and introduced in great detail, the nature of ultimate reality.
	Solaris is a filmic depiction of this concept and at first glance it appears to be incomplete and fragmented.  Upon close scrutiny we see that it is a complete and satisfying presentation of the question of existence. After all, it is really the question itself, the enigma that has no finite, humanly understood answer, which causes life itself.",Solaris
96,senortuffy,New age gobbledygook.,5,4 August 2003,"This is ostensibly a story about a psychologist, George Clooney, who is sent to a space station orbiting Solaris to check on a mysterious malady that's affected the crew.  But the story disintegrates into a lot of new age religious junk about man creating his own universe.  It's pretty dull.The only pluses are the beautiful Natascha McElhone, the set designs, and the interesting sound track by Cliff Martinez, who seems to have made a career scoring films for Steven Soderbergh.The planet somehow is tapping into the humans' minds and creating beings from the images of people in their past.  They have physical structure and awareness, but only as far as the person remembers them.  Clooney's wife in real life committed suicide because she felt displaced and feared being left alone, so George tries to make amends with the alien life form taking her place.  If I could make sense of the muddled ending to the movie, I'd explain how things turn out, but the story falls apart and becomes incomprehensible. You get the sense that Solaris is supposed to be like Heaven or some form of afterlife, but it's not clear what the writers were thinking.Movies about aliens used to depict them as threats.  They were out to kill us, eat us, steal our women, take our planet away from us - basic caveman stuff.  But there seems to be a trend towards depicting alien life in a godlike manner - ""2001"", ""Contact"", ""Sphere"", etc. - like they're omnipotent benefactors out to help us earthlings.  Somewhere, there should be a middle ground where aliens act like any other physical being struggling to stay alive and make sense of this universe of ours.",Solaris

I waited until the film was shown on TV rather than go to the cinema to see it. Now I wish that I'd seen it on the big screen instead.Stephen Soderberg has managed to turn in a movie that broods, shocks and entrances as much as the Tarkovsky version in a more viewable 2 hour running time. DO NOT go to see this movie if you like space battles and simple story lines. ""Solaris"" is a tale of love, loss and general weirdness, not ""Star Wars"".

Best sound score, and it is the most visually stunning sci-fi movie ever. I don't care for romance, but this film hits the spot! What a mind twisting story. I don't care for George C but I think he was perfect for this role. The cinematography was fantastic, the rain, the surroundings, the colors and so on.

100,Starbuck-13,Contemplative experience,7,24 March 2003,"I should have known when I found out that this movie did not run in the Big Screen Movie Theatre but in the independent movie theatre: This is an art movie. I didn't believe that a big budget movie by Steven Soderbergh with George Clooney in it would not be ""high profile"" enough to be omitted by the Big Screen - but well, it was, and what a shame!This movie somehow is like a new ""2001"" with a clearer message and a much shorter running time - and that's a good thing! It is a contemplative experience with visual and acoustic brilliance which never gets boring though there is not too much happening on screen. Well, the casting of Natascha McElhone was certainly a big addition to the atmosphere - not because she is especially good, but because she has a certain scary quality about her which is hard to bear. The are scenes in which she is looking directly into the camera where I for my part would not like to be alone in a room with her. Soderbergh could have casted a beautiful woman - that would have made the movie a different film - but he decided to cast McElhone, and therefore gave the movie an eery, surreal touch. Well done!All in all a very satisfying movie which certainly could have been faster, longer or more action packed, but that would not have captured Stanislaw Lems spirit - and though I hardly remember the book, having read it a decade ago, I am sure that in spite of many changes the movie captures it right now.

She has a plodding sort of cinematic perception, and needs a linear story line in order to keep up. I loved the time and space uncertainties, and thought it was a superb inquiry into the nature of perception, reality, and the recesses of human nature. Along that line, it brought to my mind Forbidden Planet, which demonstrated the dark power of the Id. There are similar psychological aspects to Solaris. It's beautifully photographed, by the way, and I loved the understated special effects (unlike almost any ""space"" story).

Indeed. Solaris was wrapped up in big expectation: the reported George Clooney's nudity; Steven Soderberg writing and the return of James Cameron. The story goes that a mission to the planet Solaris, in an unknown future is on the verge of jeopardy. Security teams have been sent and have not returned, and the crew has lost contact, aledgedly insane. Dr. Chris Kelvin is sent in as a specialized psychiatrist, whose head is shaken up by the recent death of his wife. When he arrives he has to deal with the strangeness of the remaining crew as well as the visits of her dead wife that abound in his thought. As producers said, the movie is all about second chances, as well as choices, being the whole thing just a metaphor. However, Soderberg messes up in the writing passing everything on the directing. The trailer suggested something different. The trailer came out as one of the best - as long with The Two Towers and X2 - of the year. Cliff Martinez's score although present wasn't there. It was needed something powerful and striking, whereas what we get is almost none. George Clooney and Natasha McHelone's performances alternate between sublime and dull, coming as a result dull, the supporting Jeremy Davies does it all on what acting is concerned. The planet Solaris, the mysterious identity that runs the whole movie only gets atractivly creepy in the end. What Solaris needed was Science Fiction atmosphere; it should make us believe that we were really in space, something that the 2000's worldwide hated (guilty pleasure to me) Supernova, had to have and to hold.4 out of 10.",Solaris

104,frankgaipa,The Big Star and the Comedienne,6,4 December 2002,"Would have had to seen this eventually: Lem, Soderbergh, Clooney. Saw it sooner, though, mainly to discover whether Soderbergh, working apparently from the book, would somehow hit on the shot from Solyaris that's stayed most assuredly with me. It may be the very last shot in Tarkovsky's film. His camera draws back from the memory event on the planet's surface, until the phenomenon looks like a scab and the planet like flesh. It may look a bit, as well, like a sunspot or Jupiter's blemish, but the scab metaphor yields more: a wounded orb, spontaneously healing itself.Soderbergh's planet's blue, constantly spewing and drawing back to itself gaseous tendrils. Key to embracing Solaris is to forget, as much as possible, Solyaris. Clooney's a huge romantic star, with huge star baggage. Cary Grant stricken humorless in a spacesuit. Imagine the only sort of film that could have put Grant in a spacesuit. I think maybe it's the romantic comedy lurking beneath that makes Clooney's George Kelvin's tragic resignation as affecting as it is. Beneath the tragedy in Natascha McElhone's face is a big-mouthed, pouting clown.The thing about Rheya (McElhone) is her situation is actually that of each of us, not excluding George Kelvin. Each of us, in one sense or another, is imagined into being by our parents. Even the worst cases imaginable, battlefield rapists and worse, if there is worse, I'm sure somehow image offspring, imagine life created. But parents raising children, foster parents raising others' children, continue imagining, imaging, lives, just as Kelvin continues imaging Rhea and even Rheya 2 after that early plot turn. Each of us imagines and is imagined by our lovers. Each of us arrives in a world that existed with myriad complications before us, and leaves, too soon, long before it will end.Yet what Kelvin engages in, as his crashingly sane colleague Gordon, played by Viola Davis, implies, is a sort of necrophilia, a sort of onanism. See the really dark coda to A.I. in which David resurrects a sentient yet rigidly terminal manifestation of his ""mother"" (mistaken by many critics for Spielbergian pap).Maybe this is a film for those who experience or temperament has never led to Lem or Tarkovsky, but it's not a bad way to go.",Solaris

However, Soderbergh's signature intimacy takes over in the film; while the confusing nonlinear sequence towards the end allows the audience many different interpretations, the sensuous last scene may leave the viewers a feeling that the film's argument is romance, rather than the existential examination of Lem and Tarkovsky.Aside from Lem/ Tarkovsky, as one independent piece, the film showcases the excellence of Soderbergh's one and only intimate atmosphere, distilled by great acting from the great casts (especially George Clooney and Jeremy Davies), simple and subtle art directions for the space station and the space landscape, and quiet and pop computer compositions that are reminiscent of Terry Riley and Carl Stone.",Solaris

Folks, if your ""thing"" for sci-fi outer space genre' films is the usual suspect cliché' ad nauseum of invading creatures, violent chase scenes and exploding space ships, this is definitely not your film.Warning . . . warning . . . warning . . .This film requires and will induce thought.Concepts like define existence, what exactly is death, or life for that matter, is only the beginning edge of where this story takes you, as one follows George Clooney's character out into deep space aboard a corporate financed space station in orbit around Solaris.While living on Earth, he's summoned to go out to the station, to solve a ""problem"" that no one can understand or even describe . . .The minute he steps on board the craft, you know something's up . . . but in ways that go far outside the box of ""the usual suspect"" plot line.As for the characters and the actors who portray them, of course. I could watch George Clooney in just about anything, but the real star here is Natascha McElhone, as Rheya. The chemistry between these two is obvious, but Natascha has her own depth of character complexity that I cannot find words for here, but is absolutely compelling to watch.No, I'm not going to meander down a laundry list of what happens at various key pivot points in this story, as such would be tedious, and hopelessly inadequate to convey the experience this film delivers.From a technical and aesthetic perspective, this is a very beautiful, well crafted example of the artform. There is no wasted space as it were. Every scene is composed and integrated together to literally create an evolving artpiece containing a story, populated with living beings enmeshed into emotional complexities who may, or may not . . . be human, sort of . . .But that description can't even begin to hint at what is going on here in this unique story.

Solaris like 2001 was based on a novel and the original Russian film directed by a luminary is every bit the epic 2001 was. In fact the movie, which has a darker vision and unlike the novel has an unhappy ending, is like a reply to 2001's vision. There is no rebirth but a lengthy kind of death because human beings carry the same pains and failings in space as they do on earth. Their weaknesses are no less relevant there. They will never be free of them and it's a simple fact of human nature.This American remake made 30 years later fails on nearly every level. It has the effects and acting but it's like a B movie with a big budget. I did try to like it but it doesnt capture the spirit of even Stanislaw Lem's novel or the Andrei Tarkovsky film.I suspect fans of Steven Soderbergh's movies are very easily entertained but fans of most remakes are too. Is it so hard to watch something made before you were born? I wasn't around in 1972 but I watched the Russian film. All three hours of it. If you want to watch The Godfather, watch that. If you want to watch some 3rd rate Mafioso movie that is clearly inspired by The Godfather, why bother when the other one is out there? Same is true with Solaris.",Solaris
110,Filmdokter,"At first intriguing, but then a bit boring",5,16 July 2021,"I haven't seen the (as I understood) classic Solaris from famous Russian filmmaker Tarkovski, of which this film (directed by Soderbergh) is some sort of remake/translation. Which is an advantage for the 2002 film I guess, since most critics thought this film was absolutely inferior to the 70s version. At first I am intrigued: what is going on aboard that space station? The film asks many questions and hardly answer any. Which is no problem for me, I do like the occasional anti-Hollywood type film that doesn't force us a nightly tied ending. But here it doesn't quite work in my opinion. Somewhere halfway through the film you figure out what is going on. And then you expect another twist because hey...we're only halfway! But that twist doesn't (really) happen. And so the second half of the film becomes just a bunch of actors talking about ""it"". In general I'm a fan of Clooney, but I found him quite pale and uninteresting here. McElhone does a better job. Final verdict: not really worth your time.",Solaris
111,SinjinSB,A decent remake for those without the patience for the original,6,5 November 2003,"With remakes, there's always going to be a comparison to the original. I think I would have liked this movie a little more if I had not already seen Tarkovsky's 1972 original. The first question with remakes I suppose should be why? I can see the reason for this film being to bring a really good sci-fi story to the younger generation that probably won't be seeing the 165min Russian original. I heard some comments that this movie was too slow or too boring. Well, in that case, I'm sure they wouldn't have had the patience for the original. I've also heard some sci-fi fans who really appreciate Soderbergh's version...in those cases, I'd consider the idea of doing the remake a success. I'm sure some of them would definitely appreciate the original, but I'm sure a certain percentage wouldn't be willing to sit through the same slow-paced story when the running time is nearly twice as long in the original. Soderbergh did a fine job with this movie and did fairly well at capturing the feeling of the original in a quicker time. If that was his vision, then I think he succeeded. He didn't really add anything new to this story. This movies is pretty much an exact, but compacted, copy of the original Tarkovsky film. The actors were adequate, but I didn't get the emotion, albeit subtle, that I got from the Russian original. I personally feel the gratuitous shots of Clooney's butt were unnecessary. In my opinion, Clooney's lead character may have been better with a lesser known actor. He plays the role fairly well and it's one of his more subtle performances to date, but you can't help but see certain Clooneyisms come out from time to time, especially when he gets upset. Though I feel Soderbergh did well to cast lesser knowns in the supporting roles. All in all, it's a decent remake bringing a solid sci-fi story to modern day fans of the genre, but I'd recommend the original to those who can make it through the epic length Russian version of this story.

By removing the main concept of the book, that Solaris is a planet with a world wide sentient ocean, we remove the explanation that Solaris represents an alien form that can not be understood by man. Solaris, in the book, is the entity that unlocks the human subconscious. So what are we left with, why are we seeing these people that can teach us so much about ourselves?  I don't know but it felt to me that this film was only a reflection of our society where everything is only about ME.  What is missing from my life, how do I fulfill my needs?  I love someone else only because I see myself in them.  Maybe we have to get over ourselves and look outside, leave our subconscious alone and move on.

113,jdhb-768-61234,Sci-Fi it ain't; pretentious and boring it is.,2,30 May 2020,"There are good films and bad films; there are very good films and very bad ones. 'Solaris' is somewhere between the bad and very bad. It's a pretentious 'style over substance' attempt to be meaningful with a story that's hard to comprehend and a script that's largely incoherent and with few sentences of more than 5 or 6 words.Some have compared this with another pretentious piece of nonsense, '2001 : A Space Odyssey' and found it wanting, which says it all. For me, Kubrick's film was beautiful but horribly lacking in real content; Solaris has neither beauty nor content and the science fiction aspect is entirely unnecessary as the love story at the centre of the film could have been set anywhere. While Kubrick had the benefit of the menacing Hal, Soderbergh has nothing; there is nothing in this film to grab hold of. People who must be presumed to be highly intelligent and rational, lose their rationality when confronted by situations which simply cannot be true.This is obviously someone's idea of great and meaningful film making, but it certainly isn't mine. It jumps around in time and place which only serves to make it even more confusing to follow. The cast are wooden in the extreme, exhibiting no real emotion and, frankly, looking as bored as I was after the first 30 minutes or so. They, of course, were being paid big bucks so got a reward for their time; I was not being paid and simply got bored.

114,turkam,Slowaris,5,18 December 2002,"I must say not right off-hand, this is not a bad film. I'm giving it a 6 out of 10. But, it could have/should have been a lot better. Soderbergh is one of the most talented directors of his generation. He puts out an enormous volume of work. In fact, within the last 12 months, he has also released ""Ocean's 11"" and ""Full Frontal,"" the later of which I have not seen. ""Traffic"" was a riveting film. No one could argue with that. But, ""Solaris' was not really a project suited for Soderbergh's talents. He seems to fare better with simple real-to-life films, ""The Limey"" is a great example of this. ""Solaris"" is also dwarfed by Tarkovsky's original, which is an enigamtic as hell yet masterful piece of work. This film lacks the depth of imagery of the original, and it is really hard to Americanize such a film which was clearly very Russian in its themes when it came out in 1972. There is some sex here, and modern special effects wizardy than you don't see in the Tarkovsky film, but it doesn't make it any more memorable. But, I think it is a noble failure, and certainly proves Soderbergh and Clooney are not afraid to take risks, alas they did it much better in ""Out of Sight."" Still one has to look forward to this talented director's next project, let's just hope it will not be based on a movie that's been done before.",Solaris
115,Gambitt,Like staring off into space for two hours,4,1 December 2002,"One of the biggest problems with Solaris is that it is being marketed incorrectly.  Perhaps this is because it doesn't even know what it is. It is NOT a romance.  I'm not sure to call it a sci-fi or not.Perhaps my preconceptions have simply become too shaped by Hollywood. Initially the movie reminded me of Event Horizon (another mismarketed film) or Alien.  Consequently, throughout most of the movie, I kept on expecting tentacles or claws to pop out of Rheya's head.  Mind you, I'm not saying that I WANTED this to happen.Herein lies one big problem.  There are plenty of thriller moments throughout Solaris.  It builds expectations and tension in the audience and then proceeds to deliver NOTHING.  Imagine a typical slasher movie in which the protagonist slowly approaches the door at the end of the hall, reaches forward, opens the door...and then the scene fades and cuts to the same protagonist eating Cheerios in the kitchen a week later. Solaris is NOT a slasher or thriller but many times it pretends to be.About 60 percent of this movie is people staring blankly into nothingness. Another 30 percent consists of the trippy swirls of Solaris.  This leaves about 15 minutes for something to actually happen.You'll hate this movie if you like closure and a plot that clicks.  I call this the ""Sixth Sense"" syndrome.  Ever since the S.S., audiences have become accustomed to tolerating long-winded movies that seem to wander aimlessly with the promise that the ending will deliver a magical twist that pulls everything together perfectly.  This is definitely NOT the case with Solaris.  I understand that uncertainty is one of the primary points of this movie, but I think it was a poor choice to use the movie itself as a means to demonstrate this.Even as a pure sci-fi movie, Solaris is nothing special.  There isn't a single idea or concept that hasn't already been explored more eloquently by countless other sci-fi movies.  And there's no need to present these ideas in such an unconsumable-to-the-masses form as Solaris.  A typical Star Trek episode has better sci-fi than this; plus you save 45 minutes.Throw in awful film editing and immensely annoying characters who always mumble their lines, and you end up with a frustrating movie that's generally pretentious and not very interesting.I would recommend this movie only if:A) You love movies that are so abstract and vague that you basically need to write half the movie in your head to fill in all the blanks.  Perhaps this may be considered ""clever"" movie-making for the thinking viewer, but I think it just boils down to bad storytelling.B) You love George Clooney, and you love his butt.  (No and No, for me)All in all, I give Solaris an imdb 4/10.  Oh and another thing. (SPOILER??):  This movie ends by flashing its title, SOLARIS, in big, bold letters across the screen.

116,Soysoy,"""I see dead people from outer space... Are they real?""",5,17 July 2003,"This film had me really upset.I generally like Soderbergh's movies, especially his daring ones. So I was expecting something outstanding.He sadly missed in this movie every single opportunity to give the potentially moving story a chance to touch the viewer. To be moved by this, one has to be so sensitive that he/she cries when viewing ""Dallas"".Yeah, the spaceships look good. Yeah, the cinematoraphy is neat. Yeah, the woman has touching eyes (the ""Emily Watson effect""). Yeah, Clooney has a nice butt. So what? This is just another of this modern and uninteresting movies which, instead of using cinematic narratives, just **illustrates**, ""nicely"" and ""cleverly"", a story like if we already knew it before... and expects from the viewer to be immersed in the story just because it's a good story. Bad news, Steven, a director's work is not only showing what he can do, using creative editing and cool cinematography... He actually has a role to play in the way the viewer relates to the story and the characters! Have you forgotten this since ""Sex, lies and videos""?We know nothing about the characters, and we are asked just to deal with what happens, and the way they behave. I don't mind to feel far from the characters if a philosophical purpose is cleverly exposed or evocated, or if the audiovisual narratives incline to meditation, like in 2001. Here it's almost impossible, as the whole movie is drawned deep into a stubborn musical score that makes each scene ""feel"" exactly like the one before. This music seems to tell you: ""nothing is happening, don't worry, you shall not be moved, or scared, or even interested, just be patient and the film will eventually come to an end""... Zzzzzzz** - the only meditation allowed is to think of the shopping list... result: people who already don't like that much slow-paced movies will HATE them after seeing Solaris. Well done, indeed, Steve, well done!There is no real emotional drive in Solaris, though the director seems to think differently. Good for him. To feel concerned by a character's emotions, one must get close to him/her. The flashbacks in Solaris are an inadequate way to fill the gaps of the early narrative, and they give only flat explanations, not meaningful inner motives. A touching love story is not made out of mere facts, neither is a good SF story.The whole thing looks pretentious and utterly empty, far too clean, intellectual and desincarnate, and the many nods to 2001 only make me think that Kubrick seems to have really traumatized directors, even talented ones like De Palma or Soderbergh, who have both been completely unable to come up with a ""space opera"" of their own without basically mimicking Kubrick's work, and fall into every obvious trap that lead to make boring SF movies ""in the manner of 2001"".When will a talented, artistic director have the guts to make a really creative, independant and meaningful new movie about the meeting of man with a cosmic intelligence, without desperatly trying to compete with 2001? Is there such a lack of imagination and creativity in the movie industry?Solaris was, for me, as interesting as a mix bewteen the worse aspects of ""Star Trek"", ""Sixth sense"" and ""A.I."". How does it sound? Not very good. ""I see dead people from outer space... Are they real?""The good thing about this movie is that it made me want to look at Tarkowski's original movie, hoping that the potentially excellent story was not, like in Soderbergh's movie, buried under the will to show off...",Solaris
117,vovazhd,Deeply satisfying science-fiction,8,12 October 2007,"Solaris is the second movie based on Stanislaw Lem's sci-fi novel, the first one being the 1972 Soviet film (which I haven't seen, so can't give any comparison insight). It follows the trip of a psychologist named Chris Kelvin to a space station in orbit around the planet Solaris. The visuals of the planet, station, and equipment is great. The atmosphere that the special effects create feels perfect for the movie, invoking a sense of mystery and uncertainty. When Kelvin arrives, he finds that there are only two surviving members and proceeds to investigate. Ironically, he turns out to be the one that is effected the most by the planet. In short, the film revolves around the subject of memory, dreams, and emotion.The music is excellent. The dialog could have been better, but the acting was solid. George Clooney does a respectable job as Kelvin, although not outstanding. Since there are only four main characters, there is a special focus on each member of the team. The majority is centered around Kelvin and the memory of his wife, which is an interesting relationship that covers a wide range of emotions. The plot gets a little jumbled (mostly due to the constant switch between present and memory) and has several unexplained parts. Even so, it is easy to get immersed into and gives a satisfying conclusion.Solaris is a must-see for sci-fi fans or broad thinkers. It is visually beautiful and has intriguing content.

I found the story very intriguing and atmospheric and it held my interest - at the same time I felt something was missing and it just wasn't as rich, complex and good as it should have been.I am not sure why, I think the key for me is that I was not able to really get emotionally involved with the love story - and this is first and foremost a love story. I have trouble with most love stories, due to my own particular biases, so there has to be a lot there to really identify with it. I think the problem here was the casting and acting - it could have been a lot better.

119,Deckard-16,Maybe the most foreign American film I've ever seen.,8,27 November 2002,"Steven Soderbergh has subverted another genre again. This sci-fi is one of the strangest motion pictures I've seen in quite some time. I still don't know what I just saw an hour ago, but I think I liked it quite a bit. (I never saw the Russian original --I never cared to.) I could describe the film's plot but I don't think it would make any difference. It is a hermetically sealed psychodrama set aboard a spaceship orbiting a sentient planet called Solaris (I think). George Clooney is in top form in a very difficult role as a psychiatrist trying to figure out what the heck is driving people nuts aboard the ship. Jeremy Davies is a wonder to behold as one of the people who has witnessed many of the goings on. His performance recalls Brad Pitt's work in ""12 Monkeys"" (but imagine Pitt in slow motion from that film and you'll have Davies in this). It is, however, very tough film to sit through. The story doesn't unfold before your eyes so much as it thaws before your eyes. It is a 2 hour film that plays like 3. Several people in the audience walked long before this film ended and I can't say that I blamed them. Nevertheless with that said, ""Solaris"" does have a weird trance-like power. It isn't so much spellbinding as it is intriguing. The ending definitely raises some questions. It is a beautiful film to watch. The production is first class. It defies easy easy explanation and I doubt that it will do much box office. You got to give Soderbergh credit trying something very different. Whether he succeeded or not is not up for popular vote but is up to you --the individual viewer. It is a very unique and very strange film with an odd power.

120,Streetwolf,Dream a little dream.,1,20 December 2002,"So George Clooney finally airs his tush in a movie and that's basically all the good there is to be said about this movie.Summary: Well Chris is a shrink in a distant future, I didn't see any flying cars so I'll say sometime this century and one day he is contacted by some people from the government, who have a request from a friend of his, who is out in space on a spaceship orbiting around Solaris which seems to be a planet built of energy... and really bad 70's disco lights. Anyways, slowly Chris manages to get out to that spaceship, where he he finds his friend dead and only 2 other survivors left, who can't explain what is happening, but they throw him a bone and let him know that unexplainable things will happen when he goes to sleep... oh and there was a little boy running loose on the spaceship too so if anyone knows who he is, give me a clue. Anyways, onwards, Chris goes to sleep, has a dream of his wife Rhea, how they met, how they got together... and so on, but when he wakes up, Rhea is lying right next to him! He can't believe she is there considering that she commited suicide many years ago after he couldn't accept that she was pregnant with his child...so who is she?So after seeing this movie, the conclusions I've come up with is, it does resemble Vanilla Sky a little yet that movie was like a dream heading into a nightmare, whilst this was a dream becoming reality, which past ghosts become alive... creepy thought. The first 20 minutes were awfully slow and actually the whole movie was very slow and the message of this movie was so unclear even though George Clooney keeps saying there is a message in this movie... kindly write it on a piece of paper next time and show us what the message of the movie is because all I did understand was, do not get married if you don't want to have children and to prevent that from totally happening use birth-control pills or something, that's what they are made for. The movie is about getting a 2nd chance after you've really messed up in a very strange way.

121,Ben-Hibburd,Solaris (2002) Review.,9,10 September 2017,"Solaris(2002) is a rare example of a remake being every bit as good as it's predecessor, and in some areas exceeding Tarkovsky's 1972 version. Solaris is adapted from Polish author Stanislaw Lems novel. The film centres around Chris Kelvin(George Clooney) a troubled psychologist sent to a distant research space station, orbiting a peculiar planet called Solaris. He's sent there to investigate strange occurrences going on with the crew, as they're experiencing possible delusions of people they loved who've passed away, coming back to life.Steven Soderbergh writes and directs this adaption, which helps give the film a singular vision. Where I feel this film improves upon Tarkovsky's version, is that it explores the emotional isolation and instability of the main character in more detail. Through the duration of the film, you see the toll it takes on Chris mentally and physically, in a way that i never got from the original film. Another aspect I really liked was the cold, strange detachedness that all the characters exhibited. The long pauses during mid conversation, the empty glances, all help to sell the eerie, uncanny atmosphere of the film, at some-points during the film it felt like it was directed by David Lynch.Something the screenplay also does that i found impressive, was that it gave the characters legitimate reasons for their actions. This is something rare in genre films, usually someone does something stupid or unrealistic to further the plot along. Here the characters motives are fully realised, and you can understand and even empathise the choices they make, even if they have negative consequences.Everybody in the film gives fantastic performances. George Clooney has never better. He gives genuine emotional intensity, especially in scenes with Natascha McElhone, who plays his on screen wife Rheya, that has somehow reincarnated aboard the space station. She gives a fantastic, unsettling performance of someone who's unsure of who they really are. Is she a living, breathing organism or a ghost living through someones memories. Jeremy Davies and Viola Davis round out the cast as two survivors aboard the station. They both give outstanding supporting performances, and their their opposing view points act as counter weights to Chris's emotional contradictions.At 1 hour 40 minutes the film is a whole hour shorter then the original film. Whilst this helps to streamline the pacing, it does end up losing some of the more deep philosophical depth Tarkovsky brought to the original. The original film also had better cinematography and set design, the space station felt generic and bland in this film. Where-as Tarkovsky's version was dirty, rundown and felt lived in. These are only a couple of minor gripes that I had with this film. Over-all Solaris(2002) met and exceed my expectations. Solaris is one of the best remakes around. It's a film that has it's own singular vision, that also adds upon the original, rather then just replicating it.",Solaris
122,evilmatt-3,A pleasant surprise from Soderbergh,9,29 November 2002,"I've never really enjoyed any previous work from the director- _Erin Brockovich_ was fluff and _Traffic_ was just horrible- but _Solaris_ is really quite good.The film itself is beautiful.  I and others have accused Soderbergh of a bad Kubrick imitator in the past, but he seems to have fixed that here.  The style still very much Kubrick, but Soderbergh has taken it and made it his own.  The film reminds one of both _2001_ and _The Shining_, but comes from a different place emotionally and is thus very satisfying.  The lack of audio-visual sychronization, signifying the fragile nature of human memory, is very slick and works well here.The script can only be described as high-minded. Admittedly, the trailers are a bit deceiving, leading one to think that this will be a love story. It IS, but probably not in the way that you're thinking.  For most, this will be a big disappointment.  For those such as myself, it will be a welcome reprieve from current popular films that severely underestimate the audience.Clooney is as good as I have ever seen him- this is probably the most intellectual and challenging film he's ever done.  McElhone (most recently in the underrated _FearDotCom_) shows that when she's given good material, she can really shine.A minor complaint which is becoming more and more common for me these days: can we please have the credits at the front of the movie again?  It's not a time issue, obviously- in this film, near the beginning, I saw numerous opportunities where they could have at least done a ""Twentieth Century Fox presents"" schtick.  Just tell us the title of the freaking movie already. You can take five seconds and do that, can't you?Overall, this is a very, very good film.  Just be warned that thought and reflection are required.",Solaris
123,nelliebell-1,Death is but at our Doorstep,4,21 February 2005,"There are many ways it is thought that the human kind exhibits its proclivities and the advent of the motion picture has become a sort of door step to make believe and play acting.The obvious naive sensibility that can be entered into when faced with the prospect of having to put one over is not what I would consider a true artistic longing as perhaps in what might be called an entertainment medium.The motion picture is not a true art form and more threateningly has provided a heavy hand to a often treacherous political underpinning that is more dangerous than merely play acting.This picture is that kind of dirty politic and it provides a underpinning that will lead us to the world known as reality.Solaris is presented as one thing in this motion picture when in fact it is symbolic of another and that be reality.The quote unquote truth is that science fiction films tend to disguise certain human frailties a certain way so as to sell a science fiction film.The inability to place a definitive context as to its assumptions are mis-leading and unjustified.To put it bluntly this motion picture is a notorious fraud.A lying dog if ever there was one and what it represents is the realization that some guy over there wrote this book and it is based upon some book.The truth is that is the depth as to this disease upon the human race, it is not only a lie but the source is as well and it all came from reality to begin with.The motion picture suggests that there is something in this world called a dream,there isn't and even more so the belief in the occurrence of a dream is unsubstantiated as reality will make certain of that.Reality is not only a un-natural imposition but wishes you to be convinced otherwise.The idea of propaganda is even not such the heavy weight as reality is in fact a determined and prolific attack which has been sustained for some 75 or more years.That was when the big mouth got its way and it provided for the death of Democracy among other ideas that such an imposition actually represents.Reality can be suggested as influence, however influence though is not such a harmless creature now isn't it?The field effect is a widening gulch of just how pervasive this imposition is and this can only suggest that we are living in a world that is the construction of a fraud.Civilization or so it would seem has been influenced by that big mouth and lies like this film and so much else do not constitute any legitimate calling nor is there a politic that can be diagnosed outside of the illusion that we are free in any respect.The imposition and its character are the basis for all we believe in and there is another disgraceful result as to this worlds idea of getting its way and that is there is no value that provides for an answer outside of the lie that it is representative of.The further enhancing of realities position is that in its determination to get its way,the film and other concerns wish to allow for something attractive and as well provide for the illusion that a field is not harmful,even in its physical capabilities.You better think again,because the field of regard is a menace that if struck outright can knock a human to the ground,render one unconscious or make for a heart attack or death.Its proclivities are of such a propensity as to be foreign not as from where but as to why.The assumption as to a challenge is that deadly force is used when in fact this force is of another world and begs to dealt with as not only a foreign imposition but just as deadly as if one was struck by a projectile.This is in fact a very violent imposition determined to get its way. What is most uncomfortable is who are we?What is the source of this power over another and is it possible that we in fact do not dream but are in fact imposed upon by a real impostor.Though Solaris is in outer space,does reality possess the propensity to extend to 33,000 feet?Are we in fact imposed upon even at thirty thousand feet?Is the field of regard that hysterical a notion to have shown Adolph Hitler up?I believe things have improved thats why and its position has been more firmly entrenched.Thats something to consider,that the ambitious nature of this impostor is of such to have had greater ambitions than Third Reich.My what a deal.This film is not honest and perhaps as deflating as any that due to this imposition the human kind is not only less human but lacking in resolve.There is a very unworthy attribute that some even perhaps many of these films provide for and that is in fact that there is no belief in each other nor is there any quality to Love.There is nothing there to comment on except some slick advertising campaign.The human kind is a miserable failure and all the more ambitious are the proclivities of reality which place a predatory quality at the door step of civilization.Reality is the story not Solaris.The further issue is enhanced by the realization that reality isn't going anywhere anytime soon and though this is but the second time they have made a film entitled Solaris reality was the source back then as well.This is one mean idea and it is not worth extending this review.I don't approve of this kind of film nor is its politics worthy intellectually.",Solaris
124,paul-nemecek,Soderbergh's Solaris,8,8 July 2018,"Steven Soderbergh is the second great director to film an adaptation of the highly acclaimed novel by Stanislaw Lem. The late great Soviet director Andrei Tarkovsky made the first version of the film in 1972. This version is written, directed, photographed, and edited by the rising star Steven Soderbergh. Astute observers of cinema will recognize Soderbergh as the director who had two films nominated for best picture in the same year (Erin Brockovich and Traffic). From the previews one might expect a sci-fi space film in the tradition of 2001: A Space Odyssey. This film is actually better seen as a film about the landscape of the mind that happens to be set in outer space. George Clooney plays a psychiatrist and widower who attempts to deal with his grief by burying himself in his work. He is called away from his routine when he is asked to investigate a crisis in outer space. Two astronauts have died, and the survivors have sent back messages that are mysterious and a little scary. The psychiatrist is dispatched to solve the mystery and fix the crisis.Here he encounters an astronaut known as Snow, a delightful character full of quirks and tics. It took me a while to place the actor, but I finally recognized him as Jeremy Davies, the actor who played Corporal Upham in Saving Private Ryan. Davies gives one of the great supporting performances in the film, but the real sizzle in the acting department comes from Clooney and Natascha McElhone, the actress who plays Clooney's dead wife.Playing a dead wife might not seem especially challenging but therein lies the rub. When Clooney awakens after his first night on the spaceship, he discovers a live version of his wife in bed right next to him. Clooney soon discovers that the two surviving astronauts in the spaceship have had similar experiences. People go to bed and wake to find people that they have lost and long to see, next to them in bed.What we have told to this point could almost be gleaned from the previews. To tell more of the plot is to spoil the suspense that is an important part of the experience. If the viewer choosing this film is looking for an extraterrestrial shoot-em'-up he or she will be sorely disappointed. As a love story and psychological thriller, Solaris works quite well and Soderbergh solidifies his status as one of the great directors working in film.",Solaris
125,MplusA92,"Dark, slow, boring, symbolic and psychological movie.",3,12 November 2018,"To make a movie with an open end is a good thing as it makes you think and search further for some answers, but if the journey to that question which the movie provokes at the end is not enjoyable,then you may not feel interested enough to look for answers.The movie starts with a brief dark background about the life of ""Chris Kelvin"" or ""George Clooney"", then he was sent to the research station for unjustified reason in no time and all the events move to the station.The movie mainly is about the relationship between Solaris ""the planet"" and the crew on the station, but this didn't close the door against some sci-fi scenes of outer space and the station, while i found the space suits look silly and outdated.The characters here are limited, ""George Clooney"" appears in most of the scenes and his actions and reactions were great, and most probably the movie wouldn't survive without him. However, his character was not introduced in the best way.All other characters were taste less, they didn't add much soul nor provoke any feelings.The movie has a message that it wants to deliver, not all of people will get it nor will enjoy it, so this kind of movie is either you will love it or hate it, no grey area here.They tried to add to the darkness of the movie by the dark colors that covered most of the scenes, the slow motion of camera, and the mystery behind the whole story.Finally, it's a drama mystery movie, that runs in a single line of actions, it's boring in most of it, and you will be disappointed if you watch it after watching the trailer, as this is one of the movies that the trailer is much better than the real movie.",Solaris

Plenty of tender moments that evoked poignant contemplation and really struck deep chords with me. I felt quite affected by the love story and the treatment of memory and self-awareness hidden beneath the polished sci-fi exterior.

127,Rooster99,Unbelievably boring,2,12 September 2003,"This was the most boring movie I have seen all year. The soundtrack was brutal! It was reminiscent of an early 80's attempt at suspense. It barely kept me awake, in fact I had to watch it in 3 sittings just to slog my way through it. God, what a snoozefest. And to top it all off, all of the characters were utterly flat and two dimensional. The deliberately weird and delusional crewmember, the one straight-headed clear-thinking person, and ""I still love my dead wife"" caricature. And then the most obvious ending imaginable. As soon as I saw his wife heal after she drank the liquid oxygen, I said to myself ""I bet that is why they showed him cutting his finger"". Sure enough, he cuts it at the end and it heals. Oooh, he is some sort of alien but doesn't know it, just like the REAL version of Blade Runner. HOW BORING! How UNORIGINAL! And la-dee-da, they get their ""second chance"" at happiness..... barf. How HOLLYWOOD! How could Soderbergh stray so far from ""Traffic""? He was the only reason I bothered to watch this movie!! What a disappointment, honestly just about the most boring movie I have ever seen. What a piece of tripe, I couldn't wait for it to end just to see if it ever picked up. It didn't.

129,srobi280,The worst way to spend an hour and forty minutes,1,17 March 2006,"I rented this movie expecting a ""space adventure"" as indicated on the cover. The trailer makes it seem so dramatic and full of emotion. The movie started off at a snail's pace. The dialogue was slow and boring. It took them 5 minutes (or so it seemed) to finish their sentences! The whole atmosphere was dull. ""Oh well, it'll get better"" I foolishly thought. So, the movie crawled on. Finally, when George Clooney made it to the space ship, I once again thought ""Ok, something has to happen now..."" Nothing happened. His dead wife appeared. They kept telling him ""Its not human! Its not human! Somethings going on here!"" No suspense. No action. Just a bunch of boring flashbacks. By the time I was half an hour into the movie, I wanted to turn it off. But the thought that a movie can't possibly be this boring all the way to the end kept me going. I tried getting into it. I really did. But I realized, there is nothing to get into. About an hour and a half into the movie, I thought ""alright, its almost over, something HAS to happen now!"" And then, the movie was over. And I was not happy. Not only did I waste the money on renting this garbage, but I also wasted a good hour and a half out of my life. I could have thought of so many other things to do instead of wasting my time on this so-called ""movie"". There is absolutely nothing intelligent or thought-provoking about it. Its a cure for insomnia, if anything. Apparently, Steven Soderbergh has never heard of PACING, as this movie moved at the pace of a demented slug. The movie is so unmemorable, I already don't remember half of it. Yes, it is ""different"" from other space movies, in that the other space movies usually don't put you to sleep.",Solaris
130,citizenchris,a review,8,3 April 2004,"A criticism of the film `Solaris' (2002) By Christopher Manning 8-3-03Ahh Science Fiction, that most marvelous of film genre. It can be used as a vehicle to the wonderful or the terrifying. It can take you to distant uncharted planets or a nightmarish future. On the surface `Solaris' appears to be about the former. Chris Kelvin is solicited by his friend to journey to the space station that is studying the titular planet. His visit will be the last attempt to solve the rather ambiguous problems plaguing the station. We soon discover that this film is much more than a space journey filled your typical sci-fi raz-taz. It's no less a journey to the very nature of how we as humans relate and perceive one another. When one considers the apparent hero of the films profession is that of a psychiatrist as apposed to say a cop or soldier. This alone should tell the audience that this film is certainly not run of the mill. `Solaris' is most certainly an exercise in minimalism. A style that perfectly suits the films subject matter. The audience is not spoon-fed a bunch of pretentious psychobabble. The story is told with raw images and raw emotions. It is both a departure from the majority of science fiction cinema and a return to what the genre is capable of.The films mages are eloquently photographed using a combination of static and handheld camera. A beautiful color palette is used to communicate to the audience where they are in the time line. Cool greys and blacks for the Solaris station. Warm earth tones for the terrestrial  flashbacks. The emotions are that of a man who has lost his wife to suicide. He is then confronted with her apparent resurrection. This being the afore mentioned problem that was troubling the resident scientists of the station. It seems that every crewmember has their own `visitor'. The origin and purpose of which is unknown. Chris has to deal with facing a woman who looks and (almost) acts exactly like his deceased wife. On the surface it would appear he is being dealt a second chance. But he and his facsimile wife soon discover that this chance is fleeting when her true nature comes to the surface. The performances are superb all around. Mr. Clooney as Chris is called upon to display a wide range of emotions. He dose so with a subtle elegance that matches the rest of the films mood. All of  the supporting roles are played nicely as well. Jeremy Davies disjointed and appropriately odd ball character plays as a good harbinger to things to come. Ultimately the overall experience of `Solaris' is a satisfying one. I havnt any real complaints about the film. It in every way represents what I love about not only a good sci-fi movie, but good movies in general. I feel the film demands a patient audience, but the reward is worth the wait.",Solaris
131,Surecure,SF for the Blade Runner/2001 crowd... not necessarily for the Star Wars crowd,9,27 June 2004,"First off, if you are looking for shoot 'em up, space ship flying through the stars, hunting aliens type of science fiction, don't even bother with this film. If you are looking for a Science Fiction film that explores the human condition in the way that Blade Runner, 2001: A Space Odyssey or Contact does, then this is right up your alley.This film is not about events and actions, it's about ideas and concepts. People looking for plot points to move them along will be bored to death with this film because most of the action of this film are those that will happen in your head. It is about people, desires, regrets and what we would be willing to do if we could have that one thing we cannot have back.Some people complain about the fact that Clooney's character of Chris does very little psychiatric work in this film. But, the truth of the matter is that his occupation is used more to propel his anti-faith views. I haven't seen it mentioned, but there is a reason why there are a lot of discussion about God, religion and faith in this film.Throughout the film, Chris questions and belittles Rheya's religious views, seeing the idea of putting stock in something that he sees as fantasy as being useless and just a crutch for people deluding themselves into a happiness based on illusion. Chris comes to realize that he would give up anything to be with Rheya, whether being with her is an illusion or not. His happiness depends on her, and he realizes that accepting what he needs is not a weakness -- as accepting faith is not a weakness -- it is simply a choice to fulfill one's life, whether it be real or illusion. And, as philosophers would argue, who can really say which is which?For those who want a science fiction film to make you think (like Blade Runner does), this film is it. With a tremendous cast, beautiful production design, excellent direction, and one of the best film scores in recent years (hats off to Cliff Martinez), I have no trouble recommending this film to anybody who is in the need of an intelligent, thought-provoking film.",Solaris

George Clooney plays another bland character that has ruined his life or had it ruined by external forces. The plot is pretty much given away in the trailers and the ending is almost never in doubt. Unlike 2001, however, this movie hasn't been considered a marvel and advancement in sci fi picture making. Quite the opposite, people really hated this film and found it very derivative. While I can see why people would say that, it really isn't that bad. Disconnected from all they hype and reviews, this movie is boring yes, but mildly interesting. It is hysterical to me, that the documentary about the film on the DVD is more action packed than movie itself.   Still, if you can divorce yourself from any hopes of excitement, this movie will be fairly entertaining.",Solaris
133,EyeDunno,No SFX Needed for This Character- and Plot-Driven Gem!,9,30 September 2008,"Several things must handshake well together in order for me to actually recommend it to people. You know what they are: an engaging plot, believable acting, creative cinematography, and a nice film score (or nice choice in music). The story truly was a bit eerie as the plot thickened and morphed. By the end of the film, I sensed my own paranoia as I put my own mind in the situation.All the characters really drew me in to their situations - the fact that there were so few main characters (including, the planet Solaris, which I consider a character) made it even better. The scenes were amazingly shot. Not every camera was set to the best framing - what film has *every* camera shot that tight - but I cheered the cinematographer when his name flashed on the screen (and later found out that Steve Soderbergh was the cinematographer after all).Within 10 minutes of the start of the movie (watching it at home) I searched for the film score, and now have a CD. The scoring blended seamlessly with the feature. But IMHO, I can see where some people can't embrace this tight film. Working behind the camera for a news organization, I've learned quickly that people in general don't like to sit through something that doesn't move, change, and develop quickly. And they tend to enjoy film scores with a faster beat, or even something with a more dramatic flair. The scoring by Cliff Martinez was magnificent, and any other type of scoring, or adding what I call ""Bruckheimer beats"" (music in films produced by Jerry Bruckheimer) would have destroyed it. Some people are uncomfortable with films that have lots of ""air time,"" which allow one to think, feel, and allow all the aspects of a movie to surround the viewer and seep in. It lacks in testosterone scenes. While I enjoy those films as well, this one I thoroughly enjoyed and will watch over and over. But I would recommend them only to people who can not only appreciate a character-driven film that relies on plot rather than adrenaline, but also wants a movie that doesn't have to spell everything out for the viewer. Does a film-goer have to rely on getting all the answers, when we can make our own conclusions, based on our own life's experiences and personalities?",Solaris
134,majic-5,"Ponderous, clunky",2,23 December 2005,"In 1936, the surrealist painter Renee Magritte exhibited his most famous painting, The Treachery of Images, in New York. The painting depicts a pipe (the kind one smokes from) along with the text, ""This is not a pipe."" I venture it takes the average person less than two minutes to get the joke: One is looking at a picture of a pipe, not the real object. Give the average person five minutes more, and s/he will understand the painter's underlying message: Can we ever know what's real, given that all we can ever know is what our minds can interpret from our senses, filtered by our beliefs? Solaris takes 99 ponderous minutes to convey the same message. The movie is a sleep-inducing metaphysical meditation on the topic, loosely wrapped in a weak narrative, with weaker characters. I applaud George Clooney (the psychologist) for attempting to escape his romantic leading man stereotype, but he didn't have the chops for such an interior role. The script isn't kind to his undead/unreal wife, either, whose lines seem to come from a sophomore film school student. The spartan aesthetic  the sterile spaceship, the constant hum of electrical and ventilation systems, and wandering, new-age pulses of sound  sets a pensive mood, but there's not that much to think about after you realize, halfway through the movie, what the theme is.",Solaris
135,Clive-Silas,Let the steel drums carry you away.....,8,26 September 2004,"As a sort of fan of the original, this was one of the few movies that nowadays I have bothered to go to see in the cinema. Having seen it once I wasn't overly impressed by the movie as a whole, but primarily by Steven Soderbergh's extraordinary photography of Natascha McElhone's lambent beauty.Since the film has made its way to satellite and cable, however, I discover that I cannot resist putting it on and watching it again, and allowing myself to be subsumed by the utterly tragic mood. The main contributor to this is Cliff Martinez's phenomenal score in which the constant thrumming of steel drums over an ethereal orchestra carries you through long exploratory shots of the luminous sea of Solaris, or eloquent silences between characters.Clooney and McElhone are very affecting as the, almost literally, ""star-crossed lovers"". Unfortunately I find the two Davi(e)ses somewhat detracting from the whole, with Jeremy's ""Snow"" a slacker whom it is difficult to believe would qualify to fly in space, and Viola's ""Gordon"" seems to be out of a rather more conventional ""space alien"" movie - in fact her performance more than a little resembles Yaphet Kotto's in the movie 'Alien'! Ulrich Tukur as Gibarian, however, is a wonderfully understated reminder of the original material's European origins.The one failing of this movie compared to its predecessor is Soderberg's inability to portray Solaris as a character in its own right, something Tarkowsky seemingly managed with ease.",Solaris

Consequences, waste of an afternoon and money for the DVD rental. Redemption, none.According to the director, Steven Soderbergh, the movie concentrates on the love George Clooney's character feels for his dead wife. And how far he will go to be with her again. But all he did was take 15-20 minutes of useful story, and stretched it into a 90 minute movie by adding on 70 minutes of useless garbage.

Thus said we see immediately that all the originality is left out of this Cloony- Solaris version.A meager love story...and never coming close to the esoterically bestranening appearances of the Wife in the Tarkovsky film.Somehow Soderbergh needed his film 'to make sense'. and that's the greatest failure in this very meager version of Lem's book & Tarkovsky's masterpiece.

The question of their nature, their origin, their purpose is key as they are not aggressive, not ""aliens in disguise"".George Clooney delivers a good performance and while the film takes us miles away from a typical SF movie into a psychological drama, a debate on reality, love even, I would say that the result is surprisingly good.Still enigmatic, the very nature of Solaris, the nature of the ""visitors"", only tends to find an explanation through metaphysical and religious terms.

143,tvspace,a surprising gem from Soderbergh,9,29 November 2002,"I dreaded seeing this movie.  Even though I find Steven Soderbergh one of the most interesting contemporary Hollywood directors, I don't find him particularly gifted or with an affinity for psychologically probing movies, at least since his 1989 movie ""Sex, Lies and Videotape.""  Indeed as he's settled into his career as a director Soderbergh has become primarily a competent stylist, and an uneven one at that.  His most celebrated movie, Traffic, is an almost shot-for-shot copy of a BBC television miniseries, and most of the changes Soderbergh introduces to Americanize the movie are not for the better.Thus the thought of this director taking the strange beauty of Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 Russian science fiction art film and building a George Clooney vehicle around it only brought forth a sense of foreboding, that these Americans were surely biting off more than they could chew and would embarrass themselves -- and Hollywood by extension -- with a ridiculous effort.I'm surprised to report that in visiting Solaris Soderbergh has made his best movie, and arguably the best English-language science fiction movie since 2001: A Space Odyssey.In fact the only negative comment that leaps to mind minutes after leaving the theater is that Soderbergh's Solaris is perhaps a little too similar to Kubrick's masterpiece, and thus lacks the sense of awe, surprise and discovery that we look for in science fiction.  (Since precious few science fiction movies of the last 15 years contain any of these elements one is forced to measure Solaris against a theoretical mean rather than its contemporary competition.)Like 2001, Solaris is really a meditation on the human condition, in particular a consideration of the limits of what can be defined as the individual, as human, as sentient.  It is a simple, minimalist movie that doesn't have any interest in space opera, and conceives of action not as a matter of resolving conflict, but only as a necessity of making inevitable choices.  It's ""Waiting for Godot"" where Estragon and Vladimir are forced to flee the stage or perish at the end of the second act, where there is no option, as in Beckett, to simply ride out the calendar.  ""There's no solution,"" says a character in Solaris, ""there's only choices.  And unless you realize that, you're going to die here.""  In Soderbergh's Solaris, the demand for solutions is a flaw, an artifact of the vain human ego that wants credit for ""being smarter than them,"" as Viola Davis' character asserts early in the film.This is not a film that is going to please the average American moviegoer, both because of its slow (but certainly not dull) pace, its focus on the psychological, and its disinterest in the notions of heroism that drive the bland balance of our moviegoing fare.  The film is paced slow not because the director is trying to drive home a point.  It is paced such in order that the viewer has time to consider, speculate and imagine himself in the philosophical position of the characters on board the spacecraft.  Viewers who would rather not figure themselves into the equation are indeed going to have some extra time on their hands watching George Clooney toss and turn in his dreams at night.  Nevertheless this is simply his best performance on the big screen, the first one where he's able to use his limitations as an actor as part of his character rather than battle (however valiantly) against them.Solaris is not the most fun movie you are going to see this winter, but it might be the best.  It's certainly a welcome change of pace from the increasingly vulgar and stupid drivel that Hollywood tries to pass off as science fiction, and perhaps best of all it suggests that Steven Soderbergh may have a higher gear that he's ready to shift into as a director, able to produce films that stand tall in the broad context of film history, and not just against the diminished stature of his contemporary competitors.",Solaris
144,thomasgulch,mixed feelings,9,18 February 2003,"Is it possible for anyone in Hollywood to create a movie from a book where they remain somewhat faithfull to the book? Lem had three living humans on the station above Solaris, Dr.Snow, Dr.Satorius and Kris Kelvin.I know the current rage is to have african americans portray anyone these PC directors think they ought - pretty soon we will have present day Hollywood portraying President Eisenhower by Ice T or Cube or Will Smith, but for the love of God, enough is enough. There was NO Dr.Gordon in the book, and I guess Soderbergh felt he might score some bonus minority points by having a Black Female added to the cast as the station chief and Physicist. I do not might in having black actors act in roles that were written for them, just as I would oppose Mel Gibson playing Dr.Martin Luther King. But in todays' America, to be even suspected of less then fanatical enthusiasm for multicultural Diversity and changing reality to fit the current state of Political Correctness, is a crime against nature. Secondly, although the director follows the book fairly loosely, he surgically removes any of the scientific speculation which was the entire point of the book. I know that most of Hollywood considers the average american to be an idiot, and to a large degree they are right, but if Soderbergh thought he might rope in current americana by denuding the picture of intelligence, boy was he in for a suprise. Most of the people left the cinema in an irritated daze, not understanding the movie even after it had been stripped of any intellectually challenging parts. Why even bother to state thatthe movie was made from a book when the only thing that the book and movie had in common was the Title and overall concept of a sentient ocean? Looking at this movie as an original work having nothing to do with Lem's book, it isn't that bad. Great soundtrack, great atmosphere and visuals, a fairly clever, if not mundane plot. I have mixed feelings about this movie. If only Soderbergh had the courage to stick to the book, it could have been a great movie.",Solaris
145,trouserpress,Ocean's Twelve it ain't...,8,9 February 2004,"This film has divided audiences, even in my own household; I thought it was really good, and my wife hated it and thought it was the most boring film she'd ever seen. So fired up was she that she ranted and raved incessantly for about an hour after we came out of the cinema. So what is the film at the centre of this debate? Well, it's is Steven Soderburgh's latest collaboration with George Clooney: a slow, meditative piece of filmmaking based on the seventies Russian sf classic Solyaris.The story involves Chris Kelvin (Clooney), a grieving psychiatrist, being called on to visit a space station orbiting a strange pink and blue planet (that looks remarkably like a human brain), where strange things have been happening to those on board. The planet is causing memories of the crew to become real living things, hence the strange behaviour and refusal of the crew to leave.When Kelvin arrives he is forced to confront his own feelings about his wife's suicide when he is given another chance to be with her. The story here is really secondary to the existential questions the movie poses, and the atmosphere and emotion that it tries to portray. I feel that for the most part the movie succeeds. It is certainly a brave experiment for Soderburgh and Clooney (last seen together with Oceans Eleven), and unfortunately has not been a great commercial success in the States (partly due to bad marketing). I fear that it will suffer the same fate here in the UK, where we want our Hollywood product loud, fast and manipulative. I think it may do well in Europe though, as it is more akin to the French style of filmmaking, where more stress is on dialogue and philosophy than on all out action.",Solaris
146,HardKnockLife210,Intriguing,8,18 October 2003,"When I first heard of Solaris, I expected very little.  Soon after, I never heard anyone speak of it again.  Then, I watched the trailer one day and realized just how interesting the premise seemed.  Yet I still had no idea what to expect when I sat down to watch the movie.What I got went far beyond my expectations.  Solaris is truly a ""mind-bending"" picture.  It is the type of motion picture that does not leave your mind soon after you have watched it.  It has a very haunting, yet beautiful quality that sends chills up your spine.  The score also adds to the altogether strange mood of the movie.And that in itself sums up Solaris.  It is a strange movie.  So, if you don't like to think or if you're looking for large amounts of action, don't watch this movie.  And, yes, it is quite slow, but it is only as boring as you make it. I challenge you to submerge your mind in the movie and let it affect your mind.  Think about what is said and think about what you see.

A fine individual film-maker is now reduced to making inept remakes of good films - Oceans Eleven and now Solaris. Solaris isn't a bad film, just rather dull, with the two main characters incredibly wooden. George Clooney is unconvincing as the psychologist summoned to investigate the space station's mysteries, and Natascha McElhone looks beautiful, whether smiling, bewildered or distressed - but expresses only those three emotions and says little of consequence.  The visuals of space are as good as I have seen but by the (ambiguous) end of the film the impression is left that the director was more interested in the visuals than the plot, despite the legacy of Lem's novel and Tarkovsky's film - both superb. A big disappointment.",Solaris
150,Preston-10,A Solaris (2002) review from a Tarkovsky fan,10,28 November 2002,"I can't think of another person who admires Andrei Tarkovsky more than I. For me, he was a seer, a poet, a true artist. When I think of truly gifted filmmakers, I only think of two: Tarkovsky and Bergman, and in my opinion, Tarkovsky has ... no ... equal. When I heard that they were making another film version of Solaris, I could not even articulate my disdain. How can they take a perfectly good film, albeit, with limited special effects, by the greatest filmmaker of all time, and turn it into a Hollywood remake. Imagine Ivan's Childhood remade by Steven Spielberg, or Stalker as conceived by David Fincher. In essence, I believe that good films should never be remade, only bad ones... I could only conceive of Solaris as directed by Soderbergh, if he actually had the decency to make his own film, rather than remake the Tarkovsky version. I became more receptive before the release of Solaris when I understood that Soderbergh came across the story only through the Tarkovsky version, but by utilizing the plot structure through the original book by Stanislaw Lem. Why should I have disdain, I thought, it wasn't Tarkovsky's idea in the first place. Today, Soderbergh's film was released in my area, and I approached it without any preconceived emotions. This is what I thought: What results from Steven Soderbergh's Solaris is not necessarily a story, but really, a thought-provoking character that analyzes our drive for what's missing from our lives, no matter how closely it can be replicated. Is space travel a way of exploring worlds, or is it a way for us to ""create mirrors"" as one scientist states in the movie. Will we find anything that fills our need, or tells us more about ourselves? Solaris analyzes these questions. The thing that I admire about this version of Solaris is that it presents itself without fanfare, or action sequences, or unnecessary special effects. It may be classified as a science fiction film, but it's far from any Hollywood science fiction film you could conceive of. It's a very minimalist film, as demonstrated by the sequences where scientist Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) roams the corridors of the spaceship that he journeys to in the film. The sea of the planet that the ship orbits around takes memories and creates replicas of lost wives, brothers, friends, etc... Why it does this is never really explained. Sometimes the experience gives us more than any need from us to explain it. When a group of astronauts journeys to Mars in Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles, only to discover their lost relatives, they can only conceive that, without skepticism, that they've been sent to heaven. It's hard to let go of the past once it's been returned to us, since everyone has something, or someone, that's so precious to us, but has been lost. So, for an initial reaction, I give my highest praise to Soderbergh and Cameron for making a film that flies in the face of the Hollywood excess I thought it would become. I give praise to this film, not from the standpoint of a Tarkovsky fan, but as a seeker.",Solaris
151,ttbrowne,Sci Fi For Thinking Adults Only,9,6 January 2004,"A great Sci Fi film. I didn't know what to expec since the box said something about 'what sci fi used to be'.

Finally, An intelligent film about the future where your mind has to actually figure something out. You won't HAVE to worry about your little children or young teenagers ruining it either, It's well beyond their thinking capability. When one character said, ""If I tried to tell you what's happening here, It wouldn't be what's happening here."", I didn't understand.

152,hmsgroop,Not so Bad as Expected,6,18 February 2003,"Being a Russian of Polish origin, i cannot but treat this film with a fair share of criticism. I'd like to point out two positive facts: 1) the makers of the film watched Tarkovsky's ""Solyaris"" (1972) VERY attentively, and they may have read the novel by Lem; 2) the makers managed to avoid the blockbuster stunts and special effects, which helped to preserve the atmosphere of the original novel. There is also a pleasant surprise - Clooney is certainly an adequate choice for the part of Chris; he has more than fine looks to offer though he also studied Banionis' Chris too attentively. Unfortunately, there is a drawback - in contrast with ""Solyaris"" (1972) the film has problems with holding the viewer's attention all the time; there are ""dropouts"", as it's hard to retain the same degree of concentration throughout the film. In this respect ""Solaris"" (2002) loses points to ""Solyaris"" (1972; Tarkovsky used symbols (like seaweed and the Breugel picture)just in the right places, so that they served both for relaxation and for reflection. I also wonder why the makers of the film decided to rename the characters - why did Khari become Rheya? why did Sartorius and Snauth give way to Snow and Gordon? Why on earth was the all-male crew of Lem's novel transformed and included an Afro-American woman never mentioned in the original? Is it impossible to shoot a film without an Afro-American on the cast as it is wrong from the point of view of political correctness, and the author may go to hell?In spite of all these drawbacks, I'd like to say that the film seems to continue the chain of problems raised in Tarkovsky's ""Stalker"". There the main characters went to the Zone to find a room where all the most cherished wishes could come true. In ""Stalker"" the characters reach the room, but they don't enter, as they do not know which of their wishes will be granted by the Zone, they don't know whether the dark side of their nature will be revealed or not.They do not trust themselves and have no faith. ""Solaris"" (2002) may be telling us to learn to trust. The giant thinking planet acts as God restoring the long-dead beloved and granting wishes. Do you remember that at the end Rheya says that everything has been pardoned and that what was does not matter anymore? So if gods give us presents having searched our souls, shall we doubt and send back the gifts?",Solaris
153,rspress,Don't Let The Solaris Go Down On Me.,3,9 September 2005,"Sorry to paraphrase the Elton John song but I don't want this film anywhere near me.I had a hard time try to classify this film. It is not really a Sci-Fi film, not really a drama, not really a physiological thriller but maybe a love story. I finally came up with a word to classify it, this is a bad film. A really bad film. Not the worst film in the world but it ranks right up there with the rank!I have read other reviews here comparing this film to Blade Runner or 2001: A Space Odyssey. If I were Ridley Scott I would be fuming and if I were Stanley Kubrick I would be spinning like a lathe in my grave. I will even cut Mr. Clooney a break and put the blame squarely on Steven Soderbergh. He fails on so many levels with this film. At least in the other films mentioned the characters are intelligent and think for themselves...they are to coin a term 3 dimensional. Clooney is sent to the space station that is observing Solaris as the only man who can save it. I take it they meant he was the best and brightest yet when his dead wive magically appears he does nothing to find out why, he just puts her in an escape pod and ejects her into space. The next night when she magically reappears with not a clue as to where an why she is there he totally accepts her without question. Clearly if he is earths best and brightest then nearly all people on earth go to school via the short yellow school bus. It makes you wonder how we developed the technology to make it into space at all, let alone another star system. The rest of the crew on the station are much worse but at least they have the excuse of having been there longer. It is hard to find a level this film does work on. The only redeeming quality are some of the scenes and the way they were shot. They made nice use of color to set the present and the memories apart, which is good because without that the viewer would have lost interest in the first 15 minutes of the film.If you want a film that makes you question reality then almost any Phillip K. Dick film will be a better bet or better yet read one of his books or short stories. If you are at the video store and this film and the Blade Runner directors cut are the only two videos in the store, just pick up Blade Runner. If you have seen Blade Runner 25 times already.....then pick it up again. I would be surprised it the film was hit by revisionist history and the credits listed the director as Alan Smithee and not Steven Soderbergh.",Solaris
154,gtbarker,Thought provoking,10,22 December 2009,Occasionally films come along which expand your perception by making you think in new ways and consider new options and Solaris for me is one of those films.I am one of those who wonders why this film is so under-rated but having been an avid film fan of many years I'm not surprised. People as a whole like happy twee explainable endings and don't like films that leave them thinking (that's why so many recent films have had their endings ruined by executive paranoia and focus group interference). This film had a retro 70s feel running all the way through it laments back to the days when film-makers were allowed to treat their audiences as adults and the fact they are no longer allowed to do this makes us all poorer for it.For me Clooney has become a great actor and been behind some of the best films of recent years and I think this was his coming of age movie.'Am I alive. or dead..?' - 'we don't have to think like that anymore'.

155,jwpappas,The BEST scifi film since the first MATRIX,10,26 July 2003,"SOLARIS is the rare modern scifi film that is a meditation on ideas instead of wham bam lazer fights in space. Many pseudo-intellectuals dismissed the film as a ""second chance at love"". The main theme of the film is the exploration of the meaning of relationships. Chris Kelvin (Clooney) while on a space station circling the newly found planet Solaris is ""visited"" by a flesh & blood facsimilie of his dead wife Rheya (Natasha McElhone). She isn't a dream nor is she simply an alien disguised as her. She is a mirror of his memories of his wife--HIS memories. This is the theme of the film: what are our relationships but for our memories of what has already happened? How much can we really know a person? How much can we approximate how another person feels, how things feel to their touch, how things smell to them? The ""visitor"" replica of Rheya is a conglomeration of Chris' memories of her--but that is just how she begins ""life"". The Visitor Rheya is conscious of what is happening & knows she isn't really Rheya & makes Chris aware if this, yet he still cannot let her go as the love that he felt during his troubled marrige has come back & its a feeling he can't abandon easily. Which also begs the question what is the meaning of love?SOLARIS is a beautifully made, well acted, moody film THAT IS NOT A REMAKE. Like the 1972 Russian film by the great Tarkovsky, it is based on the novel of the same name by the Polish writer Stanislav Lem. The dimwits who don't understand the subtlties of Soderberg's film have given themselves a pass by dismissing it as a ""bad remake"". If all one gets from seeing Soderberg's adaptation of Lem's novel is that it is a ""second chance at love"" story then there is NO WAY they ever saw Tarkovsky's 3 1/2 hour snail paced film. Chances are they never saw 2001: A SPCE ODYSSEY either but they probobly read a lot of reviews so that they can bullsh*t their way through a discussion of it.",Solaris

This movie is a thing of beauty, anyone that needs a car chase or some kind of explosion, nudie scene, or murder, stay away, everyone else please watch. I was not a fan of George Clooney, now I am. His performance is one of the top 5 in the last 20 years, this role is so hard to play and yet he plays it beautifully. Kudos for the director who gave this pretty boy the role of his career. McElhone is excellent as his wife. The only weakness on this movie is Davies, too over the top, too cliche, it is a shame because it is the only thing that stops this movie from being absolutely perfect. As far as the direction, it is fantastic, this is one of the most intimate movies ever filmed. The presentation of Clooney's encounter with his wife from the beginning to the end of their marriage is gorgeous, 100 words are maybe exchanged and yet a lifetime is presented. The score is excellent, it is so original, it would have been out of place anywhere else but here. As far as anyone saying this movie is slow, they have been playing to many video games.

One of my favourite interpretations of alien life because we never get to understand it and we are left with a feeling of wonder afterwardsThis movie on the other hand, is a love story using the planet Solaris as a backdrop. Just look at the poster...I feel if the cast were believable, (stop putting Clooney in non rom com roles that's all he can do) the script was written properly, and the direction was good this could have been a good adaptation but for me it's just a weak effort.

159,Alex-Tsander,Slowlaris.,7,24 April 2006,"The trouble with trying to film Lem's story ( rather too short to call a novel ) is that the events are all ""internal"" and subjective. There is almost nothing ""external"" or objective to depict. Why then try to make a movie of it? I am of the opinion that Tarkovsky ( you'll pardon the spelling ) did it because he wanted to make a science-fiction movie to compare with Kubrick's 2001 of four years earlier. In that he undoubtedly failed, producing a sprawling undisciplined behemoth that compensated for the lack of action with a surfeit of to-camera monologues. That he unconsciously aspired to the KJubrickesque is revealed by his preoccupation with the circular motif that was the visual signature of 2001, the space station depicted in Bob McCall's poster for the movie. Yet, whereas that wheel in space corresponded to the engineering requirements for the centrifugal simulation of gravity, in the Tarkovsky version, the circularity of the space station has no meaningful relevance whatsoever ( the floors are perpendicular to the direction in which gravity would be simulated ). It is, rather, a kind of stylistic Freudian slip, echoing the influence of Kubrick's masterpiece on the Russian wannabe.Why would Soderbergh choose to re-make the story? Possibly, by relay, there is an echo of Tarkovskies motivation, in that the Russian's movie, for all it's inadequacies, has been hailed a classic in the west. Maybe Soderbergh was drawn to that. But maybe he was also interested in those very themes which make the story so challenging to enact. Maybe he also falls into the same trap. But, whereas the earlier version relied on talk, here the drama is conveyed entirely in another medium, also not visual, yet entirely cinematic: the score.Cliff Martinez' score is undoubtedly the star of the movie without which it would be almost nothing. The music is an accomplished pastiche of compositions by John Adams, Philip Glass and, appropriately, Gyorgi Ligeti. I had not noticed Martinez' music for Sex Lies and Videotape or Traffic. I really cannot remember it. But I love the monumental quality of John Adams' music, and here Martinez has copied that to breathtakingly emotive effect. In particular, it is the use of gigantic floating chords that characterises John Adams' most dramatic work,a kind of aural surf repeatedly breaking in a suspended, ever imminent crescendo like a musical tsunami. This technique Martinez borrows in a number of scenes, even introducing wind instruments into what is a predominantly string sound-scape. The effect is to paint in the drama of shifting emotions that no one can either see or make visible. This he couples and juxtaposes with the excitement provided by his bright, high-temp rhythmic line. The effect makes the movie.The supporting star of the movie is the design of the sets. The steel and alloy effects are highly technical, impersonal yet not harsh or intrusive. However, we again find a further continuation of the circular motif echoed down the decades from Kubrick's 2001. Here those circles are every bit as meaningless in engineering terms as they were in the Tarkovsky version. And in all the various other sci-fi movies where spaceships are designed in the circular by people with no grasp of engineering or any understanding why the structures in Kubrick's timeless vision are that way.The movie at hand seriously lets itself down at the very end when it seems to trip into some kind of superficial religious cliché: ""Everything is forgiven"" indeed!",Solaris
160,wall17,Go Straight to the DVD for your Term Paper,6,15 November 2004,"Solaris is not going to be for all tastes for the reasons outlined in other reviews: some will see it as slow, confusing, etcetera. It's an art film masquerading as a Sci Fi star vehicle if you look at the credits and the bare plot outline. As far as the plot, I'm not going to bother saying anything at all, because basically anything you read about the plot is a spoiler. The more you know about it in advance, the less you're going to enjoy the unfolding. Let's just say it's definitely not a Cameron-inspired action flick, and it's as much Soderbergh's homage to Godard's Alphaville as a remake. Speaking of which, I enjoyed the original, admired the book, and I actually think Soderbergh improved on both by using a lot of pure film technique to make it more taut. There's very little in the way of loud action movie over-explanation here.What I did find particularly delightful is the commentary on the DVD edition -- James Cameron and Soderbergh talking about many of the choices that went into the movie, a host of techniques, where they think they made mistakes, what they did differently but then changed back, and so on. You couldn't have two more different directors in on a collaboration, and it's really quite cool to listen to their dialogue about the making.So here's the punchline: while this is definitely a filmmaker's film, it's even more of a film student's film. For those of you who haven't done the same and are of the analytic bent, it's great fun to go through the film, then the commentary, then read the screenplay (included no the DVD!), then go back and see the Tarkovsky and then go back to the Lem novel. You could do a whole intro to film technique course that way.I give it a 6/10 on merit but an 8/10 on guilty pleasures for peeking inside the filmmaker's toolbox.",Solaris
161,AEBarschall,"A quiet, thoughtful movie with a glorious nude",8,9 December 2002,"The images from the original Solaris movie have been coming back into my mind ever since I saw it.  I couldn't remember much of the plot, but I did remember the strange, dream-like visitors and also magnificent views from the windows of the Solaris space station.  Now, in the original, CG had not been invented.  So, the Russian director took photos from an airplane (or from a balloon??) of Earth's oceans, and used those to represent the surface of Solaris.  The space station had huge picture windows, letting in glorious sunlight, and you looked out on this beautiful, powerful ocean a lot.  It was just stunning.Now, the CG Solaris is also interesting, but somehow not as powerful or as beautiful.  Hollywood is going nuts over CG right now, and CG is definitely a lot of fun, but it's not a real substitute for some of what used to go before.Still, I did like this remake.  I must say that the high point was the nude scene.  This was just a GORGEOUS scene.  Really.  George Clooney has just the most fabulous shoulders and the lighting and filtering were very artistic.  It is definitely worth going to the movie just for this scene -- full size on the big screen (at least if you're a straight woman or a gay man).  You'll notice that somehow I still find the natural more beautiful than the CG.Now why isn't this movie R?  Because it was a back nude and not a front nude?  Does this make sense?  Surely you wouldn't want to take your kid to it even when it is rated PG.  It's heavy duty psychological and your kid won't understand it at all -- just flip out at the nude scene and possibly also over the suicides.   Anyway, as to the plot, there isn't too much of one.  It's more a bunch of questions.  What would we do when faced with an alien intelligence that attempts to communicate with us by mirroring to each individual the strongest images out of his or her subconscious?  Commit murder?  Kill ourselves?  Become weird hermits locked in our bedrooms?  Try to erase the images?  Try to cling to them?  How would the alien respond to any of those actions?  Could we ever get past the images and actually communicate with the alien in a way that would seem more meaningful to us rather than to the alien?  What did the alien actually learn from all  this?  Did people, armed with foreknowledge, ever try this experiment again -- possibly more successfully?  Don't expect answers to all of these questions, though.It's all very thoughtful and I really liked George Clooney in this.

I mean, apparently, she was the one to suggest to head back toward the end of the film, but Chris didn't bring any changes to the station really, except for summoning up that robot-like Rheya, whose death is the only point in the film which made me high --- and, p.s., why was Chris wanted in the first place?

When this first started, it seemed like this might be a decent murder mystery set in space; NOPE.  no dice there.  It ended up being two hours of time I could have spent sleeping.  My dreams are more coherent than this.  Why do people waste time and film just to show Clooney's butt, and a dozen close ups of that ugly chick he was with in the movie?  Ugh...",Solaris
164,jeev7882,...artistic reflection of love and the choices we make surrounding it,8,4 December 2002,"I hate writing reviews for movies like this. Why? Because there are important revelations everywhere, there are truths revealed throughout, and every detail mentioned is a potential spoiler. But, the way to avoid this is to address the techniques, performances, and specific aspects of the film I liked. So, while this review may not be as thorough as some of my others or nearly as helpful, I'll address as much as is reasonable.First off, I haven't seen the original directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. But, I do know that Tarkovsky believed that a brilliant movie was never entertaining. I disagree with the proclaimed movie genius in every way, but then comes Solaris, yet another Hollywood remake of a classic and another of Soderbergh's projects. Through this movie, I understand what Tarkovsky meant (though I still disagree). This movie is deliberately slowly paced, so much so that there is no huge climax or booming plot points. Instead, Soderbergh has opted to create an extremely artistic reflection of love and the choices we make surrounding it.A great deal of this movie relies on the music to carry the scene. Luckily, Cliff Martinez composes what is unquestionably the best musical score of the year. There is very little dialogue so the actors are often forced to, well, act. This movie truly believes that actions are stronger than words. Kelvin is faced with an extremely perplexing situation. We learn that his wife committed suicide years ago on Earth, and her suicide was partially Kelvin's fault. The planet then comes into play; it is the apparent cause of these ""beings"" solidifying on the space station. The planet can only create a ""being"" based on the information in a person's mind, so Kelvin is faced with a being that is a reflection of what he remembers as his wife. Not his actual wife. He deals with this first by jettisoning the first image of his wife into space, but of course she appears again after he falls asleep. Even more interesting is that from the birth of a ""being,"" they are their own person. They can reflect on the past and even judge themselves. Rheya starts to figure out herself that she isn't actually Kelvin's wife.Sci-fi fans will be sorely disappointed because even though there are some beautiful special effects here, they are extremely rare. The sci-fi elements are present only to initiate the plot and give a few nudges to move it along from time to time. This movie is for any patient viewer who can stay awake during long periods of silence, at least in terms of dialogue. Clooney fans will mostly be alienated because the normally verbose actor is limited to looks, expression of feelings, and other such techniques (women will be pleased at the continual exposure of his posterior). He delivers what is arguably his best performance ever in a very respectable acting career. If he continues teaming up with Soderbergh, a golden statue may be in his near future. A welcome surprise was a very good performance Natascha McElhone as Rheya. I normally don't like McElhone much, but as the mysterious Rheya she changes emotions in a heartbeat and gives us all we need to know with her actions. Maybe it's the fact that her big beautiful eyes and wide grin can say so much without a sound that helps her in this kind of movie. Regardless, she really keeps the movie alive at certain points when she needs to. Otherwise, she gladly takes second billing to Clooney. The rest of the cast is not much to talk about. There are fewer characters here than in any other movie I can remember.The best part about Solaris is that it doesn't throw emotion at us, but instead proposes ideas to us. The more patient moviegoer will have time to ponder these ideas and discuss them with others. My mind stopped and grabbed the line ""I was haunted by the idea that I didn't remember her right."" You can get a migraine from that one line and the many ways you can read into it. In one way, it's ironic because none of us can remember anyone ""right"" regardless of how much we love them or how well we know them. Along the same line, our emotions can be a projection of one thing onto another. Clooney hanging on to this image of his wife is no more ridiculous than crying during a movie. We know the people and most often the events are fictional, but sometimes the waterworks just can't be stopped.In the end, I found Solaris to be much less confusing than I expected, though there a few twists and surprises that were challenging to say the least. The words, while few in number, are meaningful and never unnecessary. Soderbergh's direction is as ample as always; Erin Brockovich, Traffic (overrated, but well directed), Ocean's Eleven, and now Solaris. Not a bad resume over the past few years. I have a feeling that producer James Cameron may have given him an assist on some of the sci-fi points. I can't emphasize enough that you will only like this movie if you are extremely patient and have a taste for artistic films. But, if you fit the profile, I wouldn't be surprised if you are completely sucked in by this introspective piece.",Solaris

There are very few positive things I can say about this movie... It's a 'sorta' try to copy '2001, A Space odessey 1968'. That worked then. But this does not work now.

166,imajestr,A Classic for Science Fiction Drama...,10,19 December 2006,"This is an incredible film. However, it's not a film that will be approachable for everyone. It is thought provoking only to those who will put forth the effort of seeing the questions in this movie for what they are. It's a philosophical and emotional journey rather than an explosion filled action thriller. It is fantastically atmospheric and eerie, which is very fitting considering the subject matter.The movie puts forth a few questions to the viewer: What does it mean to be alive? Where did we come from? Who are we? And what makes us who we are? This is one of the most well directed films I've seen. It's rather surreal in feel and surprisingly doesn't have a lot of science throughout. It's like a long relaxing dream. I don't understand why it only has around a 6 on IMDb. The direction was great, the philosophy is thought provoking, and the movie itself is just very well done. I especially enjoyed the music therein, as it went from very relaxing to eerie and back again at certain points.The acting is also just perfect. I was very surprised how deep of a character Clooney was able to pull off. You can really feel his character's emotions and understand him.I actually wish the movie was a little bit longer, only to extend the atmosphere a little more. At an hour and thirty-two minutes it still feels too short. Yet, I think when a movie feels like it should have more length it is a very good sign, as it means I wanted to experience it a little bit longer.I think people that don't like this movie are just the kind of people that don't like to think about movies. The same people that don't enjoy movies like The Fountain. Maybe they expect all science fiction movies to be The Matrix, I don't know, but this is a wonderfully well done piece of science fiction that I think deserves a lot more credit than it receives. So, if you're not looking to have a movie shoved down your throat, and if you're looking for a strange, yet beautiful piece of art, I'd say this is one of your best bets.One last thing, I recommend that people see this twice, as I didn't understand a lot of it the first time through, so I missed a great deal of the philosophy beneath the surface. I also didn't understand the ending the first time I watched it, but I now understand it perfectly.",Solaris
167,oleh_k,What is going to happen to Clooney character?,8,2 December 2002,"Like any high quality sci-fi this movie asks existential questions.Is Clooney character going to be a ""curiosity"" puppet in Solaris hands? If so for how long? And then what (it does take energy to maintain his existence)?He is obviously not the same person anymore - no fear of death or injury. Will his (his?) feelings for Rhea evolve? I bet they would have to change - different surroundings, different ""Rhea"". Would he still long for a baby of his own? Why? - He is quite possibly ""Solaris"" immortal (in his eyes).Was it worth to step away from the hatch to loose mortal *yourself* in the ocean? It seems to me not, if his motif was to make a better effort at recreating happy life of *him* with Rhea (this reason is hinted at in the movie). Now if his motif was exploration of alternative existence with a chance of not loosing his personality, and perhaps even returning to previous state (Orpheus-like), it could have been justifiable  who said that he is not already a figment of Matrix imagination? Why not try alternative Solaris universe?There are no answers... Only choices.8/10",Solaris

This does show that he is quite a talented actor.Anyway its good to watch it makes you think and its quite suspenseful too, plenty to see here.

169,Momcat_of_Lomita,"A thought-provoking look at love, loss, and what they mean to us.",7,23 February 2011,"Although not a perfect movie, Solaris is definitely a work that can command your attention and get you thinking.It is not a big, bravura, dynamic action movie, so if you're looking for something that is big on special effects and loaded with dramatic action sequences, this is not the movie for you. The drama and tension in Solaris are quiet and understated, and are mostly inherent in considering one man's decisions about what love, and loss, and the nature of life, mean to him. In this way, it's a very personal movie.In the end, we don't know much more about the characters than we did at the beginning, and this is a weakness of Solaris. It requires George Clooney's charisma and his visual attractiveness to rope the viewer in and keep the viewer involved, and to this extent whether the movie works for you or not depends to some extent on whether Clooney's magnetism can draw you in. And because we are given so little information about the characters in the movie, and learn so little about them, there are some moments where the viewer may not understand what's going on or why the characters are behaving the way they are. People who don't like those kinds of ""hey, wait a minute, what's going on here?"" moments will probably not enjoy the film.But if you're the kind of person who likes a movie that makes you think ""what if..."" and draws you to think about what you've seen in terms of your own life and experiences, this is a movie you could watch over and over and enjoy in a quiet, contemplative way. I liked it a lot because it got me thinking about things that are bigger than the world I inhabit, and I'm sure I could watch it again and again and enjoy it every time I watch it. At the same time, I know there are a lot of people who will find it boring, puzzling, and not something that works as pure entertainment. For this reason, I recommend it with some reservations.",Solaris
170,unknown07,George Clooney is an idiot.,1,18 January 2007,"This movie...all I can say is WTF? It was a loaned DVD from a friend. After watching it, I killed the friend. Not really, but everything in Solaris is crap. Especially Clooney, who felt the need to show his disgusting ass, no wait, face, no, ass, oh well, they look the same. This guy was voted sexiest man alive? Who did the voting, his mother and his agent? While watching this trash I was thinking--this idiot has never made a good movie but keeps getting roles. As a matter of fact, if Clooney's bobbing and weaving head appear in a film, it WILL fail. This is a fact. How this jerk made it into the movies is a mystery. As for Solar-Ass, someone wrote it was like Blade Runner. HAHAHAHAHAHA!! Whoever wrote that is an idiot...just like Clooney!",Solaris
171,StevieGB,Solaris For Idiots,4,30 July 2003,"The original Solaris makes 2001 look like Sesame Street; unfortunately the remake makes Sesame Street look like the original Solaris.  This is a great shame.  I love the original.  I hate the remake.  It's an idiot's guide, everything has been boiled down and battered and chewed up so that a younger and less patient audience can easily digest it.  If you wanted to remake Solaris as an episode of the Twilight Zone this is what you would boil the story down to.  The original had a love story in it but it was not a love story.And the original was a piece of cinema.  It told its story in pictures.  In the remake, once Kelvin arrives at Solaris, no one shuts up.  There's a constant yammering explanation of what is going on.  Everything has to be explained.  It's the difference between 2001 and 2010.  Sometimes mystery is better.Forgetting the original, does it work as a stand alone movie?  Again, it's not visual enough, you could do the script as it stands on the radio and no one would be lost.  As for the acting?  Clooney is Clooney, nice looking and can move about without bumping into the furniture, but there's always something missing from the man on screen: he lacks emotional weight. Natasha McElhone?  Awful.  The flashback scenes where she and Clooney are falling in love are an embarrassment.  It's as though she's trying to break the world grinning record.  Then she stops grinning and you know things can't be good.  And as for Jeremy Davis?  I think the man's been watching Dennis Hopper in Apocalypse Now once too often.  A bad second-hand reminder of someone else's performance.Plus points?  The photography's nice.  And it could have been longer, which might have made it a different and better film; but, given the film it has turned out to be, thank god it's as short as it is.",Solaris

It's basically a pure (and generally tiresome) love story with sole focus on the main character and his wife (recreated by Solaris planet).The most interesting aspects of the book are either missing (ocean, two suns, Solaris science) or presented in an extremely shallow way (intelligence of Solaris, insightful thoughts of the main character).I expected a short version of the original Solaris story. I expected beautiful scenography (blue and red suns, shots of the oceans etc) and some deeper journey into the true meaning of god and the human race's struggle to understand the Solaris planet. Instead I've got a boring and shallow love drama in a dark space station.In other words, do yourself a favor and read the book.",Solaris
173,spinin,Don't hate it cause it's beautiful,9,10 December 2002,"Human nature makes us so constricted. We want everything nicely categorized and neatly packaged. Most of all, we need to have control and understanding over everything in life, otherwise we feel frustrated and are unable to function. I am at least talking about the majority here. I would like to think that I am different, but nobody's perfect. SOLARIS is a beautiful film that is already well on its way to becoming the most underrated movie of the year thanks to the usual unsubstantiated complaints that it is boring or makes no sense. To those not used to films that stray from typical Hollywood movie conventions and to those too lazy to think or to try to interpret the movie themselves, SOLARIS would be worse than death or public speaking. To those open minded enough to understand that film is also art and can be used to convey thought, SOLARIS may be a great experience.The plot is only the set-up. Psychiatrist Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) is sent to a space station to investigate the strange behavior of the crew, with whom contact has been lost. The crew's mission was to study a mysterious planet called Solaris. Upon his arrival, Chris finds that only two people, Snow and Gordon, are still alive, while the rest of the crew either committed suicide or died mysteriously. During his first night there, Chris is visited by his dead wife, Rheya. She is not a ghost, but seemingly a real person. Apparently, Solaris is able to read people's thoughts and recreate loved-ones from their memories. The `visitors' appear how they were remembered rather than how they really were.The plot does not develop much beyond that. The film becomes a meditation on the nature of the situation. I am not sure what to make of Snow's character, but it is clear that Gordon is terrified by everything that is happening even though she does not comprehend it. She is eager to destroy the planet and any visitors without even trying to understand the situation. Chris is much more open minded, but may be going mad. In the early scenes back on earth, he is portrayed as sad and lonely. With the reappearance of his dead wife on the space station, he eagerly seeks a second chance.I think that Soderbergh has done an amazing job here especially the way he blurs the lines between reality and Chris' thoughts, memories, and dreams. The film has his usual steadi-cam style with some beautiful and fascinating images. The cinematography and haunting music were simply captivating, especially in the scene where Chris first dreams of his wife. The film is deliberately paced, but it is not slow and boring. It allowed my eyes to wander from one side of the screen to the other and completely absorb the images.I have not read the original novel or seen Tarkovsky's version so I cannot make any of those comparisons. However, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is one of my favorite films and SOLARIS evoked many of the same themes and recreated some of the same stunning images (while watching, I thought about how great it would be to see 2001 on the big screen). You cannot really compare SOLARIS to 2001, but I'm sure that Soderbergh was never thinking about surpassing Kubrick's film. I do think that this is his best movie along with TRAFFIC. I think he went in a different direction and succeeded on almost every level. The same can be said of George Clooney who, like Brad Pitt and Johnny Depp, is fighting his Sexiest Man in the World image with a good performance in a risky movie (although you wouldn't think so from the excessive shots of his rear end).Without getting into a specific discussion of the film's themes, the general meanings conveyed by SOLARIS relate back to what I said in the first paragraph. The film is meant to question human existence and our nature in the universe. It questions our need to explain the unexplainable and our fear of what we do not understand. It portrays humans as creatures with limitations that have a ridiculous need to always be right. I don't know if Solaris is meant to represent god or the unknown, but it is something that humans are not able to comprehend with everything we know on earth. By the end of the movie Chris realizes that he can no longer live the way he has and opens his mind to new possibilities. That may be the only way at another chance with his wife.If you feel intimidated by a thought provoking film that will force you to be an active participant and will not cater to your expectations, rent SPIDER-MAN. If you are specifically looking for sci-fi movies with gadgets and explosions then wait for STAR TREK: NEMESIS or even go to DIE ANOTHER DAY (a pretty sci-fi Bond movie). I'm sure there are people who understood SOLARIS and still disliked it. That's fine. I simply disagree with quick and irrational judgments of this film based on misinterpretations. I do not think that SOLARIS is anything completely new or revolutionary, but it felt very fresh. My enjoyment level was just about as high as it could have been throughout. I did wish it had been longer (that's right!) since it went by so fast. Maybe then Soderbergh could have gone even further with his themes. However, the threatened masses already don't know what to make of it and dismiss it as unclear or self-indulgent, so maybe it's for the best this way. SOLARIS gets a 9 out of 10.",Solaris

Movies like this can't possibly have a concise answer that can wrap everything up neatly at the end.  If they did, then philosophers and metaphysicists would've figured out all of the aforementioned issues long ago, and movies like this wouldn't need to be made in the first place.The same people who really dislike this movie probably also think that '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Blade Runner' are the worst 2 science fiction movies of all time and that 'Independence Day' is the pinnacle of the genre...",Solaris
175,Aeris4ever,"Wow, this was a trip",2,27 November 2002,"I just came back from ""Solaris"" and I really don't know what to think of it. I knew nothing about it beforehand, but I was expecting it to be a run-of-the-mill sci-fi film.  Well, ""Solaris"" is definitely not a typical sci-fi, which is good, but mostly bad.  It's a love it or hate it movie.  I love films that mess with your mind, but this was too much for me.  The total absence of action was fine with me, but people looking for thrills and chills will have to do with multiple butt shots of Clooney's posterior. 
Of all the movies I've seen in a theater, I've never been so emotionless before.  Not once did I close my eyes in fear, laugh, or express any other emotions.  All 20-some people in the theater were like zombies, or maybe they were just asleep.  When I left the theater, I felt like I'd just come out of a coma.  Watching this movie is more like watching a painting come to life, I don't know how else to say it.  The visuals are gorgeous and the acting was quite good, but the story is a mess.  Even the most intelligent moviegoers will probably walk out feeling stupid for not knowing what was going on.  Unlike other movies of this nature, seeing it multiple times probably won't help you understand it.The story begins right away and draws you in, but you probably won't have a clue what's going on until a half hour in.  By the end, I still didn't know much of the plot, but I didn't walk away completely empty.  It was a surreal experience that is somewhat rewarding, yet it was a total head trip.  George Clooney plays a psychologist or scientist (not clarified) that has been summoned to check out the strange phenomena happening in Solaris, a world in space.  He is soon greeted by his deceased wife and finds out the two remaining crew members also have ""visitors"" that are dead.  I'm going to stop there because if I go on, I'll blow the whole plot.  The plot is pretty thin, so the action moves at a snail's pace to make this short story into a 90-minute film.  If you can make it through this movie, you can make it through any movie.  On an artistic scale, I'd give it a 8/10, but entertainment-wise, I'll give it a 2.",Solaris

It only can be slow for the sort of people who is used to go to the cinema to eat popcorn and drink cola while watching the blockbuster of the month. If you like cinema you'd like Solaris.The scene when George Clooney meets for first time McElhone is to stand up and applaud. And who cares what the ending means? who cares if we understand or not? The questions are there and in this case it is enough for me.I'd also like to mention the music, which is just great + Clooney and McElhone. After having seen the russian Solaris over a year ago I never thought I'd like the american version but what I didn't know at the beginning is that the director was Steven Soderbergh (one of the most interesting usa directors nowadays). It has been a great surprise to find out that this movie is so good.This is the best sci-fi movie of recent years and I am convinced that it will eventually become one of the best science fiction movies ever made.",Solaris
177,roland-sinn,Very poor remake of Russian intellectual masterpiece,5,28 July 2003,"Actually, I'm being a little harsh. Solaris is not a very bad film, but I was expecting a lot more. I really wanted to see an expansion of the ideas and concepts presented in the original Russian Solyaris. I also wanted more action, more special effects and I wanted to see the people from the space station fly down to the planet and explore the alien sea.
Basically speaking, I was disappointed that Solaris was a very perfunctory remake yet it managed to exclude all the intellectualisms which made Solyaris fascinating and compelling. I think a lot of film makers today need to work harder at creating stories and telling them effectively. I also believe there's too much reliance on the use of existing material as a basis for new films and this results in the creation of re-warmed, soulless products.Much of the acting left me cold. I thought Clooney was terribly wooden and spoke his lines at an excruciatingly slow pace while Jeremy Davies' quirky' character was extremely annoying. Natascha McElhone however was very good. Her portrayal of a fragile personality was genuinely haunting.The biggest problem with Solaris in my opinion is that although it does make an attempt to emulate and explore many of the intellectualisms presented in Solyaris, these intellectualisms don't translate into the Hollywood version. I believe the film makers should have realised that a Westernised version of Solyaris needed to be entirely different from the original in order to be successful. Of course a director like Kubric (God rest his soul), should have been able to pull off a new version of Solyaris effortlessly.As a general interest note, I was one of only two people in the cinema when I viewed Solaris. I felt like a VIP at a private screening  Although after 30 minutes, I wished I wasn't at the private screening. 5/10.",Solaris
178,debjyoti1981,Classy,8,14 December 2009,"Steven Soderbergh's Solaris can be measured as a complex Science Fiction, yet it brings along a very profound love story. Personally I consider this movie to be an insightful love story with the milieu of Science as the platform. This definitely requires attention to value the context.The story begins with the central character Chris (George Clooney), a psychiatrist distressed by the loss of his wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone). Shortly a call from his friend/scientist lands him on a space station to a far of planet called Solaris, to investigate some bizarre occurrences which led to death and disappearance of some crew members. The story begins when Chris starts seeing his deceased wife onto the research station and tries to correlate the situation along with delusion.I think appreciation should go to Soderbergh for choosing the cast so effectively, who had morphed into the characters through a seamless transition. The chemistry between the two key characters is what made the movie so enjoyable. I think Jeremy Davies also pulled up his part pretty much well. Soundtrack used had some kind of appeal which is very hard to put across in words. Presence of James Cameron as Producer also refined the overall quality of the movie, especially if I emphasis on the production set and the special effects deployed.This is a movie which will not appeal to the universal viewers but to those who have loved movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey as well as 2009's Moon.

179,Ell-4,So Very Interesting,7,5 December 2002,"Went to see Solaris with my husband and before we even went in to see the film, so many interesting things happened. As we were paying our entrance fee, the cashier at the Multiplex advised us not to see it. Said it was the most boring picture she had ever seen in her life and people were walking out.Next as we were giving our tickets to the ticket taker,he again repeated how many people had walked out of the film, angry and bored, wanting their money refunded. He told us that if after 25 minutes, we didn't want to see anymore of the film, we could leave and go in to see the new James Bond movie at no extra charge. We sat down to watch the film, I checked my watch and when I checked again an hour had passed. Obviously we were not bored. We were most interested in what was coming next and why. However, we did see a few people walk out.As for trying to analyze the film, why bother! I think that one of the problems is that everyone wants a beginning, middle and end plus a rational reason for everything. It's like looking at an abstract painting that seemingly has no meaning except in the eye of the beholder.The changing scenes and moods appealed to us.We chose to look no further than that.As for the ending,and I think this might be  a spoiler, I thought of the long time ago movie ""Splash' One of Tom Hanks early films along with Daryl Hannah. The majority of the viewers who saw it, would have preferred the mermaid to become an earthly woman. Instead, Tom Hanks preferred devoting his life to her, splashing together in the sea. They wanted to be together. Same thing with ""Solaris"" Did it really matter where they were? Probably the majority of the population that saw the film and stayed till the end would have liked to hear that the entire film was a figment of Kelvin's imagination and never happened at all. They just wanted to be together.There is no answer I can give. After all the universe is infinite.We can always ask the question, what is outside the universe????Back to ""Solaris"" Too bad so many people were ""bored"" and walked out angrily asking for a refund (which the manager gave, due to such anger) We discussed it with him and quote his feelings ""A great deal of the masses are asses""",Solaris
180,awjonesjr,Drying paint,2,23 February 2004,"The only real undeniable quality of the original Tarkovsky film of SOLARIS is that is it SO impenetrable and pensive and ""felt"" that you couldn't say much about it aside from whether you liked it or didn't -- it's not something to be understood, but appreciated for what it is or not.Why, then, did Steven Soderbergh -- an exceptional director -- decide that he could remake it, remove the long, contemplative, meaningless MASS that was Tarkovsky and by trimming it down by an hour make it better? It is not a situation where the original was too good to be remade; rather, it is that to the extent the original worked at all was a miracle, and lightning had no way to strike twice. Soderbergh has nothing to add, no meaning to impose or new kinds of style to perk it up. He's merely taken one boring, pointless movie and made a shorter boring, pointless movie from its dropping. There are no revelations that fill in the blanks, no explanations of character or plot, or even any good action or sex to supercharge it. This SOLARIS is stolen style without substance -- or, what substance there is, just as impossible to find. It is anti-cinema of the worst kind, with lifeless performances and heavy emotions, all floating as rootless as a tree in a cyclone. Keep your head down, you don't want to get beaned by it.",Solaris

Put together a bunch of meaningless, if poignant, scenes on a beautiful, mysterious backdrop and then hope the audience feels it went over there head and doesn't mind dropping seven bucks on a convoluted story that has no clear purpose or ending.Well, I'm there to tell you, slapping some goo together on film that befuddles an audience is easy, it's not ""artistic"" and it doesn't make you some ""mis-understood genius"", it makes you a bad director or producer or whoever it was that made me waste my time on this movie.
Not good, not at all.",Solaris
182,Justin Harris,"Makes you think, but here's the thing...",5,24 December 2002,"I was eagerly waiting for Solaris when I first heard it was announced. I really enjoy Steven Soderbergh's films and thought this would be a really great film... but it wasn't.Critics seemed to absolutely love this movie, but most the audience seemed to think exactly what I thought about it. It was BORING. It moved so damn slow that it made a meager one hour and thirty minutes feel like a three hour movie. Sure it did make you think about life and all what is waiting for one after we die, but you're bored stiff to get this message. So I cannot give this movie a high score like Soderbergh's other films since it didn't hold my interest as well as, let's say ""The Limey"".And on a personal level, I know we all deal with the death of loved ones differently. But I think Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) really, really needed to get over it. When people die, they die. There's no bringing them back.SCORE: 5 out of 10 (average)",Solaris
183,ericendres,Would have been better as a half-hour Twilight Zone,6,5 November 2003,"I think my one-line summary really, well, summarizes how I felt about this movie.  It was a well-enough produced, directed and acted film, but it was very slow (and not really in a Kubrickian kind of way that you expect and enjoy) and felt like it would have benefited from being compressed into a shorter format, like a Twilight Zone episode.Sad to read the trivia comments, where Soderbergh fought the MPAA to allow a PG-13 for showing Clooney's butt. Why not just get rid of the butt shot? Like that was at all necessary...Anyway, not a bad film, and an interesting concept, but not necessarily worth its length on film.",Solaris
184,blue__yoshi,Could have gone much deeper,4,9 April 2009,"NOTE: Spoilers for Solyaris too.For me this version stripped away a lot of what made Tarkovsky's Solyaris so interesting. Solaris turned into a more simple movie about a guy dealing with a regret. Perhaps it went a little larger, and was about dealing with painful memories. (I couldn't escape the sense that it was 9/11 influenced - from the scene early on with people talking in a room about their reactions to painful memories that was sounding a lot like 9/11). But overall it missed exploring the bigger questions that Solyaris raises. There's still more substance here than your average Hollywood film but I much preferred the way Tarkovsky went deeper into every idea.Some interesting ideas from Solyaris that were only lightly explored in Solaris - Exploring the concept of creation - Solyaris created the living memories from the minds of the scientists so in a way Kelvin was the god of his dead wife. The way in which Hari was more aware than Rheya and fought more for her humanity made this connection more interesting. She did not just want to kill herself she and truly struggled with who she was and why she existed. (as humans could do as well if they are posed the right questions). She also eventually had to come to terms with the discovery that while they had were once been in love, their relationship had ended before her death (humanity abandoned by 'god'?). This changed in Soderbergh's Solaris and made it more focused on Kelvin's character and I felt weakened it overall because of it.Solaris also missed the scientist's plan to beam their waking thoughts down to the surface so it could understand them better. There was no strong suggestion of threat as found in Solaris (another post 9/11 influence?). There was just curiosity from the planet and the possibility that human-like intelligence was not as unique as we often like to think.I like the idea of having your memory brought to life, having to face it and interact with it, while also having it exposed in front of people you don't know, but Soderbergh's version made it all about Kelvin and missed some of the greater questions about humanity that Tarkovsky was able to explore.Ignore the long car sequence (apparently kept in the film so he could justify his crew's trip to Japan), I recommend watching Solyaris if you can. It may be slower paced, but it eventually goes much deeper.",Solaris
185,daisuke69,A true thriller,8,22 March 2005,"Although I picked this movie out of the sci-fi section of Hollywood Video, the only thing that relates it to the genre is the setting, this movie is a true thriller, I had ignored it before as being a probable sci-fi shoot em up or lame 2001 attempt, but I was very mistaken. And I must say this is a well executed and even creepy movie. It's not meant to scare you, it's not meant to wow you, it just makes you forget about everything else around you and concentrate on the central question, I would say it succeeds quite well at what it's meant to do.I loved the acting of everyone involved, and everything else is believable about the film, no fancy shots, no impossible technologies, it focuses only on the plot, and looking into anything else to find flaws involves departing the whole purpose of the film. There is a definite 2001 feel to this one, the music is somewhat evocative and just the general weirdness of the film is there too. The end gets sort of predictable once you're nearly done, but if you don't pay attention you might not understand it right away (I did but from what I read, many ppl didn't) There are many things that make this something completely new, completely out of the ordinary, it makes you ponder existence and human emotions, it captivates you. Definitely worth watching when you don't know what you're in the mood for.This review is purposefully vague because this is something you need to watch to really understand and experience, the less you know about it, the better",Solaris
186,hawksburn,Somewhat disappointed really,10,17 March 2003,"Let me first say, I had no idea of the running time of this movie before I went in to see it. In fact I assumed that it would actually be quite long, given that I'd seen some of the original and knew that it had a significant running time. The assumption I had was that being an American remake it couldn't possibly be anywhere near as long, but I'd still planned to be sitting in the cinema for 2 hours or more, maybe 2.5.Imagine my disappointment when it ended just 90 minutes (approx) later. I didn't want it to end, I wanted more. They didn't tell the story properly. I needed more background, more depth. For a movie that (visually) looks like it has all the pace of a snail in need of a nap, it needed more time! It moved too fast. I needed to spend more time with Clooneys reaction to his wife continuously coming back to life. I wanted to get a better sense of awe in the magnificent power of the planet below and what was happening to the crew. Too many unanswered questions. Not enough sensations.That said I was really engrossed in this film. Just the ending came too soon, which made it disappointing. I'm sure that in 5 years time we'll get the Directors Cut with the missing 30-60 minutes restored. The costume and set design was rather neat, although perhaps the clothes were a little too Vogue-ish. The Nehru neck designs of the suits flashed back to '2001'. I don't know why futurists seem to think collars will be done away with. Not that that's a big complaint. Still the overall look fits in with how I think society in 50 to 100 years will look. Which is, much like today really. Rain, pollution, supermarkets, buses, trains, grime, cooked meals, intimate dinners, libraries, book stores etc etc. No great differences, except for maybe a few more visual displays. It's probably the most realistic visualisation ever, even more so than Bladerunner. Basically, in the future, life will be ordinary.",Solaris
187,Svperstar,More then any recent movie this challenges the nature of human perception the most (NO or very minor spoilers).,10,29 November 2002,"I read the other comments here at the IMDB and several on other WebPages and people either seem to think this movie is horrible or it is fantastic, any real movie fan MUST watch movies like that :)I think the biggest problem is most people like movies to make ONE BIG STATEMENT, as clear and concise as if it were typed in BIG BOLD LETTERS.This movie makes a lot of statements, actually no it asks a lot of questions, and makes ONE statement.I will have to post a more detailed review at a later date and include spoilers then but I just wanted to say quickly that this one of the ""smartest"" movies I have ever watched. Most people consider any plot twist movie ""smart"" but there is FAR more going on in this movie then a simple plot twist ending movie.1) This IS being misadvertised as a ""chic flick"".If you want to see something like Sleepless in Seattle or What Dreams May Come you were misled by the ads, sorry.2) People say, ""nothing happens"" in this movie.That is a total load of crap.If you think ""huge explosions and gunfights = something happening"" then you are wasting your time reading my review.This is the most visual movie I can think of off the top of my head that has come out recently, I can't think of any other that comes close. THIS MOVIE IS 100% WHAT YOU SEE! Even though there is a lot of talking I would say what you ACTUALLY SEE is equally as important as the little that is said.You CANNOT go to the bathroom, talk to others, or go for more popcorn while watching this movie. Just deal and try not to blink too much.I usually check my watch in movies; I didn't do that even once through this.3)Some have said ""This movie is FAKE cause it TRYS to be deep, you are being fooled by big name actors""Yeah Yeah like its impossible for a studio flick to have anything meaningful to say. Sure the leading lady is good eye candy, I fail to see how that makes this movie bad or ""fake"". I don't buy that a movie has to be indie to be art.4)""Only pretentious movie viewers would like this to prove how smart they are""(i.e. Emperors New Clothes)WRONG Sorry, this is NOT ""a bunch of pretty shots and no plot thrown together"", this movie has a great plot and makes a great point....5) You might ask ""OK FINE, THEN WHAT THE HELL IS THE POINT OF THIS MOVIE THEN!!!""(You may consider this a spoiler)
It makes several points;in fact rather early on we pretty much get the point of this movie but I won't quote it as not to spoil it. You can extend this out forever but what I will try and keep it simple. As I said it raises a lot of questions:Ambiguity. We are the sum of our memories; all memories are distorted by our individual perception. None of us knows anything other then what our memory and perception tells us we know. That includes YOU in the audience.Given that we are nothing but the sum of our memories is not MEMORY & PERCEPTION equal to and/or more important then the ""real world""?Are you a ""real"" person based on your human perception and memories? What if you have another persons memories?Does the fact that a ""dream"" world created specifically for our individual perception & memories is artificial matter when to the individual you ARE your perception and memories?The BIG BOLD statement I got from this movie: We are not ready for First Contact when we don't even understand our own minds & what an individual is.Food for thought. Pay attention to this movie.",Solaris
188,Vlad_the_Reviewer,Simplistic,1,17 March 2007,"A Science Fiction - remake of the original Solyaris.A psychologist (George Cloony) is sent into space to analyze the odd behavior of a space crew. Arriving at the scene we learn that the crew can see and feel the products of their imagination. Soon enough Cloony will experience the same. The product of his imagination will be his late wife. An entity as big as a planet on the background in space has everything to do with it. The entity expands at an exponential rate so the crew tries to escape with another ship. Eventually Cloony ends up in the entity and ends up in the arms of his late wife.The director had modern technology (year 2002) at his disposal. Yet the ship is simple, nihilistic, without fantasy whatsoever. It's made of a bit of metal, metallic color, a few buttons with some integrated screens here and there. The 'entity' is a huge colored sphere with some simple lighting effects. At fundamental level there's nothing more to see Science Fiction wise.There's also a handgun on board: a device that for unknown reasons has to work at a frequency of 90 Gigaherz to permanently eliminate the projected persons they see. The weapon looks like an ill-formed microscope with tin cans here and there. High Tech lovers definitely should stay away from this move.The actors aren't beginners and George Cloony is a top actor in the eyes of many. None of them performed beyond the average though. The crew wasn't tested in any way. Acting-wise, there's nothing here to enjoy as well.Any decent critic would try to write something good and bad about the movie but I can't find anything good to write about. Even the psychological part of the movie, if you will, consists of insights even a child could think of.I rated this movie only 1 star. Because of its simplistic romantic and psychedelic approach, the way Hollywood produces all too often. Also, there was no use for this event to happen in space. Could have been in a cave near a magical drawing or something. There was no need to make this a Science Fiction movie and in fact, it didn't even try to be SF-esque. So what's the point.",Solaris
189,bsamdahl,A lack of emotion in this film,3,6 August 2003,"I have not seen 2001: A Space Odyssey yet, which is what Solaris is sometimes compared to. I did not like the mixing of psychology, science fiction, and surrealism all in one short film. This is because it becomes to easy to read all kinds of possibilities into the film.

Approaching this film with expectations based on genre, marketing, or on an encyclopedic film junky vocabulary will result in nothing but dissapointment. Then the cold chill runs up your spine. It's when realize that this is you. That this is what you feel, this is how you exist. Solaris reveals that huge gap that exists between an individual and everyone else.

However, this movie was so deadly boring I kept hitting fast forward on my DVD player,hitting play again, and seeing if anything interesting had occurred in the 20 minutes I skipped.

Why tell us, for example, the fate of the real wife so early on, only to then flashback at the end of act two to George Clooney finding her in bed--something we have already been told happened--when that could have been a fantastic reveal?The film keeps saying things, all kinds of things, like ""we can't trust our memories,"" blah blah blah...but these statements never find any real means of expression.  They are never dramatically illustrated in the events aboard the station, or in the juxtaposition of those events with the flashbacks. At the end of the day, the film is just a bunch of abstractions that don't add up to anything coherent or even deep.You can say, ""Hey, at least the film tried to be soemthing!""  Yeah, that's true.  But even an unsuccessful ""ambitious"" movie is still a bad one. Rent the original Russian film, please, and skip this one....",Solaris
195,fatmaninatrenchcoat,"great movie, most people will hate it",8,2 December 2002,"I personally loved this movie. It has flaws, mostly the fact that the slow pacing can be very wearing(as much as i liked it, i dont think i want to see soderbergs 150 minute master cut) Solaris is very much a thinking mans sci-fi film. there is no action, almost no special effects, just great acting and even better directing. But because of the offbeat tone and slow pace, i doubt this film will ever be more than a cult classic. George Clooney should definitaly get an oscar nomination for the best work hes ever done, by far. And soderberg should get a nod for best director, but i dont think best picture will even be considered, considering the strangness of the film. 8/10",Solaris
196,guy_lazarus,Incredibly banal,2,29 November 2002,"I did not walk into the movie theater with very high hopes for this film as Andrei Tarkovsky's version of Stanislaw Lem's 1961 novel ""Solyaris"" is one of my all-time favorite films. However, I was not prepared for how incredibly banal Soderbergh's version turned out to be. This film is, quite frankly, a BOMB.There is little to say other than the fact that despite Soderbergh's first-rate craftsmanship, as a director, he lacks power; he is not of the first-rank of cinema artists, not matter how much he strives to be. He is not even in Spielberg's class of being an uber-technician/craftsman as at least Speilberg, even at his most banal, can deliver the goods. The new ""Solaris"" IS BORING.The film is a terrible misfire. Focusing on the relationship of Kelvin and his ""wife"" to all else saps the film of the power of Tarkovsky's classic, which I always characterized as a more intellectual ""2001."" This film lacks the philosophical power of the Tarkovsky film. In sum, Soderberg's version of ""Solaris"" is relentlessly SHALLOW.Clooney is not appropriately cast, and his lack of acting chops robs the audience of identification as there is no character development that a fine actor like Kevin Spacey could give this role. Clooney's performance never really develops, his character never really changes; Kelvin, as played by Clooney, is a depressed wimp at the beginning and throughout the film. It's strange to see an actor as macho as Clooney playing a character on the border of hysteria. It might have made sense if we watched the character deteriorate, but as it was played, the character is poorly realized.As for the other actors, Natasha McElhone is better than she was in FearDot.Com, and this is NOT like saying Pauley Shore was better in SON-IN-LAW than he was in BIO-DOME; she's not only beautiful, but gives a decent performance; however, what she lacks is star power, the charisma that a star like Julia Roberts can bring to a picture, thus making Kelvin's yearning and his ultimate decision more real. McElhone just isn't up to the demands of the role as realized in this film (as opposed to Tarkovsky's ""Solyaris,"" where the character is not quite as prominent). She lacks weight. While I don't think it's her fault as much as the director's, many times she struck me as having been teleported in from a shampoo commercial. She is just there to look pretty in some interminable sequences that scream ""STUDENT FILM."" I guess this is Soderbergh's way of reclaiming his ""art house"" roots, but frankly, it's ridiculous, as is some of the dialogue, which is just plain bad, not even bad enough to border on camp (and thus give the audience some pleasure).Jeremy Davies, who was so excellent in PRIVATE RYAN, quickly is solidifying his reputation as the worst actor on celluloid. Here, he channels the spirit of Travis Bickle, but Mr. Davies, you are no Robert DeNiro. It's becoming excruciating watching Davies in any movie; each movie, he is actually getting worse.On an upbeat note, Viola Davis was good.I voted this film a ""2"" (as the production design is excellent, as is the soundtrack), but is really is a BOMB.Beware a Michaelangelo-inspired visual motif towards the end when Soderbergh really begins channeling the spirit of Stanley Kubrick.Stephen, I knew Kubrick and you're not Kubrick, nor will you ever be.The Web site for ""Solaris"" presents the film as being from two Academy Award winners, James Cameron and Soderbergh. Just remember: Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hawks and Martin Scorecese never won a Best Director Oscar; John G. Avildsen did. 'Nuff said.",Solaris

On the other hand, it is a good opportunity to look at George Clooney's butt.Strange things are happening at the space station and psychologist Chris Kelvin (the gorgeous George Clooney) is called in to help.  Strange things continue to happen and nothing is clear-cut or easy to understand.  It's interesting to watch, though, and speculate as to what is really happening and draw your own conclusion as to what it all means.This version is far superior to the original Russian film that went on and on with nothing happening.  I have no idea how that movie ended because I fell asleep.  There were sections of the current Solaris that seemed somewhat draggy and repetitive, but overall it was worth seeing.

It turned out to be an overlong, poorly thought out flashback into the romantic life of the protagonist.The direction is quite good, it is just that we see the wrong scenes all the time. The first couple of scenes (until Mr. Handsome Psychiatrist gets to Solaris) are well made - and promising. Good use of sounds and photography lead you to believe that you are about to watch a gripping space thriller/psychological drama. However, the arrival of the good doctor to the station is.. lacking. He sees blood - but there is no sense of mystery or suspense when we see the blood. He wanders around the station alone - he talks to a couple of characters . It is not cohesive. At all. Just like. I don't know. It is not that the story does not make sense - the problem is the ill choice of scenes. The director chose to concentrate on Chris - a lot of scenes are wasted exploring his past with his wife. We don't need to know his past - it's irrelevant. And yet, it takes up more than half of the movie. That, and seeing him sleeping in his bed. It's boring.",Solaris

When I read the premise of the film (a Sentient 'being' utterly unlike us) I was intrigued and determined to see it. I'm so glad I did. True, it's a love story, perhaps more focused on this than the book (I'm told), but nevertheless, the 'higher life form' premise, and the fear it would naturally induce is sufficiently touched upon in my opinion.

203,zingbot,"Minimilist, Hypnotic Sci-Fi",8,9 July 2007,"Solaris is based on the Stanislaw Lem novel. Owning both the 1972 Tarkovsky movie and the Soderbergh version of Solaris, comparisons between the two films are inevitable. However, I think it is important to treat the two movies as individual films.The plot is based around a space station orbiting around the planet Solaris, where the astronauts and a security team have either gone missing or are not very coherent. One of the astronauts aboard the space station contacts psychiatrist Chris Kelvin (Clooney) who flies off to investigate. He soon discovers some amazing developments that offer him a second chance, and questions how far anyone will go to grab that chance.I feel that Soderbergh really couldn't win however he made this film. This may be deserved to a degree as remakes are notoriously easy to criticise, and very rarely a good idea. This is one remake that may have some justification, the original film is nearly three hours long, and the shorter version may encourage some viewers to seek out the Tarkovsky version as a result of watching, which has to be a good thing. This version could be viewed as a companion piece or an introduction of sorts to the Tarkovsky version, although it is a fine film in it's own right.Solaris is criticised at the same time for being boring, too short, too complicated, and too simplified. It is also derided for having two very good looking leading actors. At 90 minutes it never has time to become boring, and while the pace is never fast, the viewer must have a very short attention span to get even close to boredom. The character development is achieved by flashback, which in the important dream sequences makes perfect sense, and releases information slowly but very interestingly. Solaris needs to be watched closely to piece together all the threads of the plot, but is not overly complicated. Some information is kept to a minimum, the viewer has to make some assumptions and use some imagination, which may be a bridge to far for some. Clooney and Natascha McElhone make excellent leads in my opinion, and anyone who says that Clooney can't act should watch more of his films.The special effects are beautiful, but not overused. The sets and locations are very sparse and futuristic while still being recognisable and possible. The music by Cliff Martinez is excellent and captures the mood brilliantly.Overall Solaris is a very moody, almost hypnotic film that requires some effort. The acting and plot development grab you and means that you keep watching to see how things develop if someone is given a second chance, and the implications that it brings.",Solaris

I think a major problem with cerebral cinema is that it's easy to slip over the line and confuse plodding with profound.  It's like you're trained to fawn over a ten second shot of Clooney staring into space like a hurt puppy dog, because obviously there's something amazingly profound you're supposed to be pondering at that moment.  His wife's dead, he misses her, and his slipping memories of her are skewed and inaccurate, I get it, I don't need to watch slowly-edited shaky cam flashbacks ad nauseam to realize that. This guy is a psychologist, and a good one at that?  His occupation loses all meaning as soon as he sets foot in the space station.  He might as well have been a construction worker.

205,twm-2,"A Haunting, Contemplative Film",9,20 April 2021,"This is very nearly a great film, marred only by an unnecessary coda that ties things up too neatly at the end. This is science fiction at its best, placing its protagonists in a future world as a way of examining life and culture as it's lived today. The main question presented here is simple but profound: Do we, can we, really know another human being? Do we see others, even those closest to us, as they really are, or merely as extensions of ourselves? And does the answer to that question ultimately even matter? No doubt ""Solaris"" will be perceived as too cerebral by many-a disappointment without exchanges of blaster fire and not a single alien monster exploding out of someone's chest. To be clear, I loved both ""Aliens"" and ""Star Wars,"" but there is room under the SciFi umbrella for a more thoughtful approach to the genre. This is a beautiful, moody, contemplative piece, punctuated by moments of awe and anguish. There is a moment near the end (in fact it should have been the end IMO) where George Clooney's character has embraced an unknowable fate, chasing a dream of lost love, and reaches out-like Adam to God in Michelangelo's famous painting-toward another being, toward hope, that is filled with such inexpressible longing and regret, it has left me shaken every time I've seen it (if I seem coy about the details, I don't want to give anything away).

I love science fiction films, were they use the space subject to show how can it affect the human condition (because of the isolation, etc), that is why Alien (1979) and Moon are among my favorite SciFi films, hell, I even liked 2001(even though it's pretty weird), but I don't know why I wasn't totally convinced by Solaris.I know you are not supposed to get all the answers in movies like Solaris, however I felt there were things that need to be explained a little bit more to allow you follow the plot (like what was the deal with Gibarian, etc).There were things though that I felt were superb, like how do we deal with the subject of letting go someone or something very important in our lives. Natascha McElchone (Rheya) acting was great too, the creepy staring at the camera at times, etc.Score (6)",Solaris
207,almagz,Was all that footage necessary?,4,11 March 2007,"Not having read the book, I cannot direct my comments in terms relative to original excellence etc. I saw a movie, pure and simple and it stands on its own for me.It is a pretentious philosophical sci-fi psychodrama suffering from endless views of a lady's profile (with no apparent purpose) and of the main hero sweating in his wife-beater shirt or showing his buttocks, that was frankly far from scary and just plain boring. It also suffers from what I call the 2001 malaise, that is an ending that is just as much subject to individual interpretation as it is a loose end that appears to need tying. An intellectual challenge? Only if one decides to make it so, and I was hardly inspired to do so.The (real) characters never appear to be in any actual physical danger. The only thing threatened is their ability to distinguish real from unreal etc. or figuring out a reason for the whole mess. This movie could have been aptly titled ""Confused."" Considering how much of its running time is cluttered with filler love-making scenes and somewhat obscure fade backs, it could have been better done as a much shorter Twilight Zone episode where the uncertainty of an ending has always been at its best. Too much film wasted on facial closeups and not enough on a better evolution of the story line. The things that will stick with me longest about this movie is probably the hump on Natasha's nose.",Solaris
208,DarrenHorne,Solaris Review,10,7 March 2005,"Solaris began life in 1961 as a Polish novel by Stanislaw Lem, then made into a film by Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky in 1972. In this contemporary remake Steven Soderbergh takes the reigns as director, and comes up with a thoughtful and adult film that puts the intelligence back into sci-fi. This is clearly a personal work of passion, and that commitment shines through in every single shot.Dr Chris Kelvin (Clooney) is an emotionally scarred psychologist that is sent to the space station Prometheus that orbits the enigmatic planet Solaris. (In Greek mythology Prometheus is the Titan that created Man and gave them fire, without asking the permission of Zeus. He was punished for 30 thousand years by being chained to a rock and every day an eagle came and ate out his liver, which would then grow back during the night)On arrival he finds his friend has apparently committed suicide and the remaining two crew members are acting very strangely indeed. Kelvin later has a vivid dream about his dead wife Rheya, (McElhoe) who he finds alive and well in bed next to him when he wakes the following morning. The film uses this scenario to explore a plethora of ideas and philosophical issues such as the meaning of life, religion, God, love, as well as what it is that defines a human. Thankfully there is plenty of time for the audience to ponder these issues due to the slow pace and long scenes with no dialogue at all.The restrictive narrative means Clooney fills practically every scene, which works superbly well as this is an emotionally complex film about one mans struggle to come to terms with his wife's death, his memory of that event, and then her unsettling return from the grave. Clooneys performance is fantastic, especially as the wounded widower that is stripped of the twinkly eyed charm (and sometimes his clothes) that we see in the dreamy flashback sequences. This allows him to deliver a raw and vulnerable performance of a man totally heart broken from past experiences.McElhoe is equally as outstanding (and remarkably beautiful) as his mentally unstable wife who has her own difficulties in coming to terms with her existence and place in the universe. The special effects used are of a high standard and used wisely. The space station is a solid and functional stage for the story to be performed on, where as the planet Solaris is a visual feast of exquisite beauty, with mesmerising electric pinks and blues that will literally bring a tear to your eye. It will not appeal to every one. I watched at least two couples leave the already barren cinema, and my girlfriend fell asleep in my lap However, it is a great film for those of us who want more than passive popcorn entertainment, and really should be seen on the big screen. This is an extremely well made, surreal, and philosophical, treat that will pose a lot of questions and hopefully touch your soul. As one of the characters says ""There are no answers, only choices"". Choose to see this film.",Solaris
209,Mark-1384,Raises questions...,7,14 May 2008,"Quite an interesting film, exploring the nature of existence, I think.A slow start tempted me to turn off(!), but once Clooney arrives at the space station we are drawn into the mystery of Solaris. Dreaming prompts the re-appearance of crew members' loved ones - Clooney's dead wife re-appears in the form of the rather gorgeous Natascha McElhone - and we have a meditation on the nature of these recreated 'people', and how one should relate to them. Western religions preach the everlasting nature of the soul, which would mean that we will one day be in Clooney's character's position; disturbing and absurd, I think, but interesting to consider how this could work (I don't think it could!). It's true that similar themes have been explored many times in sci-fi, but they are universal concerns so bear repeating.",Solaris
210,Stainless_Steel_Rat,Fantastic and beautiful,10,6 February 2003,"The problem Soderbergh faced with Solaris is that it is ultimately going to be compared by a lot of people to Tarkovsky's 1972 version. I have seen the latter and although it has some excellent moments it is a very self indulgent movie for the Director I suspect. It is a fantastic piece of cinema in some aspects, but rambling and tortuously slow at some points. Therefore in my opinion a remake was certainly a good idea to make the story more accessible to people that would not watch, or have not seen this movie.In respect of Solaris 2002, I found this to be an excellent movie. Clooney puts in a mainly good and emotive performance, which is fundamental to the story line. People have decried Jeremy Davies performance, but I think he was playing a bizarre character hence acts well... bizarrely! Viola Davis is also very good in the slightly smaller part of Helen Gordon. In my opinion Natascha McElhone steals the film though as the haunting yet enchanting Rheya.So what is the movie about? I'll try and cover this without giving too much away about the plot. Well the story covers many things, and although it is put forward as a science fiction movie the science takes a back seat in the main. For me it was principally a romance, and a story of unrequited love. Given the choice would we step back into the past and try and live things again. It is also to a lesser extent philosophising about what makes us human, and if we aren't human does it matter? (in a similar way to Blade Runner) So two fairly deep topics. I would stress that this movie is not for everyone, but if you like carefully played romance, and philosophy with a twist, you may like this movie.Also of note is the soundtrack written by Cliff Martinez which provides a very good extra dimension to the film, and accompanies the interplay with Chris and Rheya beautifully.For me, 5 out of 5. A classic.",Solaris
211,joelsecurities,Uncut Blade Runner & Nostalgia,8,28 November 2002,"Tarkovsky's Solaris, like Soderberg's is concentrated in the human mind. Andrey Tarkovsky's Solaris is spaceless, while Steven Soderberg's an intense gravitational field, with a pull to the material world. High forms of communication are possible by Dr. Kelvin, a doctor needed in Solaris. The atmosphere of Solaris is an exquisite relaxed power in pastel colors, with calm sexual energy. The play of light and shadows in the space stations are as flawless as the falling space craft, in perpetual drop with out a nudge in degree or motion. A digital score that plays with the senses, giving the atmosphere curiosity and hope. Dr. Kelvin arrives to the ship, disciplined and concerned, following a trail to a member of the board, who in turn comments ""how about that"" when the mentions of odd circumstance are hinted at. A comic effect in deception is raised to concern, when the serious anger of Dr. Gordon brings forth experience with the state of solaris. The crew becomes spaced-out with ascertain beguile by an unknown power, while the crew is trying to figure out what is happening. In solaris, while they sleep, guests of the past glide in their reality. Dr. Kelvin, is visited by his loved one, who takes the blame for her departure. Memories of intimacy & poetry, as they share verses. Bitter fights & play, as she puts a dress on him. Rhea is a feline of a woman, she gets so close, you can touch her and you allow yourself, smell her. It is interesting to note, Solaris is a piece of work. Complex with the minimum of dialog to explain phenomena. the use of few characters in the interplay of an enclosed structure, in perfect pauses with facial expressions, replacing dialogue.

213,mligorio,We Are God,7,16 January 2012,"Solaris is an extraterrestrial intelligence that is as remote as imaginable from humanity; yet, it is the very essence of human nature, which, paradoxically, is an alien. Or, rather, our inability to understand our own nature alienates us from ourselves and others. Solaris is the mysterious workings of the human psyche. All the desolation and chaos therein stem from our efforts to either destroy or abandon what we can neither understand nor control.Chris Kelvin is able to communicate with it by probing his own mind. Essentially, his private thoughts, memories and dreams are reproduced in a physical form that he can actually speak to and reason with. Unfortunately, this physical manifestation of his imagination, Freya, is all too human in that it has no knowledge of what created it. To go beyond this limitation and truly understand our own origins, it is necessary to become one with Solaris. But, possessed by an almost paranoid fear of the unknown, Chris is reluctant to surrender himself unconditionally. That is, until he finally realizes that in order to grow as an individual, he needs to share his experiences with others. In effect, Chris needs love.For all our great knowledge, the origin of life has remained a mystery. And, if we do not even know what life is to begin with, how can we ever expect to find it elsewhere in the cosmos? To fulfill our own destiny, we must journey not through space, but rather through the timeless void that is our own subconscious. Life, after all, is a physical manifestation of thought, and with the power of our imagination we will forever preserver, and ever be capable of raising ourselves to ever still higher levels of conscious.",Solaris
214,cicerobuck,Never thought I'd like this movie that much! Mind trip!,10,22 June 2003,"Alright.. I hear people found this movie boring and compare it to Tarkovsky's version? Well... Have you actually watched the 1973 (1972?) version? I have. I love most Tarkovsky movies and this was the only one I hated. I love science fiction and was completely amazed by Soderbergh's. Sure the ""message"" (guilt, technology vs ""human heart"") appealed to me, but much more than that, the flow of the movie simply took me by surprise.. You find it slow and useless? Well, just open the eyes and the ears : Cliff Martinez (an old Beefheart drummer and soderbergh's usual music composer) finally provides what I expected from him. After using the wonderful ethereal Michael Brook guitar delay sound in Traffic, he uses this time the Bashet 'structures sonores', amazing french percussive instruments that give a balinese/gamelan feeling to the music (and the movie). This is a most perfect collaboration between visuals and sounds, that justifies completely the slow pacing of the movie.The acting is eerie and on spot...

I should let you know, I am a die-hard Sci-Fi fan, but I was not in the least bit interested to see ""Solaris"".About five minutes into the movie, I thought that it was ""okay"". Ten minutes, it was getting bad. Fifteen I was lost, and at twenty, I about left the theater. I wish I would've so I could've snuck into ""Die Another Day"" but I thought ""Maybe it'll get better"". I was WRONG! I have pretty good taste when it comes to movies, so I was not used to seeing such plum-bad movies. I figured that it would get better, but I should've known once a movie goes bad, it stays bad! I was totally lost. There were so many flashbacks, and a lot of the shots were taken so you could only see half of the stuff that was going on.Overall: Never see this movie! I never did get to see ""Die Another Day"" and I wish I had now, and so does my mom. This was by far, the worst film ever made. I have one question too: ""What was George Clooney thinking?""

Soderbergh is aware of the right mood to strike, from the music and visuals of the planet, down to the restrained editing and spare use of visual FX.  This isn't a movie for idiots or those looking for the next ""Terminator"". Some movies aspire towards something more, and this movie is one of them. Thank God for Soderbergh.  He writes, directs, edits, and does the cinematography.  You don't need an army to make a great film, just a sober, mindful, skillful artist.  Also, I'm glad Clooney has decided to take on harder projects beyond films such as ""Dusk to Dawn"".

I believe the film is very different from the typical u.s. Clooney movie, but then again the director is no typical director. The music score is as mesmerising as the action, in fact there is no action, just feelings. Tarkovsky dealt more with knowledge and science and the moral of men of science trying to discover and exploit and where is the truth and where does man fits in. It had to do a lot with love and memory too. This is what this film is about: the setting is not important, it is just a mise-en-scene, it is just a stage, where memories are observed and relived, where love expands through time. we get used so quickly to science-fiction meaning special effects, and maybe we should go back and watch the original solaris and 2001 space odyssey etc...

222,nikolaiv85,More deep meanings,7,15 November 2016,"Solaris is ,from my point of view, sci-fi biblical story. I found this like representation of Armageddon by Stanisław Lem. Solaris at the end of movie becoming bigger and bigger, like Sun will be in several thousand years, and I feel like he wrote this to help his mind and soul to accept that fact easier, more like glimmer of hope, about afterlife. Solaris from my point of view, represents both heaven and Sun.I don't agree with him, but I find this very creative, and that is only reason why I gave 7 for this movie. Here comes bad parts.Other things-I really hate blow-mind movies, where main characters are making worlds to run from reality. Also, ending of movie is definite one, there is no room for further explanations like other users are saying. Main character was influenced by his own emotions,he imagined what would be his life back on Earth.He chose death,instead of that kind of life.only explanation. And that is,for me , waste. All actions of his wife ,were ultimately selfish. Abortion, suicide. He left her before her suicide,because, she chose without him. Her issues are not explanation for her selfishness. and she killed herself because she didn't want to live without him,and to make him pay, that is both stupid and I repeat, ultimately selfish.OK, this is story about weak man,who loves sickly selfish manipulative woman, and he secretly wants second chance, and I don't buy this as true love, and as story about second chance...

Is the sense of individuated existence, that sense of being an ""I"" over and against and within a universe of things and processes that are not ""I"" real or is it an illusion? In both versions of the film Solaris this subject is explored.Solaris is not a discussion upon the classic What Is Reality inquiry, but instead does a wonderful job of examining the question of what does it mean to be ourselves, and what is it about ourselves that is unique or even real? The planet Solaris becomes an artistic representation of the true Unknown, and the unknown is that state in which we all exist in, but in which we create forms of meaning to encapsulate the mystery of this moment within the illusion of the Known.Solaris presents through its actions and its very existence a format for the characters, and the viewers, to examine what it means to live safely within the illusion of the Known, but where the reality is actually an existence in which the Known is not a possibility.Do not approach this film with the intention of understanding some final conclusion, for like life itself, it is the writers intention that we question our assumptions about this movie, and possibly about our own lives as well.",Solaris
224,EddieK,"An eloquent, profound and philosophical science fiction film",9,24 May 2006,"Most science fiction movies fall into two rough categories: ""Star Wars""-style action films, and more cerebral movies in the vein of ""2001: a space odyssey."" (Of course, I simplify the classification; a movie like ""Minority Report"" can bridge the gap between the two sub-genres). ""Solaris"" belongs firmly in the ""2001"" school of sci-fi, which may explain why I liked it - and why it failed at the box office.Cerebral science fiction movies demand patience and active involvement and almost always disappoint the masses. (Recent examples include ""Gattaca"" and ""AI: Artificial Intelligence,"" films I admired that achieved something less than blockbuster status). Such is the case with Steven Soderbergh's ""Solaris,"" which extends a concept that might have driven the plot of a Star Trek episode to feature-film length. That ""Solaris"" feels longer than its 99-minute running time is not necessarily a bad thing. It's a philosophical movie that eschews action, effects and violence, and is content to linger on moments and details as it considers its trenchant themes.I can't say too much without giving anything away. The setup is that Dr. Kelvin (played by Soderbergh favorite George Clooney) is summoned to a space station where some sort of disaster has occurred. (Imagine how ""2001"" might have played out if Heywood Floyd's Clavius Base cover story had been true, and you'll get the idea). Shortly after arriving on the Solaris base, Clooney meets the survivors, and soon understands why they don't want to leave.Soderbergh directs efficiently, and the performances by Clooney, Natascha McElhone, Viola Davis, Jeremy Davies, and Ulrich Tukur all resonate. Soderbergh's use of visual effects is economical and discreet, and never detracts from the story (based on Stanislaw Lem's 1961 novel of the same name). I haven't seen the 1972 Russian film also based on Lem's novel, but this version inspires me to seek it out.""Solaris"" asks us to consider many questions: What would we do if given a chance to relive the past? How important is memory to our concepts of our loved ones? Would we choose a false happiness over the ups and downs of reality? ""Solaris"" uses a futuristic setting to explore these questions eloquently and profoundly, leaving the viewer to supply the answers.

It is ripe for many interpretations.Sadly this plays just like you would expect grade C made for tv movie, except it has the added attraction of extended artistic shots of water falling, dripping etc. (where have we seen this before???)So instead of presenting the view with mysteries to ponder, wonderboy grinds out a feel good the big lugs really got a heart for his gal smarmfest. Instead of expanding as the ongoing degradation of public morality allows any perversion on the screen, and showing how others on the station were less than wholesome with their visitors, that whole thing is swept aside to make this like a solved in one episode Captain Kirk love tryst.The good news is that anything that brings Stanislav Lem's work to light is a step in the right direction, and perhaps, by at least spreading the word, someday a talented director will take on this tale and more sucessfully mine this motherload of divine mysteries.",Solaris

""Solaris"" requires great patience and intelligence and will not be for the ""Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights"" crowd. But moreso than any other film I've seen this year, it gave me pause to consider those moments in life which we would take back if that were somehow possible....the careless disregard, a glib but ignorant statement carelessly made to a loved one in a thoughtless moment or a poorly crafted effort to cause hurt. Like Joel Siegel, I wanted to stand and applaud, like Ebert, I found myself in deep reflection....I will see it again!  I am disturbed however, that after seeing the film at 11 A.M. on its opening day, that Imdb had 77 votes just fifteen minutes later, many of them ""one's""....and I must question the honesty of such participation even though I repeat that the film is not for those who are intellectually challenged.

Many have argued the message would be simplistic and the acting below average. I have to disagree with both: The ideas leave deep impressions and the acting is some of the best to be seen.Solaris develops an almost meditative, slow narrative force, which does not deliver anything ready-made. And that is not at last because of the very subtle, but never the less brilliant performances given. Like this, Solaris chooses a highly unique approach to deliver such a complex message - and it works. The slow narration will take you deeper and deeper into the emotional world of its characters to confront you with essential questions. It is all about the strive for an identity as self conscious being and about the sense behind any effort in life:""It's the puppet's dream... being human."" Creating and developing your self, by choosing images of possible pasts and futures to pursue. By confronting its characters with emotional situations and choices that would never be possible in any lifetime, the movie reduces its' considerations towards one question: ""What are we here for?""""There are no answers, only choices!""If you can not see the richness of this answer all at once, you might want to think about Sartre's ""Being and Nothingness"" or Camus' ""The Myth of Sisyphus"" or how Camus could claim that ""I do not believe in god and I am not an atheist!"".

How often do we need to see eerie spaceship hallways rehashed (and really would they leave every light in the ship burning?) I found my suspension of disbelief broken many times throughout this film and even considered walking out at one point. The casting was probably the biggest downfall of Solaris. I like George as an actor but really, not every actor can play every role and this was certainly not a role for George (I think Mr Soderbergh has a crush). Natascha McElhone is pretty but again not her kind of role.

It is very much about the humanity of the proceedings and if you don't dig that well...this isn't for you.We follow the journey of Kelvin(George Clooney in a stunning turn from his usual performances). Kelvin is a staunch atheist ""realist"". He is sent to a spacecraft that is studying a planet called Solaris. It seems that the crew on Solaris are having deep mental issues and Kelvin is a renowned shrink. Kelvin's friend was the lead scientist on the ship and he has committed suicide. Kelvin is supposed to be the objective assessor of the problems on board. The only catch is that neither he nor anyone on Earth have any idea what is really facing the crew.

Solaris is a very benign looking beautiful planet that just exists with only one catch. Those near it are being visited by dead relatives, friends, etc. This is where the story begins. We see through Clooney's ""ghost"" a tragic romance in the making. Clooney is visited by his deceased wife and through flashbacks and conversations between the two we find out that she had mental issues and committed suicide. I won't go into all of the hows and whys of the suicide but needless to say it is a great story told faithfully by the movie.Kelvin can't see past his own love and feelings of guilt over his wife's death. Gordon the lead scientist on the trip can't see past her paranoia and fear. In a few short days Kelvin goes from supposedly helping the crew deal with their issues to exposing himself as the one with the deepest problems of them all. The questions that are posed are gigantic and the answers to those types of questions can't really be answered in a movie. Knowing this the film never insults us with cheeky solutions. What is life? Kelvin posits that Gordon is a murderer when she ""kills"" one of the visitors he is saying that existence is all that matters not origin or circumstance. Is it murder? The movie doesn't even begin to say. Kelvin it seems to me was already dead. He died with his wife and he was simply going through the motions of existence. The other character in this piece is Snow who happens to be my favorite character. Snow we come to learn is actually from Solaris. We start out and he is the most human and compassionate of all the characters and at the end we discover that he was the real Snow's visitor and had to kill him in self defense. What does that say? Again the movie leaves it up to us with the confidence that we'll figure that out for ourselves.The movie isn't easy to love. It is slow and contemplative. It never spoon feeds or coddles the viewer. You'll have to put in your own work to enjoy it. Just because it takes place on a spaceship and in the future does not mean it will have a lot of action or explosions. It is simply a study of life and love set in the future with creepy undertones. What is Solaris? The movie never definitely says what the motives of Solaris is. In fact when Clooney asks his apparition friend what Solaris wants he is merely answered with a rhetorical ""What makes you think it has to want something?"". It isn't for everyone but if it is your style you will indeed love it with a vengeance.",Solaris
234,bus7821,"Calling it an ""Art Film"" is no defense",3,21 December 2004,"Many of the reviews up to this point have defended this film by proclaiming it to be an art film and invoking the standard art film defense: that one's desire to have something actually happen in a film is directly proportional to one's shallowness. I agree that this smells like an art film --- it mostly consists of irrational conversations punctuated by staring, brooding, and flashbacks to previous irrational conversations. (Albeit in a brightly lit spacecraft rather than a poorly lit apartment.) I don't need photon torpedoes blowing up aliens -- I would be willing to accept an enlightened conversation as ""something happening"", but we don't get that. By the time Gordon leaves for home, they know nothing about the phenomenon that she didn't know when Kelvin first set foot on the station. But thanks to his inept interviews (e.g. not asking follow-up questions to clarify obviously ambiguous answers), it takes him days to get up to speed. Toss out all of the time he wastes on that, and the flashbacks to very standard scenes from marriage to a depression-prone partner, and you are left with a typical Twilight Zone episode.",Solaris
235,ravenmccoy_ff5,"Ok, someone help me out here!",7,3 March 2003,"OK, What a great film, although I am the first to admit that is wasn't the easiest to follow (I think I just about got it), It was amazing. The set and simply dialogue is 2nd to none of the films I have seen so far this year. As both a Clooney and Soderbergh fan I was more than a little excited about this film, but after hearing such horrible reviews and comments from American I was more than a little nervous about seeing it. Was this gonna be the movie to turn me away from Soderbergh or simply love him even more? It was definitely the second. As for the acting I thought that the show was stolen by the unnerving performance by Jeremy Davies. And the brave acting and brilliant interpretation of a women with nothing but the projected image of herself was carried out amazingly well by Natascha McElhone, an actress who I had not come across before.Anyway, back to the point off this comment. Although I have seen some pretty weird films and really enjoyed the fact that I am left we the feeling of 'What the hell just happened?', not a bad feeling, but I like a film that makes me question myself and the world in which I live, something that 'Solaris' doesn't fail to deliver. I have read various reviews and I'm slightly put off by the fact that no one else seems to have seen the film in a similar way that I did. The common theory I have heard is one similar to maybe 'The Matrix'. My theory (and please remember that I have not seen the original so can't compare in any way) is that Solaris was a kind of metaphor for the state of mind that a person enters after someone close to them dies. George Clooney, like anyone who loses someone close to them has a choice to make, move on and live without them, or refuse to be able to live in a world that doesn't include the person that you love. I think that the return of Natascha McElhone is symbolic for the way that people relive sections of their life before their loved one died, the fact that the way Clooney remembers McElhone effects her is true to the way people question their memories. The ending when Clooney has returned to earth and once again McElhone appears, I think shows that Clooney choose that he could not live without his wife and was willing to sacrifice his life in order to be with her forever.I would really love to hear any comments about what other people thought of 'Solaris' and whether or not anyone out there agrees with me in the slightest.Final note: See this film, it's gonna be huge!!!",Solaris
236,russianberserker,Rarely seen cerebral sci fi,8,29 September 2008,"Steven Soderbergh's Solaris is the type of stripped down cerebral sci-fi that rarely materializes in this age of romper stomper robots and flagship laser cannons decimating a tiger-faced alien menace. While a remake of Tarkovsky's so called ""anti 2001"" (remake in the sense that they share the same source material), Soderbergh's squeaky clean medical lab future owes a lot to the visuals and pacing of the nowadays rarely viewed Silent Running. The camera creeps molasses-like through ice blue corridors exhibiting the emptiness and perhaps soulless potential of futuristic design and technology. In fact, emptiness and isolation play a large role right off the bat as the film begins with our eventual space traveler Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) wafting through the muted colors of Earth. Mostly shown from behind and in company with blurred individuals, Kelvin is isolated even around the drab public. With the way technology has been making human contact more and more impersonal over time, this seems a frighteningly accurate portrayal of how we will all feel in due time.The heart of the story though is based in the space station hovering around the gaseous tendrils of the planet Solaris. Kelvin travels to see if he can help out a friend in a crisis, but this of course leads him on a most mysterious journey. The barren station becomes even more prison-esquire than the grimy locales we saw on Earth, with only two human inhabitants on board, as well as some characters that may or may not be so human. Soderbergh respects his audience and asks them to leave passive viewing at home so they too can try to figure out what is being presented to Kelvin. What defines us as human? If there is such phenomena occurring like on the ship, how does that figure into religious views? Kelvin is forced to question all of his previous beliefs and the film, which is just vague enough in the ideas it presents, forces us to do the same. This is a finely crafted, deliberately paced, and truly exotic experience, the likes of which is rarely seen (or funded) today.",Solaris
237,hermes-10,A movie like a Mahler adagio,9,9 August 2003,"What? 6.5/10 (5,037 votes)? Did the wrong people go see this movie? True, if a movie should look like a video clip, this movie is absolute trash! This is more like an adagio by Gustav Mahler.Usually I don't bother to vote and even less write a comment, but here I feel I need to defend the movie. The theme (what is reality; to what extent are we real; how is love affected by our perception of reality) should be of fundamental interest to everybody, but of course isn't.
The casting and acting are more than excellent; the directing is vintage Soderbergh, i.e. original and very good. Name your aspect (sound?), and it is simply very well done. The visuals are stunningly beautiful.
Probably why people so far have rated it so low (6.5, ridiculous!) is that it is not always clear how scenes should be interpreted. This is way beyond good guy meets good girl encounters bad guy kills bad guy and good guy and good girl live happily ever after. Since the film personae don't wear white hats and black hats, one doesn't always know from the first moment what to think of them. If that bothers you, please avoid this movie. Or as Steven Soderbergh says in his commentary on the DVD - if you don't like the first ten or fifteen minutes, stop watching, for it doesn't get any better.So far I have seen it twice, the second time with the commentary by Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron (how could you get a bad movie when these two join forces?) and I am looking forward to seeing it many times to come.Steven, I am amazed how different your movies can look from one to the next, while maintaining such a level of excellence.

238,ixtlan,Too Cerebral for the Average Viewer,9,7 January 2017,"Yes. I mean that. Viewers want to see explosions, murder and mayhem. Not unanswered questions and thought experiments. This movie will give you plenty of those. A typical quote from the movie is ""There are no answers. Only choices."" Now how many of us have the patience to think about that one? This movie challenges us to sit still for a minute and really listen to what the characters are saying and what it could possibly mean. I thought the acting was excellent given the complexity of what Stanislaw Lem was trying to convey. If he was trying to convey existential crisis, I think the movie succeeds. I loved the touch of making one of the scientists a strong black woman. I watched the original Russian version (1972) before trying to digest the newer one. The newer one resonated with me more. Perhaps because it is more current - perhaps because the in Russian version I had more trouble understanding the timelines and how they fit it - until the end. In the American movie, the timelines make more sense but there is no twist at the end. The last few minutes become predictable. I also found the Russian version much more difficult to relate to emotionally though. I don't know how either movie compares to the book, but that will be my next stop.",Solaris
239,MulhollandRob,Finally a Better remake!!,10,9 December 2002,"Like the mesmerizing music that breaks out occasionally in Steven Soderbergh's rare and beautiful ""Solaris"", the movie is a mixture of chilliness and warmth. It keeps you at arm's length even as it gets you closer. This is uplifting frustrating science fiction, nearer to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" than to ""Star Wars."" It's also a love story, but not a sappy one because the romance is more metaphysical then oppose to sappy. It's a psychological drama about love and death, reality and dreams.
Based on Polish writer Stanislaw Lem's philosophical 1961 novel, and a remake from the 1972 Andrei Tarkovsky's film. ""Solaris"" is a hypnotic mind twister, a meditation on the nature of being and humanity.Steve Soderbergh wrote, directed, photographed and edited ""Solaris"", altering Lem's story to focus more on the romantic relationship. He shows us in flashbacks how Kelvin and Rheya met and fell in love and the events leading to her death. These are the warm elements of an ultimately chilly tale. Soderbergh makes the opening scenes loo crisp, cool and evocative in a way that reminds us of a Stanley Kubrick film. ""Solaris"" easily ranks in with Soderbergh's finer works such as ""Traffic"", ""Out of Sight"", and ""Sex, Lies, & Videotape"", and is just as experimental as ""Full Frontal"" but more essential!!""",Solaris

So I never saw George on the hospital show, yet I heard about him everywhere, it was annoying.  I have seen him in some movies, he was fine in thin red line, great in three kings, ok in perfect storm, and really fun in welcome to collinwood, but solaris blew me away. We saw it at 7 o'clock.

I think Soderberg understood the book well. The character's motives and beliefs in the movie are pretty much identical to the ones in the book. It also has the same melancholic and surreal concept. The movie, beside being a sci-fi mystery, thriller is actually a genuine love story. But it is not about the love we hope to meet in another person, but about the love we long to discover within ourselves and then understand it. At least I interpret it that way.The movie is also a standard on its own for a good cinematography - lighting, make-up, scenes, and of course - very good acting.",Solaris

This film captures that sense of the Great Unknown and twists it into a very moving love story, which revolves around George Clooney's character and his dead wife (the beautiful Natascha McElhone).And at the centre of this film...

244,seanjenson,Visually stunning and strangely meditative,7,21 July 2018,Solaris is an effort by director Steven Soderberg to bring to the screen one of the greatest science fiction novels ever- Stanislaw Lem's Solaris. Comparisons with Tarkovskys film will be expected but both are quite apart in tone and approach. Soderberg's film is more mainstream and thus much more colorful. I'll give him this: His pictures are gorgeous to look at. George Clooney plays astronaut Chris Kelvin who is summoned on a space station floating around the mysterious planet Solaris. When he arrives he sees not all is right and that the planet is playing mind games on the inhabitants of the ship. This is a good film and you should check it out.,Solaris

In `Solaris' special effects are only the background for interesting story, what a pity that in the rest of SF commercial production situation is just the opposite... It was a real pleasure to compare Steven Sodenbergh vision of the novel written by Stanislas Lem, with my own visualization I had after reading of the book. Usually such comparison of book and film is unfavorable for the movie - not in this case - I can't say that film version is better than book, it's slightly different, but also excellent. Hope to see more such fabulous adaptations of great science-fiction literature.  I am sick of stupid, infantile stories, which are only the pretext for stunning special effects.

I dismissed it offhand as a weak twilight-zone-like story about benevolent aliens interacting with human on a remote space station. Then, due mostly to the repeating schedule of the movie network I watched it again.It is really a very good movie. It's not science fiction, although it reminds me most of the Martian Chronicles. Like those stories it is ultimately about what it means to be human. In this light it is quite successful.Sure it's atmospheric and moody but really well done.Try watching it again, late in the evening, when it is quiet.",Solaris
247,Slagathor,"Brilliant, touching, deep.",10,21 April 2004,"Solaris is a brilliant stand-alone effort that does not require an in-depth knowledge neither of Lem nor of the brilliant past effort of Andrei Tarkovsky. Soderbergh's true auteuristic production takes the Lem material and condenses it into one eternal question: is our memory of a person or event trustworthy, real, entire, intact? Solaris takes a stance, much the same way that Eternal Sunshine did a few years later, and claims that, in the end, the question doesn't matter. Although our memory is insufficient to construct our lives, human life, human resolve, human emotion is designed to ""make do"". Edited, shot, adapted and directed by Soderbergh, it is difficult to find any fault with Solaris at all. Clooney proves again why he is the current darling of quasi-indie directors.

250,FreedByFiction,"An entrancing, intelligent, ethereal beauty.",10,31 July 2003,"""Solaris"" is one of the best films of 2002. Soderbergh and his incredible team should be commended for creating such a splendid, miraculously crafted triumph of modern sci-fi cinema. This is science fiction with class, style, and atmosphere. If you are not appreciative of slow cameras and dialogue, do not see this movie. Now, for people with taste, let me tell you what you are in for: a thoroughly enjoyable emotional space opus designed for adult-minded people with a sense of wonder to spare. George Clooney is a psychologist sent to a remote planet's space station to investigate the strange occurrences affecting the crew. Steven Soderbergh continues to dazzle with his eclectic palette of films, and is quickly on his way to becoming a legendary director. George Clooney proves he can really act in this one, with bouts of emotions rarely seen in his usually pretty-boy demeanor. Natascha McElhone shines as the wife. The supporting cast includes Jeremy Davies, Ulrich Tukur, and Viola Davis, all of whom provide exceptional dramatic support. The sets, costumes, ships and the planet itself are wonders to behold. This film is an unforgettable experience. Nothing like it has been made since ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". The film is serious, odd, haunting, and bold. You should consider yourself blessed to see a film this delicate in today's world of cinematic drivel. Thank you Steven Soderbergh! 10/10",Solaris

Considering the poor impression it left, it was actually promising in parts and threatened to improve on a couple of occasions. It had an interesting premise and was even thought provoking at times. The pace was slow and the dialog in short supply with much of focus on pregnant pauses and facial expressions to set the mood. Which is fine and it can sometimes work very well. But the plot was wafer thin, there were a lot of loose ends and the finale was very disappointing.

I  simply can not wade through the sludge. The acting is good, and for that reason I do occasionally try again, but so far this thing just doesn't work for me. Since ""ER"" I have no particular fondness for Clooney, so that doesn't help. McElhone is good in the role of, what ever it is, but, as with the rest of the script, the dialog is choppy.

I only finished this about an hour ago, and I guarantee I'll have even more questions tomorrow than I have running through my head a mile a minute currently.Before anything, I have to mention that this movie is best seen with another person.  Be it a romantic interest or what have you, find someone to see this movie with who enjoys discussion of consciousness and the soul.  You'll enjoy it much more afterwards having talked to someone, and will probably sleep better ;)I'm not going to go into details about why I liked the acting, but I've always liked George Clooney from the roles he played such as Daniel Ocean or Doug on ER and I enjoy Natascha McElhone for her roles in movies such as Truman Show and Ronin.  Suffice to say they were both excellent in their parts, and generated a genuine on-screen romance as the slightly cynical, but emotionally restrained couple that couldn't bear to tell the other how much they really needed each other.  It was not only interesting to watch, but plausible and at times heart-wrenching.What amazed me about the movie were the things you just couldn't predict.  I can honestly say that the script was not the kind you'd be able to expect certain dialog from.  Clooney's character, while grieving and emotionally distressed, asks the truly scientific questions a philosopher would pose in spite of his inability to cope with the reappearance of his deceased wife. McElhone's character acquiring her own consciousness also throws you off the course you thought you were taking with the movie.  The execution of the film is magnificent, and I honestly never had any idea what to expect at any time during the film.The movie will not register with MANY MANY people and while this bothers me greatly (at our lack of understanding on the societal scale) it's a disappointment that the philosophical nature of love might go unregarded. The ambience of this movie was a mix of psychological horror and a the kind of deep, solidly spiritual love that can't be measured.  Only a handful of people were in the theatre with me at the time and from what they were saying to me it seemed that the majority of them were expecting something that they didn't see.BOTTOM LINE - If you're looking for a date flick, this may not be it.  Then again if you're a die-hard science fiction fan you may not enjoy this either.  If you're in a committed relationship revolved around a true bond to your partner and you like to talk about things BESIDES other people and events then this movie just might strike a chord with you.

254,newton7,A poor remake of a Tarkovsky classic,5,16 August 2003,"Director Stephen Soderbergh seems pretty confident that no-one who sees this film has actually seen the original version, made by Andrej Tarkovsky in the early '70's. Not only is the plot line unaltered (both are reasonably faithful to Stanislaw Lem's short novel), but the style is the same - very slow, drawn out, very quiet (for the most part). Cliff Martinez's music score sounds like a clumsy pastiche of Ligeti's ""Atmospheres"" (the original used a sparse, electronic score by Eduard Artimyev and bit of Bach organ music). Whereas Tarkovsy's version, which renders the plot slightly more opaque than in the original novel,has a haunting quality, Sonderbergh's attempt is merely boring. George Clooney makes an adequate Chris Kelvin, but his performance lacks the brooding quality of Tarkovsky's Donatas Banionis. Natascha McElhone is decorative as Rhea, but not a patch on Natalya Bondarchuk in the earlier version. Jeremy Davis is a suitably gibbering Dr. Snow, but his neurotic performance must give place to the superb Yuri Yarvet, a distinguished Russian Shakespearean actor in Tarkovsky's version. For some reason, Lem's Dr. Sartorius has undergone a sex change and is here the female Dr. Gordon, dutifully played by Viola Davis. The change makes no difference at all either way. The overall effect of he earlier version is hypnotic and tantalising, the overall effect of this effort is pretentiousness with a big budget. In my DVD version, the various extra documentary features make no reference at all to the earlier Tarkovsky film. Just how dumb and ignorant does Hollywood think we cinemagoers are?

Or, maybe solaris is heaven, Or, an alien planet that manipulates ones mind so that what the experience seems real, even though it's not.The discussion at the table concerning god and religion etc,.. was such a joke, very weak, and dumbed down to a point of meaninglessness.The movie is very SSsssssLLllllllOOoooooooWWwwwwwwwww paced.

I didn't get the connection with the boy holding his hand out to the main character during the finale.One commenter had this to say which made me laugh heartedly: "" explores the uncharted realms of the human condition as much as the unknown realities of the universe, and swims upstream against the currents of ethics, physics, and even metaphysics, you will probably enjoy this moody, slow, multi-leveled and heavily textured film.""human condition"" ?? what ? being trapped in a spaceship with illusions of lost love, is a metaphor for the Human Condition ? yeah Right...Unknown realities of the Universe ? like staring at the miasma of cream and hot coffee at the break of dawn.Multi-leveled ? reality and illusion, afterlife, spirit world dreamworld alien simulated life ? whatever man.. doesn't look multi-leveled to me, just your basic dreamy romance story in a spaceship setting entering a world of illusion.but then again, ""what is real?"" Well, how about a better movie like ""The matrix"".In order to be receptive to this movie you'd need a particular frame of mind: ""high on weed"".However, the acting by all the cast was solid, just the way in which this movie was written. And, the music was, well, great if you need to get some sleep.Overall the movie seemed low budget and unfinished. the concept wasn't depicted strong enough, and the slow pace makes the mind wander and thus doesn't do much to keep one interested enough.I know a good film when I see, it, and Solaris is marginal at best. Hardly worth the the price of a good book.If there is one thing I hate, are Writers that do these stupid remakes, add a few differences here, there, better graphics, steal other writers ideas then viola', everybody calls Steven Soderbergh a genius, quite the contrary, for this film, no way.One facet I did like about this film is the point where Chris realizes Nobody ever knows all there is to know about another person, and that's what makes the surrealism of the story so compelling or wishy washy, mixed up and meaningless.And, this sums up it all up, from another commenter: Soderbergh has managed to leave out just about everything that could justify the title .Serious, it was a weak film, However I respect Soderbergh cause of his other work.

Faultless cinematography is backed up by solid performances and an under stated script full of ambiguity that places the films riddles firmly in the viewers lap.Little things like life, death, love, redemption and indeed heaven and hell are all delved into with a depth seldom seen. Not so much a story as an experience (think 2001) this movie will take you far away from earth and into the depths of the human mind and space-time itself.Arguably a sci-fi film, deserving of Oscars and universal praise instead it has been swept under the carpet by the braindead masses who do not like to be challenged by their cinema.For people who like to come away from their movies with questions and don't enjoy things wrapped up in a bow. This film is must see for fans of smart sci-fi and emotionally engaging cinema.An instant classic that should rank proudly alongside the best the industry has to offer.A one of a kind experience that is Highly recommended",Solaris
258,ailinon,Eternity has just gotten a new name.,2,7 February 2003,"Reading the reviews of this movie, I cannot help but recall a short comedy clip which I saw somewhere. It featured a modern art gallery, full of well-dressed high-class people, walking around and commenting on various wacky paintings, until the camera pans over to several elderly men surrounding another example of art on another wall. They point at it, comment how surrealistic it is, how the author managed to capture this and that, how perfect and how brilliant it is - until the ""painting"" begins moving, and drives off, it being just a piece of a soft drink advert pinned to the side of a truck that was parked outside a gallery window.""Deliberately slow-paced""? I don't mind slow-paced movies, not at all, but watching minute after minute of slow walking and talking about nothing in particular while the important issues remain completely unmentioned, is a bit too much. ""Brilliant in its meaning""? _What_ meaning, excuse me? I cannot find any possible interesting explanation of its ending, really - the only two meanings I can see is one horribly shallow, cheap sappy excuse for a romantic sacrifice dressed in an old ""meaning of humanity"" robe, or a big twist beyond any possible reasoning. The former being surprisingly more likely.** SPOILERS **  - my quick overview of what, in my opinion, went wrong in the movie.First of all, who in their right mind sends a single civilian to a space station, when previously a military task force failed in there?Next, suppose your deceased beloved one materializes next to you. Would your first impulse be to chat a bit and then simply kill that person again (as they're not real anyway), then watch them reappear, and then become emotionally attached to them again? Sounds weird, doesn't it? But that's what Clooney does in there.This only gets worse in the ending. Clooney sees a vision of his own ""clone"" (cloone?:) on Earth, and decides to stay on the crash-coursed station. Why? For the sake of his dead wife that wasn't even there? Come on. But if it is so, what does this ""Clooney-clone on Earth"" stuff mean? It just doesn't make sense at all. The only thing that comes to my mind is ""we are all clones created by someone"", but I refuse to believe in such a banal idea, which actually doesn't fit in that moment anyway.** END OF SPOILERS **So what point the movie is trying to make, remains a mystery to me. ""We live only for the ones we love, even when they're dead""? Please. ""We only exist when someone remembers us""? Not explored enough. ""Everything is just an illusion""?? Puh-leeease...!!In a nutshell, the biggest problem with this movie was its pride. It presents itself like a piece of deep, meaningful art, giving time to think, to absorb, to conclude... but there is nothing to think of. The message is shallow and undecided, jumping from Harlequin romance to weary existence questions, like a hamburger served on a silver plate. There is nothing new in this movie, except exceptional boredom. It failed as a ""cerebral movie"", it failed as a SF, it failed as a romance. I'm sorry, but it is simply a bad movie defended only by an old ""you don't like it because you don't understand it!"" line. Yeah, been there, done that. 2/10.",Solaris
259,mrswhite072895,Could have been better,4,20 November 2003,"Solaris is a sci-fi, futuristic, romantic existentialist flick that tries to challenge the audience and the main character's (George Clooney as Dr. Chris Kelvin) ideas about life, death, heaven, reincarnation and life after death. It is wonderful goal for a film to have, but it was a noble plan that failed horribly.Dr. Kelvin is a therapist sent to a space station that is orbiting the planet Solaris. He is supposed to find out why the remaining crew won't come home. Or is he there to figure out why most of the crew was murdered? Or did they commit suicide? Actually, I'm not sure why he is sent there. Solaris creates facsimiles of the crew's dearly departed, mainly Kelvin's late wife, from their memories. I am not sure why the planet Solaris is doing it and neither does the crew. I'm not sure why many things are happening in this movie. The plot isn't too convoluted to be followed. There just isn't any plot at all.The best part of this movie was seeing George Clooney naked-not once, but twice. My favorite nude shot was of Kelvin and his wife sharing a bowl of Ramen noodles in all their post-coital glory. (Clooney is proof that people can look better as they get older!) Clooney also does a great job of doing that charming, soulful, caring, subtly sexy thing he does so well. He perfected it in the other Steven Soderbergh movie he starred in-the wonderfully subtle and sexy Out of Sight. In fact, the flashbacks in Solaris are very reminiscent of the hotel and love scenes between Clooney and Jennifer Lopez in Out of Sight. There's a feeling of invading on someone's intimate moment and memory. With all that, the movie was a colossal waste of time. Wait for it to come on television. Better yet, just rent Out of Sight.",Solaris
260,jpblondeau,Brilliant spaced-out mood,9,21 March 2006,"Soderbergh pulled a slow one with ""Solaris"", and there's nothing wrong with that !! The mood in this film is hard to describe... A kind of meditative state, slowly growing, perfectly complemented by the lush soundtrack. This is also one of Clooney's best roles (especially compared to his wishy-washy performances in blockbusters aka ocean's eleven, peacemeaker,etc).And when the weirdness kicks in, the movie just gets better... But PLEASE don't rent this puppy expecting Alien or Star Wars !!! It's a slow paced adventure, more akin to Gattaca or code46, you have been warned ! Far out - 9/10",Solaris
261,magscadar,"Not a sci-fi. It's a slow, dull romantic drama",7,31 October 2016,"I have both this and Tarkovsky's version of Stanislaw Lem's novel. I found both of them to be somewhat of a trial, although for slightly different reasons. Both are slow, and unless you are easily confused and generally clueless, they don't actually have much of a mystery to them because the secret of the ""mystery"" is kind of obvious very early on. Where this one fails compared to the 1972 version is that the science fiction is merely a shallow vehicle for a rather stodgy and slow treatment of a doomed romance. There's no actual science in the story at all. It's full of rather obvious logical flaws which distract from the story. There's also little to no science fiction in this version, since it revolves almost entirely about a lonely man's inability to deal with the loss of the difficult and rather fay woman he loved; the science fiction, such as it is, merely provides a pretty backdrop and an excuse for a series of dull flashbacks to the highlights of their relationship. Where the modern remake scores over Tarkovsky's film is that it's about an hour shorter, which means you can get it over and done with that much quicker. On the balance I found the modern take to be more accessible, the only problem being the lack of interest in what you are able to access.To sum up: if you're a science fiction fan rather than a fan of romantic drama, don't bother. If you're a fan of slow, dense, intense romantic dramas with troubled characters who sit staring into space for unreasonable amounts of time, and with stories which have pretensions of being intellectual, then you will probably enjoy this.The seven points I'm giving it are for a good cast who put in decent performances despite the stodgy material, and for fairly decent production values. I feel like I'm being overly generous and it actually doesn't deserve more than 6 points, but what the hell. At least they tried hard.",Solaris
262,B_a_S_t_A_r_D,No Progression,3,24 October 2006,"This comment is on behalf of everyone who has watched Soderbergh's ""Solaris"", didn't like it and were told they didn't like it because they haven't read the book or seen the original.I have not read the book or seen the original, and I didn't like it. A movie, even one intended to provoke thought and debate, shouldn't rely on its basis for enjoyment. I had never read Clockwork Orange, a Batman comic or Ring, but I enjoyed all those movies a great deal.It must be said that the ideologies presented in this film were immense. The notions of regret, second chances and fear of the unknown were skillfully put forward, especially the philosophy that a physical manifestation of an object or being, no matter how accurate, isn't necessarily the object it represents. Rheya questioning this and Chris' refusal to debate it due to his scientific values was the highlight. Unfortunately, outside of this scene, Solaris lacks anything. Character, progression and empathy. Chris is almost emotionless and this renders his character (a low point for Clooney) isolated from empathy. There is no spark between him and the audience. Rheya is dull and undesirable, hence uncomfortable to watch for too long. There is no standout performance in Solaris. The idea of regret and second chance in a science fiction film (the deepest and most thought provoking genre) seems dangerously trivial in comparison to values in Bladerunner, 2001, Invasion of the Bodysnatchers among others. Overall, Solaris is a huge disappointment. There is no climax and the film is far too slow moving to incite any interest. The values and debates are terrific, it is just a shame that there isn't a great narrative or performance to go with them.",Solaris
263,Murphy-2,"Can you say ""Wake Me Up When The Credits Role""",1,26 May 2004,"Do people genuinely set out to make really gosh-awful movies, while spending lots of money?  Actually, the question should be why would anyone in his or her right mind throw away hard-earned, fiat currency to make a total train wreck of a flick?  Hmmm . . . can you say ""Solaris?""  Do I sound redundant? If I do, please allow me to stop so I can start over and repeat myself. My husband fell asleep within the first 15 minutes of the movie, and I wondered if I shouldn't join him, seeing that even the lead actor, George Clooney (Chris Kelvin), kept falling asleep so his deceased wife (Rhyea) would return to him.  I should have fallen asleep so this movie would go away sooner.  But I resisted, and instead lapsed into a self-induced comma (aka: images floating before my eyes, while unable to generate any body movement, with occasional involuntary drooling and bodily excretions). So here you have Clooney, playing the role of a psychiatrist, who never really does any psychiatric work.  (I've seen more convincing performances in a Mandy Moore film.  She's more believable as a dying teen than Clooney is as a psychiatrist . . . and that's pushing the envelope - clean off the table.) Clooney shoots off into space to aid the commander of a floating space station, only the commander committed suicide before his arrival, but keep in mind a few years earlier Clooney's wife committed suicide, so it seems there might be a pattern emerging here, but noooo.  Instead, the remaining two people on the space station (upon Clooney's arrival) are able to dream up people - dead or undead who cares - because you never really know if they are dead or undead or if anyone is really what they seem.  Are they real or Memorex via the Solaris experience?  Only you never see their dreamed creation - well - except for the one fellow who dreamed up himself and then murdered his real self.  Or the space station commander's dream son, who is not really his son, who is actually back on Earth, but the dream boy doesn't do anything to make his character believable, which could have added an interesting story line to the movie to make up for all the dead, slow-paced script that fell flat from the first frame. The movie's core lies with Clooney's deceased, yet, unstable wife, who is even more unstable as a Solaris entity, and Clooney's dilemma is trying to keep her from committing suicide again, because she doesn't think she's the real Rhyea.  But no one bothers to indulge the viewer on the true reasons behind her original instability, which makes no sense since her husband is a psychiatrist, but it is hinted that her mother was ""Certifiable."" Instead of returning to Earth, Clooney elects to remain onboard the space station as it is sucked into the Solaris field.  So does he die, commit suicide or return as a non-acting actor in the last frames, as Rhyea re-enters spouting some voodoo propaganda to mess with the mind of the masses about being ""forgiven"" or some such nonsense?  Who knows, and by this time, who really cares? The title should be changed to ""Soborus.""  Just wake me up when the credits role, please. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz . . .",Solaris
264,HotPot,"Technically excellent, but oh so dull",3,6 March 2003,"I was expecting great things after reading a review of this.  It started off well enough, with a lot of slow or static shots rarely focussed on the person talking, making you think about the consequences of what was being said for the person in shot - mmm, arty, I thought!  After that, this artiness got a little tiresome, with continued use of very slow pans and lingering shots of nothing happening.It wasn't long before I realised Solaris was a would-be ""2001: A Space Odyssey"": the lingering shots, nothing much happening, even the style of music.  I was never a fan of 2001 because of that slowness (yet how did Alien manage to go slow but keep the audience engaged?), so Solaris trying to mimic that wasn't endearing.  I sat and tried to work out what kind of a movie it was.  Exciting?  No way.  Tense?  Nope.  Thrilling?  Funny? Humourous?  No.  Emotional?  Surprisingly, no.  Interesting?  No, sorry, not at all.Having watched plenty of other films (and TV series like Star Trek!) make the same kind of story much more engaging, I found I really didn't care what happened.  They even tried a couple of twists, but these just came off as ""let's-add-a-twist.""I suppose the acting was okay given the limited material, but in the end the movie just seemed rather pointless, contrived, dull (which I may have mentioned already), and unbelievable.  There was the promise of much, with exciting possibilities set up, but the promise wasn't delivered, unfortunately.(As a slight aside, it never looks good when people are sitting in the cinema with their eyes closed, and worse still when people walk out 15 minutes from the end; both of these happened when I saw Solaris.)",Solaris

I am actually contemplating writing to the production company for my money back...and charging for my time as well.Lame derivative story, special effects we have seen before, and long drawn out shots using slow resolving focus over and over and over again. Even the annoying character is not quite annoying enough to stand out from the rest of the film.Film Scores are supposed to enhance or add to a film not just irritate the crap out of you and let you get distracted from the movie (even when the distraction is welcome).I would have scored it zero - but the lowest on the IMDB Scale is a 1.Avoid this film at all costs.",Solaris
267,shastar,Dull and plodding,3,12 December 2002,"Ok, now I knew what I was getting into when I went to see this movie. I knew that it wasn't going to be a 'happy thug with a gun blows stuff up' Sci-Fi movie. I knew there weren't going to be chest bursting aliens, I knew it was going to be a very talky movie, I knew that this movie was supposed to make you think.That being said, I have to say this movie failed on all accounts. George Clooney is expressionless through most of it, except for a wide eyed 'deer-in-headlights' look, Natascha McElhone (Recently of the terrible Feardotcom) is about as animated as a pencil, and they way they have her staring into the camera sometimes is downright creepy, and some of the plot holes you could drive a truck through. Example: at the beginning of the movie, they mention a military team being sent in to assess the damage and rescue the survivors, if necessary. After Cloony steps onboard the station, Zero mention of them. You would think that Gordon or Snow (the stations final survivors) would have said something about them, or if they turned up someplace, maybe a message would have been waiting for Clooney when he came out of hypersleep. But nope, it's as though they never existed.The Movies symbolism and messages are about as subtle as getting hit on the head with a hammer. About halfway through the movie, the audience is practicly led by the hand into the analogy of Solaris = God. The soundtrack is overpowering, going for shrilling notes when you get views of the planet. And the 'psychological' aspects of Clooney losing all perception of being clinical and unbiased is hamhandedly and unrealisticly handled. I'm sorry, I don't care how much I want my dead wife, friend, whoever back, I'm going to be a little skeptical when she suddenly appears in front of me out of nowhere (twice). I was told when I got my movie ticket that people were getting refunds left and right from this movie. I can see why, as only the super pretentious would even try to find something remotely resembling entertaining in this movie.I cannot recommend this movie at all, not as Sci-fi, not as a study in psychology, nothing. Avoid, and if you feel that you HAVE to see it, wait until it's out on video, then find someone who rented or bought it and borrow it off of them.",Solaris

""Friends"" is good for that.Nothing wrong with any of these things, but if they are what you want then Solaris will not satisfy you. It is not a popcorn movie, it is far from mindless, and it isn't entertaining in the conventional sense. Solaris is thoughtful, intelligent, emotional, deep. If you are only looking for something with the depth of ""Friends"", you will want to kill yourself long before this movie is over, as I am sure you will notice in reading some of the other reviews for this movie.I'm scaring you already, aren't I? Well there is no need to be scared. Solaris is very accessible and quite engrossing, you just need the right frame of mind.In the right frame of mind you will be moved by George Clooney's rich and complex performance, haunted by Natascha McElhone's beauty and intensity, impressed by the realistic set design and understated visual effects, and intrigued by Steven Sodherberg's provocative direction of his thoughtful script adaptation. Too many adjectives? Perhaps, but this is a movie that defies being described by catchphrases and glib compliments, and that is probably why it didn't ""succeed"" in theatres.The plot setup in a nutshell: (mild spoilers ahead) At some point after his wife's (McElhone) suicide, psychiatrist Clooney is sent to a distant space station around an unusual planet, Solaris. Strange things are happening there, and the crew is becoming unbalanced. After his arrival and a couple of peculiar conversations, Clooney falls asleep and wakes up in the arms of... his wife. Solaris has recreated a version of her from Clooney's own fragments of memory. It has done something similar for the other crew.What follows through from this is an exploration of memory, loss, regret, and deep, deep love. In other roles Clooney does not necessarily come off as being a particularly deep man, but here his emotions are written on his face in vivid strokes. His confusion, pain, loss, love, hope are palpable. I was both touched and engrossed by his performance.There are surprises, but Luke Skywalker does not come crashing through a door. The ending is a true resolution, not a trite ""Ha ha we did it"" or ""Aren't we wonderful."" This movie will keep you thinking and reflecting.I watched this film on DVD, and might have been inspired to give it 10/10 (instead of 9 for being just slightly short of a classic) if the commentary soundtrack featuring Sodherberg and producer James Cameron wasn't so annoyingly overwhelmed with assertions of how brilliant each thought the other was (Cameron was particularly bad; he just oozed b.s.).

269,IvanKaramasov,Pleasantly surprised,8,16 November 2004,"Tarkovsky's ""Solaris"" from 1972 is among my absolute favorite movies. In the science fiction genre I can only think of ""2001"" and maybe ""Blade Runner"" in the same league. All of these three movies are relatively slowly paced, with an emphasis on philosophical and spiritual questions rather than action and suspense. I must admit that I was rather unsure about Soderbergh's ""remake"". Even though I think he is a decent director, I have never really understood those who regard him as a genius. The fact that James Cameron is one of the producers didn't exactly calm me down. I often find his movies painfully shallow and silly.It turns out that this is a very fine movie, indeed. Not quite on the level of Tarkovsky's, but not far from it. Tarkovsky's main emphasis is on philosophical questions, but Soderbergh chooses to shift it over to the love story, which probably makes this film easier to relate to for a lot of people, but also slightly less interesting in my opinion. However, it is beautifully told and overall well acted. Clooney does a very decent job as Kelvin. Nasthascha McElhone is fine as Rheya (although I have to admit that there is something about her appearance that I really don't like). But the most impressive acting is done by Jeremy Davies which creates a really strange character. If you manage to watch this movie to the end you may understand just why he behaves so strangely :-)",Solaris

274,mrandy,"A ""Jam Session"" of a Movie",9,7 December 2002,"Solaris is a wonderful film.  Its funny how when people love a movie they'll go to any length to defend it, even to call people dumb who don't like it -- assuming that the reason they don't like it is that they don't understand it.Film can be like music when it comes to taste.  For instance, one can appreciate the musical prowress of a ""jam"" band, but be bored by the jam. 
Steven Soderbergh has taken on the role of jam band.  Solaris is a jam session of a movie.  It is full of variations on a theme, and false starts that don't develop and riffs that are repeated.  The film is deliberately paced, it is not slow.  And just like a jam session, when you least expect it Solaris comes back to the important riffs.The funny thing is -- that is the best description I can give of Solaris without spoiling it.  It does have very little ""plot"".  It is not a densely written thriller (I don't mean dense as in stupid, I mean dense as in LA Confidential -- a bunch going on).  It is well acted and well directed and well photographed.  An interesting link between 2002 Solaris and 1972 Solaris is that by the end of the 2002 film, George Clooney seemed to look more and more like the original lead actor, it was uncanny.If you liked 2001: A Space Odyssey, A.I.:Artificial Intelligence, and Contact (and even Magnolia) I think you'll like Solaris.  If you don't like at least 2 of 3 those of those movies, Solaris is probably not your cup of tea.

Its a visually beautiful movie with great acting from Clooney, Davies, etc... I'd put this film in the same league as Vanilla Sky, not everyones cup of tea but definitely my drink of choice. The plot line stays simple throughout and the film uses it visuals to keep the story where its going. Its basically a love story in outer space - but its really nowhere near that cheesy! Although some might say it's nothing special I really think it takes a lot of input and effort to achieve a film of this calibre. For instance the quality of acting is heavily relied on unlike some Hollywood blockbusters these days that count on huge special effects and CGI to get the audience in. The soundtrack NEEDS to be spot on, that mellow psychedelic ambiance is perfect here. The visual effects must stay with reality, not too much CGI, which spoils so many films of late, stick to the basics of actual set design and real props instead of computer generated ones, it does this so well. And most importantly the Direction, Steven Soderbegh delivers!!! Watch this alone, without interruption, I mean really watch it - You'll love it.",Solaris
276,twitchyx,The most boring movie I have ever seen.,1,29 November 2002,"I have never seen the original version of Solaris, but after seeing the remake, I do not care to. This movie reminded me a whole lot of my senior Biology class. It lasted forever, it made no sense to me, and it was incredibly dull. Quite frankly, this movie is unwatchable. I have never seen a film creep along at a slower pace. For every 30 seconds of actual dialouge or action, we are forced to sit through 10 minutes of close ups on George Clooney's face, and views of stars out in space. This makes the plot incredibly difficult to understand because by the time you are done staring at the 10 minute closeup of George Clooney laying down on a bed, your mind has wondered and you can't really remember what is going on. I spent most of my time watching other people in the theatre. When the show started the place was nearly full, by the end of the movie almost half the viewers had walked out. Unfortunatly I was not one of them, although the thought had occured to me over and over again. When Solaris finally ended everyone stood up in unison and began piling out as quickly as possible. Bottomline, unless you are a raging insomniac who is in dire need of sleep, there is absolutely no reason to see this movie. Save your self the $7 and just sit at home and watch the paint dry on the walls.",Solaris
277,Rhife,Decent sci-fi flick uses thought instead of action to tell the story.,7,7 December 2002,"Review: I didn't know what to make of Solaris when I heard about it. Eventually, the previews told me I should give this a chance (with movies like 8 Crazy Nights and Treasure Planet, my options were slim). However, this movie is actually decent, in a weird, erotic sort of way. Clooney proves that he can stretch his acting range as a pyschologist dealing with the death of his wife, which he blames himself for (she committed suicide.) Imagine arriving to a ship and going to sleep, only to wake up with your wife who has been dead for years. Weird, eh? This movie does get REALLY slow at times, which in part is necessary for tension, but at times it draaaaaaaaaaaags. If you're not a fan of non-action sci-fi movies, then skip this. This is a movie that makes you think, but the violence level is zero. No action, unless you count sex. The performances are strong by the supporting cast. The ending is weird as well. You WILL have to watch this more then once to appreciate it. I'll appreciate it again when it comes to DVD next year.Final Score: 6.4 out of 10 (A decent sci-fi flick that relies more on thought then action. However, that could turn off most people who need that boost of action in their films.)",Solaris

And that gift is to be able to let myself go completely into a movie, and let the director, the actors and the movie itself take me on a voyage. Now, this may sound very ""poetic"", but I don't know any other way to describe it.Solaris. Written for the screen and directed by Soderbergh, produced by Cameron, starring Clooney.. Sounds bold. Sounds like a disaster waiting to happen. Let me tell you now, it is not. If you have the ability to let yourself go into a movie, this picture is no less than fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. But if you're of those who cannot overlook the fact that a romantic story is involved, and is determined this will corrupt any great movie; you will not enjoy this movie to its fullest.Steven Soderbergh has done something beautiful here. He has created something we would like to be true, or at least dream of it as an option. Yes, in some manners it does remind me of Kubricks 2001, but where is the harm in that? 2001 was, and still is, one of the greatest movies ever made. I think Soderbergh knew that just like we know that. And I also don't think Soderberghs intention was to copy or duplicate 2001 in any way. I see it more as a tribute to one of the finest filmmakers to ever set foot on this planet.I will not tell the plot (which surely is spoiled among one of the other comments), neither will I criticize the acting, directing or any other aspect of this film. This is simply because I think these aspects (though not flawless) are unimportant if you are able to watch a film and simply let someone tell you a story without looking at it with the judgemental eye of a filmcritic. One has to be able to look at movies and distance oneself from that point of view sometimes. If you do that, this movie takes you to another dimension. It shows you a tale of dreams, human instinct, fear and passion.In my humble opinion I think this movie is worthy of perhaps an Oscar. In which category I don't know, but I feel it deserves to be recognized in some way. The movie took me away from something ordinary, into something extraordinary. If only for one and a half hour, I was in another place. This one is for those who have been asking for some quality to come out of hollywood. The question now is, will You recognize it..",Solaris

There are a number of reasons why we find it hard to get a full night's sleep, but the result is usually the same. It can be frustrating, stressful, and affect our quality of life. If you are among the millions who are currently experiencing the condition known as insomnia, this movie will help. Avoid drinking alcohol while watching Solaris this may cause side effects like waking up! This so called movie is one of the worst one Clooney has ever made.

280,goacher,"An Outstanding, Stimulating Film",10,28 February 2005,"One reviewer wrote that the basic plot is aliens appearing as human beings on a spaceship in the hope they will be taken back to earth. This is overly simplistic and displays a lack of understanding (midway through the film, when the main character wondered the reason behind the ""alien"" causing these people to appear on the ship, it was pointed out to him that his mistake was to assume that the alien needed a reason to do what it was doing). The ""alien"" is merely incidental to the basic plot of the film which is, in fact, centred around a man's struggle to come to terms with a personal trauma in his life and the desire to turn back the clock and have things turn out differently.I thought this Solaris remake was an outstanding film - even better than the 1972 original. My beef with the 1972 version was that there was no depth or explanation behind the particular apparitions appearing on the ship - who was the boy? Why did the main character behave in such a way towards his ""visitor"" and what was behind his ""visitor""'s behaviour? The updated version of the film answers those questions by giving an insight into the background of the main character and his ""visitor"", and the film is all the richer for it. Some people might claim this background information makes the film slow-moving; for me, it's essential to the enjoyment of the movie.Don't let the appearance of George Clooney put you off either. OK, he overacts at times but otherwise this is his finest acting performance. The direction and the musical score are superb, all adding to the atmosphere.If you want fast-moving action, comedy or a ""feel good"" experience, go elsewhere - if you want to watch a stimulating and thought-provoking film, based on a struggle and desire that many of us feel but rarely discuss, watch Solaris.",Solaris

I have read Solaris, really this film is a riff on Solaris, and not a true adaptation of the book. It takes one aspect of Solaris and goes with it for the whole film, pretty much ignoring the planet altogether. Which is what the book Solaris is really about. But as a stand alone film, it is great. I was moved, there are some very emotional scenes and there are some uncanny creepy scenes. The acting is great, the sound, sets, colours, all great. A good bit of cinema, but not a great Solaris adaptation.I think it is a good film, but I also agree with Stanislaw Lem (author of Solaris) who called this film ""love in outer space"", honestly yes, it is, and it's good!",Solaris
282,Ken K.,"Welcome to real, classic science fiction!",10,29 November 2002,"In the annals of science fiction films, there are a few types:  horror stories transported to space (Alien and the assorted knock-off's), space operas which are nothing but Westerns (horse operas) transported to space (Star Wars, Star Trek lately, ...) and then, real science fiction, which usually deals with ideas and concepts (2001, 2010, The War of the Worlds, Planet of the Apes, etc.) in space or a futuristic setting.  Welcome to the latter.  Its' origin derives from the brilliant science fiction novel of Stanislaw Lem.  The almost three hour Russian version is an incredible film in its own right.  Steven Soderbergh has also crafted an excellent film from this material.  Although both versions utilize Stanley Kubrick's techniques from 2001, Steven's current film more directly pays homage to Kubrick with the setup of some scenes and music directly taken from the film.  This film is not for everyone.  If you are going to see this because you want to see aliens bursting out of chests, laser gun battles or even just George Clooney's naked butt, stay home.  You will be disappointed and may embarass yourself like the person at the end of the showing I attended, where a gentleman was talking in a loud voice about how the movie stank, in direct contrast to those who clapped at the end.  This is a sophisticated, psychological exploration into the human mind...and maybe not just the human mind.  Excellent acting by George Clooney and the rest of the cast.

This film raises questions like: What is the nature of life?  What does it mean to be human?  What is the nature of love?  There aren't any pat answers to any of these questions; this is a film that makes you fill in the gaps.The film is very quiet in places, letting a glance or an expression tell the story where words would only get in the way.  George Clooney gives an emotional performance that is matched by Natascha McElhone.  If you are looking for whiz-bang effects and nothing that you have to actually think about, go rent ""ID4"" for the umpteenth time.  ""Solaris"" is much more than that.",Solaris

286,harcher,Really beatiful and peaceful movie,8,14 August 2003,"Before watching this movie I had gone through and read many negative reveiws, most claiming the movie was boring or non-sensical.  So I rented the DVD with apprehension and tried to watch the film with an open mind. About 15 minutes into it I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was really enjoying it.  Possibly it was my mood at the time but I found the tone, the lack of background music and the pace to be very soothing.  In fact, if I had to name my favorite aspect of this movie it would have to be the lack of a sweeping soundtrack or background wash throughout the movie. And I would not agree that the story jumps around too much or is non-sensical.  I thought the flashes from the main characters memories made sense, anyway it worked for me.I thought the character development, acting and writing were all average to above average.  The set work and visuals were very good and as I mentioned above, the tone and pace of the movie really worked for me.  I also liked the story and the fact that I could interpret it myself and that the writer and director did not cram the correct interpretation down my throat.
This movie has no real action at all, no explosions and does not portray a classic 'hero' vs 'bad guy' plot so many will not enjoy it.  I would not call it my favorite movie but I would recommend it to someone who might like something besides action/adventure movies.",Solaris

Go see it if you want, but you had better buy the book and read it slowly. Don't forget that, there is much more in the book than in the movie. The book is a big adventure of human existence. It is ontological. In the book, the story emphasizes the role of live ocean of Solaris, a little god of itself, a tacit existence which deny all the efforts of manhood to communicate with it. The movie shows the ocean only from a distance.. but in the book, Kris touches it by his own hands.Poor Sodenberg!",Solaris
288,robrabbi,Odds are you'll hate this movie unless....,1,6 December 2002,"Okay first off I consider myself a reasonably intelligent guy. I love movies with lots of dialouge and would take quality acting over explosions and special effects any day. This movie does have some quality acting in it too and I thought to myself before I saw this that the movie couldn't go wrong with someone like Soderbergh at the helm. I was wrong.First let me tell you what I like about this movie. I thought the soundtrack was exceptional. I also thought Clooney did a great job. That's it.You see, I don't require my movies to have all the answers but I do like my movies to make you at least curious as to what the answers are. This movie has no answers, ends unresolved, and honestly, I didn't give a crap what the answers were. To say this movie is slow would be the understatement of the year and I think the people on Imdb saying how extrordinary this movie is are simply trying to show how ""smart"" and ""sophisticated"" they are by going against the majority of movie goers. I usually think the public doesn't know anything about movies (Godzilla, Wild Wild West, etc.) but this time I am going to have to agree. I have never seen so many people leave a movie FIFTEEN minutes into it! I made myself sit through it hoping that something would happen but nothing ever did.So, in my humble opinion you might want to skip this flick.

Only one person screams or yells, and only for a minute or two.  By the hollywood formula then, this is a bad movie....By the standard of intelligent and stimulating film, however, this thing is a gem.  It's not about extremes of anger or violence, but about the ways people live and cope with tragic and even blameworthy events day-to-day. Lem, like a sci-fi Camus, has found surprising qualities in the life right under our nose, and, in seeing them, we find something more real and telling than any description of people in more overtly painful, but much less likely circumstance.Some critics have complained about the ""artsy"" Kubrickian style of direction, but they are, in my opinion, only noticing the similarity of the sets to those of 2001, and the quietness of the soundtrack.  Soderberg uses the camera as a recorder of events as they happen, physically present with the actors as some non-character point-of-view, and he lets his microphones record, essentially, the ""found"" sound of life in the space-station. Soderberg's style then is clearly descended, not from Stanley Kubrick, but Robert Altman, and such a direct style is anything but artsy.All in all, I give this film a 9.  I never give anything a 10....",Solaris

It's not just SF, it's not just drama, it's so much more.But one advice, if you expect laserswords, pizza-da-Hutt-like creators, don't watch it. Don't expect to see a very happy movie, but one which leaves you with a lot of questions (at least, I had that).

294,alexandresobreira-12-509311,Terrible view of a good book,1,26 August 2014,"I don't know why people compare Tarkowsky's Solaris to 2001. Sure, that's what Tarkowsky intended. But while 2001 is the best sci-fi movie of all time, Solaris not even sci-fi. It distorts Stanislaw Lem's view of the universe and actually changes it around. Of course, many people think it's a work of genius by the way it throws philosophy around, but that's for those who like philosophy. I think philosophy is silly and overblown all around. Science (the daughter of Greek thinking - which I don't really consider philosophy in the modern, especially German, sense, but as a way to try to understand the universe) is the only form of thinking that's valid. So, I think that, although entertaining, both the 1972 Solaris and the book are rather silly in their opposite ways of considering the impossibility of humanity ever understanding the universe (which is obviously false by all accounts). That said, both are a zillion times better than this movie. Of course the decision of focusing on Kelvin's love life robs the film of all depth, but it goes beyond that. In trying to ""modernize"" the story by having Nasa selling the Solaris project to some corporation, you get the old and trite left-wing Hollywood trope of evil Capitalism trying to exploit nature as represented by Solaris. You don't get the actual core of the novel, which is the futile attempt of Solaristics to understand Solaris - and by extension the universe as a whole - but rather, as one of the Company (what a rip-off from Alien) agents say, ""the possibility of exploiting Solaris economically"". And the casting if abominable. Corey Feldman is, of course, the most ridiculous of them all, with his crazy gestures - and no, he doesn't use them here because his character is emotionally disturbed, he acts like that all the time, and I supposed he acts like that in real life too. But all the other actors are badly cast. Some have mentioned that Kelvin's wife - if forget her name now - is beautiful and renders a better performance that the others. But one of the key points of the book regarding her is her youth and innocence, in flagrant contrast to Kelvin, who is much older and cynical, which renders his shock at her return far more poignant. In that regard, Tarkowksy's casting is infinitely superior (also all the other points of this movie, silly as it is). In short, this is an awful movie. I tried to see it again today but found it almost unbearably embarrassing and boring. Stay away from it.",Solaris

That this is one of the most radical films about love that were ever made. To me, this is the perfect paraphrase about guilt, human failure, hope, final decisions and redemption. And in all this, Solaris resembles the only other movie which ever dared to put such questions and answered them the same way: Jean-Luc Godard's ""Pierrot Le Fou"". Especially the end of both films is so incredibly similar and, yes, radical that it is hardly to believe.PS: I only hope and pray that the studios will decide to finally release the uncut version of this masterpiece which is about twice as long as the one that was released on DVD.",Solaris

297,lspijker,A more accessible version of Solyaris (1972),8,24 April 2005,"I think Solaris is a very good film over the human mind, our longings, conscious and permanent state of not knowing. This version of Steven Soderbergh is more easily digestible than the original of Andrei Tarkovsky, it is more polished, and the long monotonous scenes of the 1972 are either cut or shortened. However, it is still a very interesting film about the human mind, how we mistake love for an attachment to previous memories of a person, how we project those feelings for some experience in the past on a new 'love', failing to see what it is: a product of our imagination. I would certainly recommend to see this version first, and if you like it, if it makes you think, then please, go and see the original of 1972 as well.",Solaris

I have not read the novel on which the film is based and I have watched Tarkovsky's version twice (because it demands it), but by judging this 'Solaris' on its own merits, I think this version is simply a load of old plop. Here's why: this version concentrates almost entirely on the love story at its centre and to carry its ideas through successfully, the relationship at its core has to be believable - which it clearly isn't. There is simply no chemistry at all between the two leads; I've seen more sexual sparks created between Shaggy and Scooby. And whilst George Clooney is competent enough - he's certainly no Donatas Banionis. And the casting of Natasha McElhone is a complete disaster. Why that irritating smug grin throughout the film? A futile exercise in wasting everyone's time and money. Avoid.",Solaris

I'm not going to say how many times I have watched it, but ever so often I get this ""I need to rent Solaris Again"" feeling. I can't think of another extraterrestrial or alien or whatever you want to call it movie that I've been more affected by than this one (""Sphere"" was headed in this direction, but got lost on the Interstate). This statement, in and of itself, is a spoiler of sorts, I 'spose.It's a remake, but, though I really enjoyed the original, I feel no qualms about saying that I much prefer this rendering of the story. Imagine a hauntingly beautiful woman who's very distant, versus a hauntingly beautiful woman who's way up close to you, but also quite distant. There are quite a few spots where it strikes the chords of old sci-fi themes a little harder than its predecessor does, but I believe that's a good thing. At the very least, it's great to have both treatments. The things suggested in this movie are not cloaked, over-much, in Mystery and they aren't lingered over. The look on Cloonie's face when he speaks those lines, though: ""I woke up and you were here."" It's like he understands that he's in over his head, but doesn't want to get away, really. Who, faced with the return of a lost Beloved (especially given the details of Chris' ""loss"" of Rheya), could stand flushing her into the Vacuum over and over again?Chris is clever and knows a bit about the psyche, but in his way, he's about as irritating and banal as the gum-popping Snow.

300,Potzdorf,Brilliant!,10,29 November 2002,"What can I argue that hasn't been mentioned in other users' comments? Basically it boils down to this.  There's music.   Beethoven, Mozart, Bach as compared to Eminem, NSync, Faith Hill.  There's literature.  Voltaire, Dostoevsky, Hugo as compared to Grisham and Clancy.  And there are movies like Solaris as compared to Eight Crazy Nights, the Sum of All Fears, and Sweet Home Alabama.  General audiences don't like Solaris basically because it's something foreign to them, they can't understand it therefore they don't like it.  I'm sure many of the audience members also couldn't sit through an entire sitting of a Bach concerto or even a Chopin polonaise.  it would bore them.  They just can't appreciate the complexity and richness of the work.  It doesn't entertain them like a rap or pop song with a strong beat does.  Same with books.  You think these people that walk out on this movie could sit through 1000 pages of Tom Jones, one of the best satires on aristocracy ever written?  Probably not.  Too bad American culture is being dumbed down.  American art and entertainment I feel aims for a more straightforward approach, resulting in a melodrama paradigm, granted that there are attempts to obtain a more esoteric approach to film as demonstrated by the overrated Minority Report (still a good film, just overrated), however Solaris just completely supercedes this and others.  A brave attempt on Soderbergh's part to develop a more ""European"" film technique.  I've seen the original Tarkovsky version and didn't like it as much as this remake, and this coming from someone who absolutely loves Andrei Rublyov and Stalker (go figure).  Why do American students find English and art classes so boring?  They have to study the classics, they have to read shakespeare, they have to listen to composers much more difficult to appreciate than Dave Matthews.

The sense of loneliness of the Solaris station, the bewilderment of it's crew and the strange things that happen there are presented by clean, steady pictures and narrated by one of the most original soundtracks I've ever heard. George Clooney gives a great performance so as Natascha McElhone, cast perfectly for the role of Rheya. Sometimes she has this extreme, edgy, almost hypnotic look and a penetrating glance that can send shivers down your spine. She's absolutely fascinating.

I guess Soderbergh figures he's a bigger name than Lem or Tarkovsky, and so all the groundwork they laid is inconsequential. This was a very bad film. We're talking ""Highlander 2"" bad here. Here's another film that makes that most unforgivable of errors in science fiction, as it made it all pretty damn boring.

That's one of the best science fiction movies of all time, right up there with 2001. Get past the subtitles and watch a vastly superior and much more intelligent science fiction opus than anything George Clooney could have possibly acted in.",Solaris
310,fimetic,.....did I just dream this? Hell I know I liked it whatever!,8,21 December 2005,"Steven Soderbergh, it seems to me, can direct just about anything (book, play or just an interesting idea) and make the best of what it has to offer. Solaris has a lot to say and maybe a little too much for some us. It is never just entertainment, it has much more to offer. Sometime ago I read an article about dream states. The main idea of this article was that we are all of us living in a dream; and all living matter is in a dream state peculiar to it's own species and indeed peculiar to each individual within that species. Something of this idea is being worked out in Solaris. Death does not end the existence of an individual but simply transfers him or her to a different dream state. One of the questions which this raises (if you accept the validity of the 'dream' state idea) is which of these dream states may, with authority, consider itself to be the ascendant state; is any of these states entitled to consider itself the one which is the sole arbiter of truth regarding the nature of existence. Solaris, somewhere out there - where doesn't matter, is a planet which has the power to allow individuals in different states of 'being' to see and contact one another with all the attendant confusion that this obviously brings to all parties on both sides of the existence/dream barrier. This moves on to pose many more questions and dilemmas e.g. does time continue upon changing states? If it does is it synchronous with all other dream states? Etc. This film isn't really just a sci-fi flick or for that matter, a romance it's in a category that's other than that. Decide for yourself what and where it is. Soderberg floats my boat. Always has. If you're a fan too this one's for you.",Solaris
311,masona,Waiting to be entertained? You're missing the point.,9,19 May 2004,"There's an old maxim about music that goes: ""All music is sound, but not all sound is music."" In a way, what this says is: one should remember the intent of something before judging its worth. In the case of cinema, it can be re-written as, ""All movies are films, but not all films are movies."" By this, I point to the distinction of 'movie' as a piece of filmed entertainment and 'film' as a work intended more as a creative expression with less emphasis on entertainment value. So enters Solaris.Firstly, Solaris is not a re-make of the Tarkovsky film. It is merely another interpretation of the original novel. Comparing the two films is like comparing two brothers, not a father and a son. This may seem incidental but is important when justifying the originality of each film and the lineage. Soderbergh's Solaris is, to me at least, a pure meditation on loss. It is slow but only so slow as to let the viewer react to the events, place them in their own lives, tally their effects and then place themselves back into the film. It pulses slowly and quite intentionally. To call it boring is merely to admit a lack of connection with it.Solaris is a work so specifically personal that it either destroys you or bounces off like a ping-pong ball with little ado. This is probably why Solaris is consistently either the most profound film many have seen or the most boring film many have seen. Either reaction is justified because what you get out of the film really depends on what you bring into the film.If you've ever had anyone close to you die in a way that left a mass of unresolved issues, this film addresses what is likely your greatest fantasy: what if they could come back? If you have had a great love that simply ended and you were never sure why, the film presents an allegory for what it would be like to have that again. If you live in dreams of a former life and the memories of a greater happiness in your past, the film is a vicarious journey back. What differentiates this from other films in a similar vein is that it takes place in the present. There is no time traveling involved. Characters are not transported back to their childhood to witness exactly what their past was like as a complete and entire world. It operates in reverse by sending a manifestation of the past into the brutal light of the present. This is what makes Solaris' take on remorse and lament so profound.Solaris doesn't so much celebrate fantastical second chances in life as it does brutally beg the truth of the past from the cradle of the present. Many lament the past as a greater time because it is a closed case. Where the present breeds uncertainty for the future, the past is a set, stable environment. We can choose to remember only the best qualities of someone and this inevitably snowballs into a perfect version of that person living exclusively in our own private past. Solaris brings such a person back from the dead and forces its lead character to remember why they died in the first place (sorry for being vague, trying not to be a plot spoiler.) It is not a rose-colored reality but a brutal reminder.If you can't relate to anything like this, well, this film probably just isn't for you. If you can relate to it, Solaris could send you on a pretty intense roller-coaster of emotions.I also feel that Soderbergh's Solaris is a stylistic masterpiece. Beautiful, original camera-work, set design, etc. Cliff Martinez's soundtrack is even better than his work on the film Traffic. Aside from my own personal emotional reaction to the film, I also feel it is a solid, unique piece of film-making and worth seeing.",Solaris
312,darth87,What if the Creator is me,9,11 December 2002,"--Spoilers below--The popular theme of `I am God' is taken to extremes in Solaris. The movie depicts a world built upon a nihilistic point-of-view. In the absence of objective truth, humans are left with only their subjective perceptions and the entire life experience becomes an object of humanistic creation. Therefore, human existence lies within boundaries of the greatest aspirations and the basest desires, yet; the existence is constrained by the finite capacity of the human mind. The philosophy can be summarized as, `We cannot create anything greater than ourselves.'The corporeal visitors in Solaris come from the memories of a human host. Solaris seems to analyze dreams during sleep then creates the visitors based on those dreams and memories. The central character, Dr. Kelvin, experiences the Solaris effect via the visitation of his `resurrected' wife. She has been dead for years but Solaris creates her exactly as he remembers her-and therein lays the rub. As an extension of his memory she is more automaton than human. The familiarity of her physical appearance and social responses are comforting and intoxicating. Yet the overall experience lacks the lightness of spontaneity and serendipity. Dr. Kelvin becomes trapped in a `heaven' of his own creation.There are many other themes depicted in the movie related too this central theme. If you enjoy movies that require the audience to feel and think about what they feel--then see this movie.Best Regards, Darth87 December 2002",Solaris

Yes, I was expecting more and for the story to go deeper than it did. Yes, there was some confusing plot elements (who was Gordon's visitor? how did the other scientist die? what happened to the security team that visited? what drugs was Snow on?!) that become even more confusing when you look at the filming script available online which diverges greatly from what finally appeared on screen. Despite that, the film raises some interesting questions about what would happen if our memories became embodied and developed their own consciousness...do they have a separate existence outside of our mind? Can they grow or develop beyond the confines of our perception of the past? The film could have been much more and although people here say it was boring, I was dying for another 1/2 hour to go more deeply into some issues...things were wrapped up too quickly and neatly for my tastes. Guess I'll be hunting for the original Russian film next!Parting words: Go see the film and make up your own mind.

Natascha McElhone is a very, very fine actress, but I feel shewas miscast for the part.  It doesn't make sense why GeorgeClooney's character, Kelvin, would feel the way he does aboutRheya.  I certainly did not feel that way, and for the movie to work,McElhone has to give the audience emotional reason for Kelvin tofeel the way he does.  Well, McElhone did not do it, for me anyway.Too bad, everything else the movie has is a 10!  That is; the actingof George Clooney, Viola Davis, and Jeremy Davies is superb, theSteven Soderbergh direction is first rate .  .  it does not get anybetter, the ethereal feel to the movie was right on with the story lineand it is wonderful, the script was the best, and so on, and so on.

If you like actors who have presence, dialogue that makes sense or a plot that is at all interesting then it most certainly won't.My friend gave me this to watch 'cos he said he didn't understand it. That's because there's nothing to understand. It's a real excuse for sci-fi, and is really a supernatural love story set on a spaceship.

318,andyb-13,"magnificent, literate film making for adults",9,25 July 2003,"Magnificent! Soderbergh and Clooney have produced a literate, cerebral, adult film exploring the nature of consciousness, faith, reason, reality and love.In a career best performance, Clooney gives a deep and subtle portrayal of a man emotionally laid bare by the death and seeming resurrection of his wife played by Natascha McElhone.Soderbergh has deliberately gone for a gloomy, moody, restrained feel - think Seven with the rain but without the violence - and the lack of music to drive the plot along adds to the stark and brooding atmosphere. This is space as it probably really is - lonely, silent, exhilerating and foreboding.And talking of plot drivers, Soderbergh has obviously taken lessons from producer Jim Cameron on how to succinctly tell your story in what is little over an hour and a half, which makes a refreshing change from the usual two hour plus bloat-ware that usually takes up our screens.If there's one fly in this otherwise superbly made tonic, it's Jeremy Davies' tech/geek boy character. A cliched, hackneyed, attention- seeking performance of every over-mannered oddball that's ever been committed to celluloid.Make no mistake. We should be thankful to the filmic gods for the pairing of Soderbergh and Clooney for with fim making like this, they've proved they're on top of their game and there's room in corporate Hollywood for intelligent, measured, adult movies.

319,javvie,Not exactly like the original - but nevertheless worth watching,6,6 February 2005,"This movie tries to be faithful to the Russian original from 1972 (based on the story by Stanislaw Lem). The story is nearly the same - an astronaut is asked to find out what has happened on a space station that orbits the planet Solaris. As soon as he arrives on the station, he is confronted with unbelievable events that make him question reality. While Andrej Tarkowsky's version was a pure art film, with long shot sequences and a meditative touch, Sonderbergh speeds up the storytelling a lot. He focuses on the issue of a lost love, and gives the story a different outcome concerning that point. Nevertheless, he still uses some of Tarkowsky's filming techniques, like extended tracking shots and the direct glance of actors into the camera. If you like to see a film that puts up more questions than it answers, then see Solaris by Sonderbergh. If you approach it with an open mind, you'll enjoy it. Then you should give the original a try.",Solaris
320,shoddy,"Slick, sparse, psychological sci-fi",5,18 May 2004,"'Solaris' does get lots of things right. It faithfully recreates the cold, lonely, brooding atmosphere of the remote space station, rendered in cold colours, bare metal and harsh, industrial background noise. The characters are well played with what little dialogue there is. The soundtrack is subtle and complements the feel of the film. The alien planet is beautifully rendered, in fact it's visually the most colourful and complex thing in the whole film, with pulsating colours and strange, wispy cloud formations.The reason 'Solaris' probably invokes such strong reactions is that it doesn't insult the intelligence with explanations, but leaves the viewer to fill in the gaps, of which there are plenty.My main criticism of it (as a 'mainstream art-house' film) is that it is possibly a little too slick. Everything about it is visually perfect, from the planet itself to the gratuitous, crowd-pleasing Clooney butt sequence. I would prefer to have seen a little 'Alien' style grubbiness, given the dysfunction of all the film's characters. This is scant criticism for such an ambitious project and I think Soderbergh has struck a happy medium between philosophical musing and a good old-fashioned love storyI also found that the sparseness of the film doesn't leave much to be savoured on subsequent viewings.Open your mind. 6/10",Solaris
321,kimchimofo,another remake?,7,12 August 2006,"I guess the rule these days are, if you're going to remake a film, make sure it's clever and it looks good. It's hard to argue with this version of Solaris on either grounds.The plot is not a direct copy of the original, which may or may not be more or less accurate as I haven't yet read the book, suggesting that Soderbergh may have interpreted the story in his own way. He proves that he's clever and can write a good story, though this version seems to provide the reader with more ""what if?"" details whereas the original seems to allow the viewer to ask these questions on his or her own.Maybe we are getting dumber these days ... remakes don't seem as smart as their originals.Soderbergh (as Peter Andrews) also shoots one heck of a film. In fact, I didn't know that Andrews and Soderbergh were one in the same until I saw the credits for Solaris and thought I'd seen his shooting style before. Sure enough, he also shot Ocean's Twelve, which in my opinion might be one of the more beautifully shot American films in recent days. Too bad the movie was typical Hollywood fare. It was clever and looked good. Of course I liked the original Ocean's Eleven better as well.So, while I don't think I'll be watching this update over and over again looking for new meaning as I have the original, this film made an excellent Saturday-afternoon-on-the-couch-view-once-veg-out flick, and it's finally inspired me to read the book.The original? I'm still somewhat speechless about it. See it for yourself, struggle with the meaning. Think about what you might do.Just make sure to see the original!!!",Solaris
322,Credo_Quia_Absurdum,Beyond usual sci-fi,8,13 February 2009,"The first time I saw this movie, I hated it. I initially gave it a 4/10 in here on IMDb. The fact that I had read Stanislaw Lem's novel prior to viewing Steven's cinematographic version led me to be quite ""enraged"" at the various modifications made in the overall story. I must say that I was expecting a ""typical"" sci-fi movie and that I wasn't aiming for a love story in the first place.The second time, I enjoyed it. I changed my note to 6/10. After reading the book again in between both viewings of the film, I realized that this movie had been made this way willingly and not by mistake. I also realized that although it was different from the book in many ways ( including Solaris's appearance ), it was digging deeper into the psychological aspect of the characters than I had previously thought. Even Lem had not been able to do that in such a way.The third time, I simply loved it. I finally gave it 8/10 ( which is outstanding to me ). Like many people in here, I must have been distracted by the fact that George Clooney is in it, since he is a very famous actor and sometimes acted in horrible movies ( Batman ). I came to realize that Clooney truly outdid himself in Solaris and that all the other actors are putting an amazing performance as well. The cinematography is so beautifully done that no one can truly enjoy it through a single viewing. The soundtrack is perhaps the thing I've missed the most while I first saw this great piece of filmatography. The music is an actor itself - it remains the same, yet it changes its shape, color and tone, following the emotions represented by the images it accompanies. There is something in Soderbergh's vision of Solaris that is more otherworldly than all the sci-fi movies. Even Stanislaw Lem's original Solaris sometimes fails to describe, even with words, something similar to Steven's Solaris. Because of this, I believe Solaris not only is different - it stands alone from both the older adaptation and the book itself. It's something else.Clooney's performance which I initially saw as empty and lacking true emotion for a ""sci-fi romance"" turned out to be exactly what I just said - but in a good way. Kelvin, the character played by Clooney, is an empty shell. He has no reason to enjoy life. All that is dear to him is lost. He has no beliefs, no dreams, no hope. He comes to Solaris not as an explorer about to discover another planet with an open mind ready to plunge into the unknown with intellectual avidity, but as a professional doing his work as a psychologist, not even caring about Solaris. His love for what he believes is his loved one is not true love for it died with him on Earth. All that he cares about is the physical presence of his girlfriend and not her as a whole. In this perspective, he is indeed acting as an empty man with no real emotions and thus, he accomplishes something very few actors can actually do.This movie will always have its detractors for a reason that is also a paradox: it's the complexity of the movie that makes it simple looking to most. Many people fall in love without asking themselves what love truly is. They can live this way for a lifetime and enjoy life without problems. Solaris, however, explores love in a deeper, darker way and those who are not able to see complexity and imperfection through love will not understand the many scenes in this movie involving Kelvin and Rheya. What is love? Is it being one through sexual contact? Is it sharing thoughts, emotions and words with our mate? Or is it something else, something we have yet to discover? Most people disliked this movie because of its lack of usual science fiction elements - aliens, for example. The funny thing is that they are making the same mistake Kelvin does while not figuring out what Solaris truly is. It's all there. We, the human beings, are the aliens, for we do not even know who we truly are and what we are capable of. Kelvin cannot see Solaris in a way other than as a planet just like many people cannot see this film as something that is other than a sci-fi movie.With this in mind, I encourage you to view Solaris at least twice in a lifetime. Who knows, perhaps will you see this movie in a new light next time you see it - a purple and pink light, that is. ;)",Solaris
323,startanned,A Masterpiece!,10,11 September 2005,"I'd wager that most Sci-Fi fans won't like this movie, because while it IS a Sci-Fi, it's NOT a Sci-Fi. It's also a profound psychological exploration, a moving love story, and the jewel of this film is cleverly disguised in the metaphor of the story. When I first saw this movie, I didn't really like it. On a surface level, as merely a ""sci-fi film"", I thought it was slow and didn't make any sense. But on my 3rd viewing of this film just recently, the light bulb went on and suddenly it makes sense. This is now one of my favorite films of all time, a masterpiece. Icing on the cake that the acting in this film is superb, particularly by Natascha McElhone. Kudos to Steven Soderbergh for the courage to make this movie despite probably knowing that the underlying story would probably be lost by most of the audience... at least the first time around.

Like motivation for Kelvin's actions.  Whether it is the screenplay's fault, or if Kelvin's motivations are edited out, his whole demeanor is not convincing from the limited backstory we are given to begin with.  Add to that the sloppiness of subplots left hanging (mentioned quite well in other comments) and you are left with something that *could* have been great, or even good but which just feels empty.  Clooney's work is very good for what he has to work with, and Jeremy Davies is quite together for the not-all-together Snow.

The only blood you'll see is the trails of earlier happenings leading up to the events of this film. The slow, moody pace talks to them who likes to make journeys in the mind and not deep down some robot infested spacehulk.So what are the keepings of this film? Well...

But even though I did not feel heaven, I did find myself provoked to ask many questions, listen to many answers, and ponder them both.  Surprisingly this movie is gripping, especially with all the warnings people have put out to the impatient about being bored.  In comparison to many of the action packed crap put out today that is utterly more boring with their fiber thin plots and ambiguous reasons for creation this movie rises above the rest although it admittedly has a more methodical pace than most films, and I liked that.  It gave me time to appreciate the film before the credits rolled.The acting was superb, just superb around everything else.  A key line for me was paraphrased here, ""There are no answers, just choices.""  I was impressed and bought into Jeremy Davies character of Snow too, which may sound puzzling to many of you as it seems the majority feels he was an annoyance but I liked him.  Oh yeah, and Clooney and Mchelone were excellent as well, but I think there performances speak for themselves.Another thing that is almost necessary for a film to become one of my favorites is atmosphere, and this movie has it like a five star restaurant. There is just this feeling that is in the air, like it has jumped off screen and into the theater.  The ideas that are contained in this film, interpreted in any opinion, are truly refreshing and purely amazing from any point of view.  I would have to say as a gauge, if you liked AI there are a lot of similarities that would increase your chances of enjoying this movie as well.Not everyone feels this way, but the religious overtones standout in the film for me.  Whether it was intentional or not, or whether I added most of the overtones myself the planet Solaris itself carries more than just scientific weight.  And still more, there is a thoroughly convincing and deep character study about human relationships and the need for communication.  I especially enjoyed the scene where Clooney has a flashback of his wife and himself walking down the street, there was just something hauntingly emotional about it.  Steven Soderbergh should be commended, AGAIN!! for his continued drive to express something and his ability to make us think.  His vision and talent to the art form of film is something to be cherished.  I also found Cliff Martinez's score to capture each scene exquisitely and his music to be emotionally resounding.

Especially with the names Soderbergh and Cameron attached.  So it was with great hesitation that I saw this one. This film surpassed my expectations perhaps more than anything I've ever seen.  It's not so much a remake as a reinterpretation.  Aside from Out of Sight, this is perhaps the finest acting I've ever seen from George Clooney who until today have never been the biggest fan of.  Jeremy Davies is fantastic, and completly steals every scene he appears in.  Natascha McElhone is perfect in her role and has just the right amounts of sexiness, mystery, and creepiness to her performance.  The score  and cinematography are both excellent.  And perhaps most importantly (to me at least) they didn't go ga-ga with the special effects and sets. Granted, most people in the theater didn't appear to agree.  Several people walked out.  I blame this mainly on the way the movie was marketed. Think of Solaris as more of an ""indie"" movie.  It's not for everyone.  If you're expecting a mindless space adventure this isn't for you.  This is a very quite film.  There are times when there is no talking for several minutes at a stretch.

It was badly marketed with two different messages, as, A: A spooky sci-fi film! and B: A romantic love story! Problem: it is both those things, but at the same time -- you know, like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. No wonder no one saw it, and the few who did were bitterly disappointed. What Solaris is, is a brilliant and moody art film that uses sci-fi and romance clichés (A, something bad is happening in a far off space station; B, I miss my dead wife so much my life is empty without her) to weave a profound and fascinating parable of how people create the realities they believe in, and how that leads to a (chosen, not inflicted) life of suffering, a cross to opt to bear. Stanislaw Lem, who wrote the book in the 1960s and who was profoundly influenced by quantum theory, has written that he didn't want to see this version because it so much focused on the love story between Rheya and Kelvin, but that just seems completely misguided. Why would the theories he is talking about not address love and emotion? These -- like reality, consciousness, space, time -- are among of the defining forces of human existence, and they are perfectly at home among these more expected sci-fi concepts. Indeed, the parallels drawn between the love/sci-fi genres are what make this film such a brilliant, unusual and engaging endeavor.Here's hoping Soderbergh releases an extended director's cut, with more of everything in it (including the enthralling footage of the planet and station, together with Cliff Martinez's beautiful score).

But Tarkovsky does remain true to the novel's central sci-fi premise: that life elsewhere in the universe may have evolved along lines so different from life on Earth that we could never fathom it.  Lem's novel, then, is an extraordinary rebuttal of all the ridiculous, anthropomorphic sci-fi scenarios in which aliens appear as strangely familiar humanoids (often demanding to be taken to some leader, in English). The new Solaris strats from the original in a far more fundamental way than Tarkovsky did, shifting the focus from the mind-bending sci-fi premise to something far more predictable and far less interesting: a rather conventional tale (told largely through flashbacks) of love, regret, and redemption.  Instead of Lem's world-wide sentient ocean, we get a few shots of some neon clouds--and virtually no explanation at all of what Solaris is.  In fact, Solaris itself becomes so peripheral to the story that one almost wonders why the filmmakers even bothered to use the name. The film will probably come as a major disappointment to fans of the original (or of the earlier film version, with its unique `Tarkovskyan' style and atmosphere).  It will also disappoint the casual cineplex viewer who expects that since Cameron's name is linked with the project that it must be some rip-roaring rollercoaster ride rather along the lines of another Aliens or Terminator II.  (Thus ""miss...miss..."")  Yes, the film's quite slow, but the slowness is not enigmatic and compelling as in Tarkovsky; it's mostly boring and often unimaginative.  And the performances certainly do not redeem the picture.  One in particular (the `dude' who plays Snow) is almost fascinating in its sheer badness. The difference between Lem (and Tarkovsky) and the new version is nowhere more apparent (or disappointing) than in the ending. In place of the fathomless ambiguities of the novel's conclusion (`I persisted in the faith that the time of cruel miracles was not past'), we get a rather saccharine, allegorical happy ending.  `Cruel miracles': no, there's nothing remotely to compare with that.  The shift toward allegory is strongly reinforced by an iconic (and rather pedestrian) visual allusion to Michelangelo.  At the same time, I suppose, one could see the scene as an allusion to Kubrick's `Star-Child'.  Throughout, the film's visual style and sudden fits of Ligeti-like music owe much more to 2001 than to anything in Tarkovsky--and to say that the invited comparison is not in the newer film's favor is a bit of an understatement. The filmmakers seem to depend on the beautiful stars to carry the viewer's interest, in lieu of the braintwisting thematic substance of the original(s).   Yes, I enjoyed watching Natascha McElhone's high-cheekboned face--in fact the main reason I stayed to the end was to find out the actress's name (since there are no opening credits).  But that's candy rather than nutrition.  I strongly recommend--especially to those who have yet to encounter Lem or Tarkovsky--that you stay home and either read the novel or rent the earlier version.  Having done both a couple of times, I still wished I had made that choice.",Solaris

You put your next few hours into their hands.  But what happens?  You go and see Solaris.  And you are disappointed. You realize you could have been doing something else for the last 2 hours. You realize that you should have played with your child for those precious hours but you can't.  You saw Solaris and your time is gone and you are never going to see it again. You know the rest of the story.  Your children become distant and don't love you anymore simply based on the fact that you wanted to see a movie rather than take them to see a movie of their own.  You didn't want to see The Santa Claus. But you should have.  So take my advice.  Don't see this movie.  Spend time with your family.  Don't lose loved ones because of this horrible film. And don't waste your time watching this movie.  If you go see expect the movie to talk to you.  It will send you a message. It sends out a message the whole time, ""I am a good movie, I'm a good movie.""  Then at the end is says, ""Oh kidding, I'm a horrible movie. Sorry you wasted your time.

It wasn't artistic, it wasn't beautiful. It was a failed attempt at nothing. The music was boring as hell, the movie was INCREDIBLY slow moving and went no where.

336,JonesGambino,Better than most remakes,8,16 December 2002,"When discussing what is out there in the universe and beyond, people often bring up very compelling questions. Unfortunately, the most intriguing ideas about the cosmos haven't translated that well to movies, making the sci-fi genre a long line of movies essentially about blowing up aliens with lasers. There are plenty of great sci-fi movies, but few stray from the never-ending battle of human vs. alien. `Solaris' deserves attention not for the mini-controversy surrounding its rating (a publicity stunt by Twentieth Century Fox because they reportedly had trouble finding ways to market the movie) but for having a premise set in deep space that doesn't involve evil aliens preying on overmatched humans.In `Solaris', George Clooney plays Chris Kelvin; a psychologist dispatched to a space station orbiting the titular planet to find out what went wrong on a routine exploration mission. When Kelvin arrives, he finds that two crewmembers are dead, and one of the two survivors has locked herself in her quarters because of what has gone on in the space station. When Kelvin finally does persuade the reclusive Dr. Gordon (the excellent Viola Davis) to talk, she tells him that `It isn't really worth talking about until it starts happening to you.'Though `Solaris' is a deliberately slow paced movie, `It' happens to Kelvin after his first night on the station; he wakes up to a kiss from his wife Rheya- who died years earlier. More haunting is the fact that she is not a figment of Chris' imagination, Rheya (played by Natacha McElhone) can recite memories of the life she and Chris shared together without any help from him. Both Clooney and McElhone fit their roles perfectly. Natacha McElhone has an intriguing beauty and she uses it to fit the haunting atmosphere of the film, and Clooney increasingly shows the wear of an intelligent man who cannot comprehend the events transpiring around him, and ends up with one of his best performances to date.What drives the film is the originality of the story. `Solaris'was written as a novel by Stanislaw Lem, and first adapted to film in 1972 by the legendary Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky. Tarkovsky's is a sci-fi classic and considered by many to be the foreign equivalent to `2001: A Space Odyssey.' Steven Soderbergh (who won Best Director for `Traffic'- itself a remake) refuses to call this `Solaris' a remake, and contends that his film is simply a new adaptation of Lem's novel.Soderbergh's argument is credible, his `Solaris' is almost half the length of Tarkovsky's near 3-hour epic, his screenplay concentrating mostly on the relationship of Rheya and Kelvin.The 1972 version eyes the scientific morals of the mission, something completely missing from the latter movie. The 2002 `Solaris' is a chilling film with great acting that asks intriguing questions about humanity, space and essentially love itself. Tarkovsky's `Solaris' is the superior film, but unlike many remakes, Soderbergh's film does not disgrace the original.

I expected science fiction from the trailer but found it to be a boring dissertation in grieving for a lost love. In other words, it would best be characterized as ""Love Story"" with a space ship as its setting. In fact, I was a bit surprised that the line ""Love means never having to say you're sorry"" was not used in one of the flashbacks.

340,gsmishka,Intelligent but obscure...,8,8 September 2006,"Thoughtful, intelligent and touching, Solaris demands some patience although ironically one of its failings is that it is too short! It is almost as if Steven Soderbergh realised that this movie wouldn't be to the taste of much of the cinema-going public and didn't want to try their patience.I have not read Lem's book, but I am lead to believe that it deals much more with the nature of Solaris itself and less with the relationship between the two leads. This relationship forms the major plot of the movie and this is something of a problem - we are left knowing nothing at all about the nature of Solaris or the nature of the intelligence that it contains. Perhaps this is also true of the novel. I would have liked much more to be made of the idea of this as a ""first contact"" situation - how would one cope if an alien intelligence chose to communicate in this way? Instead, the story is reduced to a ""rationalism versus faith"" parable in which a man confident in his objective, atheist view of reality is forced to follow his heart instead of his head to exorcise his past.That said, there is much here to enjoy. Natascha McElhone is perfectly cast as the mysterious Rheya. She is just utterly captivating whenever she is on screen. George Clooney plays George Clooney as usual, but turns in a competent performance. Viola Davis and Jeremy Davies are less effective - I can't help get the feeling that Davis was cast mainly because she is both female and black and they didn't want a stereotypical male, white physicist. As a scientist, the Gordon character seems awfully keen to want to destroy phenomena that are both extraordinary and unique - falling back on primitive fear instead of cool analysis.The enigmatic Solaris itself is beautifully rendered. Living up to its name it looks like a movie sequence from the solar SoHo probe studying our own star. Prominences and what could almost be cascades of alien, intelligent thought sweep across its surface. We're not even sure if it is supposed to be a star or a planet or an alien being. Coupled with the sparse soundtrack I found the Solaris object to be hypnotic. And surely it was intentional that it looks like a human ovum in that final shot?8/10",Solaris
341,nathan-254,One of the best sci-fi films of recent years,7,24 September 2005,"Comparisons with blade runner are certainly apt in the case of this film, not least by virtue of its brilliant visual language, excellent acting and subtle themes. An eerie sense of mystery is maintained throughout, which had me gripped until the end. In fact I felt this film was at least half an hour too short, basically ending as soon as the central theme of Kelvin's desire to resurrect his dead wife - excellently realised by the two actors - is fully played out. I was disappointed, however, that the film failed to explore in any depth the presence of the other ""visitors"" on the ship, which did not fit neatly in to the ""life after death"" theme. Of course we are told ""there are no answers, only choices"", but I would certainly have appreciated a deeper exploration of the choices made by the other characters. It's one of those films to leave a bittersweet taste in the mouth; for example the decision not to include Gordon's ""visitor"" at all I found a bit galling at first, but in retrospect may have been a brilliant device. I would have liked to have seen more about the moral dilemma facing these humans in the face of the ""facsimiles"".Though the acting was brilliantly restrained, I did feel the script denied the humanity of the astronauts to some extent, and would have enjoyed just a touch more psychodrama. None of the characters appeared to take any interest in each other at all, and though this was certainly consistent with the powerful character of Gordon, and though Kelvin was understandably preoccupied, the incoherence of the third character was rendered somewhat pointless by the fact that the visiting psychologist made no attempt to do his job.While I would like to point out that simply visually suggesting Philosophical themes is not quite the same as exploring them, this is still an excellent sci-fi film that fits firmly in to the tradition of Blade Runner and 2001 and the original Solaris.",Solaris

The plot holes themselves raise dozens of questions but half-way in you stop expecting anything to make sense or tie together.  If you can make it to the end, you feel like you've taken a beating.The flaws don't stop there.  The sets are dreary and ugly.

Solaris is as devoid and sterile of genuine thought and emotion as its crash bang counterparts are.Mr. Soderbergh has made ""Solaris"" a post-modern love story.

The end scene said it all, what I originally took as flashbacks from a clinically depressed guy appeared to be in correspondence to reality, and what you really have is a love story with a sub story embedded inside.This type of movie would have been better left to story.

349,darth struction,Lonely and lost out here in the stars (very minor spoilers),9,30 November 2002,"Solaris is a throwback to the kind of film that Hollywood made for a time in the 1970s, but hardly makes anymore.  Although movies from the genre of sci-fi/fantasy have dominated the pantheon of blockbuster movies, this is not one of them.  Solaris is more like the anti-blockbuster; its commercial prospects are grim.  It's being marketed as science-fiction/romance film, but fundamentally it's about the human condition, guilt, regret, forgiveness, loneliness, the existence (or non-existence) of God, and our attempts at connection with our fellow travellers.  It reminded me of the Kurt Weill song ""Lost in the Stars"" about how we were created by God, but He's left us, abandoned us to drift in space.We find out during a dinner party, that the lead character, Chris Kelvin, is an atheist and doesn't believe in God.  Human relationships should be very precious for people like him, because once it's over, once you're dead, that's it.  A lot of believers are comforted by the prospects of being reunited with your loved ones in an everlasting afterlife.  Chris Kelvin doesn't have that luxury.  The movie suggests that human relationships are very fragile and also touches upon the fundamental impossibility of really knowing another person.  The best we can really hope for is knowing ourselves.  But we should try our best to look past ourselves and get out there and make connections, to alleviate our loneliness, and not take them for granted.  After he threatens to leave his wife Rheya in a fit of rage, she commits suicide.  Many Christians believe that suicide causes your soul to be lost and damned.  So whether God exists or not, Chris and Rheya are pretty well screwed.  One of the taglines for the movie is ""How far will you go for a second chance?""  Well, if you're Chris Kelvin, I'm guessing pretty damn far.I found Solaris to be similar to these movies:Vertigo (romantic illusions and not really knowing another person)Last Tango in Paris (as above, plus the suicide angle)A.I. Artificial Intelligence (meeting your maker, redemption, mortality)Blade Runner (as above)The Remains of the Day (regret, loneliness)If you liked any or, better yet, all of the above films, the chances are good that you'll appreciate Solaris.  If you hated those movies, Solaris is not for you.  This film is one challenging piece of work, ""slow"" and filled with ""intellectual"" themes and may bring out uncomfortable feelings.  If you're looking for action, don't go to Solaris.One of the year's best. (9/10)",Solaris
350,pigsflew3000,The film equivalent of a Sharper Image catalog.,5,28 November 2002,"I really wanted to like this movie. However, it came off like a Sharper Image catalog: glossy, slick, and full of a lot of cool stuff. On the other hand, I would never really buy anything out of a Sharper Image catalog. The visuals and sets are no less than stunning. The story - with its elements of love, loss, memories, and atonement - is a good one, though its execution suffers with some inconsistent points. Where Solaris falls flat is in its pacing and its acting. The movie presents itself as a thriller/experimental/sci-fi/romance/etc, but the pace never goes above a crawl. This sort of slow and atmospheric pacing works very well when done with style (Pi, for example, with its brooding intensity). In Solaris, it is mildly boring. The acting is cold and mechanical. Perhaps this is a statement on life in this future, perhaps not. In any case, it is very difficult to feel sympathy for any of the characters, as none of them are memorable enough to really get engaged in their lives or situations. Another very strange element to this film is its soundtrack. In the trailers, a sweeping and very cinematic score accompanies the actions onscreen. In the actual movie, the ambience is provided by an incessant steel drum and bell chorus. The same phrase plays throughout the entire movie. For the first hour or so, it emphasizes the isolation and repetition of a desperate situation; in the latter portion of the movie it becomes annoying. Cinematic scores are very stirring to provide emotional cues - they tell you exactly how to interpret the story. When done poorly, they seem intrusive. When done well, they subtly guide you along. If not done at all, it is a very rare movie that feels complete. Solaris is a bit difficult to review. After leaving the theater, I initially enjoyed it quite a bit. The more I thought about it, the less I liked it. See Solaris on the big screen only if you have the patience to invest time and thought in a cold and inaccessible film with some interesting ideas and great visuals. Otherwise, save it for a rental.",Solaris
351,IMDb_user100,"A thoughtful sci-fi movie, creepy, but without horror (spoilers)",7,15 September 2003,"Solaris is a strange, beautiful world, remote from Earth, which is being investigated by a survey team to assess its economic potential. However abnormal occurrances have plagued the team including the suicide of the team leader and the appearance to the crew of persons from their past experience, who cannot possibly be physically present (some are known to be dead) in the survey ship.Enter psychologist Chris Kelvin (George Clooney), charged with dispeling the problems/""hallucinations"", only to be beset by them himself in overwhelming measure when his dead wife appears, not once but twice (the first he ejects from the ship in an escape pod).The presence of physicist and hard rationalist Gordon (Viola Davis) does much to prevent the crew (and plot) from disintegrating into a babble of mumbo-jumbo mysticism. There are no detectable psychotropic agents which could be causing the crew to imagine these occurances. The beings rather, are constructs from the memories of the persons who knew them, created somehow by Solaris itself. As such, they are what the person who knew them thinks they were, rather than the original person. But very real enough. They exhibit an almost indestructibility (if injured or killed, they shortly self-resurrect), though Gordon develops a method of dispelling them using exotic radiation.While all understand with their minds that the appearance of these beings is undesirable (""What if this was to spread to Earth"" screams Gordon), emotion overwhelms reason and Kelvin is determined to hold onto this remnant of his wife, however imperfect. There are tense moments between Gordon and Kelvin.The ending is anti-climactic and enigmatic. It is Gordon who makes the decision to return to Earth carrying the rest of the crew with her (they seem incapable of any making any significant decisions). The crew don't fall into a senseless slaughter of each other, nor do the beings suddenly turn hostile. In the deja vu sequence near the film's very end, Kelvin finds himself on Earth and cuts himself (again) while preparing a meal. While attending to the wound, he is arrested by the sudden appearance of his wife. He asks, ""Am I alive... or dead?"" She assures ""We don't have to think like that anymore. We're together now. Everything we've done is forgiven. Everything."" They fall into a long, clinging embrace which dissolves into the image of Solaris, now very reminicient of an embryo.",Solaris
352,Loredon,Soderbergh crafts a beautiful and intelligent film,10,3 August 2003,"This is very simply one of the most beautiful and visual movies I have ever seen. Which is the very reason why it may not be for everyone. The movie tells the story of a troubled psychiatrist Chris Kelvin who recieves a message from his good friend Dr. Gibarian, who is a researcher on the space station orbating a planet seemingly made out of energy called Solaris. Kelvin travels to the space station where he finds two of the crew members dead, including his friend, and the other two acting very strangely. He then begins to recieve visits from his deceased wife who killed herself because of something he had said to her some years before.Seemingly being a science fiction film the audience might be expecting something very different from what they get. It is not an action movie but a film noir in the strictest sense of the word. The story is told more with imagery than dialog and moves very slowly. Though in my opinion the pacing serves to enhance the movie even more. The slowness will however chase away more restless viewers. The movie is also very thematically based serving to deal with such things as second chances, desire, love, reality, and god. Solaris won't give you anything in terms of where you go with it. It won't show you point A and point B and draw a straight line between the two. Instead it will give you point A and point Z and tell you to draw your own path with all the other points along the way.Really there is nothing I can say that will give you a correct picture of the film. This is partly due to the fact that it is so imagery oriented, and partly due to the fact that everyone I have talked to who really likes this movie has come away with a different meaning in it. I think it is best to go into the movie without any preconcieved notions about what you are going to see because I don't think there has been any movie quite as skillfully crafted in some time now.Definately not for the mainstream. Definately kind of a niche film. Definately a very deep and thought provoking movie. Definately on my top ten list.

355,BrendanKilpatrick,Hauntingly beautiful (CAUTION: SPOILERS),10,14 August 2003,"About 20 minutes into ""Solaris,"" I noticed that there were some strong similarities between this film and the video game ""Silent Hill 2"" (this is a positive comparison, mind you, but I won't get into a discussion of SH2 here). My friend had asked me to rent it, and to be honest, I was wary of it, at first. I had heard bad things about it, and was prepared for it to be truly awful. What I got, instead, was one of the most beautiful and tragic things I've ever seen. Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) is a psychologist who has ample emotional baggage of his own. He is quiet and brooding, never letting on the torment that is going on in his mind. The pattern of his mundane life is disrupted when a couple of strangers show up with an ominous message: Chris's friend, Gibrarian (Ulrich Tukur), who is in charge of a space ship that is investigating the planet Solaris, cryptically begs Chris to come to the ship and help them, never quite divulging what is wrong. Chris obliges, and before too long, has arrived on the ship. However, he finds that Gibrarian, along with one of the other scientists, is already dead. The only survivors are Snow (Jeremy Davies), who seems eerily detached from all the madness that surrounds him, and Gordon (Viola Davis), who is paranoid and suspicious of everyone, especially Chris. Chris is unable to convince Snow and Gordon to leave right away, unsure of what is going on. In the night, Chris is visited by the apparition of his wife, Rheya (Natascha McElhone), who has been dead for three years. Thinking it a dream, Chris awakes, only to find out that Rheya is all too real.As it turns out, Solaris, for better or worse, creates 'visitors' for the crew members of the ship, which are fashioned from their feelings and memories. These visitors are manifestations of guilt, of regret, of longing, and of love. Chris, blaming himself for Rheya's suicide, is unable to fully comprehend the idea that the visitor is not real, because he so desperately needs the second chance that Rheya's 'ghost' represents. Therefore, he fights tooth and nail with Gordon, who wants to destroy Rheya and go back to earth. However, Rheya's increasing self-awareness drives her to despair, as she realizes she is not the Rheya that Chris remembers, and therefore allows herself to be destroyed. However, the ship itself is in grave danger. Snow's eerie calm was a mask for his deranged state of mind...and his treachery causes the ship to be put on a crash course with Solaris. Although Gordon is able to leave the ship, Chris, upon rumination, is not. He is left behind with Snow to face whatever is in the heart of Solaris, and what exactly he finds there is open to debate, without a doubt. Whatever it is, it provides peace, love, and forgiveness for his tortured soul. ""Solaris,"" from it's gray, dark opening, to its beautiful, mystifying conclusion, is stunning. The music is amazingly haunting and lingers in your mind long after the last chord has faded. The visuals are stunning, and each scene is a work of great beauty. The clean, cold nature of the ship contrasts sharply with the raw power of emotion flowing between the four main characters, as they struggle with reality and unreality, and what they are and what they are not. The acting is remarkable, as well. I was a big fan of Clooney's performance in ""O Brother Where Art Thou,"" but his work here was amazing. Fantastic. He really conveyed the brooding and suffering plaguing Kelvin's psyche, making the role his own. Natascha McElhone is also wonderfully cast as Rheya. Her confusion, her pain, and her mysterious, evasive nature are all portrayed beautifully. Both of these characters elicit so much love, sympathy, and frustration, that it's amazing how much you find yourself caring about and mourning for two souls that are as adrift as they are. Davis, Davies, and Tukur all do fine acting jobs, as well, to their credit. Davis is the force of reason on the ship, yet somewhat ominous, because one wonders who...or what...her visitor could be. Davies, the manic Snow, portrays the spooky character perfectly. He's excitable, and hyperactive, to be sure...yet, he doesn't seem to be bothered by anything around him. Tukur, as Gibrarian, really enhances the scenes he is in. The scene in which he converses with Chris from beyond the grave is very haunting and is a particular stand-out. Rarely have I seen a film that evokes as much emotion or portrays as much beauty as this one. Everything, from the sets, to the effects, to the acting, music, and visual style, form together to create a work of near perfection. My only complaint was that it was too short!What happens to Chris when he enters the heart of Solaris? There is no definitive answer to it, but trying to find one is a great exercise for the mind. See this movie with someone you love. (Next time I see my girlfriend, she's being forced to watch this...I think it would have an even more profound emotional impact on couples) 10/10",Solaris
356,mofolotopo,What science fiction should be,10,30 November 2002,"This movie is a perfect example of how science fiction should be done.  It constructs a situation which makes us question our ideas about reality, and about what it means to be human.  It's a shame so many moviegoers here and elsewhere seem to equate good sci fi with action/adventure; we miss out on a lot of great stories like this because Hollywood thinks they can't sell science fiction without boobs and explosions.",Solaris

I mean how many times have we seen that? It's practically a genre in itself.",Solaris
358,Christian-Buchner1,"The movie tries to be intelligent and thoughtful, but in that it fails",4,17 December 2002,"It is highly amusing to see how this movie polarizes the critics on IMDB. Other critics were bored to death, others seem to have loved it. I  will take a more balanced approach.In my opinion, the movie could have been much more but some clear flaws make it mostly incompatible with the expectations of most people. Also the advertising and trailers made me believe I would see something much better than this movie actually delivered.The visual appearance of the space station orbiting Solaris (the planet or neutron star or whatever that may be) is great. This was definitely somewhat inspired by Kubrick's 2001. However this image is used too often in this movie. The soundtrack is unconventional and fits the mood and slow pace of this movie.Unfortunately the plot development is truly banal and in many aspects unsatisfactory. Here I have to agree with those critics who found those movie boring and uninspired.We get to see Clooney enter a space station where people have previously gone mad. Some committed suicide, others have been murdered. Obviously there have been violent fights on this space station. This is a promising lead-in and setting, similar to the movie ""Event Horizon"".So the audience is led into expecting a continuation of this violent theme. But there is no continuation of this. Not at all. So why did the movie show us bloodstains in the first place?There is only very few surprises in this movie. One being that everyone on the station is haunted by a mysterious visitor created by Solaris. This mysterious visitor is a construct of every person's most intense memories. So our antagonist's beloved wife reappears in physical form. By means of flashbacks and dream sequences the audience learns that his wife is long dead because she had committed suicide years ago.This unnatural visitor acts human and even experiences human emotions herself - yet she cannot possibly be human because there is no rational explanation for her existence. Also when she gets injured or killed she magically heals or reappears hours later. Slowly realizing that she is not a true human being she is getting desperate and suicidal.Still the antagonist played by Clooney misses his wife so much that he decides to embrace and accept that thing which looks like his wife. And all that is neither particularly credible nor logical. At the end of  the movie you will keep asking yourself ""Why? I don't understand this character. I don't see why he acted this way."".The other two remaining characters living on this space station hardly contribute to the plot development. This movie could have delivered so much more if this story had not focused so much on the banal love story element. The director should have replaced the banality with a bit more suspense, mystery and maybe some violence. Catering for the audience's expectations is a bare necessity: Either deliver what people expect or present the unexpected! This movie does neither.The movie tries to be intelligent and thoughtful, but in that it fails. All that remains is a terribly slow pace where people actually expected to see some terrible mysteries revealed. Overall the movie presents no answers to a lot of open questions.  I don't see how this movie got funding in the first place and was marketed like this - given the uninspired script.Rating: 4 out of 10.",Solaris
359,classicacres7050,Big Disappointment,3,12 August 2013,"I'd have to say George Clooney has made some not-so-good movies, and this one is one of them. I kept waiting for something but it didn't happen for me. The acting was okay but he and Natasha weren't very selective in their movie pick on this one. When I finally figured out what was happening (3/4 way thru the movie) it was too late to stop watching so I had to finish. I have over 2,000 movies in my collection but this one is not a keeper, sorry to say. I really like George and Natasha, but this movie won't be part of my collection. I keep hoping George will come up with another good one as he is a very versatile actor and I really enjoy his other movies...the one's I've kept anyway",Solaris
360,jtmudge,Quick summary of slow film,2,2 June 2004,"Solaris is slow and pointless, but full of painfully long scenes and confusing plot points.What else can I say. Steven Soderbergh attempts to turn an interesting idea into a 2001 style film. Unfortunately, throwing together a bunch of slow scenes and mystic images does little to make a great film.None of the actors involved are that bad, in fact, I felt them struggling through the material to try and pull it off. I am not a huge Clooney fan, but I felt that all involved gave it their best. The DVD even alludes to the fact that the actors did not understand what Soderbergh was doing, but trusted that it would be great. If you are still interested in this film, I suggest staring at a rock for 99 minutes as a good warm up to how it feels to watch this film.",Solaris
361,hypersynesthesia,Quietly electrifying,7,23 April 2006,"I should point out that I didn't see the whole film - I only caught the second half. But what I saw was extremely intriguing. Two things in particular struck me. First, the pace, and accompanying music; it's a film that creeps over you at an invisible pace, and the hypnotic music does a lot to keep you sitting there. As said by other users, the pace we're used to in films, particularly sci-fi - crash, bang, wallop, atomic explosion - makes Solaris a challenge until you settle into it, but the mesmerising, haunting music has a way of fixing you where you sit, while the film's essence seeps into you.Second, the film's interesting exploration of ideas about reality: the reality of the world and people around us, and of ourselves; the part our memories play in defining and historically preserving reality and the form of our lives. It's not a theme that could have been well explored in a sensational, typically 'Hollywood' film; the effect would have been crass and not a little superficial. The pace of Solaris - what I saw of it, at least - allows one to think about the ideas present while the film slowly unfolds. A line towards the end - I don't know if it constitutes a spoiler but I'll assume it does - particularly intrigued me: ""I performed all the millions of gestures that constitute life on Earth. But I was haunted by the idea that I remembered her wrong... that I was wrong about everything."" It's a film that takes patience and concentration, and rewards you with moving, understated performances, a feeling of quiet unsettlement, and hours of afterthought. I'd like to see the entire thing... as well as the Russian original, and Lem's novella.",Solaris

Gordon, the main scientist left on the ship, is fighting crossing over to heaven, but our hero, Kevin, finally embraces it.  The final scene is of Kevin and his wife in heaven, as conceptualized by the author.  All is forgiven.  Lovely space philosophy; I'm glad to see mysticism in science fiction.

363,Hero_Mike,What did this movie remind you of?,10,18 February 2004,"Spoiler alert!I read the book by Stanislaw Lem and it is a real heavy-duty sci-fi book. He gets lost in long sections of scenery and techno-babble but forgets about the ""heart"" of the movie.  This story is so character driven - and to call it a ""romance in space"" is no insult.  The movie is better than the book because of what Lem doesn't do, and Soderbergh does do.Rheya - Natascha McElhone's character - finally realizes she's not a real person but a ""creation"" of the sentient planet Solaris.  She committed suicide years ago and the planet creates her from Chris Kelvin's (George Clooney) memories.  The heart of it all is that she says to Chris that she is suicidal because that is how she remembers herself.  The great wisdom in the movie is when he realizes that he remembered her wrong, though he never stopped loving her.The great twist that they add to the movie is that Snow (Jeremy Davies) isn't a real person but a ""creation"", and right from the start of the movie there are little clues to it.  Sort of like ""The Sixth Sense"" but you only see it after you've seen the whole movie.  This one bit just blew me away.This movie is great - even for those who never read the book - and I think it would have had better reviews if it hadn't been George Clooney.  He's good, but the story really is the winner here.10 out of 10.",Solaris
364,sjaszczak,"Confusing, but excellent",9,12 May 2004,"Having noted that there were a number of mixed reviews of Solaris (some saying it was excellent, some saying it was awful), I decided I had to watch it to make my own mind up.And I have to say that in this particular case, I have to side with the ""excellent"" camp.  Solaris is a thought-provoking and emotional film revolving around a man's journey to the mysterious ""Solaris"" where he has to come to terms with the loss of his wife, and what Solaris might mean to him. It is certainly one that one can only come close to understanding when watched in one sitting.I thoroughly enjoyed Solaris, but admit that I was at times left completely bewildered.  However, this only came about by my own inability to comprehend what ""Solaris"" was, which I presume, was entirely the point.I urge anyone still sitting on the fence to watch Solaris again, with an open mind, and be prepared to accept that you probably wont understand what Solaris itself actually is.Amazing movie, and one that I will watch again.  9/10",Solaris

This movie is not a typical Sci-Fi movie, it contains sci-fi aspects, but its a love story at the core (and not your normal love story either). I personally thought it was an excellent movie, and everyone's performance in it was great. But I guess this movie is not for the impatient, since its pretty much all dialogue. I'm a picky person when it comes to movies that I support, and this one has it.

367,LookinGood,Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from Magic. -Arthur C. Clarke,8,20 December 2006,"I decided to see this film at the worst time, probably: Sick, in bed, sleeping 20 hours of the day. The day I felt a bit better, I decided I would like to watch a film. This one had come in as an add-on with the TV magazine, and I remembered seeing the posters way back in 2002 (for some reason I didn't go and see it then. Pity.). So, popped the DVD into my laptop, got my good earphones, and crawled back into bed. If you now think I fell asleep after 10 minutes, you are wrong. Despite my state, I was mesmerized. This is something I hadn't come across for a long time.From the moment you see Chris Kelvin (Clooney) sitting on his bed, head in hands, and hear the voice of Rheya (McElhone) in voice-over you know that this is not going to be a normal sci-fi film. You witness Kelvin act out the things of everyday life, making appointments with clients, holding group sessions as a psychologist, but you feel quite early on that there are demons from his past haunting him. Soderbergh also enhances this by keeping the focus on Kelvin, and having other people vanish into the blurred background, only leaving their voices to be heard.These demons are becoming more real once he reaches Solaris on his investigation mission. One of the most memorable scenes for me was the first appearance of Rheya. Kelvin darting out of his bed, hitting his head, trying to wake up and finally understanding that this is real and not a dream. Sent shivers down my spine. And while Chris loses his grip on reality, Rheya becomes more real and more aware of herself and of the fact that her existence is something ""unreal"". At first Rheya is only talking in formulas, but as the film progresses, she develops a new personality and we see Rheya (Solaris) becoming more like Rheya (Earth) again. And there are the two other members of the crew, Dr. Gordon (v. Davis) and Snow (J. Davies). Snow is...- weird, and Davies' creepy characterisation was spot on, IMO. You'll understand *why* Snow acts this way later in the film. The only person choosing reality instead of dreams, and incidentally the only one to survive is Dr. Gordon. She also is the one that ultimately figures out a way to get rid of the apparitions and doesn't hesitate to do so.There is another member of the cast that merits mention and that is the score. In most films, the score is either utterly forgettable or tells you the story in broad strokes and with thumping drums. In this one, it felt like a fifth character, setting the mood for a scene, and freshening up the atmosphere with a little splash of notes here and there. It also kept you in a kind of... trance-like mood in parts, thereby adding another layer to the ""reality or dream?"" question that permeates the film.Soderbergh took Lem's classic science fiction story and made something entirely different from it, but still a classic sci-fi story, exploring love, reality, minds and sanity.",Solaris

The atmosphere of the movie gives the effect that you are actually being sucked into Solaris with the space station itself. By the end of the film, you are hypnotised within the grasp of solaris and have discovered the ability to introspect into the literal situation of -- would you go actually go back to earth IF a lost loved one -- of whom you had something to solve from within them -- came back to you in all of their glory.

The cinematography looks really good, the acting is pretty good, the soundtrack is the best element (composed by Cliff Martinez), but the film just doesn't work. I would pin it on two things; one is the direction, which doesn't let the film flow and the way the flashbacks are incorporated didn't lead me to any revelations in the film. The second element wrong with this film is that you're not surprised by anything. In a film like this you almost need a reward for spending 100 minutes watching it, but you aren't given one, there doesn't feel like any form of redemption in this film for the viewer. If you want to watch a really good film by this director then look up ""the limey"" which is a very good film which, like solaris, deals with elements of love and how we deal with it when it has gone. In the case of the Limey it is between a father and daughter rather than a husband and wife.

Here enjoying the movie without knowing the plot ahead of time would be a serious impediment (I was lucky to have red Stanislav Lev story beforehand). I can imagine myself watching this movie over and over, and definitely plan to buy it on DVD when it is out.This movie made me think what is real in life and what is not, what is of value in life and what is not, what is a true life, what does it mean to be human, if there is anything after death - then what, what is God, etc. The multitude of themes subtly collide at the unusual angles under the surface of the seemingly slowly developing movie, which makes it difficult to get into. But if you will get into it, you may end up thinking about it - and about values in your life - for a long time, finding source of strength and inspiration.Most people in the theater hated it. I think it is one of the movie you hate the 1st time around and love more and more with each consequent time.

It started off with them having sex, and then they talk on the streets. It describes the couple metaphorically, but I just didn't see a love their. Why did Chris push her off in space anyway? Also, Solaris. What is it? Nothing made any sense in this movie. Alive peoples bodies dead on the ship. Like it made sense. The planet is Solaris. But why did they make this? If they are doing it for sentiment then they didn't get anything in response. It was lively, but was senseless. It was very slow. Deliberation was slow and very pacing. It's very uneven. It wasn't confusing; I just want to know what Solaris did. But what was its purpose? It obviously did something to create a memory person. But how. The reason why I mostly hate it is because there are too many unanswered questions. And the whole premise and idea of Solaris is just dumb, not beautiful.",Solaris

To give you an idea that I wasn't alone in my opinion, I watched quite a few people get up and leave the theater in the first hour.  After the movie was over, I asked the usher if anyone had complained and he said 20 people came up and said it was the worst movie they'd seen and either wanted refunds or to see another film.  I think that pretty much speaks for itself.I hope Soderbergh doesn't lose his edge now that he's gotten so lovey-dovey with stars like George Clooney and Julia Roberts.

380,Kevin_K,"Call It Something Else, Because It Ain't Solaris",5,3 June 2008,"Having read the book before I saw this I though it was a huge disappointment. They completely missed the point of the story, which was philosophical rather than emotional. Basically, the movie took an awe-inspiring ""what if"" thought experiment - of finding a very advanced non-human intelligence (which, surprise surprise, doesn't have two arms, two legs, a body and a head) and the problems of trying to communicate with such a radically different being, especially when it doesn't seem interested in communication, and how we can relate to it with our own limited human experience, and squeezed out all the juicy intellectual bits. Solaris was supposed to be the real star of the story and the screenplay instead turned it into background wallpaper. All that was left then, was a sappy love story set in space. It is frustrating to think about the potential that was wasted. Mr. Soderbergh could have made a classic sci-fi film here, if only he'd made an honest attempt.The funny thing is, if I hadn't read the book I would have liked the film, because it is well directed and has a nice atmospheric mood. There's nothing inherently wrong with love stories either. Just.. call it something other than Solaris, give the characters different names, don't do anything to remind me of the original story and I'd say it is a good movie.

Mix the two and you have Solaris, a place where we can be tempted to believe that even the most profound and terrible loss can be redeemed.For what this film sets out to do, it does impeccably. The acting, pace and ambiance of this film do everything to allow us to reflect on, and be moved by, the themes that are explored: namely, love and loss.This film will not to be to everyone's taste because it relies completely on the audience being engaged and moved by these themes, but if you are not bored then you might possibly be moved to tears.",Solaris

You're hoping it's a set-up to pull the rug out from under you when you least expect it.  Sadly, there is no rug; the rest of the movie remains at this underwater pace all the way to its unsatisfying and hokey ending.The premise is intriguing enough, but little is done with it.  Instead of focusing on the thriller (unraveling the mystery of Solaris), the back story of Clooney and his lost love takes over.  This is dull beyond belief--partly because we know it's history and partly because Clooney's lover is a character that is so moody, aloof and unsympathetic that we really don't care about her at all.  What should have been one flashback--or at most a montage--becomes almost half the film.  And the wrap-up of the main story ensues without answering any of the mysteries of Solaris.  We never know why it does what it does.  There's nothing to spoil, here, folks.  Because there are no surprises.Then, as if the content weren't dull enough, they add insult to injury by filming the thing like a student film on a shoestring budget with unending tight shots and close-ups...as though they couldn't afford any sets.  With the amount of money amassed by the talent involved, this is not just annoying--it's unacceptable.  If it was an attempt at an effective use of claustrophobia, it failed miserably.  As does the film.  We were sold a sci-fi thriller with big names at the helm.

385,marievevir,An excellent and faithful adaptation,10,10 December 2002,"I am a big fan of Andrei Tarkovsky, and I must say I was absolutely NOT disappointed by the re-make.  It is an excellent example of how Science Fiction CAN be intelligent, and while not completely a re-make of the Tarkovsky film to the frame, and different from the book, it absolutely retains the spirit of these works, while adding a few of its own twists.I know that this film hasn't exactly set the box office on fire and many of the multiplex crowd are running from the exits clutching their heads in pain, but I have one question to North America...  Are we really THAT stupid?  Come on, this film merely gives us a beautifully ambiguous dream experience that is not all that dense beyond the fact that it is based on emotion rather than logic.  I mean come on, must every movie be so logical that there is NO room left for an audience to use their imaginations, and have FUN with ambiguity?  MULHOLLAND DRIVE was an excellent example of how recent movies can not give you all the answers and work.  But that film was embraced, and this one, because it was done by a guy like Soderburgh and features Clooney seems ripe for the picking because it will attract audiences that are only there to see a movie star's ass.Very silly for the marketing departments at Fox, who obviously had no clue what to do with such a beautiful and poetic film, that they handled the film completely wrong.  This film should have opened slow and small then grown with word of mouth, not thrown out with 2,400 prints on a Wednesday!  I know it is an expensive movie, but now they have killed any momentum it might have had, at least in North America.  Hopefully for its international release, a more thoughful campaign and strategy will be used.Overall, I couldn't be more impressed and pleased with this film, from the superlative directing, acting, cinematography, music and production design, this one works full force.And the irony is that it's not even HALF as dense as the classic film Tarkovsky made of the book years ago.  So if a simplified version of such a story is getting so many audience members screaming in confusion and boredom, how are even more marginal films going to survive?  It's getting more and more difficult to see interesting, intelligent genre films that don't feature kung-fu fights and machine gun battles between their new ideas.Guess it will continue to get tougher.  I am at least one person who will continue to support and love intelligent and progessive genre cinema.Hope there's more like me.",Solaris
386,Danthron,Beautiful,10,7 February 2005,"Just watched this again. I know it's popular to use Soderbergh as a punching bag for folks' unrealized filmic ambitions, and to venerate the also-excellent (intellectual, but sorely pretentious) Russian version, but a serious, unselfconcious look at this picture shows that it's a true work of art, and one of the best, most thoughtful science fiction films ever produced. I've seen it a number of times now, and it is a movie that completely understands itself, understands the depth of the questions it's asking, and pays respect to the audience in the simple, lyrical terms of pure film. Clooney is marvelous, and doubly so for overcoming his inherent recognizability. A lovely piece of work.",Solaris
387,ubostel,Inspiring and artistic - great movie!,9,12 March 2003,"All I knew of the movie in advance had been some short reviews and a brief look on the website. So I was really not expecting a science fiction spectacle like ID4 or STTNG. I guess I was hardly expecting anything at all. And this was good!I guess reviews and opinions have been somewhat controversial, I acknowledge that in several theatres people have moved out on the movie. Not so in the screening I attended. The cinema was packed with people (O.K. merely 150 seats), they were even sitting on the stairway! Nobody left during the movie, and at least half the people stayed until the very end of the credits. Now that is a scene I do not experience too often!I quickly agreed with my girlfriend that this movie was truly a piece of art - some 30 seconds into the movie. And we were not at all disappointed. I might compare it to `Out of Sight', another Soderbergh/Clooney feature that I like very much but actually many people do not. And of course some comparison to 2001 imposed itself. I liked very much how this movie challenged my spirit and provoked my thoughts.I am not going to recite the storyline, but I have to say I was deeply touched by the tragic of `new' Rheyas consciousness. Her urge to know what and who she was. And the sudden realization not to know whether anybody was `himself' anymore. Finalized by Chris' concern not to have remembered Rheya rightly.In no means this movie is fast paced or swift. It takes its time and gives the viewer time to orientate himself or - more likely -  to experience the disorientation of the characters. I was a little afraid the movie might conclude in some action feature shoot-out or similar. Fortunately this was not the case. The movies draws the complete circle back to the beginning and eventually leaves the viewer in awe.Finally I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the movies photography and editing. The focus/blur effects really contributed to center my attention. The choice of camera angels also did involve me so much more than the usual depictures of scenes. And the edited sequence of shots and scenes built just the right tension.A 9 out of 10! Really great, great cinema!",Solaris

390,joolztoolz,I thought it was very thought provoking...,8,30 July 2003,"********Warning Spoilers Ahead***************I'm taking it to be a message about our existence--what is god?  why are we here anyway?  what is reality?  There were obvious parallels to our own circumstances in that Rheya ponders her existence--knows she has been created by the planet--but doesn't for what purpose and cannot communicate with her creator.  I thought it had a 'spirituality' message--I even think I saw the old ""God in the Sistine Chapel"" shot at the end when Kelvin reaches out to the little boy.Also, maybe it was also a closer look at the human condition.    Juxtapose Kelvin's reaction at his wife's abortion, and later, shooting wife copy no. 1 into space. The message being your morality can and will change, depending on your circumstances.  I also like that Kelvin is human--and not one dimensional.  Its refreshing actually to see a bit of weakness in a ""hero"". I think that whole 'don't tell copy no. 1' stuff is hilarious.I liked the Kubrick-ey space shots--what else can you do? I'll think of them as 'tributes'--of course, the space station was the best and most realistic ever.  The soundtrack was good.I like that there are questions unanswered.  Like the 'formula' isn't that dead people from your past come back to life--cause Snow makes a copy of himself...we don't know what Gordon's visitor is, and doesn't Gibarian's son exist on earth?  Kelvin copies himself--so maybe he was a copy already when he got there?  Who knows?I always like sublety and get annoyed when I am hit on the head with the 'answers'.So for me I took away alot from the movie--the who are we and what are we doing here anyway theme.  They didn't attempt to answer the question--the whole point was to pose the question.  As individuals, we have to answer that one ourselves in our own way.and like the characters in the movie--its probably unanswerable.",Solaris
391,keyspoet,"Thought-provoking, powerful and evocative film",9,21 December 2003,"I rented this film, then did some last minute Christmas shopping. While I was gone, my husband watched the first half of ""Solaris"" and turned it off - twice. He then watched ""Terminator 3,"" which he enjoyed.After he went off to bed. I started ""Solaris."" Unlike my husband, I was hooked from the start, and thoroughly enjoyed being reeled in. This is what I look for in a film - a compelling, nuanced story, involving complex characters. Perhaps it appealed to me more than to some, because I have lost several loved ones in recent years, including my father who died three years ago today, and am therefore wrestling with the same questions pondered in the film. Or perhaps I'm just a sucker for a good story, deftly told.I don't think we would have necessarily had a better or worse film had Cameron written the screenplay, merely a different film altogether. I give him more credit than many on this board, as ""The Abyss"" is and remains a favorite film of mine, and only defied the laws of physics a few times. ;-) Certainly ""The Abyss"" is a quieter and more introspective film than the Terminator series, but then again, the films do examine the same themes. It might have been interesting to see what Cameron would have done with ""Solaris,"" hopefully sans car chases.Personally, I am glad Soderbergh wrote this version, as there is very little I would change. I enjoyed every minute of it. The musical score captured and enhanced the atmosphere quite well. I remember hearing about the original ""Solaris,"" which came out the year I started high school, but I never saw it. Having now seen this version, I'll make it a point to do so, and I'll read the book as well. I will definitely be adding this film to my collection.As for my husband, I probably won't recommend that he see it right away. Instead, I'll let him see it over time, as he did ""The Shipping News,"" which also put him off initially. Once he got past the move to Newfoundland, he began to understand the humor I saw in the film, but he still despises its more depressing aspects. Still, he considers my taste in films weird, and to date understands neither my love for ""Jacob's Ladder"" nor my devotion to ""Six Feet Under.""But then, he doesn't like jazz, either. ;-)",Solaris

394,anubis1138,Death Be Not Proud,10,14 February 2006,"To say that this movie surprised me more than any I have ever watched, is an understatement. Solaris is one of the best films ever made about the power of memory, the ways we deal with pain and the unknown, and how real love is transcendent.The music and visuals (especially of Solaris itself) are hauntingly visceral in a way I can't even completely convey. The cast is dead on perfect. The story is a very simplified, economic version of the original (which in this case works just fine) and deals more with the human factor than the science. It's a shame that more people couldn't get into this movie and disliked it because it didn't meet their expectations of what a science fiction should be; Solaris dealt with consequence, love, perception, fear, reason, spirituality, and death in a way that some of the most brilliant pure dramas have never even come close to capturing. This is one of the best sci-fi films ever made and hardly anyone seems to know about it. To call it underrated is an insult to an underrated movie. Solaris has been overlooked completely, even within the sci-fi community. Of those that did see it, many didn't really get what the film is about. (I blame the marketing campaign for that to some degree, trying to sell an action or horror sci-fi movie when this film was neither of those things.) They couldn't embrace the subtle, constant tension and unconventional, subversive, underlying themes. Spiritual science fiction is one way to describe it. A haunting, hard journey of man facing his memory, his ""sins"" made flesh, literally. Solaris is painfully insightful about relationships and the way we remember events and people to a degree that again, words can't capture. The end of Kelvin's journey is something that people can talk about again and again, trying to figure out what really happened to him.Did he ever finally get ""home""?",Solaris

396,iddavid,did the SOLARIS infection get back to Earth?,6,18 March 2006,"In the USA version, they have a space station monitoring an astronomical phenomenon (named SOLARIS). NASA is running out of money so they sell the project to private enterprise, which thinks they can develop the space-station into a resort complex holiday hotel.It turns out that the astronomical phenomenon, SOLARIS is an intelligent being, that is able to materialize the most vivid memories of the space station scientists. The dead person they were closest to. Referred to as the visitors.They don't know why SOLARIS is doing this, but obviously to try and study the humans that are there, to study 'it'.George Cluney's dead wife appears as his visitor.The twist is that the scientist that sounds like he is on drugs, is actually the dead twin brother (visitor) that ""SOLARIS "" created from the original. When the visitor appeared in front of his brother there was a struggle because they did not know what was happening. The original was killed and the visitor took his place without anyone knowing.The black woman scientist is experimenting on her visitor, locked in her room. She tries to find ways to kill her visitor, but the visitor is able to resurrect. She makes an energy particle accelerator that disrupts the molecular bonds that keeps the visitor intact (and also seems to resurrect them), so they can't heal.The plan is to pilot the space station back to Earth, but they must eradicate the visitors first, because they don't know what would happen if they went to Earth. They cannot be allowed to infect Earth.The visitor (twin brother of the drugged out scientist) who is piloting the space-station in orbit around SOLARIS, does not tell them that the energy particle accelerator has drained the space-station fuel cells and it is about to crash into SOLARIS, until they discover he is a visitor.The black woman and George Cluney only have minutes to escape in the small space ship that George Cluney arrived in.George Cluney imagines his life back on Earth and seems to be living it at the same time as showing us that he may have stayed in the doomed space-station.As he lives his monotonous Earth life, he cuts his finger and we see it heals by itself and then his dead wife appears. He asks the question 'how can you be here, am I alive?' They changed the ending from the Russian film, to give closure. Basically they stuffed the ending, because they could have edited it a bit better so that we did not know if he stayed on the space-station or travelled back to Earth. So his wife appearing at the end could have meant that he either died at SOLARIS and imagined he escaped, or he escaped to Earth but brought the SOLARIS infection to Earth.",Solaris

I read the book and saw the Russian film in my teens, but they didn't have the same impact as Soderbergh's interpretation of Solaris. He chooses to study a human relationship more than the science(-fiction) elements, we won't find out what this celestial body is or what it wanted in the end. Not that it'd matter. ""There are no answers, only choices"" as one character says in the film. I wonder if Aronofsky's The Fountain will be as heart wrenching... There are too few true sci-fi films today.

So he's a psychologist, and somehow, somewhere, mankind has developed a space station orbiting a planet. Where is this planet? How did he get there in under 40,000 years? Are all psychologists qualified astronauts in the future? Why don't we ever get to see the alien-vaporizer doohickey in action? Why do we have too see George Clooney's ass and not his hot wife's? It's very likely one or all of these questions were answered during this movie, but I couldn't watch it without getting distracted. From the start, I knew at least one or more of the people on the space station weren't real.It's one of those movies where the director and writers make everything confusing so at the end you'll be like, ""Whoa, what a mind f%&*!"" and then you'll watch it again so the pieces fall into place better. However, with this movie, it's just confusing, and it was so dry and boring that you really don't give a crap to watch it again to see if it makes more sense.Somewhat cool camera work and decent ambient music where the only redeeming qualities.

401,JoelB,Interesting but not really fulfilling,6,12 December 2002,"There are a number of good things about this movie, but ultimately it felt to me like a lost opportunity. It raised provocative psychological issues but never carried me away or led me to anything like an epiphany. In the latter half, I was in fact a bit bored. It certainly isn't enthralling like Tarkovsky's version. Rheya's character is better developed, particularly her own psychological trauma in being a ""creation"" (Tarkovsky's Rheya was something of a naif in comparison). But what I missed from Tarkovsky's version is the sense of humor (this one is stiflingly earnest) and the evocative and poignant use of Bach chorales in the soundtrack. The soundtrack to this one is intriguing (a la Brian Eno, Ligeti, and Thomas Newman's scores for The Player and American Beauty), but I eventually found myself desperately longing for a cadence. Lacking the feeling of redemption communicated musically in Tarkovsky's version, this one had to rely on ham-handed statements of fact. And finally, I can't help remarking that neither Tarkovsky nor Soderbergh really convey the element of shame and sexual deviance that played such an important part in Lem's original. Both place the emphasis instead on guilt, which isn't quite the same thing, is it?",Solaris

In fairness to the original, I should see it again, but based on my recollection of it this remake is much better.  Clooney and McElhone are wonderful.  Soderbergh should be well on his way to Oscar nominations for best direction and screenplay, and so should Clooney for best actor.  I was struck at how emotionally moved I was while watching this film.  I had tears streaming down my face at times.  This came as quite a surprise.The screenplay is wonderfully ambiguous.  There may be strong spiritual, mystical, and religious undercurrents at work here.  But, then again, maybe not.  I expect this film will generate a good deal of discussion. Without giving too much away, I wonder how many saw the reference to ""Adam and God"" painting of the Sistine Chapel?This is a fabulous film.

However if I didn't like the film, they wouldn't have convinced me otherwise.  Luckily the film was very good, both cinematically and with good acting performances. During the interview, both their comments on Solaris backed up what I had been thinking throughout the film.I admit that it could have been better with more background on the planet itself and what had previously happened, and was perhaps a little too short to do the source material justice. However Soderbergh's  focusing on the relationship between Kelvin and his wife, and his questioning of what was human, did really work. It had echoes of the similar theme in Bladerunner.I didn't surprise me it hasn't done that well in the US, as I can't name any other, non action sci-fi film that has, 2001: A Space Odyssey being the exceptionIn summary I'd rather see Sci-fi films like this, than any number of asteroid blasting gung-ho kill the CGI alien film, that purport to be Sci-fi.  8/10 from me.",Solaris

Forget re-make bashing and any kind of comparison - it's usually a pointless pursuit for trainspotters. I should know, I am one!I first saw this movie dead-beat on a plane back from New York, very very sleepy and was mostly captivated by the drifting music while I dozed off. That time around I was annoyed by the glamorous looking couple in the movie. However, I wanted to hear the music again so bought the DVD and re-watched it all the way through while wide awake. Now the whole movie seems like one long dream itself, haunting and beautiful. I agree that other movies, and the original movie and book, deal with philosophical issues at greater length, but despite being fairly cold itself, this is a film about emotions and is intensely visual. Lots of sly visual allusions to other films, including obvious ones to 2001, but that always was one crazy hippy movie!Anyway, I would definitely recommend this, 10/10, if you have time, and I agree with another commentator, watch it with your lover/partner!

I need to be sedated or put out of my misery.The most excellent s-f book I've ever read had been turned into... into... have no idea what it has been turned into but it HURTS. They say the movie is 'deep' and 'spiritual'. It could have been if it was something original, if it didn't happen to be based on the book so great and DEEP and SPIRITUAL.So, what was that bad about the movie? Ummmm. EVERYTHING?! 'K, no, George was fine, as he always is. He's not a good actor, he's a great actor but neither him or his buttocks could save Solaris. It died right before my eyes. *sheds a tear* Major SPOILERS to both the movie and The Book.God, I have no idea where to begin with, I don't really have a week to describe all that was wrong. Fine, the main issues would be it: First of all, the movie is a one gigantic chaos. It seems cut, jumps from one time frame to the other, there's no fluentness between scenes. I understand it's deliberate but it's more annoying than anything else. Plus, it really doesn't help that they cut out half of the book and then they hint at us that those things happened but we just didn't witness them. It creates a bloody mess, people! If I didn't read the book I wouldn't have the slightest clue what is going on! And no, it's not the typical 'if we showed it, we wouldn't have time to show the rest' case, because they have time for those pointless flashbacks and George's naked buttocks... ... ...ok, can't blame them for THAT.Yes, babes, they cut out everything about Solaris!!! What the ...!?!?!?! The book was about it, just look at the title for God's sake. What the hell, tight budget? If you paid George Clooney to show his naked buttocks around, I'm sure you could find a penny or two for some special effects. I wanted to see symetriads! And mimics! You just can't take Hamlet, decide that he can go and make the play without him. O_o Perhaps that makes me so angry. I LOVED SOLARIS - The Ocean, loved the theories, the musings, the mystery, the thrill, the unknown... but all I got was a dull romance/pseudo-psychological thingy. I had 4 favorite scenes and hoped that at least one will make it to the movie. It did not.Other things they changed? Well, that's the thing. Parts of the movie were fascistically accurate with the book, while lots of those so called Significant Details were changed. Names. They changed names. Why?! They changed sexes. WHY?! They changed Fat Black Woman into The Son but that I expected to happened. They TOTALLY changed the ending The only good thing, really, because I was not pleased with the ending in the book, seems like there was none but the fact that it turned that in here we've got A Hollywoodish Happy Ending made my stomach turn. The thing about the book was that from the beginning we were aware that Happy Ending is not possible and here? Oh, blah! Hahaha, know what really is amusing? Apparently, in the movie, the answer to everything is the fact that Solaris is alive. Well, in the book we find out about that on the 3rd page, we are just not sure what kind of 'life' is that. Is Solaris super-intelligent or is this some primordial soup? Is it the end of the evolutionary journey or just the beginning? Is it evil? Good? Can we even use those terms to describe it?

'It's Solaris, it's alive' 'Oh, that explains everything' *headdesk* I could survive everything, the changes, the ending, the chaos but I will never forgive them, that they turned such intelligent, interesting, fascinating and thrilling story into a bad romance.One more thing, Dear People That Turned The Book Into The Movie.Next time, if you get confused what the book is about, look at the title, it might give you a clue. The book was called 'Solaris' for a reason, the main reason being Solaris, which the book was about. The title of the book was not, I repeat, it was not 'How I Met Loved My Wife'. If it still doesn't help, TRY ASKING THE AUTHOR WHAT HE MEANT BY IT, OK?!",Solaris
414,bobbygreenwood,"Intelligent, touching, thought-provoking. Great cinema",8,24 April 2006,"There's little point in me repeating what so many others have already said well enough.I didn't know what to expect from this film the first time I saw it, but as the credits rolled I was left with that great feeling of satisfaction at having been entertained by a film that is deep, challenging, emotive and thoroughly entertaining. I took away a lot from this film and did a fair bit of pondering.Reactions in the room were mixed. One friend just laughed out loud with a look that suggested he just didn't get any of it, and had been thoroughly bored. I personally don't understand how you can't get this film, but it demonstrates that it's not for everyone. Then again, I know people who never once laughed at The Big Lebowski, so...Maybe it's me getting old and sentimental, but I found the interplay between Chris and Rheya, both in the past and on the space station to be quite beautifully written and acted. Through snapshots of their relationship and her growing recall of events leading to her death, you are treated to a subtly understated but powerful insight into their relationship. I found watching them through the flashbacks to be tender, touching, romantic and tragic. It's quite gently understated and softly underplayed by Clooney and McElhorne. For me, it's rare to be moved in such a way.Others have remarked on the great existential themes within Solaris, so I won't bang on about them. Suffice to say, this should be in anyone's collection. Show it to your kids and make their brains and hearts swell.",Solaris
415,pelotard,The best since 2001,9,7 June 2006,"Movie buffs should note one thing before watching Solaris: this is not a remake of Tarkovsky's masterpiece. This is a movie based on Stanislaw Lem's novel Solaris, and as such, much closer to the novel than Tarkovsky's movie. Tarkovsky could, at best, be said to be ""inspired by"" the novel. But comparing the two would be like comparing ""Star Trek: Insurrection"" to ""Apocalypse now"", simply because they were both inspired by the same novel (""Heart of Darkness"").Those looking for a grand space opera, complete with laser beams going Whizz and space ships exploding with ear-deafening booms, are also in for disappointment. This is a drama, which happens to be set in a fairly distant future. As with the best of literary science fiction, it is about people, and about here and now, although the story works by introducing elements that we don't have in the world around us today.The pace is slow, the acting is brilliant, the story is powerful. And the title of my review compares it to ""2001"", since it tells us just how utterly, utterly alien an alien world will be. The trailer actually says most of what you need to know: ""There are places where mankind is not ready to go"".",Solaris

I could see how some people may get hung up on the pacing, especially if you are used to shoot-em-up type movies. This is not a typical Hollywood plot, so it may confuse 7 out of 10 viewers. I thought it was a masterpiece however. Great directing, visually stunning, great acting, great emotional depth, and what a plot!If you like movies that are not predictable, that you can't figure out what is going to happen from the first five minutes of the film, then I would recommend this movie to you. If you are the type that likes very formulaic plots where there is a good guy and a bad guy, and in the end the good guy wins and saves the world, then this movie is maybe not for you.",Solaris

However, the film turned out to be very romantic, as well as intensely philosophical and beautifully shot.
Clooney continues to choose challenging roles and quality material, and director Soderbergh continues to prove his ""auteur"" status.  This film is entertaning while you are viewing it, and then it stays with you afterwards in an eerie, yet thought-provoking way.Overall, a fine film that may not appeal to the kiddies, but should please many deep-thinking adults.  Hardcore sci-fans should also enjoy this work a great deal.",Solaris

And after recently watching The Midnight Sky, I finally got around to it.Really loved this film back when it first came out and after watching it again recently, I can say for certain that it is on par with the original for me. Now I know that's going to draw a lot of hate, but it's just how I feel and believe me, I absolutely love the original Solaris!",Solaris
421,johansst-1,Shorter and more direct than the original,8,7 January 2011,"This is one of those movies that gives me that sci-fi feeling I like, more so than the original Solaris (or Solyaris). The reason is much because of the newer effects and visual appeal, but mostly because of it's shorter more direct approach, you could say more commercialised, which here I don't believe is a bad thing. Also for Solaris (2002) avoiding to elaborate too much makes Solaris (2002) more thrilling than the original.I have given both the 2002 and 1972 version an 8 of 10 stars. The original Solyaris is longer and the philosophical aspect is more elaborate, and I DO think it is better in many aspects. But for me the shorter more direct approach of Solaris (2002) gives it the upper edge.",Solaris
422,ScotWiZ,Interesting,6,31 January 2003,"I watched this pretty much straight after watching 'The Hours' so that may be the reason I did not find Solaris as boring as many of the comments previously have mentioned. It's a pretty cute film that tries really hard to be clever but without being cheesy. It asks a few questions of life that make you think... Theres a lot of questions unsolved in regards to the plot which are slightly annoying, might reveal more in the book I guess.
Overall 6/10",Solaris

425,GrahamRowe,Could have been so much better... (Spoilers),6,27 March 2003,"It takes a brave man to follow Tarkovsky's answer to 2001 and Steven Soderbergh is that at least. First, the good: the film looks beautiful and the score lulls you into a relaxed, observatory state of mind. The cast are attractive and the worst of the anachronisms of Lem's book have been removed. There is actually a resolution to the movie and it is far more emotionally literate than either of the originals. Saying that there is much that has been messed about with to very little effect other than to ruin the intended plot. The essence of Solaris (the book) is an exploration into Man's (I do not mean to imply gender here) method of scientific analysis and how fallible that approach would be for an intelligence that exceeded their own. The only meaningful dialogue with the vast sentience that is Solaris comes from Kelvin's unresolved regret for the loss of Rheya, his love for her and the transmission of his unconscious thoughts to the planet itself. In this adaptation (mega-spoilers here): - Solaris itself appears never to have been studied or visited and the whole idea of the 'living sea' is lost.'Coroporations' (very 21st century and totally irrelevant to the plot) want to own Solaris as 'a possible energy source'. Again, why? This is both impossible (Steven do you understand *anything* about physics?) and detracts from one of the central points about the book which is Man's pure academic struggle to understand an intelligence greater than their own. The entire space station's library in the original(s) were devoted to decades of study into the phenomenon of Solaris. In the mythology of the book the planet has formed whole schools of thought and analysis - all lost hereBerton is lost from the plot and his son becomes Gibarian's. This character then becomes the representative of the planet. Neither the book or the Tarkovsky version needed this device so why do we in this film?Snow (Snaut) has become an alien. Why? It was not necessary to the plot. The planet never knowingly killed before (Jeremy Davies is definitely vying for the most irritating portrayal of a character ever.) There are rumours that this film was butchered for theatrical release and I sincerely hope that this was the case!",Solaris
426,famd-1,Comments Stanislaw Lem's (and myself),10,19 April 2009,"What about the Soderbergh's film? What are the good and the bad points of the movie? Lem: l though I admit that Soderbergh's vision is not devoid of ambition, taste and climate, I am not delighted with the prominence of love. Solaris may be perceived as a river basin - and Soderbergh chose only one of its tributaries. The main problem seems the fact that even such a tragic-romantic adaptation seems too demanding for mass audience fed with Hollywood pap. If in the future someone else dared a faithful adaptation, I am afraid the effects would be understood only by a tiny audience.I read the book, and I think that in fact that book is about the unattainable, and inconceivable. More of the unattainable love, than Lem himself said. It is in the subconscious of the book. I really loved Soderbergh's film.It's about God too.",Solaris
427,metalistik,"Great Novel, Great Movie A+",5,28 December 2002,"The movie was great. Soderberg made a great film. I love the eeriness and the slow movement of the film. This movie has done a very good job of capturing the mood of the novel. I read quiet a few reviews here that are crying about the movie being slow and hard to understand. If you want an easy to watch sci fi film , go see Nemesis (not to say that Nemesis is a not a great movie, it is). Then there are those of you who start dissing the novel. Solaris is considered one of the greatest sci fi novels of our time, so to call it second rate sci fi is just plain stupid. As for the film, this movie did something that I hoped it would, it took a portion of the book and adopted it into a fantastic, artistic film, full of psychological twists, great acting and spectacular cinematography. To recreate the book to the t is simply impossible. The genious of this book is that for the large part it happens in the mind. So no two people will see this story in the same way. It is also wrong to say that Soderberg was trying to compete with 2001 some how. Just because this is a psychological movie that happens in space does not make it a rip-off of 2001. This movie was about half the book, and i understand why. If the whole book was to be made into the movie, the film would be way too long to show in a theater. Overall, this movie was done very well, I love the book and I love the movie. To those of you who haven't seen this movie I advise the following: if you're looking to see another installment of 2001, don't go, if you're looking to see a Trek type film, don't go, if you're looking to see a picture that is nothing like you've ever seen before and which will seem different every time you watch it, while being very uncommericial, mesmorising and brilliantly made, GO SEE IT !!! 10 stars.",Solaris

430,BauceLawyerson,A rather dull film with some redeeming qualities,6,13 May 2014,"Solaris has a runtime of roughly 90 minutes without logos and credits. Still, many of those precious minutes are spent on numerous stylized flashback sequences. Most of these definitely serve a purpose but take entirely too long and aren't particularly exciting to watch, being mostly dark and dim. Some of them feel arbitrary and purposefully stretched to boost the length of the film.It seems like Steven Soderbergh went out of his way to avoid exposition through dialogue, possibly out of fear of having it be too obvious or condescending. A lot of time is wasted on showing the audience that George Clooney is some kind of shrink. Yet, by the time he sets foot aboard the spaceship, we still have no idea what Solaris actually is or what kind of mission the crew is conducting. Simply knowing that might have greatly increased my enjoyment of the first half. The deliberate vagueness does not contribute to the sense of mystery at all, it just makes the characters less believable for not seeming all that bothered by it.Some credit is due for the way in which Soderbergh manages to portray the rather philosophical subject matter and have the characters explore and discuss it without breaking our suspension of disbelief. That being said, since none of this is technically original material, I think it's appropriate to base my rating mostly on artistic considerations. Intellect has little to do with one's enjoyment of this movie. It's definitely no Star Wars, but it's no 2001 either. It doesn't take a common man to get annoyed by the inconsistent pacing and dullness.",Solaris
431,n-oved,Terrible Film-making (Warning: This comment contains spoilers),1,28 April 2008,"Solaris is not a sequel, its not an action/adventure/science-fiction film or fantasy like A Star Wars or Terminator. It is way beyond opposite of all that. It is more of a dramatic, mysterious, romantic adventure in the future when a planet known as solaris is a place of energy. An energy source that would be able to contain a world with highly advanced, unwastefull or unpolluting energy. The energy source ends up being used for Earth, which brings our planet to a futuristic and highly advanced and sophisticated in mathematics and science in the energy's capability. I took the impression thats how Earth was futurelly-like. But this exotic and occasionally sexually active and erotic adventure passes like a wind blowing over a tight swindle.Starring George Clooney, and in definitely one of his most richest roles, he plays unusually in this bizarrely overrated motion picture. He is a hard-to-understand character. But in the beginning he is sent to a space-ship which impressionally is the central station for watching over Solaris. It moves around the planet like a satellite. While making sure the planet's energy is being reflected to Earth for good reasons. Strange and Bizarre activities have been happening on the ship lately. When Clooney gets their, he sees blood and dead people. He also sees blood coming from the vents on the ceiling. He realizes he and a co-pilot are the only ones left on the team. Once there were about seven of them. Clooney eventually asks what had happened, and the guy who really...speaks...like...this (the co-pilot) says a metaphorical statement. And throughout the entire movie, they don't even explain it once, which is one of the film's disappointments. But once clooney sleeps and wakes up in the middle of the night, seeing his wife (who supposedly died) is alive again. Thats where the confusion comes in. It is a mind-bending tale, with very good ideas.It shows a few long 10 minute flashbacks throughout the movie of Clooeny and his wife, their relationships, their romance, including their sex. Also when he brings her on the space station, and how he puts her in a small glass shuttle, and for some odd reason he presses the go button and lets her go off into space while she is still in their. While Clooeny's suspicion of her being dead, she appears back on the ship again. Then a random kid comes up, maybe a 7 year-old-kid. Later on, Clooney see's the co-pilot's dead body in the vents of the ceiling, which is where he had noticed the blood coming from the vents. While the co-pilot hangs out in his room, Clooney realizes that everything is just a memory. His wife who had randomly appeared on the ship was just a memory of what Clooney knows of her. Same goes for the co-pilot. Then Clooney realizes that the random kid is also just a memory. These memories that seem so real is by the strength of solaris which is how the memories are appearing in actual life.When solaris starts to implode, the co-pilot leaves, the girl just disappears, and clooney including the kid just sit in the ship, waiting for solaris to explode and kill them. It is somewhat a sad scene, Clooney's raw intensity in this scene is simply astounding. (personally the best scene of the movie). Then after Clooney dies, he's back at his house, and his wife stands their looking at him.Now, first of all this movie was absolutely the most boring movie I have ever seen. The first 20 minutes are purely raw intensity and deep in entertainment. But the rest is dreary, especially repetitive with sex and nudity. The movie is just about obsessed with it. But it is drenched Win confusion. The deliberation is always slow. The movie is slow. The movie sucks. It is the worst movie I have ever seen. Definitely up for the razzies. If you're expecting drama, expect MAJOR drama. Because it is an orall experience. These are good ideas with a terrible execution.Secondly, critics are idiots. Thye apparently loved this movie. You can see how, but I thought it was patchy, dry, dull, soulless, heartless, slow, weak, boring, and terrible. Whenever someone mentions this movie (which people never really do) I'll just laugh. Its lame. Its not anyones kind of movie, its easy to fall asleep in. What kind of a story is this. Its not even interesting. And having solaris' explosion is a lot bigger of a situation than how they should of reacted. Leaving isn't the answer. It is the Earth's frickin power source. Ultimately the world would fall apart. And the last scene was terrible. Made me feel even worse for this movie, the world is still alive, and it shows the wife appear again. Did Clooney die or just appear back at home? either way, the direction was awful, same with James Cameron's writing.THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.1/10 -- if it can go lower: 0/10.",Solaris

It has intelligent and fallible characters - which is to say, believable characters, well acted.  The pace of the movie is leisurely -slow, never forced, but towards a definite conclusion.  I am surprised the studio ponied up the amount of money necessary for the well-done sci-fi effects and futuristic set design.

This film, and other recent films like Mulholland Drive, Memento, Fight Club, Punch-Drunk Love, and Donnie Darko has taken up much of my thinking time out of the theatre.Although in most of those movies events occur that sometimes do not make much sense, the overall movie draws you in to its complexity and makes you think outside of a theatre. The film evolves from being a simple escape into an experience, sometimes that might change the way you think about a certain aspect of your life. Such is Solaris. If you are capable and willing to lend some of your time outside the theatre to think about what went on in the movie, give it a try. It'd recommend it highly.

I couldn't image how anyone could hope to take any of Lem's works, let alone Solaris, and make a film of it.  Having seen it, I have to admit that I'm pleasantly suprised.  While it's not exactly a faithful representation, it is a deeply atmospheric interpretation of the story.  George Clooney continues to impress me with his emotionally moving performance of Chris Kelvin, and Natascha McElhone is astonishing as his wife, Rheya.  Although I knew that I had to see this film, I had serious doubts going into it.  It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but in my opinion, by daring to create a film outside of the mainstream that interacts with the audience on an almost entirely emotional level, Mr. Soderbergh has made an important contribution to his art.

The film manages to perfectly achieve the tense atmosphere of the investigation into the mystery of existence around Solaris, and the heartache this causes the people there. The actual sci-fi is quite subdued in the movie, and this just made it more realistic for me personally (though this is the first time I've seen a Higgs field mentioned on-screen). I'm not convinced everyone in the future will wander around explaining all their technological marvels all the time like in some sf movies, and doing so just detracts from the storyline.

Other films are unabashed entertainment to thrill the masses.  And then there are films like SOLARIS. Films made for only one reason: to satisfy the egos of filmmakers who actually think they're saying something.It has become its own genre.This last kind of film has a small but earnest following.  And you can bet their audience will find meaning in ANY tale.  But you can also bet they'll never agree with each other on what that meaning IS.  Oh, but that's the point, you see.  It's ""interpretive"".  It's subjective.  We all see different meanings in it.  That's the whole beauty of it, they say.A similar kind of film is David Lynch's MULHOLLAND DRIVE.  And it would seem that people will tend to like or dislike both.  And if you come across someone who LIKES it, don't dare suggest it's awful -- or else it's assumed you're not intelligent enough to ""get it"". (Or perhaps just not creative enough to have imposed your own meaning upon it -- which, let's face it, if I wanted to WRITE the movie, I wouldn't have come to see YOURS!)Personally, I prefer a story.  I prefer something that makes sense and has a forward motion.  Something that adds up -- ALL of it.  I can go cerebral and make the challenging mental connections along with the best of them.  But SOLARIS and its breed (and their followers) believe that juxtaposing images in a random or lingering fashion -- as long as you have a thread of a story -- makes for some sort of artistic masterpiece.But it doesn't.There are some very nice elements in SOLARIS.  The concept, for one.  I haven't seen the original nor read the book (which shouldn't be required when seeing a film, by the way).  But the story concept is EXCELLENT.  I would have LOVED a well-told version of this thing.Jeremy Davies also gives a dynamic performance (hammy, perhaps, but at least it was fascinating to watch).  Clooney was solid.  McElhone was radiant. Davis was good.  I enjoyed the score and the aesthetically-pleasing cinematography and the expansive set.But when Soderbergh is at the helm of a story that DOESN'T have a clear linear drive (as BROCKOVICH and OCEAN'S both did), you get self-indulgent filmmaking, pure and simple.  TRAFFIC's another example.  Great to look at, excellent acting, nice scenes -- adds up to nothing we hadn't seen on a hundred television shows.  Maybe it's just me, but I find Soderbergh the most consistently overrated director working today (well, alongside Lynch, perhaps).The worst part is that I LOVED the IDEAS behind these films.  I would've liked each of those mentioned here to have been great WITHOUT having ME supply their meanings.  I just wish the filmmakers had done their jobs (tell a story), rather than pander to those few who find meaning where there is none.If that's you, then this is your film.",Solaris

Great director, great actor and great (I'm the king of the world) producer.  I guess too much greatness went to their heads as this movie has neither beginning nor end.  Okay I can take the idea that the movie is slow but please show some suspense.  You know when Chris (George Clooney) sees his wife for the first time he was shocked and afraid that he ships her off into space.  But when he sees her the second time I didn't even care since there was no suspense to build up to that climatic moment. The story is depressing but they could have added some dialogue and some more suspense to keep the audience wondering until the very end. Frankly, by the time the movie ended I didn't even care that happened to these two characters.  Another problem is the other crew members on the space station; we are introduced to them and nothing more.  They might as well not been there.  I guess Steven Soderbergh added them in to add some dialogue to the story.  At least make them interesting.  In an interview Soderbergh said that he hardly used FX so it doesn't take away from the story.  Sorry Steven but there was not story to take away from.",Solaris

I truly felt for the characters and Soderbergh's deft musing on ideas and themes are superb. I got a similar feeling from Sex, Lies.. and also Traffic. The films he make deal with fairly major issues; but seem to really effect the individual characters. Reminds me of Philip K Dick stories in a way. The story rolls out a wonderful pace, fragments of memory from various characters mixed in with visuals of the planet. Did anyone else see the strands across Solaris' surface? Reminded me of brain synapses...in the original one Russian character says something like 'the planet acts like a mind' or something like that. A lovely take on those lines I think. The acting is superb; Clooney is excellent. Who is the 'hairy' guy, who's been 'copied'? I can't remember his name, but he was in another film which had Bono from U2 in it (something Millenium Hotel?). I really enjoyed the soundtrack, really great with the visuals.

Also akin to that film it also achieves this wonderful sense of isolation and really create Solaris, the planet, as almost a character in its own right.There is little more I can say except that this film is brilliantly directed and paced, shot with more then a nod or two to Stanley Kubrick and impeccably acted (particularly by Clooney who really defies expectations) But also and most importantly for a sci-fi it is thought provoking and engaging.",Solaris

However, he almost immediately accepted her presence and began to defy normal convention--and he was supposed to be a brilliant psychiatrist?

453,buliabyak,A parody of Tarkovsky,1,3 May 2005,"I'm not a big fan of Tarkovsky's Solaris. It's not too deep philosophically, although it's stunning visually. Lem himself didn't like Tarkovsky's film, and the reasons are clear. His novel is first of all a _science_ fiction masterpiece about Man and the Unknown, about the limits of science, about science and ethics. Most of the novel's depth was lost or trivialized by Tarkovsky. However, his film is truly haunting visually, and its imagery is unforgettable.Well, it's only by seeing this abomination that I started to really appreciate Tarkovsky. Soderberg's film is an amateurish reenactment of the classic with slightly better lighting and more expensive sets. Its faithfulness to the original is pathetic; it inherits all of the problems of Tarkovsky's film but adds absolutely nothing of its own. It just makes it worse - much worse.It's especially dreadful when you compare the heroine. Tarkovsky's Harey is incredibly beautiful, airy, touching, loving and lovable - she almost made me cry. Soderberg's Rheya is old, ugly, awkward, and delivers her lines with such cheap melodramatism that it made me cringe. In one scene, her saying ""Oh my god"" twice - with a tear! - was such an unbelievable soap that I nearly vomited.Clooney copies Banionis laboriously but seems to forget that he's supposed to be an actor, and actors don't normally wear such wooden faces. Snow (""Snaut"") is actually somewhat funny (the best actor in the entire film, by far), though totally out of place. The black female ""Sartorius"" is passable but just barely.Perhaps the only reason to remake Solaris now might be to create the real Ocean, with all its complexity and unpredictability, the way it described in Lem's book. Tarkovsky could not do that due to the obvious technical limitations of 1972, and it looks like he wasn't interested in that part of the novel anyway. Yet, it's hard to believe that Solaris of 2003, with all the computer technology and whatnot, shows an even less impressive Ocean than Solaris of 1972. What did they spend the money on, I wonder? One point where Soderberg departed from Tarkovsky is the ending. Tarkovsky's ending, different from that of the novel, was striking and original. Soderberg's ending, different from that of the novel, is silly and soapish.Overall, it all feels like an unfunny parody.",Solaris
454,iain-77,"Intelligent, moving sci-fi",9,29 April 2005,"CONTAINS SPOILERS! What an outstanding piece of work. This is pure sci-fi: take a wild concept - what if our memories of lost love ones could become real and take on their own lives? - and then follow the idea to its logical conclusion, as realistically as possible.Despite a slow start this film scores, largely because of the outstanding portrayals of its two central characters, Chris (Clooney) and Rheya (McElhone). Of the two, McElhone is the mesmerising heart of this film, delivering an understated but electrifying performance as a new being struggling to understand what she is, and struggling to negotiate strange memories of her pain-wracked relationship with Chris.The parallel stories of their relationship past and present play out beautifully and almost every scene delivers a thoroughly convincing emotional bombshell. And no, it isn't a chick flick. This is grown-up film-making. It feels a lot like a play - dominated by long conversations between the two main characters. But it never drags and never gets boring. On the contrary, it is totally gripping because it commands such belief in its characters and their situation.Hats off to George for a nuanced, heartfelt performance and for being enough of a professional to give over so much screen time to McElhone. There are long shots here of conversations between these two in which we see nothing of Clooney at all - just McElhone's extraordinarily beautiful, haunting face, studying her reactions as he speaks. And it works. This film will stay with you for days.Highlight: Clooney's anguish when he discovers that Rheya has aborted their child (paralleled at the end when Rheya discovers that he killed her first ""copy"") - a powerful scene and the kind of acting you rarely see in Hollywood movies.

455,gravity_allen,Not so good,4,3 June 2005,"I tend to believe that movies should be judged on whether or not they accomplish what they set out to achieve. Consequently, When it comes to an adapted screenplay, I think one should try and determine what the Director and/or writer had in mind and then ask ""did it work?"" Well I may be breaking my own rule now, I have to admit that I don't know what was intended with this movie, beyond trying to make a film out of the novel Solaris. As a result, I can only conclude that they failed. The movie is far from awful, and movies (being the subjective beings they are) can be wonderful or otherwise, depending on the viewer. While I can understand and appreciate people loving this movie for whatever it is, it misses the mark completely when attempting to convey anything that Lem had in mind when he wrote the book. One might say that everything present in the book is in the movie, and this is essentially true, but content isn't all. The book is structured to give the reader a realistic sense of what a truly alien encounter might be like, but the film glazes over this and seems to focus on something else (to be honest, I'm not entirely sure what). Without trying to undermine anyone's interpretation of the movie, I must say it really isn't Sci-Fi at it's best and fails to give any meaningful insight into the infinite possibilities of the genre. Skip this if your a fan of the book or of Sci-Fi in general. See it if everything I just said means nothing to you.",Solaris

I watched it, full of anticipation only to be greatly disappointed. I admit that at the beginning I found it a little interesting, but that held for only the 5 first minutes at most. Soon it became clear that this movie is not a masterpiece.Still, I fought the urge to stop the film and went through the whole movie, Dozing to sleep about twice or three and then rewinding to continue from where I left off (and I wasn't all that tired). They said it was great didn't they?While the movie poses an interesting situation at the start, it offers no insights, no clues, and no direction. It's more a drift in space with no purpose than a voyage with discoveries. I don't need any answers, but even new questions along the way are missing in this movie. It all looks like a mesh of nonsense that someone put together and justified with something like ""Duuhhh, SpAcE!?"".Watching the wall for the duration of the film would be much better, even without the popcorn!

458,Neulwen,Too silly,4,17 January 2016,"This movie starts out interesting, but pretty soon it becomes silly, and much more fantasy than sci-fi. The acting is so-so. The script is often stupid/awkward, but sometimes poetic (in a good way). The characters aren't introduced much, and seem unfamiliar and hard to associate with. The movie generally doesn't evoke much emotion, except a few times, mostly because it so often induces disbelief. Certain camera shots (like seeing a character's face) feel unnecessarily long without adding substance, and at the same time, some story aspects are underdeveloped. There is no explanation for how clones of specific dead humans, with their memories, appear out of nowhere. The crew members are certain, by unknown reasons, that it's the planet below that creates them. Of course. And they are not unusually perplexed, amazed or in disbelief. The whole movie feels shallow because of this unrealism. It would have been potentially interesting to learn more about the planet Solaris.Also, more could have been done out of the main character's approach to Solaris. More emotion.At one point the characters discuss how the ""visitors"" are built. One of the crew members comes up with what is supposed to be a wild guess, the other one programs a particle accelerator (how come they have one on the ship to begin with?) based on that guess, and it just happens to be correct. And again, no questions asked and no explanations. There are multiple such ignored bits in this movie.The mentioned physics is bad too. Bosons do not have anti-particles, and the Higgs field gives *everything* mass, and exists everywhere. Although the Higgs was not yet experimentally confirmed by the time this movie was made, this has been theorised for some time. It would only take a simple internet search.However, the movie has some good aspects too. The visuals are beautiful. There is some really aesthetic lightning and scenery. The planet Solaris looks fascinating, and there are some nice shots of it. There are a few good story elements about love and regret, and the occasional emotional atmosphere. Background music is fitting.",Solaris
459,dplotnik,Does everything possible to keep you in the theater,10,1 December 2002,"The original Solaris by Andrei Tarkovsky is a cult classic.  Rent it at Blockbuster and compare.  As with all Tarkovsky's movies, it is made for the ""enlightened"" and does not even make an attempt to win over anybody else. You'll see how much more of the story Tarkovsky leaves off the screen - for the patient viewer to reconstruct.  Your attention will be challenged by seemingly endless visual sequences. At times the dialog is so rich with different ideas that you need to rewind a few times to simply hear it all. Thus the Tarkovsky's version would not work for general audiences - it requires too much commitment from the viewer.  I saw it in the 70s, people were walking out of the theater - just as expected.Soderbergh knows all that and makes everything humanly possible to adjust the movie to the general public's tastes.  He focuses on the most fundamental ideas.  He sticks to the tightest, most straightforward storyline.  He cuts the movie himself with the precision of Eric Clapton's guitar.  He also knows that he will lose audiences if he fails to entertain them all the time, so he casts two undisputedly beautiful actors: Clooney and Natascha McElhone, augments the couple with a wonderfully funny sidekick (Jeremy Davies). He turns every frame into a glamor shot, adds romantic love scenes (with nudity, mind you), a state-of-the-art sci-fi soundtrack and elaborate computer graphics... and still people walk out of the theater.

It is clever, intelligent, and calculated, while still being intense and emotional. And don't let the other reviewers fool you--it has some magnificent visuals, without being over the top or unnecessary. The dialogue is subdued for most of the film, and feels closer to natural speech, instead of the quick, backtalking style that is far too popular these days. It is clear that this was a dream project for Steven Soderbergh, and I found little at all in this film that resembled his others.I feel sorry for the film industry in a way. People are going to movies less and less, and the industry knows it is because the films being produced are unoriginal, predictable, and pandering. Yet here they offer a film that is not, and the public stays away.The American people deserve the crappy movies they get.

And I wasn't disappointed.Its not as sprawling or epic as Kubrick's 1969 masterpiece, but the long periods of silence and the understated performances from the main characters are clearly Soderbergh's reminder to us of the vast quietness that exists in space. Clooney was excellent as the troubled psychologist dealing with the suicide of his wife. He is summoned to the Prometheus, a space station orbiting the moon of Solaris. The message is vague, but tells him that ""strange things have happened, and the easiest thing would be to return home, but (they) don't want to"". So he goes to help out.............It was captivating.

467,david-winborn,"Absorbing, haunting and gorgeous.",10,13 May 2006,"Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick decided to make the 'proverbial good sci-fi movie' when they jointly created the film and novel 2001: A Space Odyssey. There have been few comparably good sci-fi films since. Solaris is, however, one of them.Whilst the Russian original is an epic and demanding film, Soderbergh's work should not be considered a remake. The director himself considers it his own interpretation of the book, quite apart from the earlier film. Because of this, the two should not be compared.If you hated Alien 3 because it didn't have any guns or 2001 because the ending was confusing, do not waste your time with Solaris. It is not for you.Conceptually, the story is standard psychological sci-fi fare, with simple but effective theological and philosophical themes. In this respect it breaks little or no new ground over the Tarkovsky predecessor. It has elements of romance, thriller, and drama, all necessarily set in sci-fi land, as the setting is integral to the storytelling.Visually, the Solaris future is a conservative, believable vision, reminiscent in look to that of Gatacca. Solaris space is a minimal, beautiful place to be. Not dirty and used like the celebrated Alien 'space trucker' look, Solaris vessels are gleaming, intricate and stylish, but seem to have been designed by engineers rather than artists, such is the practical realism. Their design is complemented by some of the best CG spaceship effects I have seen (incredible that it has taken this long for computer graphics to look as good as the model-based technology of 2001, Star Wars and Aliens in the 1960s and 70s).Solaris, the planet itself, is a clever piece of art, seemingly evidencing a degree of emotion by its colouring and detail, as no doubt was the intention. In the commentary to the DVD it is mentioned that many of the lingering shots of the planet were cut, which may have been necessary for the pacing of the film, but I found every shot an absorbing spectacle and would have enjoyed more.The sets and costumes also retain the sense of engineering realism combined with beauty. Soderbergh's eye for detail is evident here, as everything has a purpose and look that fits perfectly with the overall feel. Somehow, this look is original and avoids many of the clichés we come to expect of sci-fi mise-en-scene.Channel Four recently showed this on UK television and billed it along the lines of a 'George Clooney Sci-Fi Romance'. A tenuous interpretation, perhaps, but you can see why they did it. Whilst Clooney adds Hollywood star appeal, fans will be slightly disappointed, not because his work here is in anyway weak, but because he is understated, convincing and very un-Hollywood. With Solaris he adds another fine performance to an already commendably diverse filmography.Natascha McElhone too plays a difficult, emotive role without resorting to melodrama. The small supporting cast doesn't put a foot wrong, with a delightfully odd but subtly creepy performance from Jeremy Davies worthy of note.Solaris is slow, abstract, haunting stuff. The direction is subtle, dare I say almost Kubrick-esquire. The camera work is non-intrusive, solid stuff without gimmick (apart from a touch of shaky-cam in the restaurant scene where Kelvin meets Rheya) or overstatement.Add to this a beautiful, timeless score by Cliff Martinez and you have one of the better psychological sci-fi movies ever made.The majority of people will hate Solaris. Let them. Let them have instead the mindless Hollywood trash released every week and keep this treasure for yourself.",Solaris

The planet/object 'Solaris' has intelligence; the capability to manifest your subconsciousness or dreams into reality. This is a common theme in Soviet era movies, for example the Russian made movie Stalker in 1979 is a quest to find a place in ""The Zone"" where you could basically get your wishes granted. Considering the bland lives of living in the Soviet union during that era, it's no wonder movies like this made such an impression on those people.The point of the movie is that if you could have your dreams, would you forgo reality and choose the dreams? In Solaris, the manifestations of your dreams take on a life of their own. The consequences are not predictable, so maybe dreams are best left locked up in the mind...",Solaris

Just ignore Solaris' box office and watch the first 33 minutes of this film. If you aren't absolutely hooked, well, I guess I'll accept it, but I won't understand it.",Solaris

I found it slow in the beginning, and I found myself wondering what the point was going to be.I got more out of the movie thinking about it afterwards. Thinking about the relationship between the two lead characters, the way things can turn sour, the mistakes they made, and the regret they felt when it was too late.The movie has themes about heaven, redemption, and life after death. Although I found it slow, I enjoyed talking about it afterward, and thinking about it.",Solaris

An emotional journey into relationships and what they entail. Soderbergh weaves a tapestry of human emotion beyond the book's boundaries, and beyond Lem's original novel, which sacrificed passion for debate. And it still manages to homage the Tarkovsky version with the water motif (rain on the window in the first shot - rain in the background in the dinner conversation scene.) Soderburgh has taken the source material and crafted an original piece of cinema which reflects both the book and the original film. And to add to that, the music's fantastic.",Solaris

I can therefore report my surprise as to how much I have enjoyed this movie. Chris Kelvin is a psychiatrist who when introduced to us seems to have a very busy but emotionally dissatisfying life. He is compelled to visit a space station following a mysterious plea from a friend. When he arrives at Solaris he finds that his friend is dead and he begins to discover why the crew has had trouble leaving the space station. This story is set in a science fiction surrounding, but is very much a story about relationships. In one scene Chris tells Rheya that he is the right guy for her, but we soon discover that he fails her. Ultimately Chris wants to redeem himself by saving her when offered a second chance. The movie is very slow paced, allowing for great character development. Solaris is refreshing in that it leaves many questions unanswered. It does not force feed the viewer moral judgements rather it leads us to the question and allows us to explore our own thoughts.",Solaris

Why oh why aren't more sci-fi films like this made these days, instead of ""blockbusters"" like Attack of the Clones and Independence Day? I saw both of these films on release and left the theatre feeling let-down and disappointed. Not so Solaris. From the opening sequence I was captivated. Everything - visuals, music, atmosphere, acting (especially Clooney) were top notch. I've always thought he was a decent actor but this for me was by far a career best. Ok there was some unnecessary shots of his butt but who cares? Even my girlfriend, not the deepest thinker that's ever lived, confessed that she'd enjoyed it. Reading some of the user comments I gather this film bombed in America, which doesn't surprise me. If it's not a film involving gung-ho heroes killing every baddie in sight or a film where they re-write history to suit themselves - see U571 or The Patriot - they really don't want to know (my apologies to the half of America which has a brain, and I suspect there ARE a few of you!).

I know I was a fool for not reading any reviews before going to see it, I'll make sure not to make that mistake again.

482,michael-baker2,Should I Watch This Movie?,8,14 November 2007,"I have not seen the original 1972 Solaris movie, nor have I read the book so these comments assess the 2002 Solaris movie as an independent story without regard to its originality nor adherence to the book. Perhaps the 1972 telling is better in conception and execution and if you choose to see only one Solaris, maybe the original is the better choice, or maybe not. But in either case, the 2002 Solaris definitely has significant merits. Two days after viewing the movie, I find myself still thinking about it.So, should you watch this movie? Is it good entertainment or a waste of time? That depends, of course, on your expectations so let's help set some expectations. More than most, this film requires you to be in the right mood; if you're in the right mood with the right expectations it is a pretty good movie. But if you're not, you certainly will not like it.Is it science-fiction? It has a science-fiction setting, and some science-fiction themes running through it but those themes are minor compared to its main themes and are not explored much. There are some acceptable special effects and science-fiction imagery but they provide a counterpoint to its brooding atmosphere more than anything else.This is a fairly serious film, with central themes exploring the ""human condition"" and human nature. The sci-fi setting allows the storyteller to put the characters into unusual situations that just don't otherwise occur, at least in the here and now. The characters will act and react according to how the storyteller, relying on her/his own sense of human nature, thinks they will. So it's a sort of thought-experiment. If the storyteller has real insight, the characters' actions will seem reasonable to us, although perhaps only after some thought because the situations are certainly unusual.What else does Solaris offer the viewer? It is one of a short list of ""puzzle"" movies. Such movies tell their story without any real third-party narration. They are seen entirely through the eyes of one or more characters; the audience is required to sort out the objective facts of the story from the subjective narration. Well, maybe this isn't the best definition, but it's somehow part of it. I'm thinking of, but not comparing Solaris to, movies like Sixth Sense and Identity. What was going on? Is that scene a flashback or occurring in the present or a dream? Does just the protagonist see that or does everyone? There was no objective narration; it was presented as an intellectual puzzle to the audience to solve. (To digress momentarily, I would argue that Sixth Sense presented enough clues, and presented them early enough that figuring out the solution to the puzzle was possible early in the movie. Whereas Identity did not present enough clues until late for the puzzle to be solved, thus becoming more of a surprise-ending movie.) Solaris is rich in a brooding atmosphere. And it has a slow pace, perhaps to give the audience time to think about each clue before the next is presented.So why watch Solaris? If you're interested in solving a ""puzzle"" movie, one that will possibly continue to engage your thoughts after the movie is done, if you're willing to explore some very serious themes about human nature and the human condition, and if your mood matches the brooding atmosphere and slow pace, then watch, puzzle, cogitate and drink it in.Is it a good movie? Within the constraints of the above, it is better than most. My chief praise for the storytelling is the way it continued to periodically deliver us puzzle clues, unlike some other movies which deliberately withhold the clues. And I was also pleased that there was a solution at the end, consistent with the clues and with the story pushing us towards it - although the interpretation of that end solution is open to discussion. So, as an intellectual puzzle, a good challenge but a fair one.I really enjoyed the acting and somewhat enjoyed most of the cinematography. I did not enjoy the music quite as much as most viewers posting here seem to have, but it wasn't jarring nor distracting. I also found the volume of the soundtrack uneven, so make sure you have your remote handy. And the pace could have been picked up just a little, but not too much or else it would have lost its atmosphere. Overall, an 8 out of 10 but not for everyone and make sure you're in the right mood.Hope this helps.",Solaris

It was not. As for Solaris ""himself"", you see a planet of blueish light effects from afar (the novel takes you to the surface of Solaris), with absolutely no detail. As for the story, you get a love-story instead of something you can interpret the way you like. As for the ending, it has nothing in common with Lem's vision. And on top of all, it is a (very) boring movie. The novel itself does not contain much action, but when the makers of the film took the negligible side story and made it the main plot... everything gone awfully boring. And I have to tell you: Solaris isn't evil (or something like that), as you might feel in the end; and nobody knows what's ""his"" goal, but surely it isn't to make someone (or everyone) happy...If you want to watch a love-story in outer space, then give it a try, but if you want to watch a sci-fi movie, look somewhere else.",Solaris
484,dui_kuro,"But come on, who knows what ""love"" really is?",10,13 December 2007,"Steven Soderbergh's adaptation of Stanislaw Lem's novel is quite interesting and compelling. His directing could have been greater but the work still lands in the charts of good film-making and adaptations from a classical novel to screen. What is most intriguing about this particular celluloid version of the book is that there is no character development. There is no sense of particularity in the characters. You can actually even doubt the very existence of life. And what about the wife of George Clooney's character? Does she exist or not? Who is on board on this space vessel? The answer is a self-exploration of a psychotherapist for the main character, the one that George Clooney with the direction of Soderbergh accomplishes successfully. Magnificent acting, not over the top but just right. But the answer still is a contradiction. The final message of the film itself is a contradiction and there is no definite end of the story, or a beginning in the same sense.During the film you kind of accumulate the feeling of knowing the different characters but in the end doubt their even existence. This is symbol of mankind's development, evolution, meaning of life if you may - self-perspective, self knowledge and understanding.It's deep, it's chilling, it's bizarre and makes no sense at some point, because it is dreamlike. The whole film sequences seem like taken bits from a dream. don't get me wrong, it's a well-organized, well-directed, acted out to perfection and with a great score but in the end it stays up in the air. You have to feel it to understand it. Sense it to comprehend it. Let go any logic whatsoever and just ask yourself - what do you fear and desire most?And up to the point of conclusion - Love? Noun, no explanation. It cannot be enforced and it's existence is a mystery. That's what the novel is about. If you know what ""love"" is, you shouldn't watch this movie.

Where is Drama and Sci-Fi ? it is only cheap Romance. I'm quite sure he never read the book. I was forced to stop the movie after 34 minutes.

Although I respected it for the vision and style, I was not able to really feel a part of it.  Maybe because of the subtitles, or because its pace is more designed for a European sensibility, I found myself drifting away from it many times.  Clooney's Solaris, with its quiet feeling also allows me to drift, but pulls me in and holds me there.When a movie or book is able to envelop me in its dream, and actually hold me there long after the end, it has accomplished its goal.  Solaris held its pull on me long after the last view of the planet disappeared from my screen.  I was left with that dreamlike feeling and mood for a long time afterwards.

It started off giving me a bad impression, but completely saved itself at the very end. Watching the movie, I was consistently reminded of the Myst game series.  Not for stylistic reasons, but simply the overall detached tone seemed to be very similar.  This movie is an example of Soderbergh's incredible ability to imply things very subtly.  Half the plot is hinted at through flashbacks, and for those people who like to think, a lot is told in so little time. This movie makes no attempt to explain the science fiction it incorporates.  Rather, it spends its short time explaining the psychology of the humans and Solaris.  People going in expecting a sci-fi will be greatly disappointed if they are expecting realism; this is a psychological movie, and explains that well. My favorite line was the last part, where George Clooney asks, ""Am I alive, or dead?""  It doesn't matter, because if he believes he is happy, then it is of no consequence whether or not he is dead.  This is how the entire movie is; even we do not know whether he is actually at Earth and dreaming, or still in Solaris.  It is an exploration of the human mind, and how it reacts.

508,byron_t,For Art's Sake,6,6 December 2002,"For those looking for Star Wars or Men in Black, this movie is not for you. The classification of `Science Fiction/Thriller' is somewhat misleading. While it is science fiction, the film is much too cerebral to be called a `thriller.'  In truth, this film is more a testament to the power Soderbergh has in Hollywood than anything else.  It's not that the film is bad, but it certainly is not `major world wide release' material.  This is both a critique and a compliment for the film.  On the one hand, the movie going public could do with more challenging films, movies that it takes a few post viewing hours to wrap your mind around.  On the other hand, presenting a movie this inaccessible to the general public runs the risk of a financial and professional failing.  Thus, that Soderbergh could make it and release it during the Christmas movie season speaks volumes about how much pull he has (and justifiably so) in the industry.As for the movie itself, as with all Soderbergh films it is exceptionally well crafted (Traffic is, in my opinion, the most finely crafted film made in the last 20 years).  Fans of Soderbergh will not be disappointed by either the visual or atmospheric elements he brings to bear.  That begs the question whether visual and artistic merit are sufficient criteria with which to judge a film.  The answer is; it depends.  In a film such as Ron Fircke's Baraka, where there is no dialogue and there are no (specific) characters, the thematic elements can only be conveyed through visual and audio images.  Therefore, visual and artistic merit are the only criteria you can use to judge the film, and that suffices.  However, in a traditional film with characters, dialogue and action there is an expectation for thematic cohesion that Solaris seems to lack.  Because the ideas are vague and the plot non-linier, very few people will come out of this movie with a strong sense of what actually happened and what it all meant.  On the surface, that seems like not such a bad thing.  Strong art (and despite its wide release this is undoubtedly an `art film') should leave you thinking, discussing and wondering.  The problem is that if you are unable to come to any cohesive, arguable conclusions after you have done the thinking and discussing, the value of the film comes into question.  If the only value of a film that includes dialogue, character and action is for the visual and atmospheric quality, why should the former be included?
All of this is to say that we cannot simply be impressed with Soderbergh's camera work and call the film good.  Nor is it enough to say, `Wow, that film really made me think, it must be good.'  Rather, the director and writers should use the medium they employ to convey a message, and at some level that message must be obtainable by the audience they are trying to communicate with.  If the film, even after it has been discussed and analyzed by discerning minds continues to be incoherent, it has failed in to communicate and thus failed completely.The unavoidable comparison with Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey illustrates this point.  I first saw 2001 when I was twelve and I'm not sure what was more confusing, the movie or why I had watched the whole thing.  I had no idea whatsoever about what the film could mean.  However, I sat down with my father afterward and he pointed out some of the ideas and meaning.  Ideas such as that the film showed the progression of man from beast to human to whatever enlightened being Dave becomes at the end of 2001.  He showed me how the obelisk was either a catalyst for or a representation of these huge leaps in humanities advancements.  As our discussion progressed, the ideas of the film fell from confused images to a cohesive theme.  Certainly not one that was easily accessible or capable of being grasped without thought or effort, but after the effort was applied I knew, even at a young age, what was being communicated to me.  In short, the director and writer had connected.  The power of that moment stays with me even years later. Solaris, unfortunately, never lets the viewer (no matter how discerning) make that discovery or that connection.  You are left convinced that the film had something to say but despairing that you will never know what it was.  There is an overall lack of internal consistency so at no point can you track enough evidences to a defendable conclusion.  It's not so much that there are inconsistencies, but that you don't have enough evidence to support any particular idea convincingly.  It is the worst kind of argument: one with neither a conclusion nor enough evidence to support a conclusion.
Some will argue that that is precisely the nature of the film.  The fact that there is no solid answer is not only justifiable but also desirable. For that argument to be true, however, we must accept that the film either does not give us enough information or the information is contradictory. If that is the case, it lacks the fundamental aspect that makes science fiction believable, internal consistency.  The viewer is left with only confusion and chaos, neither of which justifies the medium used to present, nor the time taken to view, the material.If you appreciate the visual and atmospheric elements in film this movie is worth watching.  If you are going for the plot or themes you will likely be disappointed.  There is a subset of viewers out there who will completely enjoy this film for its existential elements and unanswerable questions. However, for those who might be tempted to see this film because they anticipate some form of intellectual edification, just rent 2001 and call my dad with any questions you might have about it.",Solaris
509,sdhawk,Wait For The Rental,6,7 December 2002,"I was very disappointed in this movie. The best way I can describe it is BORING!It was slow, dark,and one of those movies you are always wondering if it's really happening , a dream, or something else. If you are a Clooney fan and just have to see it. Wait till it hits the rental stores. I wish I hadn't waisted my money on it.",Solaris
510,andrzejb,Film seems to be short(ened)...,7,15 February 2003,"Solaris has reached Europe, Poland in particular last Friday, and very first spectators have seen the long awaited film. In general, I agree with Stanislaw Lem and his comment on Solaris, however one negative is very visible: film seems to be short (shortened); producers sacrificed some episodes from the book to make the slow action more fluent (I guess the pilot Berton testifying has been cut off) I have heard that opinion from many people surrounding me in the cinema. Steven Soderbergh, a top grade film-director is not strong and experienced in SciFi. Ridley Scott, for example, would do better job I suppose, however I respect the work of Mr Soderbergh as well. I hope Hollywood will continue to translate Lem's literature into the movie and next pictures will be even better. I gave 7 out of 10.",Solaris
511,dogzillacouk,Better than the Russian (surprisingly!),9,22 August 2003,"I was a big fan of the original adaptation, so I kind of had my doubts about this. But as it turned out I honestly think this version is better.The Tarkovsky version has stunning cinematography, but there's a humanity to Soderbergh's rendition that brought me to tears. His ability to sum up a deep and believable relationship in just a handful of scenes is amazing. You really believe that these people were and are in love.I was disappointed to see how mishandled the various advertising campaigns for this film are. I can imagine a lot of people came to see the film expecting something totally different to what they saw and left disappointed. It's NOT a ghost story, or a romance, or a horror film. It's a love story.",Solaris

I have not met many people who thought it was just ""ok"".First of all, this movie has one of the best and most original soundtracks you will ever hear. It rivals that of Fight Club. It flows perfectly with the very cool and mesmerizing visuals throughout the movie. The story is very simple yet deep. There is even a nice little twist that brought a smile to my face. The normal witty and ""to cool for school"" persona that Clooney normally brings to the table is put aside for this film. Instead you find a troubled, depressed, and weak minded Dr. Kelvin which is played very well. I won't divulge into the story in hopes that if you have yet to see it, you go into it with an open mind.I can't say enough about this film. Even though I felt sad during the movie for the unfortunate Dr. Kelvin, I left the movie feeling happy and satisfied. Nothing feels left on the table, yet it leaves a bit to the imagination. My only negative is that I felt like it could have been longer. Solid 9/10.",Solaris
513,Fat_Cat,So boring,1,27 March 2003,"I think the idea of this movie was a decent one, but it's not for anyone with a normal attention span.  The editing was just awful, the shots were held to long (especially reaction to dialogue) and the camera work was boring and not very creative.I understand that this is not a movie intended to thrill the eyes, but when people are yelling things like ""This sucks!"" out loud you know that it's not a good movie.  Don't waste your time seeing this",Solaris
514,dramateras,A film in its own right,9,19 May 2011,"I liked the film very much. I can understand the criticism of some other contributors stating that the movie is not very authentic with respect to the book, although it it is called Solaris and states in its credits that it is based on the book. This is of course misleading and it would have been better to give it a different name and rather say that it was ""inspired"" by Lem's novel. Therefore I only gave a 9 to a film which I otherwise would have graded 10. Because in its own right I find it very well made indeed. The subject is an absolutely relevant one: Who are we? What makes us human? What is life? What is love? Do we need explanations or meaning in life? The movie concentrates on these questions, different from the book. This is a completely legitimate approach. Don't concentrate on the comparison of film and book, and you are fine. I got curious to reread the novel, and I am not expecting to find too much from the movie in it. That's OK.Also the cinematic realization and the acting was very good. The planet, the spaceship, the drama of the relationship between ""humans"" and ""replicas"". Who is human and who replica in the end? Who dreams whom? The result seems to be that being human is defined by nothing else than the relationships themselves, to persons or to the inanimate world. And in Solaris, this ""inanimate"" world turns out to be more alive than expected, another subject worth being explored.I really cannot understand the relative low rating of around 6 and the many negative reviews this film has received. I think it's great.",Solaris
515,ithnen,Too many missing pieces,1,1 September 2003,"Wait a few years and this will be on Mystery Science Theatre 4000.  This movie tried to be intense, deep and thought provoking but in the end was just boring.  Ideas and characters introduced and left behind.  We meet Gordon who is terrified to leave her cabin but in the next scene she is seated with Kelvin and Snow discussing how to get off the station.  After more intense moments of Kelvin dreaming his wife back into existence, Gordon gets on the escape pod and leaves.  This first rescue team is mentioned and forgotten.  His friend, who asked him to come to the station, makes another appearance but gives nothing to move the story along.  His friend's child, who apparently the friend dreamed into existence, runs around the ship. The deep discussion at the dinner table of the existence of higher intelligence sounds like a bunch of junior high kids.  At the end Kelvin and his wife are being absorbed into the higher intelligence, and Snow get to stare, mouth wide open, up at the ceiling.  So, we have a man sent to space to find out what is going wrong (stealing from 2001 A Space Odyssey?) and then because of his great emotional turmoil, brings his wife back to life and they live happily every after in another plane of existence.  All at taxpayer expense.",Solaris
516,john-pattie,Awful,4,15 January 2011,"Yep, awful. Didn't expect much, and it let me down. How anyone voted this as a 10 is absolutely ridiculous.Although, i must admit, watchable, i watched till the end. And the end was incredibly disappointing.Clooney is absorbed to the ship immediately, whereas you'd have to be mad to believe what happens to him even in the first few moments.You'd expect the character, a doctor going there to save them, to be reasonably sane. Yet he takes to it like a duck to water.There is know twist, the fact that one of the small parts is actually one of the beings has zero relevance to the plot. In fact that being some detracts from the film rather than increasing the storyline.Maybe i was rather generous with my vote of a 4, but as I didn't turn it off, I felt i had to give it something.",Solaris
517,bupham,One of 2002's Best,9,7 July 2003,"This genre-bending (or simply -ignoring) film was rightly dissed by the hoi-poloi, but should be a must-see for any serious movie goer, and especially any fan of Soderbergh's- it is one of his best. Soderbergh combines a love story with a space mystery, and brings his usual attention to the nuances of humans and their relationships to a larger, or at least more profound, stage - in orbit around a god-like planet that can shift reality by interpreting dreams and desires. It is a near-perfect match of science fiction and mature drama. Expect to see another film like it sometime after hell freezes over.",Solaris
518,Mareln,Slow and Thoughtful,8,2 January 2014,"I like my sci-fi to be less horror, and more psychological. Solaris fits the bill. The movie starts like a Twilight Zone episode. We see Chris Kelvin, played by George Clooney, looking forlorn while hearing the voice of his wife. Shortly thereafter, he is summoned to take on the task of investigating anomalies on an earth spaceship that has gone somewhat rogue while orbiting Solaris. He finds himself in a bind because he is confronted with a reality that doesn't fit the reality he has come from. Is he ""here""? What is ""here"" from ""there""? His objective reality is shattered by subjective reality, which is as much known as unknown. He is tortured by this psychological enigma. Viola Davis, Jeremy Davies and Natash McElhone deliver fine performances. If you're looking for blood and gore and aliens galore...look elsewhere. This is a thought provoking piece.",Solaris
519,karencmui,"Gorgeous, beautiful and haunting",10,15 August 2003,"i normally don't comment on films, but I was so surprised at how beautiful the visuals were for this film. The storyline, cinematography and music (electronica- similar to  Woob1194 ) fit so well together. George Clooney was also brilliant- my respects to those all who put together this film. A film like this will be remembered more as a piece of art as oppose to the high budget films that only focus on the mainstream commercial market.",Solaris
520,johnez1010,Tries too hard!,4,14 February 2013,"I had read very little about this film before seeing it. I was aware that many people had given it good reviews and i was intrigued as I am a huge fan of all types of science fiction. I am a great fan of Stanley Kubrick. One of the first films I can remember seeing was his 2001: A Space Odyssey when I was 7 years old. My parents were rather forward thinking and took me to see it on the big screen when it was originally released. That film changed the way I saw the world and the way I would look at films for the rest of my life. I can still remember the some of the content of the philosophical discussions that the adults, who saw the film with us, engaged in after the show. The questions that came up most often were ""What was the monolith"" and ""What was the effect it had on the beings it encountered?"" ""Was it a representation of God?"" Solaris is a film that I feel is trying to explore the idea of what is God and what is human? But, Solaris fails miserably in trying to provoke the same thoughts and feelings that Kubrick did so well with 2001. Solaris tries too hard to be another 2001. From the thin, plodding plot line to the loud chorale music pieces that overwhelm the sound track in a number of places, it tries to be 2001. Where Kubrick wowed us with never before seen ground breaking and realistic filming techniques that produced the spacecraft visuals, that are accompanied by beautiful Strauss waltzes, Solaris keeps showing us that same pink planet visual with the same computer generated sounding audio. After reading the book, 2001: A Space Odyssey, I was able to appreciate more the genius of Kubrick in how he showed us enough to make us think about what it was we were seeing and what it meant. Solaris tried to do the same thing, but it only bored and eventually annoyed me. How many ways can a director/writer try to illustrate the same vapid question of ""Is there a God (or creator, or supreme being) and does he care about humans, their relationships with each other, and their emotions"" Plus, 99 minutes is a little to short of a run time to even think about exploring this question. In the end, Solaris was a tedious, boring, confusing at times, uninteresting film about people I couldn't possibly care less about. What we are not shown or not told is a lot and it cripples this story and this film. Maybe I will have a different view of Solaris after reading the book, but after viewing this film I am in no hurry to spend my time reading it.",Solaris
521,skazik,What for?,5,1 September 2003,"The strange attempt to combine Tarkovsky's ""Solaris"" (1972) with Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" (1982).

522,aarondickson4ever,Read the book instead,4,5 September 2003,"As a big fan of the original book I thought this had so much promise to be a true classic, bringing sci-fi and philosophy of the mind together. But I was greatly disappointed, feeling only that a great opportunity had been missed out on. While the book had a hidden depth of discussing human perception and belief, the film seemed to gloss over this, focusing rather more on the love interest, which to me(in the book) was a path for a more philosophical look at human belief. How can we believe what we see? can we truly understand our universe, or will it always remain a mystery to us?Read the book, it will tell you more than the film(and is also a damn sight faster no matter how slow you might read :P )",Solaris

The very mention of the film is now part of a family joke.  While watching the film, the crowd became ever increasingly vocal about how bad it was.  This crowd appeared to be very well behaved otherwise.  It was simply the level of lousy that we were watching that caused the crowd to burst elicit comments like ""I would rather have root canal than watch this again"", ""I can't believe I spent money to see this"", to simply burst out in delirium tainted laughter at watching the absurdity.

I had already been warned that it is very slow, and that definitely helped me suspend judgement until later in the movie.  If you accept the fact that the story could be told in 30 minutes, it is really easy to appreciate the unique aspects of this film.  The cinematography and set design are awesome, and the mysterious and haunting performances that the actors give rival Kubrick at his best.

The presence of the song by ICP (Insane Clown Posse) early on in the film gave me a huge relief. It helped to not take the rest of it with such pain, since the movie does no justice to the novel or the Tarkovsky's version. Someone was either genius to give the hint that film is garbage just as rotten as ICP or it was made by people who aim for a cheap hit that would make a big buck ""on the shoulders of giants"".

528,gigi128,All in his head,8,2 January 2004,"***Spoiler Alert***** I too got pulled into this film and ended up watching it a few times (once with commentary).  I found it more interesting the more I thought about it.  My view on it is probably a bit different and more symbolic than most and not necessarily what was intended.  I see the whole story as Chris Kelvin's grieving process over his wife's death. That everything that goes on in the film can be seen as his going further into his own mind/memory/perceptions to heal from it; to try to come to peace with the memory of her.  The planet Solaris even resembled images of electrical activity in the brain - neurons firing.  The further he goes on his journey, the more dynamic, intense and closer Solaris gets.  The various characters could even be viewed as aspects of himself. Gordon - the ego/defensive/protective side that wants to avoid pain, change; the part that wants to be rid of Rheya's memory altogether; the survival instincts that want to get back to regular life (earth). Snow - the intellect - pure thought, but we see only a ""replica"" of what his intellect was since Rheya's death - the replica is disjointed, fragmented, way ""out there,"" seeming like it should make sense but too vague to be clear.  Gibarian - the charming, outgoing, social - possible husband/father - side who becomes lost after Rheya's death - thus Chris being deadened/robotic in his dealings with the world since.  Trying to find & help the ""Gibarian"" aspect of himself is what sets him on the whole journey.  He ends up having to review his whole history with Rheya - all his ""film clip"" memories of their past.  He has to relive it all and let himself feel (the pain & pleasure) in order to move through it.  Only by fully surrendering and connecting to his child-like self (symbolized by Gibarian's son), no expectations /open to what is to come/innocence is he finally able to come to a place of forgiveness. Forgiveness of both himself & Rheya so he can be at peace with her memory and connect back to himself.",Solaris
529,jpsoccerfan,adventurous bit of film-making,9,11 June 2004,"*****MILD SPOILERS AHEAD (not about the end though)****After having been through most comments posted here, I'm not really surprised to realize that, while some people loved the movie, some found it boring, to put it mildly.First, let me put it bluntly: I loved this movie. But depending on the mood the day I first saw it, I feel like I could have found a better way to spend my time. The line between the two feelings being a thin one.There are undeniable qualities to this movie: first, the music. I hadn't heard an original music that fit so well the movie since Requiem For a Dream. But unlike that of RfaD, where the music would become overwhelming, that of Solaris makes itself non-remarkable, being but another hint at the characters' state of mind, therefore brilliantly serving what should ultimately be a soundtrack's purpose (understand: compared to all those movies which just use the latest hits as loud as possible in order to sound cool, no matter if the songs actually fit what's going on). Secondly, and I know that some here don't share that view, but the visuals and the photography were stunning, and I loved the contrast between the colors used in the scenes on Earth and those aboard the station, which give most scenes this dreamy aura, again completely fitting the story. Also a word about the actors: they are very few speaking parts, but all of them have been cast well, with Clooney showing us yet another face of his talent and Natasha McEhlone simply excellent in the difficult part of Rheya, Clooney's Kelvin's deceased wife, who is the emotional core of the movie.Now about the storytelling in itself: of course, this covers only part of the book, or the original movie for that matter. But this is one of those stories where, unlike Lord of the Rings for instance, there is no real point of retelling the same story word by word. THAT would have been a waste of everybody's time. Instead, Soderbergh chooses to focus on some of the themes, namely the loss, the need for redemption, and the choices we make.But don't expect long and loud theories about all this. Don't expect moral judgments about the characters' actions. Instead, you are shown facts, the slow pace of the film allowing you space and time to put in your own thoughts and feelings.And this maybe for some the problem, and why lots of people have considered this film boring: they are times when no words are said, and little is done. Even at times, the music is completely gone, a kind of pace we're not used to in today's Occidental movie making (compared to Asian's cinema and animation)and that something that we tend to be almost afraid of somehow, like when at dinner when everyone run out of good words and pleasantries and all is left is silence. We always feel uncomfortable, because all we're left with is ourselves. Some days, we can face it. Some days, we cannot.This is exactly what happens with this movie, which, at core, is a mirror to some of our own basic human feelings, and not necessarily those we're always ready to deal with. Therefore, instead of getting dragged, we're are actually asked to participate to this emotional (and NOT intellectual) journey.But are you ready for it?*******************************Luckily for me, I was, and this is why I gave it 9/10, as I've been treated with one of the most powerful emotional journey cinema over the last few years.",Solaris
530,edward-harris,"Could have been better, but decent film!",5,5 October 2013,"These demons are becoming more real once he reaches Solaris on his investigation mission. One of the most memorable scenes for me was the first appearance of Rheya. Kelvin darting out of his bed, hitting his head, trying to wake up and finally understanding that this is real and not a dream. Sent shivers down my spine. And while Chris loses his grip on reality, Rheya becomes more real and more aware of herself and of the fact that her existence is something ""unreal"". At first Rheya is only talking in formulas, but as the film progresses, she develops a new personality and we see Rheya (Solaris) becoming more like Rheya (Earth) again. And there are the two other members of the crew, Dr. Gordon (v. Davis) and Snow (J. Davies). Snow is...- weird, and Davies' creepy characterisation was spot on, IMO. You'll understand *why* Snow acts this way later in the film. The only person choosing reality instead of dreams, and incidentally the only one to survive is Dr. Gordon. She also is the one that ultimately figures out a way to get rid of the apparitions and doesn't hesitate to do so.There is another member of the cast that merits mention and that is the score. In most films, the score is either utterly forgettable or tells you the story in broad strokes and with thumping drums. In this one, it felt like a fifth character, setting the mood for a scene, and freshening up the atmosphere with a little splash of notes here and there. It also kept you in a kind of... trance-like mood in parts, thereby adding another layer to the ""reality or dream?"" question that permeates the film.Soderbergh took Lem's classic science fiction story and made something entirely different from it, but still a classic sci-fi story, exploring love, reality, minds and sanity.",Solaris
531,hawkirkwood,This film is half the length of the first Solaris film but it is infinitely more boring.,1,11 June 2004,"Visually this new adaptation of Solaris is simply dull, as is the plot, the cast and the dialogue. Tarkovsky managed in his version to create stunning imagery which I found extremely thought provoking but this film is just so plain that when I had finished watching I had to wonder why I ever wasted an hour of my life doing so (I say an hour as I had to resort to fast forwarding through most of the painfully irritating flashbacks). Of course I am biased; the reason why I watched this film was to see how it compared to the Tarkovsky film and to be honest I never thought Soderburg and Clooney were up to the job, the best I was hoping for was a film which didn't try to be too clever and instead came up with a few neat innovations for science fiction. Instead the film turned out to be simply the most tedious dialogue I have ever experienced set against endlessly plain futuristic style backdrops broken only by a tacky sex scene featuring an unwelcome view of Clooney's buttocks. Nothing in this film is profound, nothing in this film is entertaining and I can't think of a single reason to recommend anyone this film unless you happen to fancy the leading actors rear end.",Solaris

We entered, found seats (the theater would fill to near capacity) and settled in.The movie began, slowly, and slowed down from there. Myt wife and I kept saying, ""It's got to get better."" It never did. It was too long, to slow, and lacked interest. When it was over, we sighed and wondered aloud why we didn't get up earlier and sneak into a different theater.

534,clffedorak,a beautiful movie,9,28 April 2005,"I saw this movie in its original release in theaters and I don't think that I will be able to stop thinking about it ever. This was one of the most beautifully shot movies I've seen in a long while. The story was a powerful emotional journey which asked many questions about love and life.First the look of this movie, there were so many interesting cinematographic techniques used that I was never bored looking at this movie. The scene when Clooney was at a group session but all the other people were blurry blew me away. Every scene sparked a question, a thought or an idea - what a nice change: a movie that makes you think and not just react. The story of meeting your dead loved one in a space ship above a mysterious planet prompted so many thoughts of what that would be like. Would it be desirable? Would it be everything I hoped? The feelings portrayed in this movie over feelings about a lost loved one felt so true that I thought I was watching my own story on the screen. How would I feel if my lost ones suddenly came back to me? The line that Clooney's wife says that she is only from his memory was so true and yet he doesn't care. Could I turn my back on that person even though it wasn't really her? Mind-blowing!The main criticism of the film was its pacing, some say it is slow but I prefer to say deliberate which leaves time to consider all that's happening. There isn't a lot of physical action in this movie but it's not about that. We have so many movies where all of our senses are under constant assault in order to take advantage of the new technology and not leave us bored that it is a relief to see a movie that is quiet and carefully paced so that we can ponder the questions asked. So many new movies are so frenetic that they seem afraid to show us a movie about people and ideas. Not Solaris. If you want to see a movie that's asks interesting questions while showcasing it in a fabulous looking film, check this one out. And if you like this one I highly recommend Code 46 which is just as good and underrated.",Solaris

It gives the feeling of watching a play where there is a stage but also intimacy that is difficult to find on film. Don't expect the film-makers to hold your hand and guide you through the plot they have, thankfully, given you more credit. You meet the characters in a time and place in which life is in progress, in other words, events have taken place and they are moving into another stage of activity. After the movie you will have questions in your mind of not just the movie but of reality and perceptions within your own life.

These people are also the kind of people who hate Solaris.The people who say it's ""too boring"" are the people with too low of patience and are probably amazed that it doesn't have anyone's limbs flying off. Those who say they don't get it are either not very smart, not very patient, or don't give the movie a chance and say ""Oh, well blow this..."" in the first five minutes. The movie was beautifully composed with the scenes flowing into each other wonderfully and the music giving the perfect touch to the deepness of the movie. (some spoilers...)And in case if you really didn't get it, it's about a guy who's wife had committed suicide in an argument about her unborn son, and his live is a total waste. Every day is depressing to him. So, he gets requested to go on a trip to a space station observing a strangely acting planet. He finds distraught people there, and none of them really give a straight out answer to what's going on. So that night, he dreams about his wife again, and in the morning, she's right next to him. Not remembering how she got there, the guy locks her into a space capsule and sends her off knowing that it couldn't be his wife. He later speaks to the crewmates and they find that the planet seems to be sending them people from their lives that they probably feel guilt over from their memories. The next morning she's there again, and when she finds out that he sent her off in the capsule from a crewmate, she commits suicide like he remembers her; suicidal. So, they find out that Snow had a visitor (himself) and when Snow tried to kill him, he kills Snow.(If you look in the beginning, the blood stain's there from the start. I think Snow had already died before he got there.) He tells them that Solaris is dragging them in and that they should leave. So the other crewmate and him runs to the pod. She rushes in and starts activating it. He's faced with the decision of whether he should go back to his life and live in guilt and depression. (definatly spoilers)If you think about it, Solaris was really giving them all a second chance. It told the other crewmate(forgot her name) that she should go through Snow because she wasn't ready for Solaris. The guy who stayed behind, the main character, had died but seemed that when he woke up he was back on Earth with his wife again. Who really knows about Snow.

This is not some foolish love story (although there is a love theme, but it is for better understanding the human nature). I wonder why people voted so high on this picture. Without reading the book it is not understandable! The plot is a knot of randomly picked issues from the book and doesn't make any sense at all.This movie really let me down.

According to the review in the television guide, it was a three star movie. And given that it sported George Clooney, we expected good things. All the better that it was science fiction, too.The sets are very convincingly done, the sound and lighting are interesting, and the acting excellent. Few complaints about the cinematography except for one scene with fast panning that could have been skipped - that effect was annoying. The movie has one fatal flaw, and that is simply a bad storyline that is slow to the point of being arduous and so lacking in substance as to border on being stupid.

As for the philosophical issues, it looks at the nature of personal identity, the boundaries of what can be known and what can't, the existence and nature of God and whether those topics can even be addressed by humans, and of course, what happens after death. What makes the film interesting is that it sounds out the questions without in any way seeking to supply the answers, except to suggest that those answers cannot be trite. It cleverly references 2001 A Space Odyssey. I think it needs two or three views to get the full benefit, but it does re-pay repeated watching.",Solaris
541,marctessier100,Simply Awful,1,9 February 2005,"Not only was this the worst Sci-Fi movie that I've ever seen, it was also one of the worst movies of ANY genre that I've ever seen. When it comes to movies, I'm really not that critical and I think I'm fairly open-minded. I sincerely cannot understand how anyone could find a single redeeming quality about this movie -with the possible exception of someone that could benefit from video sales. It was awful. Nothing exciting or even remotely interesting happens in this film. Basically, a guy goes to space to figure out a ""mystery"". Unfortunately, he doesn't figure it out and then the movie is over. Now, maybe the film-makers simply ran out of tape before they could film the actual ending of this movie, in which case I'd really be interested in seeing it. All in all, this movie would not be worth watching unless someone was paying you to watch it. Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't watch it on cable or VHS or any other form of media. You will never be able to get the time back that you wasted watching this movie. The thought has crossed my mind that perhaps this movie was a tool used by psychologists conducting some kind of test. Maybe they were measuring how much money an obvious flop could generate on one actors fame, i.e. George Clooney. Or perhaps the for-mentioned psychologists were attempting to test the ""emperor's new clothes"" parable in modern times. For those of you not familiar with this story, let me make the analogy of a notable wine connoisseur saying that a glass of urine was actually an exquisite white wine. Then, said connoisseur waits for other wine connoisseurs to either be honest by saying the wine tastes like urine or to agree out of fear of not having a discriminating enough palette to detect how wonderful the wine really is.

Apparently the planetoid that the space station is orbiting has the power to create a faux human being that exists in the minds of the astronauts. For the protagonist Chris Klein its his wife.Although, the camera work is competent, there is nothing all that awe-inspiring about the concept or the performances for that matter. The story (if the movie has one) is so predictable that you would literally doze off.Solaris falls into that class of movies which are so vague that only Film School 'pseudo' know-it-alls would like to sit and analyze every inane frame just to show off how much more perspicacious their understanding of the fine art of film-making is.

It has some tension but is comparatively laid-back (especially when compared to films like ""Alien"").I was surprised to see Clooney's character, Chris Kelvin, exhibit some true traits of a psychologist. While not exhibited with much depth, the blindness of the character to his own manipulability was intriguing.The vocal tics and absent-mindedness of Davies' character, Snow, added a little depth to the character, although after a few minutes the audience hits bottom with Snow.

548,yang_damian,Never remake a masterpiece,4,14 August 2005,"Solaris is Steven Soderbergh's adaptation of Stanislaw Lem's novel ""Solaris"" and remake of Andrei Tarkovsky's Cannes prized ""Solyaris"". Considering these fact there are too ways of approaching this film: reading Lem's novel/viewing Tarkovsky's movie or none of both. I myself, doing the former two, was very disappointed by this movie. Although this movie is significantly better than most movies that come out of Hollywood it is utterly sloppy compared to Tarkovsky's adaptation. Shure, this movie get's you thinking more than most popcorn flicks, and yes, this is not your average action-adventure-E.T. killing S.F. but the movie fails to focus on the questions it raises.One of Lem's main theme's in his book is man's inherited incapacity of communicating with profoundly alien entities. And profound alien entity is just what Solaris is. That is right - Solaris is not just the planet where most of the film is set but Solaris, or better yet, Solaris' ocean is an entity, a being, possibly a rational being. It is capable of reading human thoughts and capable of forging ""real life illusions"" of friends or family members that haunt the minds of the astronauts living on the space station on Solaris. The fact that ""Solaris"" sends these messengers out, and the fact that the final solution of the characters is to destroy them signifies just this impossibility to establish a connection with the planetary mind. Now you might not get all this just by watching Soderbergh's movie simply because it fails to illustrate these problems either by means of plot, dialogue or plain visual effects. In fact the movie is very poor at explaining what Solaris, the purpose for it is researched and completely cuts out an important part of the original plot that explains the mysterious encounters of a pilot in Solaris' atmosphere.This remake is one hour shorter than Tarkovsky's version and unfortunately it shows. Some people compared this title with 2001: A Space Odysee because of it's long cuts and it's slow and little action. In fact comparing it with Solyaris one can only have the impression that the director made a bet that he could get all the story in an under 100 minutes film.Unfortunately the result lacks consistency. It is hard for the viewer to follow the themes of the movie unless he is already familiar with them from the book or from ""that old Russian movie"".The director hoped this will turn out to be a smart movie like his previous ""Traffic"" but he ended up with this pseudo art movie. It is too low key and psychological for ""Star Wars"" fans and too Hollywood for ""2001"" fans.Rated 4 out of 10 for mediocre, better luck next time,never remake something that's already perfect the way it is",Solaris

551,Merodach,contains spoilers,5,3 October 2005,"There are a number of interpretations that can patch together a resolution for this picture if one is not particularly troubled by plot holes and logical conundrums. For instance, a giddy fantasist could conclude that the main character has reached out to an alien life form and has fallen in love with it: a real wham-bang love story. A determined sci-fi fan might see Blade-Runner-style tragedy. A prodigiously sane person completely unexperienced in mental illness might suppose that main character succumbs to madness. A quick cynic might conclude that passive-aggressive aliens adroitly manipulate the main character's unresolved feelings of love and guilt re: his suicide wife to achieve their nefarious ends. A Socratic person might conclude that if such is the case, the main characters's embrace (a la Cypher in The Matrix) of an illusory ""wife"" in favor of reality is pitiable. A moralist might find the same choice reprehensible; an existentialist, absurd; an aestheticist, disgusting.I don't subscribe to the any of the more generous interpretations. In fact, I am deprived of any interpretation at all, because the story failed to sustain my interest. I freely admit to fast-forwarding through many of the dull silences and duller (though fast-cut) dialog. The picture did not create enough of an illusion for me to suspend my disbelief sufficiently to care about what was actually happening. Here is why the execution, in my view, failed: 1. In what is actually a short picture, the pace is glacial and the film at times downright boring, especially after it is clear that these ""aliens,"" if aliens they are, intend to employ only mild-mannered psychology and low-key guilt trips to obtain their ends (as opposed to ray-guns, spatulas, creepy mind-f#@ks, or anything else that might possibly inspire fear). If any kind of tension is to be sustained, the ""visitors"" phenomena ought to be able to inspire dread of some kind in the viewer. This side of the balance fails however because there is no fight in the main character, who falls for the aliens' machinations almost immediately, with the unsurprising result that the human stakes are too low. We might feel pity for this weak-willed guilt-sodden sap, but hardly fear. Conversely, if one tries to interpret the ""visitors"" phenomena in a positive light, tension also fails, for the same reason: it is obvious that the love-smitten main character will do nothing to harm these visitors. Likewise, that the only other human crew member (if she IS human -- you decide), partly because she is so underdeveloped, likewise poses no real danger to any friendlies. Furthermore, one never gets the impression that the phenomena, however interpreted, represent any ill to the main character that amounts to even one-third of a hill of beans. The main character just isn't man enough.2. Some reviewers clearly were impressed with the emotional reality of the main character-""wife""/visitor relationship. I didn't find much emotional depth, despite all of the in-your-face edits. If we are to be able to imagine we are viewing a picture in which a main character is faced with aliens, human-shaped vorpal bunnies, self-created revenants, mental illness, what have you, the picture ought to be more frightening. Instead, we are left with a main character who weakly succumbs to phenomena that somehow manage to be more soporific than anything else, probably because they spend most of the picture rehashing the main character's relationship with his dead wife. With a weak MC and little sense of threat (i.e., something at stake), my response can only be, WHO CARES?",Solaris

If you cannot prove it but you choose not to believe, why cannot I choose to believe? Like Carl Popper said, scientists have been trying hard to distinguish themselves from metaphysicians, however, science in itself involves a huge amount of metaphysics. Because it is based on a lot of very fundamental assumptions that you can never prove.This world, I would like to say, is contaminated by materialism. There was once a time we people could tolerate and probably accept the existence of all different kinds of believes and we all tried so hard to understand this world. But now, like what scientists would not like to admit, we adore science too much as the flies' passion on rotten foods. We suddenly stopped thinking. We are satisfied with what we have and we are crazy playing with it. We are not only enjoying it, we want more. Still not knowing what we are and why we are here, we keep a thirst for the things that don't even know if we are supposed to possess.All creatures, with or without a brain, do stupid things when they are satisfied. Once upon time we were so happy declaring that we were unique. However, after years, we turned no more than the dirty monkeys in Gulliver's trip. So we came to Solaris, with great ambition and unexplainable confidence. We came here for the entire human race on the Earth, although we still don't have a single clue of what we are on that planet for.A lot of humanists sensed this huge question mark. Kubrick's 2001 also demonstrated a possibility of getting closer to the keys of big questions by not depending on science too much. If there are most arrogant scientists, the craziest words they could possibly say might be, OK gentlemen, we are familiar enough with our planet. Only the most stupid of the most arrogant believe that we can explain things even out of this planet, such as in Solaris, using what we learnt on Earth.I know that my interpretation involves some subjective thoughts and feelings. However, I can be sure that Soderbergh doesn't deny the possibility of multiple explanations of the world or the universe and he believes that we have the right to choose among them.""Hello, Neo. Look, here is a Matrix inside which people live regularly with rules created by God and guaranteed by computers. Also, you have the power of destroying it. What do you think? To be, or not to be?"" Solaris is such an elegant movie with profound retrospection, beautiful photography and reasonably good acting. It is set on a stage that seems so strange but so familiar. It could be Solaris. It could also be inside our mind. Soderbergh reminded us again, that if there is anything that makes us human race so special, it is the spirit we possess.

Soderberg does not try to do a remake, or a film of the book, he does what anyone who has any sense does. he takes the idea that works in the book. and changes it to work as an excellent film. the combination of the screenplay, directing, acting and cliff Martinez' awesome, atmospheric soundtrack all come together and make Solaris nothing short of a masterpiece.The film is really like an art exhibition in a way, some people may not enjoy, but if you're going to watch it, do so with an open mind and just enjoy the truly superb piece of film making.",Solaris

The film caters more for the intellectual sci-fi buff. A psychological thriller come love story dealing with ones inner most guilt and desires. Thought provoking well presented film. Clooney is cast in a role far removed from the genre he usually stars in. Not having read the book or seen the original I had no preconceived expectation and found the film watchable although it could be slow at times. The special effects are believable especially the majestic opening scene as Clooney's ship approaches the space station orbiting Solaris. The score does the job of setting the mood. Overall not a bad film.,Solaris
