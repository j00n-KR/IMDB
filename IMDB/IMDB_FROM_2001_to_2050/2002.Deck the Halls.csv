0,TheLittleSongbird,Not enough festive spirit to make this film remotely enjoyable,2,21 June 2010,"Deck the Halls is strikingly filmed, and the soundtrack is great, but as a film it is quite mean-spirited and unfunny. The story is simple, but it is also predictable, clichéd and mediocre, while the scripting is weak and lacking in laughs, same with the gags which were rather cheap.The direction was not particularly great either, like the film itself, it was lacking in heart. The ending held no surprises either, I admit I smelt the ending a mile off. And to add insult to injury, the characters are unlikeable and quite obnoxious. Matthew Broderick is flat here, while Danny DeVito is wasted, and he can be funny, so that was a disappointment. In fact only Kristen Chenoweth had any spark. The pacing is uneven, either rushed or languid, and there just isn't enough festive spirit to make Deck the Halls enjoyable.Overall, bah humbug, this could have been so much better. 2/10 Bethany Cox",Deck the Halls
1,bkoganbing,"""The Christmas Man""",4,19 December 2015,"If you want to see a film where Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito act like juveniles than Deck The Halls is for you. Of course some juveniles might get offended.Broderick plays the unofficial Cloverdale, Massachusetts consultant on Christmas decoration and decor. That is until DeVito comes to town and moves across the street. DeVito is gauche and city born and bred and in Kristin Chenoweth has this Playboy Centerfold wife with a pair of twin daughters who take after mom. They arouse jealousy in Broderick's daughter Alia Shawkat, but in his young son Dylan Blue the hormones begin their first rage. Chenoweth does bond somewhat with Broderick's wife Kristin Davis.Broderick's pride and joy is his own tastefully decorated house during the Yuletide season. The rather shy and retiring optometrist gets put in the shade by DeVito's gaudy display of Christmas lights. But it's costing him some big bucks for this ostentatious show and eventually his job as a car salesman.These two really start acting like fools over the whole thing. Grownups simply aren't supposed to act the way they do, but Broderick is entering a second childhood and DeVito looks like he never grew up.I can safely say this is not going to be on anyone's list of great Christmas movies though it does beat out Santa Claus Conquers The Martians considerably.",Deck the Halls
2,SnoopyStyle,didn't laugh once,4,21 December 2015,"Mild-mannered optometrist Steve Finch (Matthew Broderick) loves Christmas. He lives with his wife (Kristin Davis) and kids (Alia Shawkat, Dylan Blue). He plans his Christmas starting from December first. He organizes Winterfest for his town of Cloverdale, Massachusetts. Buddy Hall (Danny DeVito), his wife (Kristin Chenoweth) and their hot twin daughters move in across the street. Buddy is a new car salesman who is able to sell a car to the dealership's owner. However he can't stick to one thing. He puts up his Christmas lights to be seen from space. Steve starts getting annoyed with Buddy.I didn't laugh once and I'm not sure exactly why. Matthew Broderick plays it like a lesser Jim McAllister from Election. Danny DeVito play it a bit normal. Neither is likable. I don't care about them. I don't care about Steve and his passive aggressive issues. The wives aren't that compelling. The kids do a couple of things but nothing funny. The whole movie feels flat. I'm not annoyed or angry. I just feel nothing for this movie.",Deck the Halls
3,Prismark10,Dim the lights,2,14 December 2014,"In Deck the Halls stuffy optician Steve Finch (Matthew Broderick) always plans a traditional Christmas for the family and organizes the town's Christmas display.His brash new neighbour Buddy Hall (Danny DeVito) a car salesman moves in and plans to have the brightest display in town and wants his lights to be seen from space much to the Finch's chagrin.This is a film with a Christmas themed 'neighbours at war' idea and as its a comedy it means you have to have mishaps leading to hilarious consequences such as a can of gasoline inexplicably outside a Pine tree display in the woods despite falling on snow somehow ignites when a tree is chopped by an axe. When your young children exclaim how could this happen you kind of guess this is all nonsense.However the film is full of this type of unfunny scrapes, there are no nice characters in this film. Broderick is a stuffy bore, DeVito is annoying as hell. I could never understand how others in the town liked DeVito so much and its never explained in an early scene in the car showroom how he managed to sell the car so fast to the owner of the car lot. You just have to take it as read he is an ace salesman because of his boorish charm.The film is lazily written, its not funny, even when the duo make up at the end you do not feel much as you knew it was going to happen and you never liked them in the first place. There is little chemistry between the characters because it is so badly written and directed with the actors making the best of a bad job. The film was rightly nominated for the Raspberry Awards.",Deck the Halls
4,jboothmillard,Deck the Halls,3,23 November 2010,"I seems obvious that every well known and successful actor should do at least one Christmas in their career, so here was the offering from the two male leads. Basically eye doctor Steve Finch (Matthew Broderick) is an expert when it comes to Christmas, and with the holiday approaching he wants all the usual traditions to be ready for him and his family, wife/mother Kelly (Sex and the City's Kristin Davis), and kids Madison (Alia Shawkat) and Carter (Dylan Blue). Then they notice a new family moving into the house the other side of the street, it is car salesman Buddy Hall (Razzie nominated Danny DeVito) and his family, wife/mother Tia (RV: Runaway Vacation's Razzie nominated Kristin Chenoweth) and his twin daughters Ashley (Kelly Aldridge) and Emily (Sabrina Aldridge). Soon enough it is obvious Buddy isn't your regular friendly neighbour, as he is buying a large amount of fairy lights, outside decorations and a range of other Christmas accessories. After looking at a satellite picture on the computer using the website MyEarth (spoofing Google Earth), he is desperate to light up his house so bright that his house will be seen from space. As time goes by, and Steve has mishaps involving Buddy, including a trip in frozen water on a Santa sleigh, his car damaged and a few other things, Buddy is gaining the reputation as the new ""Christmas Guy"". Steve has sat back and suffered through these small disasters long enough and feels the need to complain and have a more peaceful Christmas, even if it means stopping Buddy from achieving what he wants. They challenge each other to the WinterFest speed skating race to determine what happens to the lights, which Buddy has using Steve's power systems to light up, but he wins. So Steve tries to make Buddy suffer with the racket of some powerful and illegal fireworks, but he just ends up wrecking his own house, making the family leave him, and the same goes for Buddy. Buddy starts taking down the lights, but Steve knows how much it means to him, so they decide to end the rivalry, and all the people from the town bring all the lights they can to help Buddy. In the end, live on the MTV news the decorations are completed and the lights are activated, it doesn't work, and they have a big carol sing, before the lights do work and Buddy's house is indeed visible from space. Also starring Lost's Jorge Garcia as Wallace and Harold & Kumar Get the Munchies' Kal Penn as Amit Sayid - Satellite Computer Tech. I was a bit unsure of Broderick's casting, DeVito was a bit annoying most of the time, and as you'd expect it is a high amount of lame slapstick laughs and sentimental mush for the family, a bit of a silly seasonal comedy. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Excuse for Family Entertainment. Adequate!",Deck the Halls
5,ccthemovieman-1,How They Did It Is Better Than What They Did,6,31 January 2008,"To put it briefly, this was an entertaining movie, gave me a number of laughs and was also extremely stupid and insulting to anyone's intelligence. But, if you look at it strictly as a farce, it will do for a 90-minute diversion. Just don't take any of the characters seriously and try not to get annoyed - which isn't easy - at the typical comedy clichés that are in this movie. And - as some others have pointed out - do not watch this with your kids; it's not ""family fare.""Many of the dumb ""Hollywood stereotypes"" you've endured in comedies the last few decades are in this film. A few examples: the obnoxious kids who say clever things; the typical family story where the men are made to look stupid while the women are smart and sensible; one guy who is a total crook is pictured as sympathetic; things happen in minutes that would take days to occur, unnecessary sex jokes, on and on. Yet, through it all, there are some funny lines of dialog and the Christmas lights on Danny DeVito's house are great fun to see.This comedy also reminded me a lot of ""What, About Bob?"" as DeVito slowly drives neighbor Matthew Broderick almost crazy as Bill Murray did to Richard Dreyfuss. I'm told it also was like the National Lampoon's Christmas Story but I never saw that.What was very interesting were two five-minute featurettes which came with the DVD. In it, is explained and shown how the movie makers built the two houses from scratch, put in all the incredible lights and light show and how it was made to look dark. The story takes place in a mythical town in Massachusetts (where nobody in the film, by the way, has an accent!) but was filmed in Vancouver in July where they were only getting six hours of darkness per night. Most of the film takes place at night so they also built as 60-foot high ark-like building over the two big houses! Incredible!",Deck the Halls
6,paul_haakonsen,Good Christmas comedy...,6,29 December 2015,"""Deck the Halls"" is actually a fun and enjoyable Christmas comedy. Of course it doesn't match the 1989 ""Christmas Vacation"". However, I will say that ""Deck the Halls"" is noteworthy and does compliment the genre well enough.It is much in the same League as ""Christmas Vacation"", as it is the Holiday feud of two neighbors competing to have the role of the local Christmas guy - the guy who is the heart of the Christmas season. And things quickly escalates out of control in no time.Danny DeVito and Matthew Broderick actually were great in their roles in this 2006 movie. But especially Broderick surprised with his performance in ""Deck the Halls"".The movie is fun and entertaining for the whole family, and there are some good laughs throughout the movie. It was just a shame that there weren't more funny scenes though, because it would have lifted the movie further up.If you want a fun movie for the Christmas holidays and want an alternative to ""Christmas Vacation"" then give ""Deck the Halls"" a chance. I have seen it for the past two Christmas holidays now, and believe that it will become a holiday tradition for me, just as ""Christmas Vacation"" is.",Deck the Halls
7,michaelRokeefe,Just can't get enough of those Christmas lights!,4,14 November 2007,"This Christmas comedy has its moments; and is better than a lot of the recent holiday fare. Steve Finch(Matthew Broderick)lives for the Christmas holidays; after all he is the town's Christmas authority. Steve's wife Kelly(Kristin Davis)is finally disagreeing with his regimental holiday mode. When a new neighbor movies in; Steve's disciplined world becomes a battleground. Buddy(Danny DeVito)is a short little man with great big dreams and his latest is to decorate his new home with enough holiday lights that it can be seen from outer space. Buddy's wife Tia(Kristin Chenoweth)is almost certain this all will be another one of her husband's many failures. Steve is not going to take a back seat to his new neighbor and goes on a personal mission to thwart Buddy's grandiose plans. There is some crude and lightly suggestive humor that really is not that much out of place. There are some holiday flicks out there that are a whole lot dumber. Also in the cast: Sean O'Bryan, Alia Shawkat, Dylan Blue plus Sabrina and Kelly Aldridge. I think Chenoweth is the brightest star in DECK THE HALLS.",Deck the Halls
8,studioAT,A Christmas turkey of a film,1,3 December 2017,"This film about two rival neighbours competing to have the best Christmas lights should have been great, ITV did a one off Drama about a similar scenario and pulled it off well, but this is a mess.The worst thing is that it wastes a great cast, led by Matthew Broderick and Danny De Vito, but nothing can paper over the fact that this film has a weak script, and actually, a poor sense of Christmas spirit.I know at this time of year people will watch anything remotely festive, but this film has the potential to make anyone a Scrooge.",Deck the Halls
9,hitchcockthelegend,What is your favourite Christmas memory?,4,28 December 2010,"Deck the Halls is directed by John Whitesell and stars Danny DeVito, Matthew Broderick, Kristin Davis & Kristin Chenoweth. Plot sees Broderick & DeVito as warring neighbours who try to out Christmas each other during the festive season.Seasonal movies are notoriously hard to get right, particularly those set around the Christmas period. Even the most popular and fondly thought of ones still have their detractors and carry around a sort of sentimental baggage that many critics refuse to kowtow too. Deck the Halls, sadly, is the sort of film that still further sets back the Christmas movie's chance of getting a fair crack of the critical whip. In truth it's a pretty inoffensive movie, one that boasts a couple of very watchable leads, but the laughs are sparse and the plot as thin as a pre ghostly visited Ebenezer Scrooge's Christmas dinner. Even as the inevitable feel good factor starts to kick in for the final quarter, the makers feel the need to shoe-horn in a song moment that's so full of treacle it vanquishes what little good Xmas spirit was built up in the run in.Danny and Matthew deserve better, and ultimately so do those viewers like me who are mostly forgiving on the Christmas movie. 4/10",Deck the Halls
10,dbborroughs,This could have been a classic in better hands and minus Matthew Broderick,4,16 September 2007,"Matthew Broderick plays an anal retentive eye doctor who lives for Christmas. Danny DeVito moves in across the street and decides to put enough lights on his house so that it can be seen from space. Not the nightmare some reviews made it out to be this is a movie that shows too many signs of being messed with. Its clear that the producers had no idea what type of movie that wanted to make. The style of comedy varies from scene to scene as do the performances as if they were going with what ever they wanted for that day.Matthew Broderick is awful as the uptight jerk who wants things a certain way for tradition. Its a bad part badly played. frankly why his family hadn't left him prior to this is beyond me. DeVito as a super salesman who gets bored easily is fine (hence the lights). He's not the monster some have said and actually has a character to play. The rest of the cast is fine doing what ever they are doing. More misfire than disaster, this is ultimately a forgettable movie- and one that could be remade into a a holiday semi-classic in the right hands.",Deck the Halls
11,lastliberal,"Hey baby, who's your daddy?",4,23 December 2007,"One would think that a holiday movie with Danny DeVito might be funny. After all, he is a funny man.One would certainly think that Kristin Chenoweth would be great as she was on ""The West Wing."" One would be wrong on both counts. I really didn't expect much from Matthew Broderick, and i didn't get much, but I did hope for more from the others.Chenowith played the same type of trailer trash that she did in RV; this time exploiting the Aldridge twins, Kelly and Sabrina, to get cheap tasteless laughs as they were portrayed as teen sluts.There just wasn't much Christmassy as De Vito and Broderick came off as a couple a juveniles. Not a laugh in the whole film.",Deck the Halls
12,anaconda-40658,Deck the Screenwriter.,3,4 February 2016,"Deck the Halls (2006): Dir: John Whitesell / Cast: Matthew Broderick, Danny De Vito, Kristen Davis, Kristen Chenoweth, Jackie Burroughs: Crappy Christmas spectacle about overdoing things such as making this film. It regards two neighbors who compete with regards to who will be noted as the Christmas guy. Matthew Broderick plays an optometrist while new neighbor Danny De Vito sells cars. De Vito wishes to get enough lights on his house that it will be seen from space. All I can say is that as long as this film isn't seen from space then we are better off. Director John Whitesell improves over his previous junk Big Momma's House 2 with perhaps the best element being De Vito's house. With that said, this is not much of an improvement. Both belong in a trash bag and lit on fire. Broderick and De Vito deliver among their worst performances while Kristen Davis and Kristen Chenoweth are given the unholy task of portraying their wives. The behavior displayed here is on par with the hideous Christmas With the Kranks where a couple is harassed by their neighbors when they decide not to put up Christmas decorations. This is not normal behavior and it certainly isn't funny to see two grown men compete in an event that is as mindless as what's presented here. The antics are so over the top that this film should be decked with five dozen good size rocks. Score: 3 / 10",Deck the Halls
13,FlashCallahan,I want my house to be seen from space.....,5,13 October 2012,"Centered around two neighbours in a small town, who go to war when one of them decides to decorate his house with a so many Christmas lights that they are visible from space.The neighbourhood is turned upside down as the families try to discover the true meaning of Christmas, and each other......The thing is with Christmas films is that you can generally tell what is going to happen by the poster imagery. See Fred Claus, Christmas with the Kranks et al.And most Christmas films have their own formula. The main family (Brodericks) are the homely type who want an easy life. Enter the kooky family who are likable but annoying to the father of the other family.The father of the 'good' family becomes the bad person of the film, and tries to redeem himself several times before the end.There are set pieces that involve the two leads battling for some reason, usually sport related, and the underdog wins.Everybody at the end learns some life lesson, and the true meaning of Christmas is shared to all.This is no exception, it's watchable holiday pap, all the cast are fine, and it ticks all the relevant boxes.It's no wonderful life, scrooged, or Die Hard, it's one of those Christmas movies that will be on TV probably the week before Christmas, and you'll watch it, and forget.",Deck the Halls
14,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Deck the Halls,6,2 December 2006,"You know the Christmas season is coming when the theatres start to line up its Christmas themed movies. You have comedies like Deck the Halls, one for the romantics in The Holiday, and of course, going back to basics with the retelling of the birth of Jesus Christ in The Nativity Story.The very first Matthew Broderick movie I've watched is Wargames, when I was a kid. And I thought he would have had quite a stellar career with his boyish good looks. Well, it's been almost 20 years, and that dude still retains his baby face, though now given age he's taken on roles of the family guy, and as Steve Finch, he's known as the Christmas guy around town, for his role in the committee for spreading the Christmas cheer. Until of course, his new neighbour, the Halls, move in, and innocently starts a rivalry with Buddy Hall (Danny DeVito), which in certain instances, look as petty as those squabbling neighours in the Joo Chiat area.And family comedies like Deck the Halls are as predictable as they come by, with the setup of the dysfunctional characters. In the Finches, you have the straight laced Steve, the model mom Kelly (Kristin Davis), the depressed son Carter (Dylan Blue) and the coming of age daughter Madison (Alia Shawkat). At the other corner, you have the Buddy the father, with a penchant for giving up the things that he does, the ditzy mom Tia (Kristin Chenoweth, reprising a role so similar to her RV one as yet another blonde yodeling mom), and two, totally hot teenage twin daughters in Ashley (Sabrina Aldridge) and Emily (Kelly Aldridge), which are unfortunately, flower vase roles.The feud starts when Ashley and Emily suggest to Buddy that their new home cannot be viewed from MyEarth (a fictional Google Earth clone), and to Buddy, one way to do that is to light up his home so that it could be seen from outer space. That's the primary premise, and naturally, by doing that, you disturb the neighbours, the Finches. So begins the one-up-manship between the two guys, egos bursting and all, as they outwit and try to outlast each other, much to the disapproval of their wives and kids.It does make you think though, that in this spirit of giving and forgiving, that these two men are actually doing the direct opposites in upholding their Christmas values. Steve wants his (boring) family traditions to continue, and he does so in a very boorish manner, with his frequent complaining, whining, and sabotaging. Buddy on the other hand, steals. It portrays typical hypocritical behaviour that in your laughter, you're forced to think enough about whether you actually fall under the same category in this season of goodwill toward all men and women.The flaws in the movie are obvious, such as the poor editing which dazzled itself during the Winterfest scenes. I suspect that a lot of footage containing various set action pieces were shot, and some discarded for time and quality, while the Who's Your Daddy joke just couldn't not to be included. Given its budget, cheap CG shots also distracted and took the mickey out of the fun factor.Given that it's a Christmas movie, it definitely must have the feel good factor, which accounts for its implausible ending that cannot happen given time constraints, unless of course, you deem it a miracle. It's feel good, though some in the audience were manipulated enough to shed some tears at the end. And what of the message? It's obviously Love Thy Neighbours, and to relook into man made traditions that seem to stifle rather than make closer the valued family ties.But as goodwill extended to this movie, although it'll never be a classic, will be the impressive light show sequence, as lights are made to dance in tune to the yuletide songs. One wonders who much time, effort and money went to create that show, which is this movie's pièce de résistance. And I appreciate that little clip from Meet Me in St Louis starring Judy Garland - watch that if you can.",Deck the Halls

Time-Pass!'Deck the Halls' Synopsis: Two neighbors have it out after one of them decorates his house for the holidays so brightly that it can be seen from space.'Deck the Halls' is flawed, but funny nonetheless.

16,StevePulaski,The runner up for worst holiday film. Ever.,2,10 December 2010,"Curiosity killed the cat, and will soon kill me if I continue to punish myself with lame, panned, awful films. Especially ones around this time of year. It's Christmas for God's sake. A time of loving, caring, cherishing the people around you, and giving thanks for everything that has blessed you. It's not time to subject yourself to horrible Christmas films jammed with slapstick antics, and two respectable actors submersing themselves to the lowest form of Comedy hell. We are far from the bottom of the barrel. This is Christmas Hell! I love Matthew Broderick. His look, smile, face, and acting abilities are something I envy. I wish I looked like Ferris Bueller when I saw it. Now, I can barely take him seriously after I saw this. He was the best person in this film, but that is certainly not saying much. He was below average, but way better than Kristen Davis' or Danny Devito's performance in this horrendous picture.The plot: Steve Finch (Broderick) is a father of two, and is trying to live his life calm and collective. Buddy Hal (DeVito) moves in across the street, and before they get fully acquainted, you know they are going to be the best of enemies. Buddy's goal is to get his house seen from space, so he buys as many Christmas lights has possible and decorates, scratch that, floods his house with gleaming, annoying strands of lights so bright that one could look directly at the sun and not feel so much pain. Annoying Steve greatly, he decides to fight back.We then get an hour of Steve trying to get Buddy to take down his lights and it just leads to nowhere, thus leaving Steve in a bind and the viewer wishing he had went to see another film. I've never sat through a more painful, unfunny, minuscule, appalling Christmas film in the fourteen holiday seasons I've lived through.This ranks up with the 2006 remake of A Year Without Santa Claus for worse holiday film ever made. I would name this #2 in the list of worst of it's kind. It's films like this that make me NEVER want to watch or go within five feet of a Broderick or DeVito film. It tainted the reps of both of them for me, and will take an Oscar film to get my respect for them back. How many people have had to say that about a film? The holiday season is supposed to be for eating a big meal, hanging with the family, spreading love, cherishing time together, and of course watch some Holiday classics. Do yourself a favor this holiday season, stay warm, drink some Egg Nog, be safe, and watch a Christmas classic like Hardrock, Coco, and Joe, I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus, or see how Charlie Brown spends his for the countless time. DO NOT go out of the tradition's path to watch this miserable film. My Christmas is ruined now that I put this in my player, yours doesn't need to be.Starring: Matthew Broderick, Danny DeVito, Kristin Davis, and Kristin Chenoweth. Directed by: John Whitesell.",Deck the Halls
17,Smells_Like_Cheese,There could have been a few more laughs,5,23 November 2006,"Every year there is a Christmas movie released, and it's always the typical family friendly flick that gets pretty annoying and predictable, in fact there really hasn't been any good Christmas movies past Home Alone and Christmas Vacation. When I saw the trailer to Deck the Halls, I was so excited, because I'm a fan of Danny and Matthew, they're both great comedic actors and this seemed like a great film for Christmas and how obsessive people are over the holidays.Steve is a family man who is intending to make the holidays brighter for his depressed kids and over shadowed wife, he is also love by the community. A new family moves in across the street, Buddy and his family are genuinely nice people but rub Steve off the wrong way, especially since Buddy is upset that his house cannot be seen from outer space and figures that Christmas lights will fix that problem. While all the other family members of both guys are getting along great, the guys end up competing with each other to see who will be the Christmas King of the town.Matthew and Danny who you'd think would be the perfect comedic duo actually didn't spark anything that grabbed me and the jokes were pretty predictable. While this movie was over all a slight disappointment, actually, I'd say there are a few good little laughs her and there, it is a cute Christmas movie, but like I said, just stick with the classic Christmas comedies.5/10",Deck the Halls

19,sddavis63,It's Not Awful But It's Certainly Not A Christmas Classic,6,5 July 2008,"""Deck The Halls"" was clearly inspired at least to some extent by ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,"" with the main plot being essentially an extension of what for ""Vacation"" was a subplot. In this movie, Buddy (Danny DeVito) drives his neighbour Steve (Matthew Broderick) crazy with an outrageous display of Christmas lights on his house, in much the same way as Clark Griswold did to his neighbours in ""Vacation."" In the same way, ""Deck The Halls"" copies ""Vacation"" by showing the passage of time by the opening of the dates on a Christmas calendar. Unfortunately, ""Deck The Halls"" is nowhere near as funny as ""Vacation,"" although it does have its moments. I especially think of Steve's accidental horse-drawn sleigh ride as one that drew a few laughs from me. The real problem with the comparison between the two movies though is the spirit that fills it. Irritating though he was at times, Clark Griswold was a lovable character who always meant well. Steve and Buddy are just plain not very nice and really quite unlovable characters. Steve is an uptight guy obsessed with Christmas traditions and rituals to the point at which he saps the joy out of the season. Buddy on the other hand brings some joy back to the town, but his goal is essentially self-centred: he wants to make a name for himself by having so many lights on his house that it will be seen from space, and he doesn't care about the impact of this on his neighbours. His character is also not particularly well-developed and he's a bit of a mystery to be honest. By the end, of course, there's reconciliation (it is, after all, a Christmas movie) but the overall mood was a mean-spirited one throughout. There were also some logical inconsistencies in the story (not surprising, perhaps, given the kind of movie this is). I think especially of the scene in which Buddy is called into his manager's office and told that his job as a car salesman is in danger because his sales are down? Huh? Down from what? According to the passage of time in the movie, Buddy hasn't worked there for more than a couple of weeks.Having said that, Broderick and DeVito were superb in their respective roles, as were Kristin Davis and Kristin Chenowyth as their long-suffering wives. I also appreciated that the movie ended with the singing by the townsfolk of ""O Holy Night."" In the end, they did get the real meaning of Christmas in there. They made this worth watching, but it isn't destined to be a Christmas classic. 6/10",Deck the Halls
20,Lejink,Lights on but nobody home!,4,16 December 2012,"Expanding on a plot strand if you can call it that, from both a ""Simpsons"" episode and ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"", this Christmas feud has a few mild laughs but not much else going for it. It really is quite strangely cast in my opinion, Matthew Broderick exuding zero charisma as the Christmas control freak threatened by upstart neighbour Danny DeVito's arrival on the scene with his po' white trash wife and two nubile teenage daughters. It all escalates when DeVito hits on the idea of wanting his Christmas decorations to be seen from outer space, putting Broderick's nose still further out of joint with ever more extravagant lighting displays before the inevitable reconciliation in time for the happy ending.DeVito's casting is suspect too, he must be about plenty-something years older than his screen wife here, who likewise seems too young to be the mother of their daughters. The narrative is bitty and episodic, lacking laugh-out-load set-pieces and the interacting of the leads is similarly nondescript. Minor characters flit across the screen, most bizarrely a cross-dressing police officer, but none engage the attention much.There are plenty of Christmas songs on the soundtrack as you'd expect, but even these, to my ears, seem less widely-known and rarely seem to aid the story itself. In fact the brightest thing on show are the fantastic light displays on DeVito's house with the acting pretty flat all round, even DeVito seeming bored by the proceedings.On the whole then, a somewhat disappointing movie which tries too hard to exude seasonal jollity",Deck the Halls
21,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Beyond abysmal family movie that I have to wonder why I even bothered watching,2,17 December 2008,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning This is the part of the review where I provide the plot summary. I've become accustomed to using it to start the review off, to give an idea of what the film is about and describe it in as detailed a way as I can. But I really think detail just doesn't describe the plot to Deck the Halls. It's about as detailed as this: Danny De Vito's character wants to use tacky Christmas decorations to make his house so bright it can be seen from space and his neighbour (Matthew Broderick) tries to stop him. Wow. If that sounds like a great plot to you, I'm sure you'll love Deck the Halls. For more demanding viewers though, it's a bit too thin and whimsical to stand the duration of a movie, even if it is under an hour and a half. The lead stars, both fading actors who haven't had a hit for a while, only seem to add to the problems, Broderick apathetic and lazy in his role, while De Vito goes through the motions doing his usual loud, obnoxious American act. You might force a chuckle here and there but overall your lasting thought will be less a feeling of festive cheer and more an insult that rhymes with the title. *",Deck the Halls

He comes up with the idea of making his house bright enough to be seen from outer space. All the lights and traffic begin to aggravate Steve Finch. He makes an attempt to sabotage Buddy's lights, but his attempt isn't very successful. He competes with Buddy in the town speed skating contest. Steve's wife gets along with Buddy's and she and kids begin doing things different. Steve wants everything done the same as in the same ""family traditions.""

Well, maybe not. but quite a pleasant film, actually",6,27 December 2006,"Steve Finch (Matthew Broderick) is smallish Cloverdale, Massachusetts's town optometrist. He also is determined to create great holiday memories at Christmastime for, as he explains, he was an army brat and moved too often to experience a traditional Xmas. Therefore, Steve has his family on a schedule that includes hanging wreaths and singing carols. He is also a big supporter for the town's winterfest celebrations. Enter Buddy Hall (Danny Devito). He and his wife have just purchased the house next door and Buddy has got the holiday spirit, too, in a big way. He wants enough lights on his house to assure it can be spotted from outer space! Buddy and Steve get off on the wrong foot from the start, with Buddy's light-and-music show giving Steve insomnia and stress. Can these two get into the true holiday spirit of forgiveness and harmony? This is a nice addition to the holiday movie repertoire. Broderick and Devito are fine as the quarreling neighbors, with Devito turning down his manic comedy just a bit, with welcome results. The rest of the cast is well chosen, too. The look of the film is arresting and the costumes and scenery quite appealing. Near the end of the flick, there is a sweet moment when the lights go out and the lovely song, O Holy Night, is resonating. What a great way to remind everyone for the true reason for the holiday, amid the humorous chaos of the rest of the picture. If you want to see something new this holiday or in the future, this one will do nicely for a family gathering.

The problem with ""Deck the Halls"", is it simply isn't outrageous enough. I'm sure it's due to the PG rating, as R rated Christmas films are undoubtedly a tough sell to the studio. There are other problems, including Matthew Broderick's mummified performance. The film would have benefited from DeVito playing off a character you really sympathized with, which is not the case with Broderick. What you are left with is a tepid comedy, which is certainly no ""Christmas Vacation"", but still enjoyable. If Christopher Walken had played Matthew Broderick's part, and it was PG13 or R rated, ""Deck the Halls"" might have been a Christmas classic. - MERK",Deck the Halls

It starts with too neighbors named Doug(Matthew Broderick) and Buddy(Danny Devito) who start out as friendly, but soon become competitive on who is better at being Mr. Christmas, soon the season does not seem to jolly anymore, much of the dismay and annoyance of there families. I wouldn't call this film the greatest, if I were to compare it with ELF(2003), I 'd say ELF would win that round, but if I were to compare it Christmas With The Kranks(2004), I'd say Deck The Halls wins by a long shot.",Deck the Halls

Matthew Broderick is a little forgettable here but still produces a good display. Kristin Chenoweth is probably the best of the rest, but it's all about DeVito in truth.I mentioned the heart works with the aforementioned actor, but elsewhere it's a a bit hit-and-miss.

And so it's a back and forth war of wits between the two men, none of which is particularly funny.

That's right - it's about Christmas spirit.Buddy Hall (Danny DeVito), in trying to alleviate his self-esteem issues, decides to light up his house so brightly it can be seen from space. Luckily, it's Christmas, when snideness and unbridled, irrational spending are rife in suburban middle America, so Buddy buys enough Christmas tree lights to festoon his house and p-off his anal neighbor, Steve (Matthew Broderick).Steve used to be the ""Christmas guy"" in town before Buddy moved onto the block, so - being Christmas, when competitiveness and backbiting are in season - he decides to reclaim his crown by attempting to out-Christmas Buddy.Idiot-fest ensues, involving sub-standard comedic effort put into ice-skating races, chopping down trees, dumb-hot-chick jokes, noise pollution, cross-dressing cops and crimes that would warrant jail time anywhere in the world except in a Christmas movie.If ""being seen from space"" is Buddy's objective, and cost is obviously no object, why not 2000W Lycian spotlights blaring upwards, instead of 5W Christmas bulbs? Insipid Kristin Davis (that insipid chick from SEX AND THE CITY) finds herself married to the real life husband of her pal from SEX AND THE CITY, Sarah Jessica Parker, making the reasons for her hesitancy to get intimate with Broderick quite obvious, though nicely adding to her real life sheen of insipidity.Written by three first-time TV writers who think we're as idiotic as they are, and directed by John Whitesell (MALIBU'S MOST WANTED, 2003) like an insult to retarded people, DECK THE HALLS is one of those skin-rashing elements of Christmas that make us thankful it only comes once a year.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",Deck the Halls
36,Sirus_the_Virus,When great actors make horrible decisions.,1,4 December 2009,"Deck the halls, starring great stars Matthew Broderick and Danny Devito, and others like Kristen Chenoweth and Kristen Davis, is a real shame. It's sure to make your Christmas tree explode. ""It's fun for the whole family"" some critics say. Perhaps not about this movie. Hopefully not about this movie. When you see great actors like Devito and Broderick starring in such crap, it could make you tear up. It might eat you up inside. Get ready for Deck the halls, a dreadful film experience that puts great actors to shame.The plot is simple stuff. Of course it is, but it's actually kind of stupid and ridiculous. It's the story of a Docter(Played by Matthew Broderick) who gets really into the holiday spirit. Kind of like the retarded town in Christmas with the Kranks. Another stupid one. This doctor's life and his family's change when a neighbor(Played by Danny Devito) moves in. This neighbor wants his Chirstmas lights to be seen from space. That is what starts off this overly clichéd mess. The two neighbors compete for the best lights. Doing whatever they can to ruin the other persons.There is one part of the movie where Devito's character quits his job for these lights. There is another point where Broderick's character fires a missile at Devito's house. Are you kidding me? The plot alone is just plain stupid. Would you really go all out for Christmas? Trying to blow up each others homes. Come on. There a lot of really weird parts too. Like one where both of the leads are turned on by their daughters. Yuck. That is messed up.Devito has made up for this movie. He stars on one of the funniest shows on TV, It's always Sunny in Philadelphia. But Broderick, now getting very old, can't get new material. What happened to Ferris Bueller, the guy from Wargames, other crap that he's been in.A lot of funny people have stooped to children's films recently. Jason Lee has, Adam Sandler kind of did, Ben Stiller is. The only one that I don't mind is Jim Carrey cause I watch anything that he does.

37,Joxerlives,An odd film that can't decide if it's one thing or the other?,5,17 December 2012,"A very, very weird film which can't decide whether it's one thing or the other, raunchy comedy or wholesome family film. Either we should have the competition between the 2 fathers ramped up to an absurd degree in order to produce some hysterical comedy or they should tone down the adult humour a little and make it a family film.De Vito and Broderick are always watchable but they do very little in these roles. The conclusion of the film lacks credibility, we care little for these men and they're not really very likable. Their wives by contrast are a lot more appealing but just left as wooden stereotypes who really don't develop all that much. It's the sexual comedy that is really puzzling, who thought to bring that in? We have Broderick's son lusting after De Vito's (admittedly sexy as hell) twin blonde daughters but we're told they're only 15 and he himself seems far too young to be so enamoured of them upon their first meeting and playing peeping tom into their bedroom with his binoculars. We also have the part where the 2 men's three daughters put on a sexy Santa's helpers dance routine in high heels, fishnets and Xmas mini-dresses so revealing they blatantly expose their underwear. As I thought with the similar scene in Mean Girls would any Christmas fair really allow that? (and how come Broderick's Avril Lavigne style teen goth rebel daughter is taking part? It's like the twins have seduced her into bimbodom?) Even if it wasn't their daughters they were leering over the sight of Broderick and De Vito screaming 'Who's your daddy?' at them is just creepy as can be. Although admittedly the next scene where they dad's wash their eyes out with Holy Water was quite funny.So, a very curious mixture that doesn't really work too well, I'm amazed it did so well at the box office.",Deck the Halls
38,Beta_Gallinger,Have yourself a nauseating Christmas!,4,8 October 2008,"Before seeing this film, I had noticed it several times at the video store, and recognized both stars, Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito. Yes, they've both appeared in popular movies, but unfortunately, ""Deck the Halls"" is far from one of them. It seems this 2006 Christmas movie received a lot of negative feedback from critics, and judging by the number of votes I see for it here (a lot less compared to probably most films from recent years I've looked up), it looks like it has been widely ignored by movie watchers. After watching it myself, neither of those surprise me in the least.Steve Finch (Broderick) is an optometrist who lives in Cloverdale, Massachusetts with his wife, Kelly. Also in their household are a teenage daughter named Madison and a younger son named Carter. Steve is committed to his annual Christmas traditions, even though they don't mean as much to the rest of the family. One night, during the Christmas season, new neighbours move in next door, the Halls. Buddy Hall (DeVito), the husband and father in this family, is a car salesman, but wants to do something that will bring him more attention. One night, he learns from his fifteen-year-old twin daughters, Ashley and Emily, about a website where things on the planet can be seen from space, which gives him an idea. He decides to decorate his house for Christmas so heavily that it can be seen from space! He gets a lot of attention as he decorates his house, but Mr. Finch is not happy about this, as his once quiet neighbourhood has become a rowdy one, and Buddy seems to be replacing him as the ""Christmas guy"", so for the two neighbours, this means war! This is supposed to be a comedy, but I think I'm going to have to agree with others that a major problem is that it's not usually funny. I think I smiled at least a couple times, but that was about it. There's some rather pathetic humour here, including Carter Finch during their first visit to the Halls' house, when he makes it clear how he's really turned on by a near-pornographic picture of Tia Hall (isn't this supposed to be a family movie?), and also when he sees the Hall twins for the first time. Later in the film, the Finch boy sees the twins having a pillow fight through the window, which once again turns him on, and I just shook my head at this scene. We also have one scene where Steve is on the ground by a camel, and it throws up on him. I EXPECTED something gross to happen there, but I guess I can at least be thankful the camel doesn't defecate on him! Unfortunately, the lack of humour isn't the only problem with this film. The two main characters are total idiots, their rivalry is stupid, and you really don't care what happens to them or their families (none of the characters are likable, even if they have more sense than the two main ones), what they might learn, etc. I wouldn't have minded if all the characters in both families literally exploded! As I'm writing this, it's October, not quite the Christmas season yet, but since this is just another cheesy, dismissible recent Hollywood Christmas movie, I see no reason why I should have waited until the season to watch it. In fact, I don't recommend you watch it at ANY time of the year, and most things I've said about the movie have probably already been mentioned by others. So, watch ""Deck the Halls"" at Christmas time and you're guaranteed to have a cheerful holiday season! I'm kidding! If you want a decent Christmas movie for the season to put you in the spirit and make you laugh, I'm afraid you'll have to look elsewhere. Regardless of what time of the year you may be reading this comment at, you're better off finding something else to watch, whether it has anything to do with Christmas or not, or else this 2006 flop will likely bore you, maybe even nauseate you!",Deck the Halls

This will give him the accomplishment of his life, and make him ""somebody"". Now he has just moved in across the street from squeaky clean Broderick, who happens to me ""Mr. Christmas"" around the holidays. The two begin a war of wills as to whom the town will adore the most. Devito keeps piling on lights, Broderick tries to sabotage it. Now with that storyline laid out, so, so many things come to mind.

B), as a car salesman, Devito forges Broderick's name and sticks him with the payments on a new SUV. Now, only in ""movie land"" would Devito not be fired and brought up on charges of fraud. C), let's count the rip-offs of other movies, shall we: xmas neighbors feuding (Christmas With the Kranks); unstable man lighting up his house (Christmas Vacation); Broderick banged around and covered in goop (Home Alone); a VERY badly blue-screened runaway Santa sleigh (Christmas Vaction AGAIN!).

Hall character is more psychotic torturer to Matthew Broderick's (you actually feel badly that a decent comedic performer got himself involved in this mess unlike Devito who should pretty much take whatever work he can get)prim and proper character rather than comedic foil. Of course, to complain about the performances is somewhat unfair as even Jim Carrey before he went nuts couldn't have saved a schizophrenic and rushed script - clearly the three listed writers had different visions for the film. The script forces the two main characters to alternatively like and hate one another and tries to portray the obsessive narcissist Devito character as the good guy despite being too mentally unbalanced to hold down a job or provide any parental direction to his slutty daughters.

46,willcundallreview,Christmas never felt so mean,4,20 December 2014,"Rating-4/10Deck the Halls is a festive film full of thrills spills and jokes, unfortunately none of them work and you finish watching this neither filled with holiday cheer or a hurting stomach from laughing too much. The film tries very hard to be a comedy that then also tries too hard to bring jokes rather than any jolly feel, overall just leaves you feeling this movie to be Poor, and a strong one of that.The story is a very fast paced one, lots of gags and they are very slapstick orientated. I felt throughout the jokes are just not well made enough, some have a little mind put into them but end up being wasted and too predictable. The plot even becomes tiring by the end and the feud seen within the movie becomes stale and flat where as a Christmas film doing it right would have changed course to make it more interesting to the viewer.The acting in truth is one of the if not the worst part of the movie, Matthew Broderick is just not good whatsoever in this and fails completely as the main character Steve Finch. Danny DeVito could possibly top Broderick's performance and do even worse as he is just so unreal and unbelievable, you can't help feel any old person from the street could have done a better job. Other than those two the cast remain fairly subdued and even actors such as Kristin Davis fail to shine.The directing is a bit of a fail and although I don't want to sound a critic who offends, the directing is of absolutely no help to the movie and if anything they should have just improvised for the film. The script offers little originality and I still can't help feeling that if they had brought in a more experienced writer then we may have seen a funnier piece. I enjoyed the Christmas design coursing thorough but to say this movie oozes festive sparkle, well I would be straight lying.It may seem I am disgusted by this film but in truth it is only poor, it has as I mentioned a nice Christmas step, the feeling may not be the there but the look is. A few jokes produced a kind of slight snigger and although maybe I felt a slight bit of remorse afterwards at laughing at such things, I guess I can't help but at least try to locate my funny bone.If you like a good old comedy Christmas flick, well avoid this as it won't fulfil your needs, but if you don't mind an unkind movie with a bit of a haphazard plot then you may find this suitable entertainment. One thing I did feel whilst watching was that it tends to follow the same lines as other Christmas like films, the naughty and not nice nature of the movie feels like it's been done before but I do think people could like that part about it.Overall I give this a 4/10 and found it to be Strongly a Poor and unreasonable film but one that somehow stays stable enough not to become truly awful. Just try to watch it in a happy if not happy an slightly mischievous mood and you may find it pleasant enough viewing, watch it in a normal critic mode well you will not like it and if anyone laughs throughout this movie a lot, well my hats off to them.",Deck the Halls
47,I_Am_The_Taylrus,"Cute Christmas Film, but Too Predictable.",6,25 November 2006,"SPOILERSOkay, this film is cute. That's all. I don't think this film is getting an Academy Award any time soon. Again, I'm not doing a detailed comment on this film. Why? I have no idea. I just don't feel like doing a detailed comment on a film like this. Anyway, I loved Matthew Broderick in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. He was great. This is the first film I saw since Ferris Bueller's Day Off that had Broderick in it.Here's the plot in the most simplistic forms. A Christmas man named Steve Finch gets new neighbors. The new neighbor is named Buddy Hall. He has a wife and two teenage girls. For this Christmas he wants his house to be seen from space when he heard that his daughters found a website with every house except his. Slowly Buddy becomes the new Christmas guy in the town, which upsets Steve. He's the Christmas guy. Steve tries to cut Buddy's power, which doesn't work. Buddy finds that out and they start competing. After all the competing their wives leave them. They try to make Buddy's house be seen from space together. It does and their wives come back to them. It ends happily.Overall, this film is very, very, very predictable, but still great fun for the whole family. Plus, as an added bonus, it has Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito in it! Also, I have one more thing to point out. Most of the gags are very predictable and are a lot like the gags and jokes from the movie Christmas Vaction. The light jokes in the film are a lot like the light jokes in that film. But this film is cute. It's a nice little Christmas flick that I think your whole family will enjoy.6/10Recommmended Films: Christmas Vacation.",Deck the Halls
48,arieliondotcom,Hearty fare for the Holidays,9,27 December 2007,"You see what you want to see most times in many instances. Some critics here say this is ""heartless"" but maybe that says more about them than about this movie. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie because it DOES show heart. Best of all, for Christians, it shows the REAL meaning of Christmas (as in the birth of Jesus Christ), subtly, not banging you over the head with a manger, but makes sure to use a creche scene, mention the birth of Jesus, and use Christian lyrics among the usual secular stuff. So for me, that made the movie all the more meaningful. I didn't catch any embarrassing language or actions. Any ""violence"" is over-the-top cartoon stuff. And the lighting effects ARE great.There are also some genuinely funny lines, but you need a sophisticated sense of humor to catch it, especially with the deadpan style of Broderick.It's a funny, fun, family film. I highly recommend it. (And don't pay attention to grinch critics who say otherwise! They don't see heart in this film because their hearts are ""two sizes two small."") ;)",Deck the Halls
49,lyubitelfilmov,The First Christmas War or How Steve Finch Fought with Buddy Hall,7,24 December 2020,"Comedy. New Year and Christmas are getting closer, and the festive mood is increasing every minute, so I decided to continue watching and revising pictures of the corresponding theme, so today I decided to recall the Christmas family comedy, which I managed to check out on TV at one time, and to review it a couple of months ago, and now not just revise, but tell you about your personal impressions of it. I will scold, deservedly, the Russian distributors, who perfectly ""refueled"" the sneaking New Year, and decided to call this comedy (which is translated from the original as ""Decorate the Halls"") in some way, remaking the name of the Soviet classic film from the sixties. Apparently there was no appetizer, but oh well, I'm kind now, so here's my brief opinion - The First Christmas War. The picture has both pluses and minuses, and now your humble servant will tell you about them. Sit back, pour some tea, fasten your seat belts - we're here!
So the pros:
1. Scenario - the picture tells about Steve and Buddy - neighbors in a provincial American city, who started a real Christmas war. What's the matter? What is the reason for this conflict? Buddy decides to make his dream come true - to light up his new home so that it can be seen from space. This, in turn, does not like Steve, who all this illumination prevents sleep. And so it started! A series of funny situations, irreconcilable confrontation of neighbors, an excellent Christmas atmosphere and a corresponding morality about the family, ridiculing selfishness and blind passion and many more things await the audience. The script is simple and straightforward, not burdened with unnecessary elements and, most importantly, it will not be delayed. For an hour and a half, they were able to tell us a light story with morality and humor. If you want to perfectly end the evening with your family, then this picture will definitely suit you.
2. Humor - the picture is designed for family viewing, and humor is present here for both children and adults. Do not worry, all ""adult jokes"" are veiled, so you will not cause an attack of ""Spanish shame"". I didn't manage to laugh out loud, it was rather a slight smile, although some moments were more than witty. Do not be afraid, there are no philosophical and thoughtful jokes here.
3. Festive atmosphere - the picture is saturated with it one hundred percent, and even a little more, because the creators managed to plunge the viewer into the picture and make them closely follow the characters and enjoy the pre-holiday bustle and household chores. The atmosphere is light and unobtrusive, partly it excites this very festive mood.
So the cons:
1. Brain-exploding moments - don't get me wrong, because the picture is quite realistic, without a touch of fantasy or a fairy tale, but in several places it becomes a natural farce, it is conditioned by the script, this is understandable, but it still gets out of the general mood and hurts the eyes and hearing a little ...
2. Logic - again, there are several points that hit the general perception, and most importantly, logic. I will not list them, so as not to spoil my mood. Just know that they are there.
A little about the main characters:
1. Buddy Hall performed by Danny DeVito is a new resident of the town who has just arrived and settled in a new house, who set out to decorate in a way that no one has ever been able to, which causes a conflict with neighbor Steve. Open-minded and cheerful, cheerful and with a good sense of humor. The hero at first arouses suspicion, but then the viewer is interested in watching him. Danny splendidly played the role of a cheerful Buddy, not devoid of certain character traits. Well done!
2. Steve Finch played by Matthew Broderrick is a watchdog and conservative to the core, which makes his own family nervous, especially before Christmas. The appearance of a new neighbor Buddy with his crazy idea makes Steve declare a real war in order to return peace and order to the house. As a result, he realizes a lot (and he is not alone). Matthew has not been seen on the big screen for a long time, and even more so as the father of the family. I did it perfectly. Well done!
The whole picture was rooting for one, then for the other, because both are somehow right. And then Hurley from the TV series ""Lost"" appeared.
As a result, we have a good Christmas family comedy about the confrontation of neighbors, with a good script, a great festive atmosphere, good humor and excellent acting.

50,RhapsodyReviews,What??,2,22 December 2019,"Review:
'Deck the Halls' is a Christmas comedy film directed by John Whitesell.
While the movie does have a few laughs, it still doesn't hold any grounds to be well executed film in any way.
Determined to unseat Steve Finch's reign as the town's holiday season king, Buddy Hall plasters his house with so many decorative lights that it'll be visible from space! When their wives' bond, and their kids follow suit, the two men only escalate their rivalry - and their decorating.
The only actor in the movie that has any substance in their resume is Danny DeVito and even he was holding back what he could do in the movie. Matthew Broderick in my opinion isn't anything special, but he gets lost in this movie with all the other one note performances shown.
The film has zero substance. It was just really painful to watch. The storyline in itself was bad, and the acting did nothing to make it any better. The idea of a grown man wanting to restore his honor by making his house visible from space with Christmas lights is ridiculous.
Overall, there are a few good little laughs her and there, it is a cute Christmas movie, but like I said, just stick with the classic Christmas comedies.

This is a FUNNY MOVIE !!!!!,10,23 August 2013,"Very cute movie about two neighbors (Danny DeVito and Matt Broderick) who try to out-do one another as 'The Christmas Guy' on their block by lavishly decorating their houses during the yuletide.Lots of great scenes like when newly arrived neighbor Danny introduces himself to Matt and winds up taking Matt's morning newspaper and cup of coffee. Also when Danny can't understand the conversation when Matt starts to ""talk weird"".

52,Zoooma,Meh. Not as bad as it's made out to be.,6,30 September 2014,"Here's the good news: when you lump this in with all the Christmas movies, including the (seemingly) thirty or forty dozen small screen, made for television each and every single year, this isn't that bad. But comparing it to other big screen Christmas films: meh, not very impressive. I do think the IMDb rating and several (many) reviews gives this a worse rap than it deserves. It's not unfunny, in fact, there are a few very good, seriously funny moments and plenty of small laughs throughout. Problem is it's just so lame at times. It seems like it wants to be National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, in a way. That's been done and it's a classic. Why, then, couldn't they come up with enough originality for this script to make it a great holiday movie? Danny DeVito gives it his best to counteract Matthew Broderick but the whole story never allows the comedy to happen as much as it should have. Then the ending, oy vey, ay caramba. MTV News? The spontaneous O Holy Night? It falls apart quickly and dissolves into a fizzle. Not even Harold's best friend Kumar can save the show. Oh well. Amazingly, if you're watching a few dozen Christmas movies during a cold and snowy Christmastime, I'd recommend throwing this in the mix... maybe while recovering from a root canal surgery or a really bad sleigh ride crash. The pain killer meds should help make this more entertaining than it is.6.1 / 10 stars--Zoooma, a Kat Pirate Screener",Deck the Halls
53,Mike_Noga,This Christmas movie is no gift!,5,21 November 2008,"2 of 2 people found the following review helpful: At least it was a Green X-ma$ for Broderick and DeVito!, October 28, 2008 I really like watching Christmas movies. In part because I like Christmas, but also because I like to see how Christmas and our celebration of it is portrayed over time. It's gone from a reverential celebration of religion and family to a funny(or not) analysis of modern obsessive behavior and over-consumption. Then there are movies like these, which are just time killers. This is Christmas as Product. It has a few watchable moments. Kristin Chenowith is plenty hot as always and gets to sing a teeny little bit and Kristin Davis is the most adorable lil mannequin come-to-life since her SATC partner originated that act years ago. There is one bit in particular which made me laugh. It's horrible and if you're a father you should hope it never happens to you. I won't ruin it for you but I will say in the next scene DeVito and Broderick are in a church washing their eyes out with holy water, with good reason. It's one of the few scenes that show any signs of life, which is too bad because this thing could have used many more. Mostly though the movie is lackluster. It doesn't have the manic energy of a Christmas Vacation or the heart warming nostalgia of Christmas Story or the black, outrageous humor of Bad Santa or the child-like joy and goofiness of Elf. It has a few badly paced jokes and more than its share of sleep walking actors. The pace and performances were so slow and half hearted that I felt like I was watching the entire movie through a Valium induced haze. The movie has no real heart or message, or insight and it's not very funny. It's a place holder, the studio needed to put out something for the Christmas movie-going audience so they cranked up the Eszterhas 3000, set it for ""HOLIDAY"" and extruded this.....""movie"". Pretend it's a Christmas stocking folks, and STUFF IT!",Deck the Halls
54,Sunsphxsuns,GOOD FAMILY FARE THAT DESERVES BETTER,9,24 October 2021,"Film fans, I'll cut to the chase. Deck the Halls has been routinely roughed up and bruised by audiences and critics since its November, 2006 release. Not coincidentally, during post production interviews, some of the cast members glibly confessed they were certain this production would be the ""end of their film career."" Many of them also complained about the working conditions being extremely difficult. Having to wear heavy winter apparel while filming in the hot summer was a sweaty, agonizing, nightmarish endeavor. Nevertheless I'm pretty sure the pay was still worth the sacrifice.Competently directed by John Whitesell, the film features Danny DeVito, Matthew Broderick, Kristin Davis, and Kristin Cheniweth. With such a high caliber cast, you'd expect this holiday film to be better. I think that's essentially why Deck the Halls hasn't garnered more praise: The expectations may have been too unrealistically high to achieve.Clearly, Deck the Halls was good enough to be copied, as evidenced by Hallmark's spurious release of Battle of the Bulbs, the 2010 made for TV film starring Daniel Stern. Like Deck the Halls, Battle of the Bulbs is less about the holiday itself and more about two grumpy neighbors who make every attempt to out-Grinch each other with garish, overwhelming outdoor light decorations. It gets pretty heated.In Battle of the Bulbs the net effect doesn't quite work, but it does in Deck the Halls, and the result is a very decent, enjoyable Christmas comedy that's easily viewable for the entire family. It's fun. It's silly. It's Christmas! What can be more inviting than that?I'm going to defend Deck the Halls to the end. The DVD I purchased has lots of interesting extras and the entertainment value certainly outweighs the film's minor flaws.",Deck the Halls

It had comedy (very little of it) in the movie, but it was not funny nor was it worth watching.The acting was good, as you'd expect from Danny Devito and Matthew Broderick. And the story was adequate, but not worth watching. The lack of humor and any semblance of ""funny"", as was attributed to the movie, was a huge sore thumb which hurt like the devil.My only advice to Danny Devito and Matthew Broderick is that if they're making a drama or action flick, make it well.

What I liked about this movie was the sense of crazy humor combined with the great acting and chemistry between the characters. Everybody played their part beautifully and in spite of the funny atmosphere the characters had a certain depth and I believed it. Of course it wasn't the best movie or Christmas movie I have ever seen, but I enjoyed it. I think you need a certain, bit off sense of humor to like it though. It's not for everyone.

That might not be so bad if the jokes were funny. But they're not. They're not even interesting to watch.And there is no charm or spirit of the holidays here as in Christmas with the Kranks (another poorly made Christmas film). All the audience gets is one over the top gag after another until they are left dazed and confused, wondering if they should bother celebrating Christmas at all this year.By themselves, DeVito and Broderick might have made mildly interesting Christmas movies.

I like Matthew Broderick but his character is kind of colorless. These actors were wasted in the movie and it is a shame. The other actors were lacking in appeal. I could not understand why any parent would think that maxing out his credit cards to do something as inane as decorating a house so brightly that it could be seen from space, at a time when he was fired from his job, would consider this a positive goal.

Since I heard about how awful this one is from Cinematic Excrement, I decided to check it out.Yeah, this movie is awful. Matthew Broderick's acting sucks as usual, but it's a treat to watch. Seeing him try to say such lines as ""What's happened? What's happening?"" and ""We live in Massachusetts. I could die!"" with such little effort is so great, but there are more things to this movie. Some jokes were good, while the others were horrible. There is one ""comedic"" scene in particular in which I despise. It is the gag where Steve (Broderick) goes to the police to report Buddy's antics, and the guy at the counter is wearing a bra and thong. Another scene where Broderick's underacting shines is something that takes place at the winter festival that the town has. It involves Steve's daughter with Buddy's girls in a routine called.... Ugh, ""The Santa Babies"". Usually, a father would be scarred for life if he found out that the girl dressed like that was his daughter, but not here. Steve is just up there smiling away while saying ""I'm your daddy!"" But I must say, the scene where they're in the church washing themselves with holy water after seeing that is pretty funny.Yeah, this film sucks, but in the end, it has a nice feel to it. It has a Christmas-like feel to it, where everything turns out right in the end, and people end up celebrating the holiday in happiness. So, yeah. Horrible movie, but it has a nice feeling to it.If this movie happens to be on anytime soon, I wouldn't really recommend it. That's up to you to decide. Watch at your own risk.

Finally I just had one lighthearted, humorless, family friendly gag too much and hit the stop button. This movie is nauseatingly bad, I mean bad. It has good actors, I mean Danny DeVito can do humor certainly, which is why I was waiting for it to pick up. But the script is terrible, the direction is flavorless, and the plot is hopelessly clichéd and predictable. Mathew Broderick phones in his character and is grotesquely miscast in this, in fact this is probably the worst thing I've seen him do. The dialogue was so bad it looked as though he was actually embarrassed to be in this movie. Deck The Halls uses just about every feel good holiday movie convention there is: Campy music, stereotypical and quirky small town people, illogical stunts and sight gags, exaggerated moral motivations, bratty insolent children who learn the true meaning of family, destructive animals, a token ethnic person or two, and lots of fake snow.

The story here is somewhat interesting and the principal cast members are all very sophisticated. Many of the scenes included herein made me glow with happiness. I was extremely amazed by just about everything that this movie depicted. The film-makers really outdid themselves!Danny DeVito and Matthew Broderick play Buddy Hall and Steve Finch, respectively. Hall is Finch's new neighbor and their families are met with mixed reactions. After a series of discoveries, Hall decides to decorate his house with an intense amount of Christmas lights and other holiday material. Finch gets jealous because his new neighbor is now the talk of the town. As a result, Finch tries to ruin everything for Hall. Eventually, their families become infuriated when the argument goes to far. After some apologies and reconciliation, the two families establish a strong friendship. Everyone has a happy holiday!My favorite scene was the one where Finch was dragged all over the city in the sleigh that Hall picked up from a local retailer. In addition, he found a couple of horses and decided to spice it all up. The horses had fake antlers taped on their heads to make them look like reindeer. The animals went crazy while Finch was sitting in the sleigh; they got active and Finch received the ride of his life.Also, I was delighted when I saw that DeVito's offspring here were portrayed by a set of beautiful twin teenage girls. My eyes got big every time these characters (Ashley and Emily) were on the screen. Seriously, these two cute gals really had me captivated! THEY WERE SO HOT!Highly recommended!",Deck the Halls
66,superduperspit,I found more heart in Scarface,2,25 November 2006,"We have reached that time of year again. Every year, or every couple of years, we have a fake Christmas comedy that comes out just for the sake of making money, with no heart. In 2004 we had Christmas with the Kranks which is one of the worst reviewed movies ever, but god help me but I found enjoyment in that film, believe it or not. I am known as Mr. Christmas, I love the holiday itself and I love its movies, most of them always bring me joy, my favourite one being The Polar Express. Now, I try to find joy in most holiday themed movies I watch, but when filmmakers have sunk to such low levels Deck the Halls, it's hard to melt the cold hard plastic that it is. But honestly, how could we have expected a classic from the man who brought us such great films as ""Big Momma's House 2"", and the unforgettable ""Malibu's Most Wanted""? I sound very angry, but you know what, enough is enough. What happened to filmmakers putting heart into a Christmas movie, or any movie for that matter? What happened to being excited for such Christmas classics as Elf, The Santa Clause, A Christmas Story, It's A Wonderful Life, Home Alone, or The Polar Express. Movies were the story, and the message matter was heart and holiday joy. I'm sick of studios making these ""Christmas"" movies that are just released for the simple fact that is money, these films show what Christmas has truly become, all about the presents. This film may have had no promise and, and I may have had no expectations for it, but to sink as low as this, and to have such a fake and cold-hearted movie, is just sad and disturbing. Box-office poison, Matthew Broderick strikes again with yet another box-office poison machine, Danny DeVito. Never have I seen a movie with such a cast of actors I hate.I mean, at least Christmas with the Kranks had Tim Allen & Jamie Lee Curtis who are normally two very funny people, to bring some joy to it. In Deck the Halls we receive Danny DeVito, who just makes your skin crawl, and who is always stuck in movies with hot wives, what is that about? Then there's Matthew Broderick who hasn't delivered a classic or hit since who knows how long, it's been a long while since his fantastic work in Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Election, two classics. Then adding to that for female contribution there's nails on chalk board voices Kristen Chenoweth and Kristen Davis, although Chenoweth at moments is funny in this rather forgettable comedy. DeVito and Broderick have as much chemistry as an apple and a plate, enough said. My main beef with the movie however, is something Kranks actually had, a message and an ending to it where all the garbage comes together and you actually, cared. Here we have just scenes put together called a movie, and ending that comes from no where but cliché-land. It doesn't even strive for something original, it's just here, put some ""heart"" into it. I found more heart in Scarface.We have come to the age where the story doesn't matter to this films, you slap a Christmas theme on it, and there you have a holiday hit. I mean, at least the recently released The Santa Clause 3 had a message and heart, this has nothing. I mean, it's about a man wanting to have his house seen from space, compensating for something much? Broderick's character doesn't even have a fight, if you know what I mean. They could've competed for the brightest house, that would have been more interesting, but no, we have to see him get slammed with Camel snot, put into its dung, and worst of all Danny DeVito make out with Chenoweth. It sounds as nasty as it is, I pray for her to make a full recovery. The house being lit with half a million lights is incredibly clichéd, and very annoying to the eyes. I remember when I had retinas, it's blinding to say the least. The ending again to this film without giving anything away, is so fake and cold, and so heartless, I was honestly in shock at how it comes together. In the future, I pray for someone in Hollywood to come up with an original, heartfelt holiday movie.Bottom Line: As cold and heartless as the light bulbs surrounding the house.Review written by Jordan Appugliesi for www.boxofficefanatic.com",Deck the Halls

It's what you do with that formula that matters. I'm not talking about creating a film and just setting it at Christmas (Gremlins, Die Hard, Lethal Weapon) or films that play with the genre (Go, Rare Exports, Eyes Wide Shut) but ones where you pretty much know the story, but it's done so well it doesn't matter. Something like Love Actually, Scrooged or National Lampoons Christmas Vacation.I mention National Lampoons last as this is kind of what Deck The Halls seems to want to be. Matthew Broderick is Steve 'Mr Christmas' Finch, who's obsessive management is designed to create the perfect Christmas but really just frustrates his family. Danny DeVito is Buddy Hall (Remember the title? Cleve, huh?), a fast talking, wise mouthed Look, he's Danny DeVito but not being the bad guy for a change. So, surprisingly these two collide when Buddy, in his brash, carefree manor attempts to put so many lights on his house it can be seen from space. This is because he's never accomplished anything. Or something. I don't know. Ignoring just how criminally inane this basic premise is, let's just keep going shall we?What follows is one up-man ship as zany stunt leads to wacky happening leads to hilarious mishap leads to catastrophe. The two mean loose their wives (Kristin Chenoweth and Kristin Davis) due to their bickering but put aside their differences to win them back. Steve learns the value of Christmas, Buddy learns his family was his greatest accomplishment, and there is no real consequences from them burning down their houses or spending all their money on fairy lights.Actually, I have no real issue with any of that, as I said formula can be good. (Though it takes me 15 minutes to untangle my tree lights every year even if I put them back carefully. The rate at which these guys can work is AMAZING!) However if you are going to do run out a plot we all already know, then your set pieces need to be TOP NOTCH. Ooops Some bits are OK, I did giggle when Steve woke up naked next to Buddy, who had stripped him down so they could share body heat. And when Chenoweth breaks into song at one unbelievable point, she is staggering, but the rest is just far to run of the mill to make this a holiday favourite for me. I just don't think it's all that funny.",Deck the Halls
70,themovieclub,We wish you a dreary Christmas,2,22 November 2006,"Some movies are so bad that you may swear off Christmas movies.  This Christmas stars Danny DeVito and Matthew Broderick as New England  neighbours who spark a feud when one of them goes overboard with the  Christmas decorations. DeVito plays Buddy who wants his house to be  seen from ""My Earth"" (You know Goggle Earth?) and outer space. Two  credible actors have just reached a low time in their careers.  ""Oh honey, Christmas is THE most important day in the year."" Give me a  break. The acting was so bad that it is so unnatural, lame and  cringe-worthy.  Nasty neighbours fight but realise that Christmas is all about sharing.  Family resolves conflicts and gets together for a meal, decorating the  house with lights. The whole town goes in merry making, and ends by  singing ""Oh Holy Night"". How contrived, pretentious and hypocritical  can a Christmas movie get? It's Christmas, so please at least be  sincere and realistic about it.  The CG was so badly done. The scriptwriters forgot that their audience  is actually sophisticated. As if we all know the 'true spirit' of  Christmas is about being together with our family and neighbours. The  whole town singing Christmas carols waving lighted hand phones was the  last straw.  Please",Deck the Halls

Matthew Broderick should be ashamed for getting himself mixed up in a mess like this. He's good at playing straight men, but his deadpan delivery of this lousy script will have you checking your watch frequently. It's a particular waste of his comedy talent, which is well-documented. Danny DeVito once again demonstrates that his career peaked about 10 years ago as he mopes his way through the story. Just when you think you've got his character figured out, he does something that takes you back to square one. Is he a nice guy? A scumbag? A criminal? It could be any of those things, or none. God knows the ending doesn't give you any ultimate idea. I don't really know, and I don't really care. Avoid this film unless you have nothing better to do at the mall except wait for a swollen molar to subside.

And it's also so embarrassing I CAN'T look directly at Dan DeVito's face, especially after he cuddled up naked to Matthew Broderick in the back of the van! (Tries my best to wipe this disgusting sight from my mind!)It's all about a nerdy dad who tries to encourage his long-suffering wifey-wifey, an unimpressed prepubescent son, and a harlot-wannabe teen daughter to get into Merry Christmas spirit.Then along comes a short, balding weirdo with his aging Barbie trophy wife and two bimbo supermodel ""daughters"" (where'd he pick up those three blonde floozies, BTW? Maybe they're really all SISTERS and in service to the old sugardaddy?) to shake up things a bit with the dork of dad, especially with the issue over Christmas lights.Then things really get stupid around the town between those two demented blockheads, resulting in both families storming out of the houses (heh, I thought the yellow-haired girls went right back to the cathouse!) But ONE ""nice"" little thing HAPPENED right before the angry momma packed her kiddies into the SUV to drive out of her hubby's life: she sadly said that ""fries and chocolate milk at least made a nice Christmas memory"".I do like the special effects on the Christmas lights, however.

Whomever decided to put the lame ""rap"" on the menu screen for the DVD obviously has no sense of style as it was just painful to endure. It didn't match even the tone of the movie, well...except that both sucked, so I guess it did match on that level. Who green lights junk like this?

How sad that this movie had such a WEAK script and plot and far fetched situations like the way that DeVito 'sold' Broderick a car. There was no chemistry between the characters. Bad attempts at subplots involving his relationship with Broderick's family were left at mere attempts. I am a fan of Chevy Chase in Christmas Vacation and wanted to see at least a Christmas 'decorating war' -this was not even close to the humor and great characters in 'vacation'. I will also be hesitant to see another movie with DeVito and Matthew Broderick in them.,Deck the Halls

I love happy endings, so I liked how it ended. But the casting director did a horrible job really! Those twin sisters for example. Did they have any acting job before or what? It was so bad! Anyways musics, De Vito, and happy ending I liked. Also I gave an additional point to the sweet idea of flying Santa's cart and kid in the car seeing it through sunroof yelling ""it's real!

How in the world can ANYTHING be seen from space if it's snowing outside? DUH?! Did anyone else even catch that? Matthew Broderick can't act his way out of a paper bag, and Danny DeVito is at his worst. The twins were hot, but predictably played to be shallow and stupid...and were topped by being bad actors. Direction is awful, reaction to situations is not even remotely laughable, and nowhere near what an abnormal human would do even do if they had a zero I.Q.. I can only imagine anyone from outside of the U.S. looking at this movie and finally realizing why every other country hates us and thinks we're a bunch of morons.

It looks like these actors are new to the business. Bottom line, I only give it a 3 because it had a good message to the movie: to be with your loved ones for the holidays. The other message might be:don't ever see me again! Younger kids would love it because there are plenty of accidents and dancing lights to keep them in the holiday spirit.

99,GreekDragon1,I cannot verbally describe how tedious this wreck of a movie is.,1,5 July 2007,"""Deck The Halls"" Holds a place of honour in my heart. Frankly because I don't think I've ever seen a PG-rated Christmas film that promotes sexual preferences like free candy canes. To be honest, it made my stomach twist and turn to watch 'Kristin Chenoweth' star in this film and distribute as much cleavage like a stripper in ""Showgirls"". Poor Jesus Christ, for his birthday has once again been decimated by a lousy holiday comedy.If you can imagine this film as a big surprise for the family, golly, good for you. I'm willing to bet that you inhale helium for a living as well. Mere words cannot describe how tedious this wreck of a movie is. It is pretty much the equivalent of watching a bunch of anthro reindeer characters smoke marijuana in Santa's Village. Even Santa Claus would know when to avoid these people. The film stars 'Danny DeVito' as Buddy, the new neighbor on the block who lives across the street from Steven Finch 'Matthew Broderick'. Buddy works as a car salesmen and surprises his coworkers by selling a car on his very first day. Then we have Finch. He works as an optometrist and sells glasses to senior citizens that resemble creatures from ""The Mummy"". Later on in the film, Buddy realizes what his main goal should be this holiday, which is to decorate his house with as much visible spectrum that it will be visible from Earth orbit. Yes, I know it's all Hollywood and all, but please. A light display with as much output as a nuclear bomb flash sounds pretty expensive to me. I don't think Buddy could ever sell that much car. Finch soon becomes jealous of his popularity and plots to take out Buddies display by any means necessary. It's completely outstanding. You'd think that a man with sweaters as vibrant and red as his are would spend more time with his family and less time battling with the neighbors. I guess that a screenplay like this one shows that there are no boundaries when actors like 'DeVito' and 'Broderick' are available by accident.I do believe the character of Buddy is awkward from the start, and this I'd have to say twice about Broderick's character. Their acting in this movie is so cheesy and bland that it makes ""The Santa Claus"" look like ""Miracle On 34th Street"". You can't say much for chemistry in this film either. I didn't find much anywhere. I will tell you what I did find out though, I did realize that the word meh might just be used a lot more outside the internet nowadays when regarding movies like this.I practically fell in love with 'Broderick' in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and 'Danny DeVito' has been in some pretty amazing pieces of art too. There was no real reason to have them star in this flop. It makes me feel dirty to watch them ruin their careers like this. Maybe this will be a wake-up call to them.As a screenwriter in training, I'll have to keep my eyes and ears open when searching for good personal credential. But when I think that I've made a big mistake of this career, I'll immediately bring up ""Deck The Halls"" and think of how much I'll be saving.",Deck the Halls

The plot was also a little too thin to make the movie interesting and way too thin for a Christmas movie. I got to the point where I didn't really care what happened to the two families.

The acting is way above US Xmas TV Movie hell standard, it's certainly one I roll out once or twice each Christmas to relieve the boredom of the rubbish that's on the TV!

104,AnarcoCap,It's not that bad,8,4 December 2009,"People need to stop looking so deep into movies that have no intention to look deep into. Deck the Halls is a fun movie with really cool Christmas lights, and the little war between the two family husbands is silly and fun to watch. I really enjoyed the small town feeling that this movie presented -- something that is fading away generation to generation. I enjoyed watching this movie with my family, and will enjoy watching other silly Christmas classics in years to come. Combine this movie with other fun Christmas movies like Christmas Vacation, Christmas with the Cranks, The Santa Claus I and II, and Home Alone for a fun filled night.",Deck the Halls
105,chgocub2002,Loved the soundtrack,7,26 November 2006,"I enjoyed the movie. I really related to the Danny DeVito character who for whatever deep seated reason, goes all obsessive compulsive when it comes to decorating his house for the Holidays. I'm glad somebody finally made a movie about us. The story line was simple, the characters were identifiable and and not too over the top. You never see Mathew Broderick in an antagonist role, so that was an interesting twist. The twins were great.I agree that just about anything you see Danny DeVito in is going to be entertaining. I dug the soundtrack so much I just ordered it, but I was disappointed to see that it didn't have the boom-box remix version of ""The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies"" by Flipp on it. Does anybody know where I can find it?",Deck the Halls
106,nickanderton,Oh My! The best Christmas film ever,10,20 December 2019,"It is a film to watch with your family, it funny, festive, it perfect for young ones, it a film to watch on Christmas Day after Christmas dinner, plus it makes you feel good after watching it",Deck the Halls
107,jgrobarge,sweet mother of god... run for your lives!!!!,1,25 November 2006,"i am usually a fan of these Christmas movies, and i realize that they're corny and stupid, but this is taking it to a new level. The only thing worse than the movie's ridiculous plot holes was its ending. When Buddy's house doesn't light up and everyone took out their cell phones, i was so appalled that i threw up in my mouth. i then proceeded to stand up and take out my phone, hoping to give my fellow victims some entertainment. From now on I'm just going to ramble on about stuff to provide a filler, because of the retarded 10 line comment rule.This is the worst movie i have ever seen. For serial. My aunt came in from Canada, so we fulfilled a family tradition involving seeing a movie. It ruined my day, unfortunately.",Deck the Halls
108,justamom-1,Fun for all,9,23 November 2006,We have 3 little boys. We enjoy going out to movies and I am tired of watching animated films. It is nice to go see a PG movie that is entertaining for the whole family. The movies is not spectacular by any means but it is much better than most. I knew in the first 5 minutes I would be entertained by the movie as much as by sneaking peaks at my youngsters reactions. This movies script was not dumbed down and the dialogue was very good. Also Devito should be doing more movies. I think he does an excellent job in this movie and they could have made better use of his talent. I also liked the fact that they didn't worry about making things believable. So many movies in this genre try to make everything believable and it just makes the movies seem silly. We laughed and the children were entertained. It's definitely not a movie you would choose to go to without the kids because there are simply better movies available. This was the best family movie we have seen since RV. The last 20 minutes of the film will be a bit boring for the the youngest members of the family so just make sure to save some milk duds.,Deck the Halls
109,dlbgbell,A pleasant surprise after the bad reviews,5,24 November 2006,"News papers reviews (plus a few other comments on IMDb) trashed the movie - so was expecting the worse. Was instead pleasantly surprised, as was my family (my ""children"" are both in college). However, we enjoy Christmas movies. If you don't, don't go. Is this a Christmas classic - not by any means. But it is average to a little better than average Christmas movie. Many scenes generated laughter (one reviewer stated that he didn't laugh once - well we, along with the rest of the audience did) Story line had some plot holes, but main critic is with Matthew Broderick - seemed very, very stiff - much more so than what the character called for. Some have been critical of the ending. Well here's the spoiler - and it isn't bad - they sing ""O Holly Night"". I understand that some may not like a song that contains ""...our dear Savior's birth"" to be linked to Christmas, but that is the true meaning.",Deck the Halls
110,abhearst,I walked out smiling!,9,3 December 2006,"I almost didn't take my 9 year old because of all the negative comments, but I have to say that I walked out smiling and humming a Christmas tune. I thought it was a nice movie. Is it predicable? Yes, but so was Miracle on 34th street... Can't something just be enjoyed and not torn apart just because the message is a simple one - to be nice to one another and try to help out? I liked it! It actually has a number of messages: That people who are different can still be friends (i.e. the two wives). That kids can learn from each other (i.e. the daughters) and that the husbands can learn that life isn't just about competition, but about family and friends.",Deck the Halls
111,dawnwood5,Unacceptable for family viewing - don't waste your time.,1,10 December 2006,"This movie was boring and full of crude humor and sexual remarks that are unnecessary for family viewing. There were three preteen boys and one girl with me. The boys were embarrassed. Two of them highly disliked the movie. The cross-dressing, the boob shots, the admiration from married dads of their daughter's legs and bottoms, the comments made all throughout the movie referring to sex, was sickening. One of the boys was a guest of ours. I should have left, but my son was embarrassed to stay or to leave. Not wise on my part to not read the reviews first and very foolish of movie makers to assume that every family loves entertainment only if it contains crude humor, sexual references,and other unacceptable viewing. Believe it or not, there are still some of us adults who don't appreciate the crude humor. What ever happened to responsible, respectable movies ? The actors seemed sleepy, too . I was thoroughly disappointed in this movie and its contents. Very much a B rated movie with little to no joyful Christmas spirit, depressing. The ending was the best part of the movie. I learned a lesson. Always read the review and go with your gut when picking a movie. I almost passed. Should have listened to my Spirit and passed.",Deck the Halls
112,lbltew,loved the movie!,8,18 December 2006,"I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie. I went with a friend and we laughed hysterically during many of the scenes. I am not a big ""fan"" of any of the actors, but I thought it was great. There were so many funny one liners that I couldn't help but laugh! (Looks like you are smuggling some chicken nuggets in that outfit...) I liked it so much, that my husband and I have plans to see it this week! Not all movies have to have a perfect story line behind it in order for others to be able to enjoy them. It actually reminded me of people I know who do get too caught up in Christmas! We all need to slow down and spend time with family and friends. *Lighten up and just l-a-u-g-h!",Deck the Halls
113,VeraVee63,Not NEARLY as bad as predicted....,7,24 December 2006,"After seeing, Deck The Halls, I was quite surprised as it was much better than all of the reviews I had seen or read of!! Yes, it is ""cliche"", but what movies today aren't? I think the basic meaning of the movie is what's important and Danny Devito is hilarious! It is quite heartwarming to see how the friendships evolve. I also think the basic meaning of Christmas IS, family & friends are what is important not what's under the tree which is portrayed in a grand manner in a good movie.I was a little confused as the previews showed it as more of a "" who can outdo"" one another which isn't the case at all.It's well worth seeing and I for one will purchase it on DVD and it will become a ""Christmas staple"".",Deck the Halls
114,jhbbunch,Lot of work for a lot of nothing,3,9 September 2007,"I live near where this thing was filmed, in Ocean Park, Surrey, BC, Canada, in the middle of summer, on the main road (128th Street) through the area. Flag people to control the area, the works. The main houses were on an acre or two of land with 'snow' everywhere. Another house across the street was all decked out too. Quite the spectacle. I thought that this was going to be a pretty major film. When I finally saw it I just could not believe how pedestrian it was. All that time spent in traffic line-ups for this mess? Keeping up with the Jones's, the Christmas version. I believe Home Improvement did it 10 times better, on 1/100th the budget in a half-hour. Watch that episode instead of this mess.",Deck the Halls
115,alxalx-2,this is rock bottom...,1,26 December 2007,"I think this has to be the very worst movie i have ever seen..it has nothing..no spirit..no screenplay..no acting.. i don't even know how anybody can watch it 'till the end..for me it was an actual fight..i just wanted to see how much bad lines and bad acting can i see in one movie.. the producers,the actors..they must have no shame releasing this movie..if i was in their shoes i think i would have to apologize to the public ant the ones that paid the tickets. please don't ever do this or anything close to this ever again..it is the absolute rock bottom of Christmas movie..or any kind of movie for that matter.. I am confident that Danny and Broderick can act..i have seen them doing much much better..i really hope that they are able to learn and never repeat this..maybe their agents should learn better and really do their job as advisers..or get fired..",Deck the Halls

117,hottopicgirl-91,So Not True,10,10 September 2008,I Really Didn't Even Know They Did A Remake Of Deck The Halls In 2006 And Plus I didn't Even Know There Was A Movie Called Deck The Halls I Knew About The Song But Not The Movie. I Love The Song That Is Me Favirote Christmas. I Loved This Movie When I First Saw It And I like How They Fight Over The House Being To Bright Or Not Bright Enough. And Then When There Wifes BOTH Left Together And Took The Kids. I Like How They Found Out Where They Where And Buddy And Steve Took All Of Buddy's Christmas Lights Down Off His House And Hung Them From The Hotel Where They're Family Was. Back To Buddy Hall's Front Door And They Spent Christmas Together And Have Christmas Dinner Together. But Over ALL IT WAS AND IS A GOOD MOVIE.,Deck the Halls
118,jewkbox,Worst Holiday Film Ever,1,13 November 2008,"The movie begins with some promise, building characters and presenting a conflict. However, the last half hour is a joke (and a bad one at that). There is no acting, no plot, and no comedy. The worst part of the film is when the family is walking down a holiday lane that DeVito builds in efforts to make amends to everyone. My jaw dropped as I watched the movie get worse by the minute. I like Danny DeVito. He has an interesting character for the first half of the film. But as the character changes toward the end the interesting aspect quickly wears off. I would only suggest that anyone watch this film if they want to see some terrible film-making.",Deck the Halls
119,maxipoggio,A Simpsons Christmas Movie,7,25 February 2010,"This is a hidden Simpsons Christmas Movie: Homer (De Vitto) VS. Flanders (broderick). If you see it that way... ENJOY A GREAT MOVIE! Some characters are a little mixed up. But they are all recognizable. It's a MUST SEE for Simpsons fans. I saw it just because Fox was going to show this film ""premier"" this month in Latin America, but the minute I got the plot, I just knew it. The Simpsons as you never saw them: Real, dimensional, little town life in Christmas. You even got Chief Wiggum! Wath this movie from this point of view and you won't forget about it. A Simpsons Christmas Movie!!! You'll know it when you see it. 7/10.",Deck the Halls

121,N_Mousseau,When do we see the final cut?,1,12 December 2006,"WOW! This movie was a total waste of my money and my time. Some parts were forcefully funny, but all in all it felt like I was watching a bunch of rough sketches linked together. It felt very choppy and the storyline skipped around. I was hoping that this movie would live up to National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, but it didn't even come close. Maybe next time the creators can work on character development and drawing the audience into the story. A great movie is one that the audience doesn't want to end. This one definitely had me wishing that I hadn't even bothered to come out and see it at the movies. It's not even worth buying on DVD...too bad.",Deck the Halls
122,cgnphertco,I was desperate for it to finish.,1,3 December 2011,"Shame on Matthew and Danny for making this awful film. However did the cool Ferris Bueller turn into this silly,unfunny character? It is bad in so many ways but the biggest sin is pinching most of its material from Lampoons Christmas Vacation. What an insult to Chevy and the gang, who's classic is a Christmas tradition. Did the makers not realise that true comedy must have a tiny shred of believability to be remotely funny? This was a blatant case of jumping on the bandwagon. Cramming in one situation after another without thought for continuity or subtlety. I only watched it through so as not to offend my wife who had suggested the film. But I was desperate for it to finish.",Deck the Halls
123,rhenie27,"lighten up, it's a fun movie, I'm so sick of......",7,25 November 2006,"I'm so sick of those people who MUST feel the need to critique every movie like they're a movie critic for the Los Angeles Times...Most modern day Christmas movies, are silly, predictable, and not going to win any Oscars, big deal! You know what, take your kids, listen to them laugh, share some popcorn, and enjoy what this movie DOES have, not looking for the obvious predictable plot, or faults it possesses! Christmas Vacation is silly, yet, has become a Classic, A Christmas Story was blasted by Critics in the early 80's, but has become a Christmas staple on TNT, the point is, this is a HOLIDAY movie, goofy, fun, heart warming, stupid at times, funny at times, and at the end, you leave the theater feeling good! Lighten up and enjoy the movie, it's not that bad!",Deck the Halls
124,carlo_and_amelia,Ouch,2,9 December 2006,"This was just really painful. The storyline in itself was bad, and the acting did nothing to make it any better. The idea of a grown man wanting to restore his honor by making his house visible from space with Christmas lights is ridiculous... The actors seemed uninspired and stiff, even though I love Danny DeVito I really can't see how he said yes to this. The most catastrophic acting though, were his two twin girls. Ouch. Talk about being picked for your looks rather than your talent.I really can't write reasonably about this movie, it was just too much of a mess for me. It had some funny parts, but they were all pretty clichéd and well-used, and I never once laughed out loud. This is just not worth your money and if you're looking for that Christmas spirit, stay as far away from this movie as possible.",Deck the Halls

126,crystal519,Great Christmas movie,8,23 December 2007,I agree with Valeen the II; I thought it was very funny. I'm not in the best of spirits this year and was just clicking through the channels on cable and I caught the opening credits. From start to finish I laughed. Thanks Matthew and Danny for lifting my spirits.Great CastWould Watch Over and OverFavorite Scene - was when Danny's character kept Matthew's character warm after Matthew's character fell in the pond and when Matthew's character woke up and realized that their both naked that was just hilarious to me.,Deck the Halls
127,kbalduchhi,One of the worst excuses for a holiday movie ever!,3,21 November 2007,I cannot begin to tell you how disappointing this movie was. Brodbrick performance was as stiff as a 2X4. He was a much better actor as a kid. Devito was the only bright spot in this movie and it was no where near strong enough of a performance to make up for the horrible script. Kristin Davis from sex in the city was invisible on the screen and Chenowith was decent but could have had a much better roll. One scene that I did get a chuckle from was when Brodbrick was in his car with devito on the way to the hospital after is sleigh accident. Out of 93 minutes of movie time laughed twice. Search other where for your holiday cheer!,Deck the Halls
128,iggyroo36,Avoid this movie like a virus,1,13 December 2006,"Such a sad crappy movie. It's not a family movie as they make it sound like it is. I was upset with the constant boobs, sexual references, the two slutty dressed daughters, the horny 10 year old son that complains of his constant horniness. Matthew Broadricks daughter shows off her tight shirts filled with big boobs. It seemed like Russ Myer may have consulted in this movie. Here's a line for the family...""honey, it appears that the ceiling is too low for my pole"" Gotta have that stripper lingo so you can keep the interest of the male audience. Don't forget the half naked painting of Devito's wife. The previews had none of these things. If they did, it would and should have gone straight to DVD. Boy this film is really desperate to sell sex. It just goes to show how Hollywood has lost touch with mainstream America. Oh and of course, this film is boring and not funny. Avoid this film at all costs...especially if you think of taking your kids. We walked out after the first 20 minutes and went to see the Nativity Movie. This was a good family movie if you want to learn about the real story of Christmas.",Deck the Halls
