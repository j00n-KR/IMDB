0,SnoopyStyle,war on Christmas,4,24 November 2020,"Chris Cringle (Mel Gibson) is wary of the world which has become more naughty. With fewer good children, he has delivered fewer presents and the US government has cut its subsidy. He's forced to take work from the military. Meanwhile, bad boy killer Jonathan ""Skinny Man"" Miller (Walton Goggins) has been obsessed with finding Santa. Entitled rich kid Billy Wenan is angered by his lump of coal and hires Skinny Man to kill Santa.It's all very flat. The production is limited. For example, the boy should have a mansion. Smarter filmmakers would adjust the script accordingly if they can't swing the budget. The Nelms brothers may be pushing for a revolutionary Christmas film. They really only achieved an intriguing misfire. Chris is not appealing and I wonder if I really don't like Mel Gibson anymore. There is a dusting of human ugliness all around the man. There's nothing to care about him or this movie. It tries to be a dark satire and ends up as a loud shoot-them-up. It thinks that it's funnier and edgier than it is. The comedic timing is non-existent and its edge is all surface. All of it makes it rather flat. It's like a guy telling a joke badly and keeps nudging you to agree that it's funny.",Fatman
1,Prismark10,Fatman,4,29 November 2020,"In a world where the Christmas spirit has lost its meaning. Mel Gibson is Mad Chris Cringle.Fatman is about a cranky Santa whose business is failing and he needs a government handout to survive. Feeling like a bird on a wire, he takes on a military contract to keep going.What Chris does not know is that a spoilt rich kid who got a lump of coal for Christmas. As payback the kid has hired a maverick hitman (Walton Goggins) to bring him back Santa's head.This is a dark fantasy twist on the usual santa story. Stripped of shmaltz with some dark comedy. It is a mean movie where people get unnecessarily killed by the hitman. He leaves a trail of bodies behind as he goes searching for Santa.At least there is a lethal shootout at the end but it is a film that really goes nowhere until the hitman and Fatman go on a collision course.",Fatman
2,nogodnomasters,Best in Show,3,24 November 2020,"Mel Gibson stars in the title role as a cynical Santa who has fallen on hard financial times. Bill Wenan of Minnesota is an over privilege kid who has his own hit man Jonathan Miller (Walton Goggins). When Billy gets a lump of coal for Christmas, he puts a contract out on Santa.The film should be a dark comedy but failed in that genre. The personality of Santa failed to garner any love. I was rooting for him to get shot between the eyes. Note the ""Ted"" looking teddy bear.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Fatman
3,kosmasp,Beard Man and Kill Man,7,28 February 2021,"After Kurt Russels more family friendly Santa outing, we get mel Gibson in a more mature Santa outing. Way more mature, though I reckon there are still some lines that are not entirely crossed ... or at least they seem smoothed over. And that is one thing that I really sort of dreaded in this movie. Because while it seems like a mean Santa (Bad Santa, Kill Santa) outing, there are things or lines the movie does not cross. Pulling punches if you want to call it that.Having said all that, the actors do an amazing job. Walton Goggins for example is quite restraint. While I wasn't sure if that was the right way to go (over the top would have also been an apt or even better choice), his soft and calm demeanor might play more into some other viewers expectations. The jokes are dry, the pace is slow .. there is nothing fancy about this outing and ... re-imagening of the myth that surrounds Santa Clause. Not more apparent than in the commercial aspect and contracts Santa is obeying by ... While I imagined this to be way more fun, it still can entertain, if you let it",Fatman
4,classicsoncall,"""There are limits to what I can do.""",6,21 September 2021,"I couldn't think of a more underwhelming finale to this story than what the scriptwriters came up with here. Sure, I know Chris Cringle (Mel Gibson) couldn't very well mow down the spoiled twelve year old brat Billy Wenan (Chance Hurstfield), but something more than a dressing down would have been expected. How about tying the kid by his ankles and lowering him upside down into a chimney? That would have worked for me. The weird think about this flick is that none of the principal characters were all that appealing. Gibson's version of Santa is something of a downer, and he didn't appear all that fat to me. Why would he when he works out on the heavy bag? I felt bad for the science contest winner Christine Crawford (Ellison Grier Butler) when the Skinny Man (Walton Goggins) showed up, but what else was she going to do? I don't know, this one fell short of working for this viewer; I give it six lumps of coal.",Fatman
5,paul_haakonsen,Some movies should just remain wrapped up indefinitely...,3,20 November 2020,"What the Holidays was this? Did I just sit through 1 hour and 40 minutes of utter boredom? Well, yes I did.This 2020 movie from writers and directors Ian Nelms and Eshom Nelms were by no means a future Christmas classic. Actually, it wasn't even a properly entertaining movie. I must admit that the storyline was a massive swing and a miss in terms of it being entertaining or enjoyable for me.I mean, a storyline so devoid of Christmas feel that you just sit there all throughout the course of the movie wondering whom this Chris character (played by Mel Gibson) really is, because it sure was no Santa Claus.Sure, the idea behind ""Fatman"" was unique and original, but its transition to the screen did little to work wonders, much less work in favor of the movie as a whole.Sure, I managed to sit through the entire ordeal, but I can't really claim to have been entertained, and this is by no means a movie that I will ever be watching again. And it is certainly not a Christmas classic in any way. So it can join the ""Die Hard"" movie on the 'not a Christmas movie' shelf.The acting in ""Fatman"" was actually good enough, but it was just hard to buy into the script and storyline, which ultimately reflected poorly on the entire movie as a whole. So the actors and actresses were definitely struggling with an uphill battle in order to carry this movie. While Mel Gibson definitely was doing something for the movie, I will say that Walton Goggins' performance was the most outstanding and memorable in the movie.My rating of ""Fatman"" is a generous three lumps of coal out of ten.",Fatman
6,zardoz-13,There's A New St. Nick in Town!!!,9,16 December 2020,"A bizarre but unforgettable foray into fantasy and realism, ""Fatman"" is an eccentric Santa Claus action comedy that casts Mel Gibson as a gun-toting Father Christmas who supports the Second Amendment. Chris Cringle keeps up target practice, blasting away at cans on fence posts with an automatic pistol. He never misses his mark. He drives a battered red Ford pick-up when he isn't cruising the clouds in his legendary sleigh with his fabled reindeer team. Constantly munching on his wife's Christmas cookies, Chris serves as his own accountant. Lately, he frowns more often at the amount of the subsidy checks Uncle Sam sends him. Sometimes, after he exits the Post Office, Chris bellies up to the bar at a local tavern. He has been known to safeguard the marriage vows of countless husbands eyeballing a sexy barkeep with her alluring bedroom eyes. Occasionally, Chris dissolves his Alka Seltzer tablets in his shot glass of liquor for respite from his own woes. Mind you, Father Christmas's business hasn't been as prosperous as it once was, and he has suffered setbacks. Indeed, the bearded fellow has grown sarcastic and grumpy. Children are no longer the same. Although it is never adequately explained, this Santa Claus has the ability to heal himself, and we catch a glimpse of a gunshot wound inflicted on him during his night flights. Naughty teens have been known to open fire on his sleigh as he traverses the heavens. Chris maintains a company of loyal, hard-working, efficient elves who thrive on sugar and carbs. They can conjure up untold merchandise galore at Santa's secret factory on a sprawling, snow-swept ranch in Alaska. Although Billy Bob Thornton's two crude ""Bad Santa"" movies broke new ground for Santa Claus movies, ""Small Town Crime"" co-writers & directors Eshom and Ian Nelms have reinvented Santa as an action hero with a moral conscience in ""Fatman."" Incidentally, the film draws its title from the derogatory usage of this synonym for Santa Claus.
Despite its provocative blend of realism and fantasy, ""Fatman"" amounts to a sober-minded morality tale about the choices people make and the consequences. If anybody knows anything about who has been either naughty or nice, Santa Claus knows, and he doesn't tolerate nonsense. Mel Gibson's stern Santa grumbles about the bad behavior of children. Ever wonder about those unsavory souls who didn't get what they sought from Santa? In ""Fatman,"" Santa leaves a lump of coal in their stockings as punishment. Surprisingly, Uncle Sam has contractually obliged itself to reimburse Santa for the volume of toys he distributes at Christmas. Since Santa has been delivering more lumps of coal than gifts, Uncle Sam has reduced the amount of subsidy it pays Santa. Furthermore, the future of Santa's shop and his workforce appears in jeopardy. Grudgingly, Santa agrees to re-tool his factory temporarily for the production of military aircraft parts for the Pentagon so as to ensure the continued prosperity of his business. Meanwhile, Santa's intransigence has prompted one of the naughty to retaliate with lead in the shape of bullets! In ""Fatman,"" Santa tangles with two villains. First, he has provoked the rage of an evil twelve-year old, Billy Wenan (Chance Hurstfield of ""Good Boys""), who refuses to admit defeat just as virulently as Donald Trump. Consistently, Billy has won four First Place Blue Ribbons for his elementary school science projects. When he loses to Christine (newcomer Ellison Butler), Billy summons the second villain, Jonathan Miller (Walton Goggins of ""Django Unchained""), an adult assassin with no qualms about shooting a couple asleep in bed. Although Goggins plays the murderous Miller with sinister anonymity, Chance Hurstfield steals the show with his flawless, sociopathic performance as Billy.Before he goes after Santa, Miller abducts poor Christine. He stands by quietly while Billy threatens to electrocute her with twitching battery cables if she doesn't expose herself as a fraud. Of course, Billy winds up getting his Blue Ribbon. Nothing can redeem Billy's wicked lack of scruples. Abandoned by his father, Billy lives in a mansion with his wealthy grandmother who dotes on him. Billy takes advantage of her affection for him and forges her signature and cashes a number of checks! When he isn't looting granny's bank account, Billy lords it over their obsequious servants. Ultimately, Santa's lump of coal sends Billy over the edge, and he hires Miller to turn St. Nick into Swiss cheese. Billy dreams of having Santa's head on a stick, but Miller refuses to smuggle a severed head through two border checkpoints as well as preserve it from the elements. Like pampered but tyrannical Billy, Miller lost his parents early in life and suffered a similar kind of anguish. It doesn't help matters either that Santa gave Miller the coal treatment, too, when the hitman was growing up. Predictably, Miller seizes the chance to wreak vengeance on Santa.As soon as Miller sets foot on Santa's property and starts shooting up the place, ""Fatman"" turns into a full-fledged, bullet-riddled actioneer. Scattering pipe bombs at random on the premises, Miller eventually finds himself face to face with Santa in the equivalent of a Wild West showdown. Santa wields two handguns, while Miller shoulders an impressive looking assault rifle. The ensuing firefight turns out to be a sanguinary ordeal with each man extracting blood from the other. Mel Gibson gives an avuncular performance as a disillusioned Santa who refuses to quit no matter what the consequences. Indeed, the Nelms brothers make Santa Claus look like a kind of boondocks version of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Actually, with his steely gray beard and solemn eyes, Gibson couldn't have landed a more characteristic role or created a more iconic character. Happily, he never dons the red suit at any time during the film's swiftly paced 100 minutes. The rugged Canadian landscape stands in for Alaska, while Johnny Derango's widescreen cinematography imparts an epic, larger-than-life grandeur. Altogether, ""Fatman"" breaks new ground with Santa Claus's heroic shenanigans.",Fatman
7,deloudelouvain,"Forget about the usual cheesy Christmas movies, Fatman is different.",7,25 December 2020,"I watched this movie on Christmas day as my wife likes to watch Christmas movies at that time. I wasn't too thrilled about that idea though, as I was expecting another cheesy holiday movie but Fatman is different. I actually enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. It's definitely not a Christmas movie for kids that still believe in Santa Claus. There's a fair amount of violence and killings so not sure if kids want to see that if you want to keep them in the Christmas spirit. But for adults it's entertaining. Mel Gibson, once a decent actor, played in a lot of bad movies lately, at the point where I was wondering if he forgot how to act. But in Fatman he got it together again with a decent performance playing Santa Claus. Walton Goggins always seems play mean characters and he's good at it so no reason to change that. The whole cast did a good job making Fatman a different Christmas movie than we're used to. It changes from the eternal Home Alone franchise they push down our throat every year over and over again.",Fatman
8,siderite,The Christmas action film we never knew we didn't need,5,11 January 2021,"This film has no idea what it wants to be when it grows up. It's about an American Santa who is paid by the government and the assassin sent to kill him by a spoiled and rich brat. There is no moral to the story, no character development, the movie just is and then it ends. The depths to which some actors can fall... The movie deserves no attention whatsoever.",Fatman
9,blanbrn,Dark little comedy that entertains.,6,11 February 2021,"""Fatman"" is one of those little independent films that entertains in a surprise like manner as it does have an interesting story with well known actors and it is joy. Set during the ""Christmas"" season a 12 year old boy receives nothing so he decides it's the big red suited man's fault and he hires a ruthless and crazy hitman(the fine wonderful Walton Goggins) to hunt Mr. Claus down and kill him. As a subplot and on the side as a wild card like story is Chris(in a fine turn from Mel Gibson) a real life Santa who makes a living meeting kids needs. Only Chris is down on his luck and broke, however when he takes up partnership with the U.S. military things change. This film becomes an action like thriller with the two central characters ending up crossing paths overall this picture is underrated give it a watch as the entertaining moments and fun dark action and laughs keep on giving!",Fatman
10,ksf-2,santa's budget comes up short,6,26 February 2021,"Most of the film is very cryptic. mostly action. the viewer is left to figure out most things on their own. the basic story is that when a spoiled rich kid doesn't get what he wanted, he hires a hitman to take out kris kringle (Mel Gibson). but naturally, the killer has a hard time tracking down santa. plays like a Coen brothers film, but this one is actually a Nelms Brothers film, with writing and directing credits. a subplot is now that santa's budget is coming up so short, he takes on extra work for the military. which involves the toy-making elves, of course. the warning up front told us there would be lots of violence, and they weren't kidding. pretty dark. it's all leading up to the big showdown at the end when the hitman catches up to santa. it's entertaining. and violent.",Fatman
11,FeastMode,borderline useless,2,10 June 2021,"I went into this movie knowing nothing, not even the basic premise. As it went along and i started to see what it was about, i was intrigued. I'm all about movies with an out-there premise or a ridiculous idea taken in a cool direction.But nothing happens. It's so boring. The movie is an hour and 20 minutes of setup for 10 minutes of payoff. And none of it was satisfying.IMDb lists the genres as action and comedy. There was about 5 minutes of action. And i didn't even realize they were trying to be funny. That's how bad the jokes were, or how little there are.I like the music. The performances are pretty good. My boy BOOOOOYD CROWDER is always fun to see. But this movie pretty much amounts to nothing. I had difficulty finishing it and by the time i reached the climax, i just didn't care (1 viewing, 6/9/2021)",Fatman
12,MOscarbradley,Easily the worst film of 2020.,1,24 December 2020,"The ""Fatman"" of the title is Santa Claus; yes, the 'real' one but as played by Mel Gibson he's no 'Ho Ho Ho' jolly old man in a red suit but a gruff old businessman with money troubles and a concerned wife, (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), and when he needs to be he's pretty handy with a gun. This alleged black comedy is clearly aimed at people like me whose favourite Christmas movie is ""Bad Santa"" but whereas that gem was genuinelly funny and done in the worst possible taste while still managing to be sweetly sentimental thanks to a terrific performance from young Brett Kelly. This, however, is seriously short on laughs. Worse, it's poorly scripted, directed, acted and very violent; this is a Christmas movie clearly not aimed at children.The plot, for want of a better word, has obnoxious rich kid Chance Hurstfield hiring hitman Walton Goggins to kill Santa after he leaves him just a lump of coal at Christmas. Meanwhile Santa and his elfs find themselves making parts for the U.S. military to make ends meet. Done well, this could have been inspired instead of the under-cooked turkey it turns out to be. In fact, rather than watch this rubbish revisit ""Bad Santa"" or even watch ""It's a Wonderful Life"" for the 40th time or just go to bed early and hope that Santa brings you something more than a lump of coal.",Fatman
13,Bored_Dragon,Wasted potential,4,10 January 2021,"The interesting premise, which could have been developed into a hilarious comedy, ended up as an indefinite nonsense, with only a few decent moments.

15,ops-52535,X-mas takes a toll on everyone...,6,20 November 2020,"Especially the elderly and ill, the lonely ones and the brats that creates havoc due to a lousy gift under the tree from santa claus. so the culprit sends out a fathima on our beloved saint, to all hit men in the world, that santa claus is a scrooge and not worthy to live anymore.one hitman, that have had a grudge toward saint nikolaus since he was a little child with significant appearances like Jeffery Dahmer do take the mission serious, and as a large reward is waiting at the north pole sign, he starts tracing up the fatman himself. will he succeed? will he obtain eternal life and fame ? well have a look and see...BUT IT ISNT A FILM FOR THE SMALLEST CHILDREN TO WATCH, NEITHER WITH PARENTAL GUIDING OR WHATSOEVER. BECAUSE THIS IS A FILM FOR YOUNG ADULTS AND UP...!so if you like to hanky panky the idea of x-mas, and the turmoil before,and the foreverlasting searching for presents for your whining kids and grumpy better halves, inlaws and grand and greatgrandparents then have a look. if your searching for the lulefeeling look somewhere else, because here the guns aint toys, and the blood runs freely into the snow.so mel gibson as fatman himself may have got some new fans from the shotgun association, and he steels a bit of the show, as could this film easily be made on every decent rural norwegian farm in the winter, because a large part of our countrys farmers look like fatman, and get their deeds done under any malign circumstances.its is a bit comedy too, but not a cult classic to the real x-mas nerds. a 6 with a small recommend from the grumpy old man",Fatman
16,eddie_baggins,Another strange addition to 2020,4,17 December 2020,"Just when you thought 2020 couldn't possibly get any weirder, along comes Fatman to make you realise once more that this is the year of the unexpected.The film no one asked for and the film that absolutely didn't need to be a thing, Fatman see's grumpy Aussie icon/villain Mel Gibson become Chris (aka real life pistol shooting Santa!) whose not only battling a problem to stay in business thanks to kids these days being naughty rather than nice but Walton Goggins St. Nick hating Skinny Man, whose been employed by Chance Hurtsfield's little brat Billy who wants Santa dead after he delivers him some coal for Xmas.It's an utterly bizarre set-up that in an even odder turn of events is played almost entirely straight by its cast and directing duo Eshom and Ian Nelms, who instead of letting their tale run rampant into black comedy and accept its idiotic narrative, choose to instead make sure Fatman is a straight faced incarnation of an Xmas movie that feels like a distant cousin to Bad Santa, sans jokes and overweight red heads.There's funny little moments in the film, Walton Goggins is going for it and his Skinny Man's hatred for Santa and kidnapping of science fair winning children needs to be seen to be believed, while mostly unexplored issues with Santa's elves and contracts with the military signal moments the film might've been able to really make things click into gear but a huge portion of the Nelms film feels like its only ever half-baked at best as its relatively by the numbers plotting takes hold.You can't help but feel disappointed by the fact that this bizarre oddity didn't manage to milk (and cookies) more out of the central concept of a grizzled Santa and Mrs. Clause fighting to remain viable in an ever changing landscape while its underutilized use of some game leading men makes you feel frustrated that the material they were working with wasn't able to maximize their commitment.As good as his been in years (not as though that's saying much) Mel Gibson appears to be having a lot of fun here under a significantly bushy beard and he against all the odds makes for a Santa you want to see more of while Goggins is doing a variation of his Vice Principals persona here that has made him a recognizable and reliable face when it comes to off-kilter characters that appear to be on the serial killer spectrum of human personas but they don't get much time together in the films brief 90 minute runtime, while there's a sense they're both never really given killer moments to work with in the film.Final Say -There was potential here for Fatman to be a pitch black Xmas comedy classic yet while it has brief moments of surreal goodness, its insistence to play things straight and eschew big laughs hurts its chances of achieving anything of a lasting nature despite its game leading men.2 pistol wielding Santa's out of 5",Fatman

21,subxerogravity,"It's no Die Hard, but it's a decent Christmas movie.",6,17 December 2020,"Fatman is a great movie for the modern era as it showcases the corruption of Christmas. It feels like somewhere down the line the world got too big for Santa and as such Santa was force to make some deals with people like the Military in order to keep Santa's workshop afloat. Seems like a low point for the magic of Christmas but that magic is wearing down as children become less and less innocent. Plus it looks like Mrs. Claus died and Santa has been sacking up with one of his elves, a black one at that (wonder if that was a coincidence, Mel).Add salt to the wound, Santa gives a rich kid oozing with first world problems a lump of coal for Christmas, and this kid sends a Santa obsessed hitman to track Chris Kringle down and kill him.Mel Gibson is no Kurt Russell when it comes to playing an alternative St. Nick. In fairness Russell is playing the Kringle that still has a twinkle in his eye in The Christmas Chronicle movies while Gibson's fat man sounds like a southern preacher who lost his faith in god. it's perfectly grim.Walton Goggins plays the hitman and to his credit he's a show Steeler.

23,stevendbeard,A Different Kind Of Christmas Movie,7,15 November 2020,"I saw ""Fatman"", starring Mel Gibson-The Expendables 3, The Beaver; Walton Goggins-The Unicorn_tv, House of 1,000 Corpses; Marianne Jean_Baptiste-Blindspot_tv, RoboCop_2014 and Chance Hurstfield-A Million Little Things_tv, Good Boys.
This is a different kind of Christmas movie. It has comedy in it but it also contains a lot of bloody violence. Mel plays Chris Cringle, aka Santa Claus, aka Fatman. Marianne plays Ruth Cringle, aka Mrs Claus. Chance plays a spoiled 12 year old rich boy that is used to getting everything he wants, even if he has to grease some wheels to get it. Walton plays a hitman that Chance has on his speed dial. Chance is a little disappointed when Mel leaves him a lump of coal for Christmas-it seems that Chance was a bad boy-and so Chance hires Walton to kill Santa. But the job is going to be a little more difficult than Walton anticipated. Santa has been around for a long time, remember? So he has learned a few things over the years. It's not going to be just easy pickings for Walton. To complicate matters even more, the military is on site at the North Pole trying to make a deal with Mel to use his elves to make military hardware in the off season-the elves do have a reputation for being good workers and delivering the goods on time. Like I said, it's a different kind of Christmas movie.

27,kirbylee70-599-526179,SANTA FOR PARENTS,8,21 December 2020,"Well once more Christmas time is here and the regular slew of holiday films are on TV. Rudolph is glowing, Santa is coming to town and the Grinch is stealing Christmas. Adults that remember these shows are watching them with their children and grandchildren now. But what about a Christmas film that the adults can enjoy? Something a little more inclined to be viewed when the kids go to bed? Enter FATMAN.Billy Wenan (Chance Hurstfield) is a spoiled rich kid whose father is incommunicado and is being raised by his grandmother. Billy has a deep Napoleonic complex (witness a portrait of the ruler on his wall) and feels the need to win at all costs. For example when he loses the school science fair he brings in hitman Jonathan Miller (Walton Goggins) to capture the winner and threaten her with returning the prize to stay alive. Needless to say this puts him on the naughty list and he gets a lump of coal for Christmas.Meanwhile Mel Gibson stars in the title role as Chris Cringle, who lives with his wife Ruth (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) in North Point, Alaska. Chris is down because his business is waning. It seems children are not behaving as nice as they should. News reports of some dropping bowling balls off of freeway bridges and setting houses on fire have dampened his spirits and it shows.In an effort to keep his factory running and Christmas alive, Chris has been contracting work with the US government. But this year's check is half of what it once was. In an effort to keep the work he does going he agrees to a 2 month contract with the government. In return for more funds he and his elves will be working to build items for the military. He's not happy about it but he has to do so if Christmas is going to keep going.After Billy gets his lump of coal he is angry with Santa. So much so that he contacts Miller and puts out a contract on Santa. This is a contract Miller is keen to take as he has his own issues with Santa from his childhood. To this day he finds people willing to sell items from their childhood that Santa presented them and buy them from them. Now he has the chance to get his own revenge against Santa.While Miller tracks down clues to discover where to find Santa, Chris and his elves begin working on the contracted government project. Happy with the work they've done they want to extend the contract but Chris tells them this is a one time project. In the meantime Captain Jacobs (Robert Bockstael), the Army liaison in charge of the guards enjoys his time with Chris and the elves working for him.Eventually the confrontation between Chris and Miller will take place. After all that's where the plot is going here in the film. Along the way there is plenty of dark humor involved that will have you snickering or outright laughing as the film rolls forward. Plenty of language is on hand to get this film an R rating and if that wasn't enough some blood is shed. No, this is not a Christmas carol for the kids.The film hits the right notes when discussing Christmas because there does seem to be a lack of cheer these days. Cynicism runs rampant with young people these days and the talk of being honest with kids and not letting them believe in Santa seems to be a growing trend. But why not let them have some fun before they have to face being adults? That may not be the main concept here but it does play into the story.Gibson is aging well and does a great job here as Chris. If you didn't catch it already, yes he is THAT Chris Cringle. From knowing the names of everyone he comes into contact with to knowing if they were bad or good. Jean-Baptiste is a delight as the cookie baking Mrs. Cringle. Goggins is superb as the hitman Miller, allowing us to see the cold hearted killer that he is as well as the grown child disappointed in a gift he requested of Santa that there was no possible way of delivering. Watch to find out what that is.Dark comedies are hard to pull off. Some go over the top while others seem afraid to tread on items the comedy is based on. FATMAN doesn't pull punches and delivers some truly funny moments. Perhaps not knee slappers but funny none the less. So if you're looking for a movie to watch while the kids are sleeping and you're busy wrapping presents, this might be just the movie you're looking for.",Fatman

29,s3276169,Off key....,6,23 November 2020,"The choice of tone is important when making a film. Hit the wrong chord and the whole thing is ""off key"".Such is the case with ""Fatman"". Its styling and overall treatment is far too dark and serious. It calls itself a comedy but has more in common with ""Dirty Harry."" Heck, even the ""Die Hard"" films managed to include a few comedic moments, that are funnier than this tale.Really, it should have looked for inspiration to lighter, comedic films, by by the Cohen brothers with a dash of Monty Python, to round things out.As its stands ""Fatman"" simply has too many sharp edges, in a bloodily bizarre, 'what the hell happened to Xmas and Santa?' kind of way.Thankfully its still watchable. This is due in part to decent pacing and action but mostly, to strong performances by the cast, led by the innately talented Mel Gibson.In summary, this one's plain weird. Moderately watchable, yes but weird. Not to mention a little disturbing.6/10.",Fatman
30,aidanratesmovies,What a fun non-conventional Christmas flick,8,7 November 2021,"An original and bizarre satirical thriller- Fatman lives up to its crazed Santa potential and gives its audience exactly what it's looking for. The film can be a bit slow at first start, a bit choppy and over dramatic at times, but man is it fun. Mel Gibson plays Chris Kringle and is an absolutely perfect casting choice, as well as fellow mainstream actor Walter Goggins, and Marianne Jean-Baptiste. The script is excellent, a well executed blend of action thriller and dark social commentary while also dabbling in the absurd. The cinematography is excellent perfectly capturing the vibes of the film as hand, as well as with the set direction and wardrobe throughout. Its characterization is also quite brilliant, if a bit predictable at times. Its characters can seem a bit artificial at times, but it doesn't stop the audience for caring about them and being invested with them along the way, no matter how big a jerk they all are. In the end, Fatman is a bizarre but incredibly enjoyable little Christmas flick that I hope will soon become a cult classic. Gibson and Goggins are fantastic and its blend of dark and comical tones works in a way no other film before it has quite tried.My Rating: 7.7/10.",Fatman

32,arungeorge13,I don't know what to make of this film. I know for a fact that I didn't enjoy it much! [+40%],4,21 November 2020,"Fatman is one of those films that makes you think it's going to get better but doesn't. After an intriguing-enough start, it fizzles out in plot (I mean, I like a good irreverent comedy, but this sure didn't cut it), the action doesn't exactly instill interest and a decent ensemble is left to fend for themselves given the lackluster screenplay. Tackled right, Fatman could have been disgraced actor Mel Gibson's comeback flick (by no means, endorsing what he did or his attitude). He plays a Santa that isn't cheery, spreading smiles and distributing wrapped presents around the world. This version of Chris Cringle is often drunk, bruised, and totally devoid of the Christmas spirit. Quite certainly, what keeps him going is the resilience shown by his wife Ruth (played by Marianne Jean-Baptiste), with whom he shares believable chemistry.An angry kid orders a hit on Santa: this is Fatman's one-liner. While that may sound pretty enticing on paper, it doesn't hold your interest for 95 minutes as the treatment is a tad formulaic. The showdown between Santa (apparently, a mind-reader) and the assassin (played to generic effect by Walton Goggins) is restricted to the film's final 15 minutes or so, and it gets over so quickly that you forget what went down, along with the rest of the film. The scenes solely featuring Gibson and Jean-Baptiste are probably the only thing worth salvaging here. And oh, the one time I chuckled was when an army man learns how Santa's elves operate and refers to it as ""a hell of a way to run a crew"".",Fatman

42,MrDHWong,An avant-garde take on the mythology of Santa Claus that only offers sporadic moments of entertainment,4,24 December 2020,"""Fatman"" is a Christmas action thriller film written and directed by Eshom and Ian Nelms. Starring Mel Gibson and Walton Goggins, it is an avant-garde take on the mythology of Santa Claus that only offers sporadic moments of entertainment.In North Peak, Alaska, Chris Cringle's (Mel Gibson) toy workshop is facing financial turmoil due to there being too many naughty children acting out of line. To help keep his business afloat, Chris partners with the US government to help them create the necessary parts for a top secret fighter jet. Meanwhile, a spoiled rich kid named Billy (Chance Hurstfield) swears revenge after receiving a lump of coal for Christmas and hires his personal hitman (Walton Goggins) to track Chris Cringle down and take him out.I've always found Christmas films to be an odd means of entertainment. The very concept of people waiting exclusively until the very end of the year to watch them seems so strange to me, as I like to watch movies at any time without that looming feeling over my head that it isn't the correct season to be enjoying them. With that said, I think most of them end up being hit-and-miss, with some that are considered classics, like Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and some that are clearly intended as throwaways, like those countless made-for-TV Hallmark movies. ""Fatman"", on the other hand, falls into neither of these categories, instead attempting to try something new with the genre but failing on almost every count. I'll admit what attracted me to it in the first place was its bizarre premise - a rugged, tough-as-nails Santa Claus fighting back against a skilled assassin. Sounds amusing enough, right? Well, that could have worked had the film played into this goofiness with the correct tone, and this is where it falls flat. This movie takes itself WAY too seriously, setting up the whole revenge story like a regular action thriller almost completely devoid of any humour. I can only really recall two moments where I chuckled slightly, and these weren't at any jokes but rather in disbelief at how brutally intense things played out. I'm not saying I expected a brilliant dark comedy filled with laugh-a-minute moments, but I did assume I would be smiling a whole lot more.Another major problem is the strange choices in editing. The film's first act sets itself up as a standard revenge thriller but then jarringly cuts to some awkward attempts at comic relief. None of these parts are funny nor do they make any sense leading into each other and it becomes highly distracting to the overall viewing experience. When a film can't completely decide what tone it is going for, it becomes near impossible to have any kind of attachment to what we are watching and this severs that important connection the filmmakers have with the audience. In other words, if the film doesn't know how it should feel, then those watching it won't know how to feel about it either. During my viewing, I couldn't help but think of better dark comedies like Edgar Wright's ""Hot Fuzz"" which perfectly blended intense action with hilarious moments. Perhaps in the hands of someone like him this film could have worked better but one can only dream at this point.The only real thing that made this film watchable was its cast. As clumsily plotted as the rest of the story was, it's still somewhat amusing to see Mel Gibson play such a gritty, downtrodden version of Saint Nick in that typical style he often brings to his characters. With his dirty beard, skilled marksmanship, and a big belly, there's definitely something to be said about the veteran actor taking up a role like this so late in his career. Additionally, Walton Goggins was his usual sinister self as the hitman tasked with offing the eponymous character. Even though most of his schemes were ridiculously implausible, I was at least interested in seeing how he tracks Santa Claus down as though he were just another regular person and not a mythical being of folklore.In the end, this film had some decent ideas but terrible execution. To give credit where credit is due though, the filmmakers at least tried something different with the whole Christmas movie genre, but that doesn't mean the final result was worth the effort. This whole experience was nothing more than a novelty, a curious but brief oddity that will blissfully fade from memory as time goes by.I rate it 4/10",Fatman

47,TwistedContent,2020's Best Seasonal Adventure,6,20 December 2020,"""Fatman"" is the kind of Christmas movie we get gifted very rarely, a black comedy thriller, one with interesting ideas and awesome casting. Quite possibly the best Mel Gibson's performance in some time, another proof Walton Goggins is great with oddball criminal characters, and plenty of entertainment with heart to offer. Its biggest flaws, really, are all the laid-out, left-out lore, plot possibilities and potential. If you're looking to add a solid alternative christmas flick to the annual traditions list, it's most definitely recommended.Santa is real, his name is Chris, and he's rowdy, cranky and been there a long time, and also a businessman, fighting to save a declining business. There will be no spoilers, but the universe of ""Fatman"", even though possessing a little magic, is real and grounded, and Santa has to make realistic choices.. Ain't no ""Christmas Chronicles"". Meanwhile, a rich, spoiled and smart kid with a potential grow up to become a murderer, hires Walton Gogginns to kill Mel Gibson, over receiving a lump of coal in his stocking. Let the chase commence.""Fatman"", with relatively little means, builds an interesting world of possibilities, taking good advantage of putting Santa Claus and everything that comes with him in our rough world. The success of that is also ensured by Mel Gibson who puts on an awesome, believable, and just plain cool performance, and together with Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Ruth (Mrs. Claus) add pleasant warmth to ""Fatman"". Waltons Goggins plays a cold-blooded, eccentric but grumpy hit man with a serious grudge for Santa Claus, and does so charmingly. Lastly, Chance Hurstfield played the villainous kid excellently, because I hated the character.Now, the problems with ""Fatman"" lie in the writers putting out all that stuff on the table in the beginning, and then commencing the simpler, more typcal-to-thriller/revenge story plot lines, in process losing momentum and providing pay-off that's not better than the build-up. The more christmas-related side of ""Fatman"" does not get strengthened and a good amount of the lore is left at an introductory level. ""Fatman"" overall tries to do a whole lot, be realistic, be magical and be about Santa, be grim, be funny, but ultimately not all boxes are ticked. Tell you what though, I'd be up for a sequel and that extra exploration.""Fatman"" has that indie spirit, and that reflects in the technical and aesthetical aspects as well. It is, however, shot on a 20 million budget which is not that little, and I don't know how much went to the cast, but ""Fatman"", while looking nice and good, doesn't have the potential grandness in not only the story, but also in the visuals. Nonetheless, it never seems cheap or has a on-the-nose weird camera angle. A beautiful little indie with a-list stars.""Fatman"" deserves a viewing this December, because why not, ain't nothing better happening around, so if you're looking for a more unorthodox seasonal feature, I approve.

Secondly while listed this movie is listed as action comedy it lacked in both in my opinion. The action came in finally at the last 15 minutes of the movie and as for the comedy I diddn't crack smirk not even once.On the positive side the reason I gave any stars at all was due to the acting which I thought everyone did a pretty good job overall.

52,movieman6-413-929510,Far-fetched violent Christmas film for an older audience.,5,24 November 2020,"Fatman is a new action comedy film directed and written by Eshorn and Ian Nelms, who also co-directed Waffle Street.In the film, Santa goes by the name of Chris Gringle (Mel Gibson), who is struggling financially after the government has stopped his subsidy. Chris is so turned into a grumpy alcoholic old man. As Santa, he now only delivers gifts to children who really deserve it. Spoiled 12-year-old Billy Wenan (Chance Hurstfield) will not get the Christmas present he expected. To get revenge on Santa, he hires the hit man Skinny Man (Walton Goggins) to kill Santa.This movie is more of a new Christmas comedy for teens and adults filled with a lot of far-fetched and violent humor. If you like that kind of humor you can enjoy this movie more. They have applied good and appropriate Christmas music in the movie to the scenes to make them come. The pace of the movie can seem a bit slow, because the real action doesn't start until the end of the movie. The build-up to this action is filled with scenes where Santa tries to adapt to his new way of life, the hit man trying to find out where Santa lives and the spoiled child checking the way things are going. If she had put a little less of these different storylines into the movie, the pace would have been a bit faster.The acting is done appropriately by the film cast. Mel Gibson comes out well in this movie as a bad version of Santa Claus. Together with Marianne Jean-Baptiste, he plays Santa Claus in a fun way with a suitable Santa Claus. Walton Goggins also plays a somewhat exaggerated hitman, who also hates Santa Claus himself. Chance Hurstfield also stands out as an annoyingly spoiled kid.

Apparently, everything. This is a movie that should not have been made (And we thought Bad Santa was out of line). Who knew?To be fair, the acting by all and the overall production were fine. It's the story I have a problem with. Why, why, why a story about Santa to be killed? It just doesn't make sense.

I like how the movie attempted to make Santa a relevant concept in modern society, it was a nice touch; however what I don't understand is who is this movie for? Some strong language makes this a pass for kids; plus the guns and killings that take place including stabbings.So, why don't I rate it so highly? Well most of the movie takes place with the assassin traveling by car, repeatedly. The child character bears no real relevance to the plot really, since the assassin had his own motivations to kill Santa anyway.So most of the movie seems wasted. Plus there are so many scenes with Santa and his wife that seems to repeat in tone and content.

I knew immediately that it wasn't exactly my taste in film but I also knew I had to add it to my blu ray collection. My girlfriend and I finally watched it last night and of course she really liked it. However, i felt differently. I slept on it before writing this review to really let my opinion come to the surface as I sorted my thoughts on it. The next morning, the bad taste from the movie was still in my mouth, so here's my honest opinion: The pallette of this movie is unappealing overall. The locations were mundane and dreary and not in an artistically good way. This movie completely failed at trying to make its budget look bigger than it was. It kinda seems like the money was spread too thin for the first two acts then kinda dumped on the third act. The storyline is overall dumb and it was off putting to see Santa Claus portrayed in such a miserable and grumpy way. The subject matter is teenie as the movie didn't go dark enough to be aimed at most mature adults. This film would have faired much better with some graphic violence and some coarse language and grit. Also, one of the worst things about the movie is that the dialogue is flat out terrible. The bad guy says simple and childish lines. Its like the type of dialogue you write when you are writing essays or papers for school. I get this may be part of its campy and wonky output, but the movie definitely thinks its smarter and wittier than it actually is. Having the child as the criminal mastermind was nothing short of immature and we have seen this done before. The movie doesn't target the spirit of Saint Nick enough and it leaves us with an old used up drunk grumpy man that has a sleigh in his garage(the sleigh looked awful) and a few reindeer in his barn. We dont get to see Santa in his sleigh. We dont get to see him deliver any gifts. We only get to see the poorly picked locations the bad guy travels through to get to Santa, and Santa's crappy looking ranch/house. Having Mrs. Claus be black was ok with me, but still very forced feeling as this movie was probably filmed post covid and post the riots.
The movie did offer a few funny moments like when the bad guy was driving in his car and we got to see all the different moods he was in along the way accompanied with the music he chose to listen to in those moments. That was pretty funny. Other parts, I was waiting with a smile on my face for what i thought was gonna be a witty line, but it turned out to be childish and basic wording. The casting overall is also very weak. Mel Gibson is a great actor. Do i think he nailed this role? Not so much... Idk, i think it's typical this movie got the praise it did because most that have seen it are basic and occasional movie watchers. The true film fans will have a field day with this one. Maybe watch it. Or dont.",Fatman

62,diggnuts,It just does not work,2,23 November 2020,"Cute idea, what if Santa was a badass, but it falls flat completely and it isn't half as original as one might think on first glance.After the world is established in a very quirky, illogical and disjointed way that I suppose it meant to be funny, but only makes your toes curl, it quickly becomes a meaningless action pic.There are no stakes, there is no sensible continuity and morally it is all over the shop. It is like somebody wrote the outline and a commission of b-writers randomly pasted in dialogue, the odd joke here and there and random actiony bits.The notion of taking a known narrative or character and subverting it isn't new.

But I have no desire to watch it again. It's definitely not one of those 'watch it again next weekend' type of movies. Once was enough. Too many better movies to watch it 2-3 times. I'll add some spoilers which I normally don't do. It's a spoiled rich kid movie (never seen one of those before, right?) with Santa and the U.S. Military tossed in. The difference for this one is that the rich kid has an enforcer/hitman on the payroll. The guy from The Shield who played the dirty cop from Georgia plays the twisted hitman. He's one of the reasons I watched the movie. I haven't seen him much since The Shield and I like his work. The other reason is that Mel Gibson plays a dark Santa. I like Mel's work also, even though his actions over the past decade or so shows him to be a little deranged. I would recommend the movie for a watch. Don't go into it expecting a great movie and you won't be disappointed. It's a good watch if you like B-Movies. It reminded me of the 1960's-1970's B-Flicks.",Fatman

73,garethvk,Mel Gibson Brings A Dark Version Of Santa To Fatman,7,12 November 2020,"Billy Wenan (Chance Hurstfield) is a very spoiled, entitled, and sadistic young boy. He has the advantages of privilege and lives with his wealthy Grandmother but is rude and condescending to the staff. Billy is also very arrogant and petty to the point that a Runner Up finish at his private school Science Fair after a string of wins motivates him to hire a Hitman (Walton Goggins) to intimidate the victor to falsely admit to cheating so he can claim victory.This is not the first time Billy has hired the Hitman and when he gets a lump of coal for Christmas from Santa (Mel Gibson) he is enraged and hires the Hitman to take out Santa.Santa has his own issues as a decline in revenue has forced him and his wife Ruth (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) to take on a project with the government to not only restore his fully stipend but to pay additional funds that will ensure financial stability.
The fact that the Hitman has his own reasons for having issues with Santa further motivates him to take the job and rushed north to face Santa on his own turf.
""Fatman"" is a dark and entertaining new holiday entry that gives a contemporary take on Santa and his Elves as they must contend with the issues, politics, and changing world that face many companies.The at times dark nature of the film is an interesting contrast to the usual overly sweet films that are commonplace this time of year and Gibson and Goggins backed by a strong supporting cast turn in memorable performances.
While not one for the kids; ""Fatman"" is a solid piece of entertainment and Eshom and Ian Nelms keep things moving at a steady pace and provide an interesting and contemporary look at Santa in the modern world and combine it with a story about finding a way through adversity.3.5 stars out of 5",Fatman
74,Sunsphxsuns,THE KRIS KRINGLE YOU DIDN'T KNOW,9,26 October 2021,"Yet another grossly maligned holiday film that many critics didn't understand, subsequently wrote damaging reviews, which then caused large numbers of movie goers to stay away. It didn't help that a Pandemic of terrible proportions was also heading our way. Bad timing, or bad omen? Either way, Fatman (2020) is much better than you'd think. You just have to keep it in the proper perspective.No spoilers (as usual) but I can reveal Santa Claus isn't portrayed as the chubby, rosy cheeked, pipe smoking Elf. Not this time. Instead, Santa (Mel Gibson) turns out to be a surly man with a significant drinking problem. He actually gets paid for his work. But instead of overseeing his toy factory as the Christmas holiday approaches, he appears to prefer shooting tin cans in his icy back yard.Like Braveheart (1995), which also stars Gibson in ""war paint,"" Fatman features a Mel Gibson whose anger and pain is etched on his tormented face not in symbolic war paint, but in real scars. Even his eyes fully reflect his disappointment. Apparently he's been through quite a lot.I've watched Fatman a few times since its premier, and each time, I couldn't help but notice the biting similarity between Gibson's character and his real life. I think that a holiday movie like Fatman could only cast Mel Gibson in the title role. Anyone else would seem like a boring cliché. This is high drama and intense adventure, tinged with despondency and pushed into a odd pseudonym combing the military and capitalism. (I'd love to expand here but I promised you, dear reader, no spoilers).In the child's world of 2021, a time when they would normally enjoy a carefree and innocent life, it has instead morphed into a serious regime of safe social distancing and masks. And at home, their parents are struggling, many of them wondering how they're going to pay next month's rent because they're both out of work.It is in this terrifying ""bubble"" that I find a film like Fatman to be most prescient in its timeliness. For if Fatman is our only hope for a better, more loving, less cynical world, what happens if he too has given up?",Fatman
75,freddy_at_home,Good Christmas movie with some fun violence and dialog,8,20 November 2020,"Very happy to see Mel Gibson back in a good role. He does it really well. The man shows he's a legend for a reason.I liked it, it's absolutely different from most other Christmas movies. If you count Die Hard as a Christmas movie, as I do, then I would put both these two as one of a kind Christmas movie. Also you might add Bad Santa on that list.I laughed and I actually got surprised a few times. Good violence, the hitman is epic and the kid is just a bit beyond the typical bad kid. I also like that the Fatman is faulted, he is a working man, tired, annoyed and somewhat an alcoholic.The story was also good and I actually believe that this could be happening, if I believed in Santa Clause. LOL! This is just pure fun, I like how they chose to tell the whole story, about Christmas and all. Don't think logical and don't forget to turn off your brain. Then you will get some good old fun!

Unfortunately the general idea is good but it falls flat and does not deliver anything unique beyond the concept of a bad ass Santa Claus and a hit man. All of the rest of the plot and story is just 1 dimensional and is not really that funny or entertaining and bringing in the military just gets pathetic. If Mel Gibson was not in this film I would not even watch it but kudos to Walton Goggins who brings some spark to his character. I could go on with more details but its one of those films that just does not get any better after the first 20 mins.

(William Conrad and Joe Penny fans are the only ones who will get that 80's pop culture reference)
Seriously though Mel Gibson is believable as Chris Claus living with Marianne Jean-Baptiste (best known for ""Without A Trace""), while ""The Shields"", Walton Goggins as Skinny Man is up to his usual psycho killer hitman moves.
He even goes all Bond villain in the snow in a White Hunters suit.
Proving not all bad guys wear black, remember Storm Troopers?
This movie is a slow burn that lives up to the trailer and beyond.
It feels like Fargo with hints of Tarantino and a big build up to a gun fight Spaghetti Western style, it's also dark like Nolans' Batman, but it will make you laugh out embarrassingly loud not just LOL.
This is one unorthodox, disillusioned Santa suffering an existential crisis in Pandemic times.
Let's face it he didn't get this job because he was fat and jolly.
What we see is a Santa who has loathing for a world that has forgotten him.
Mel's not playing a Bad Santa, rather a Bass Ass Santa who keeps his armoury under his bed.
He's desperately trying to keep Christmas alive through US Government budget cuts and even signing a contract with the US Military to make a buck and keep the lights on and the elves fed with a high sugar diet.
Don't knock their elfish lifestyle they outlive us humans.
The body count in this movie is higher than most Festive Season flicks.
It's more ""Die Hard"" than ""Miracle of 34th Street"".
Strap yourselves in for a very different Xmas movie that's an action, comedy, fantasy with no yuletide carols.
This will become a modern cult classic.

The amount of children believing in Santa in 2020 is about right, Because of social Media it would be harder to hide from the outside, and I just love how Santa has to come to terms with himself to become more proactive.

80,MovieWarfare,Some weird clash of tone but entertaining nonetheless,6,12 December 2020,"Fatman is a film with such a ridiculous premise that you wonder how it was even made. The premise is that "" Chris Cringle, also known as Santa Claus, is forced into a partnership with the U.S. military to save his declining business. Making matters worse, Chris gets locked into a deadly battle of wits against a highly-skilled assassin, hired by a precocious 12-year-old, after receiving a lump of coal in his stocking"". I was very intrigued by this movie and the fact that Mel Gibson himself is playing Santa Clause. So was the movie a jolly good time or giant lump of coal?Firstly, the idea and concept of this movie are great. It's ridiculous but it's different and a unique take on the legend himself. The director/writer (Eshom Nelms) manages to somehow bring this legend and make him grounded in reality (sort of). Seeing Chris's/Santa's struggle with declining income due to lack of nice kids and having to not make toys but help the military is intriguing. You're watching this movie hoping to see how Chris/Santa overcomes this dilemma and you want to see him be fulfilled by the end. There is also the massive tension with the impending Hitman getting closer to discovering Santa's location that adds some thrills to the movie. The third act is also a blast to watch.Mel Gibson as the titular character is great casting as well. Mel doesn't phone it in and gives a genuinely strong performance. One moment that sticks in my mind is the part where Santa has to tell the elves that they have to work with the Military. Through Mel's eyes and his bodywork, he convincingly shows the audience how heartbreaking this is for Santa and its surprisingly quite moving. Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Ruth Cringle/Mrs Clause is also really good and her interactions with Chris Cringle/Santa (Mel Gibson) is where the heart of this movie is. The chemistry between the two is heartwarming and makes for an enjoyable watch when the two are together. Chris is grumpy and frustrated the world but Ruth gives him the words and encouragement he needs which is what keeps him together. Walton Goggins as Jonathan Miller the Hitman is good casting as well. He is quirky yet scary and Walton gives a good performance in conveying that.However, the movie does have some pacing issues and can feel quite slow at times. There are a lot of scenes that are just people walking that I feel could have been cut. Likewise, there are a couple of scenes involving the Hitman shopping which I don't think needed to be in the movie and slowed the pacing. Some scenes add to world-building but not the main narrative such as how elves work or how Santa is stronger than normal people. Nonetheless, the scenes don't amount to anything as Santa doesn't ever use his super strength or how the elves operate doesn't matter as they aren't that important to the main story. The 100-minute runtime could have been shortened by at least 10 minutes in my opinion.The movie also has a fair amount of tone clashes. When the movie begins with the kid, it feels like a family comedy. When it goes to the hitman the movie feels like a dark comedy and after getting the call to kill Santa it feels like a thriller. When it comes to Santa it is character-driven drama and then the third act is an action movie. The movie will constantly change perspective from Santa to the Hitman and occasionally to the kid leading to some jarring tone changes. It doesn't always mesh well and can be a bit annoying when it goes to the kid as those parts aren't as enjoyable as the other stuff.Overall, the movie is surprisingly enjoyable. Despite the absurd premise, the movie delivers a relatively entertaining movie with some potent and heartwarming scenes. It may not be a full-on action movie that marketing might lead you to believe but it is certainly a good time.",Fatman

84,PerryAtTheMovies,Turn back now while you still have the chance....,1,6 December 2020,"Initial Thoughts:
What an actual joke of a movie... While the film started off with promise, not even thirty minutes in, it started to go downhill. From a self-absorbed child who acts like he's all that, to an assassin with a Jack Nicholson from ""The Shining"" personna, and beyond, this film does not bring the holiday cheer. The only way you can classify this as a ""Christmas movie"" is because the name 'Santa Claus' is spoken. The action is nothing but mindless, and while Mel Gibson's portrayal of Santa going through the roughness of life was well-done, it was not enough to make this film worth watching.An essay would have to be written to truly describe how bad this film was. Basically, the characters had no backstory. The story itself was poorly written by dropping us in the middle of this child wanting to kill Santa for receiving coal. And while the idea of the US military working with Santa was nice. It did nothing, but create an obstacle of questions. After questioning everything else about this film. If I had known how the ending would be. That would've been enough to deter me from this film.Overall:
If you had this film on your list of Christmas films to watch this December. My recommendation is to go back, check that list, and immediately remove this film. Such a sad excuse for a Christmas movie.Enjoy the show!",Fatman
85,jackbanister16,"Story is a little lackluster, but acting makes it pretty good",7,7 February 2021,"The story loosely draws on Santa's mythos, but presents Santa as having brokered a Faustian deal with the US govt. to manufacture toys with the intent of stimulating the economy. Unlike the normal presentation of St. Nick, Santa can get depressed and run low on Christmas spirit, and there are bills to pay to keep the toy factory afloat. At the end of the day though, this movie is basically a revenge plot between the kids who get lumps of coal and the big, red, fat man.The actors are all top notch, truly. Mel Gibson is awesome as Chris Cringle with a gritty, but vaguely jolly Santa that has been brought down by the realities of life as a sellout. Mrs. Clause, played by Marianne Jean-Baptiste, is Santa's soft place to fall and brings a healthy dose of Christmas spirit to the table. The kid in this movie, Billy Wenan (Chance Hurstfield), is a truly diabolical villain, who in my opinion steals the show. He is almost a little too convincing in his sociopathic role; someone get that kid a shrink lol. A close runner up to the kid is his henchman, the skinnyman (Walter Goggins), who has also been ""wronged"" by Santa. All of the actors in this movie are very good at their jobs and deserve kudos for their performance.The final scene is just excellent acting by Mel Gibson, who makes sure that everyone knows that Santa is making a list, and checking it twice.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie, but I can't give this movie more than 7 stars because the climax was a little underwhelming. The movie builds a good deal of momentum and kind of peters out just when you hope they will turn the dial up to 10 on the action and drama. I'd definitely recommend it to a friend though!",Fatman

The acting overall was pretty good.If I have any complaints is that there were certain parts of the storyline that made no sense other than to prolong the action. I mean Santa getting subsidized by the US government?
And surely Santa had more powers than he used.
And by no means do I want to come across as racist, but come on, a black actress playing Mrs. Kringle?

Meanwhile, the military hires Santa to manufacture control panels. It ends with a western style standoff in Alaska. This bizarre mix of black comedy and thriller is certainly not for all tastes, but is nonetheless unique entertainment although the tone veers wildly from one scene to the next. Walton Goggins is a treat, as usual, as a hugely disgruntled hit man with a chip on the shoulder against Santa. Interesting and watchable fare for a slow evening.",Fatman

Because gift giving during the Christmas season spurs on the economy, the US government is supposed to give the jolly old fat man a kickback so he can keep his gift giving business open, those elf's don't work for free, plus you gotta pay the electric bill and suppliers who provide the raw material that the toys are made from, right?Unfortunately one of the boys is placed on the naughty list so on Christmas morning he finds he is rewarded with a lump of coal. His response? He hires a hitman to take out Santa.This is NOT a family friendly movie. It's hilarious, but not in a family friendly way. I've saw reviews comparing it to Fargo, which I get why, but I'm more inclined to compare it to Grosse Pointe Blank. Everyone treats their role in the movie as if it's a serious drama thriller despite the comical concept for the movie, including Santa's little helpers. They know the boss is stressed over Christmas and the lack of income, but they are loyal to their employer, even coming back from post Christmas vacation early in order to do some side contract work to give Santa some extra funds to keep the operation open.The humor is in Santa's demeanor, snacking on home made cookies by stealing them from his wife. Knowing each individual he sees by name and in a few occasions steering them in the right direction when you know that they are going to make a bad decision.In short, Santa is having a crisis of faith and his ever faithful wife strives to keep him grounded...

She (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) and Gibson had fantastic chemistry. Made me remember Lethal Weapon and the chemistry between Gibson and Danny Glover. Mel may have gotten a bad wrap from some, but he is an excellent and entertaining actor. He's had a few duds lately, but I don't think he gives 2 craps.

131,passan-80670,A good movie about a dumb thing.,6,20 November 2020,"This is not a charismas movie and certainly not a children movie, but more a story based western if anything. It has humorous elements, but it is never funny.
Basically, the journey of a killer to reach Santa, a kid that is being a villain for some reason and Santa who actually is battling a mild ""depression"" because how unpleasantly the world is evolving.The writers put a lot of logic and thought in to it and tried to make it grounded. For me it worked quite well, but sadly for most people it didn't.
It is a world where Santa exists. NOT reality obviously. Once you can realize this flaw, it starts to make sense. They explain a lot of elements as logical and reasonable they can with such a dumb premise and they stay consistent with everything they show/we learn.
They break or avoid some clichés you would expect in such a movie.On a technical level it was fine. Very few bad scenes, but sadly very few good scenes as well.The cast was fine. The acting was better than expected and in many scenes the acting was even great. The child actor as the villain was surprisingly good. I liked his scream and how unlikeable he was..
The score was a mix between ""stock-music""-like and actually really good.
There was very little action in the movie, but when it was there was mostly fine. They actually use single fire and reload their guns! The standoff between Santa and the Hitman was tense and fun. The outcome was unexpectedly expected. It evolved in to a solid action movie for a few minutes.
It is competently shot with fine camerawork and since I do have a soft spot for movies that are shot outside, I was satisfied.
Sadly not many locations the actual story takes place.Marianne Jean-Baptiste's hair was the worst thing ever. Why did she had to have haircut like a hipster? Why couldn't she have normal hair? Her Hair was the only thing that pissed me off.I have some problems with the movie, but what makes this movie good is how serious everyone takes the entire premise. Yet the entire movie takes itself not serious because it is about a killer trying to kill Santa.
The 2nd act/buildup to the standoff was a little bit convoluted. It was still interesting to see how they would reach the 3rd act.The conclusion was not as good, but it made sense for the characters and felt natural.",Fatman

In this movie, Chris a.k.a the Fatman (Mel Gibson) and his wife Ruth (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) are having serious financial difficulty, and the stress is taking its toll on both their relationship and their business which is in peril of closing down. In order to survive Chris takes on a military contract to make the proverbial ends meet. His staff are forced to use their manufacturing talents in novel ways to help support Chris and Ruth in this venture.
Meanwhile Billy (Chance Hurstfield) is busy extorting his grandma, intimidating his competitors and generally being a dick to the household staff... Behaviour which earns him a large lump of coal from the Fatman, and leaves him with a hankering for vengeance.
Enter Johnathan Miller a.k.a the Skinny man (Played with relish by Walton Goggins, veteran of the creepy-nutcase-baddie roles), who is hired by Billy to exact revenge on Chris, and who is all-too-happy to take on the hit, because he too has unresolved issues with the Fatman.
This movie starts with a novel premise, and builds momentum as it goes along, starting slow and steadily building pace until the final scenes. It is not a laugh-out-loud comedy, it's dark and the humour is in the irreverence to traditional values and common courtesy. The four main characters are adept at eliciting the desired reactions from the audience, the dialogue is witty and poignant, and the supporting characters prop them up with strong performances. Cinematography is fluid and beautiful, from wide snow-filled scenes to facial close-ups, and there's no shaky cam during action scenes. Sound is crisp and helps set the mood well.

147,olympicator,Oddly Brilliant,8,16 December 2020,"I don't know how this movie got made, but I am really glad it did.This is a sick, violent, sophisticated thriller, and at the same time it is a dark comedy that had me laughing out loud, and at the same time it is a Christmas movie. In fact, it is one of the most poignant Christmas movies I have seen in years.Christmas has become commercial, because we have become commercial - we know what we want, and we just want more and more of it. So this movie shows Santa's workshop as an elaborate business, one that we are squeezing and taking advantage of. Santa is tired of it, but what can he do? He cannot ignore his omniscient view of people's morality (or their lack of it). He must adapt. But of course the greedy spoiled children of the world do not approve. They expected him to be a blank check, and one disappointed little boy finally goes too far and actually seeks revenge against Santa Claus.I have seen Christmas movies lately that tried to be dark comedies and ended up perverted and ugly (""Krampus,"" ""Better Watch Out""). But this movie does not lose sight of the moral that the best Christmas movies strive to achieve, the moral of morality itself, of goodness and care and simple compassion. Like the Grinch, like Ebenezer Scrooge, the Santa Claus in this movie has a kind heart that we can appreciate after he has rediscovered it.Does this message belong in a violent movie? Absolutely. In fact, that was what has been missing from so many soulless, choppy action movies these days: a heart. It's the heart that makes action movies like ""Die Hard"" and ""Terminator II"" so enduring.This movie is far from perfect, and yet it works almost seamlessly. The hitman didn't have much depth to him, he was almost a caricature, but I think that made him a good foil to Chris himself, who has a wife and a team of workers who respect him. I dislike Mel Gibson as a person but I have admitted that he makes some great movies, and he throws his all into this one. The comical absurdity of the movie made it seem preposterous at times, and I went with it. Like Julie Taymor's ""Titus,"" this movie goes over the top and knows it.I honestly wish they had come up with a better title for this movie, because when I first heard of it I just thought it sounded like a fist-brained parody of a Santa Claus origin story. It is not that, at all. I'm not sure what would have been a better title - ""Harder than Coal""? I know titles can be tough, but ""Fatman"" really doesn't fit.I had trouble motivating myself to watch this movie, but I genuinely enjoyed it.

155,benisof,Interesting take on Santa!,10,10 December 2020,"The critics should just shut up on this one!The movie was good, entertaining. Despite being a bit slow and short it felt like just right. The story managed to capture some of the psychology of the people involved. It was absurd at times, supernatural at others. It managed to get into some modern politics and economic aspects, somehow. If you are in doubt, just watch it.",Fatman

157,bobzzy,It's deeper than that,10,4 December 2020,"I admit I decided to watch the movie just because of two reasons - Mel Gibson and Walton Goggins.
At first I thought it's gonna be some black comedy, it turned out to be more than that, making you think after you hear & see what characters say & do in the course of the action:
What Christmas stands for?Haven't we forgotten its meaning?How close are we to the point where we are going to kill it ..forever ?That's why I gave this movie 10/10, because it's not aiming for the popcorn digesting audience, or at least I hope so...P.S.

159,RennerFilms,Very Odd Film *SPOILERS*,3,27 November 2020,"The premise was interesting enough I suppose, but here are the things I had trouble with.-The hitman calls Mel ""Fatman"" (and it's the title). He's not the slightest bit fat. Did they originally intend to cast a fat actor? Or is it meant to be ironic?-Santa flies around the world in a night on his sleigh (i.e. magic). Yet his face-off with the hitman is a gun battle. Why? Doesn't Santa have powers he can use? (apart from surviving headshots)-The military want to use his elves. Wouldn't they be more interested in this guy's immortality? Or the fact that he has somehow discovered a mythological species?-A single hitman kills an entire army unit? And why would he bother? He's only been paid to kill one man.-The build-up to the face-off is slow, slow, slow. Hitman kills a lot of people. Santa moans about his finances. Yawn.-The hitman buys Christmas presents. Because he only got a toy car as a kid? Um....okay. Oh, but he has a hamster. (??)Was this supposed to be a comedy?

Important plot points are revealed and left hanging, abandoned.This is NOT a comedy. All the funny parts are in the misleading trailer.This movie is not one to evoke the Christmas spirit or celebrate Christmas with.Christmas and Santa are here in name only, to drive a senseless wreck of a poorly made and directed movie. The writers should be fired and never write again.Seriously, its that bad.I like campy movies, 80s movies, corny movies, cute movies, etc. This is none of that.

I found myself wondering the extent of his magic and how it works. It certainly made me want to see more of this world. Gibson is surprisingly vulnerable as well as intimidating in the role.

162,puzgolac,"An interesting idea, but they didn't do anything with it",4,22 November 2020,"I don't know what this movie was supposed to be. It is not a comedy, because it simply isn't funny. I can't recall a single time that i even exhaled the air through my nose a bit louder, let alone laugh during watching it.
It isn't an action movie, because the action scenes are sparse and, more importantly, amateurishly done. You're more likely to laugh at the action scenes (and not in a good way) than at the ""funny"" lines.
It isn't a thriller, because the story is undeveloped and, despite the movie having an interesting premise, the actual plot is quite bland. They missed every opportunity to make the story interesting and compelling. Throughout the movie I kept expecting it to get better, but it just never did.This definitely is a different kind of Christmas movie, but different doesn't necessarily mean better nor even good enough.
One final note - despite people who keep calling this movie Tarantino-esque, it is nothing like it, so you'll be even more disappointed if you watch it expecting some kind of Tarantino vibes.",Fatman
163,joe6629,Who Is This For?,2,22 November 2020,"The idea of Santa having a hit put out on him by a disgruntled, corrupt, psychopathic child is interesting - and given that Mel Gibson had signed on I figured it was worth a shot. What Fatman is though, is hard to describe: Fatman portrays adult themes, profanity, and violence mixed with adolescent dialog and plots. You have an (alcoholic) Santa character vacillating between compassionate and psychopathic. You have fantasy concepts mixed with attempts at ""realism/grittiness"" and the standard injection of ""woke"" themes (Mrs. Cringle is Black?) that left me wondering who the heck this movie is supposed to be for? Adults? No - Writing is simplistic and bland. Children? No - too much profanity, violence, and adult themes. People who consider themselves ""edgy""? Maybe(?).At the end of it all, my overwhelming impression was ""What WAS that!?""",Fatman

166,predatorlm,Great gritty comedy,8,2 February 2021,I love Mel Gibson and am also a big fan of Walton Goggins so of course I had to watch this movie. It looked funny from the trailer and whenever Mel Gibson is in something I try and see it but I can happily say my expectations were surpassed by the movie. It works as an action movie but also has a certain variety of comedy in it where nobody is really laughing in the movie but it's funny to the viewer. Something I would definitely watch again.,Fatman

Now I'm partial to film (the warm feeling) as this movie is straight up digital (the cold feeling).. ugh.. anyways... The cast was good with some well known familiar names. Just feel that this film was going through an identity crisis and Mel Gibson's acting in this one felt so much like Gerard Butler's acting in The Den of Thieves. Worth the watch but definitely not going in the Hall of Fame X-mas movies!",Fatman
168,gtessarini,Don't mess with Santa,7,16 December 2020,"Starring Mel Gibson, this Christmas production is not in the same genre of films that we watch with children at the end of the year.With an indicative rating from the age of 16, Fatman brings a fanciful and hopeful narrative of Santa Claus, the good old man with a white beard who brings us gifts and the joy of Christmas, in a more realistic and embittered situation.Situated in the real world, where Santa Claus needs to seek new commercial partnerships with the American army to save his operation from bankruptcy, the mythical and magical figure tries to maintain persistence in the increasingly disappointing and scarce, Christmas spirit, as he struggles and gun to the teeth.It would be difficult to imagine a story in which Santa Claus, a practically omniscient and immortal man, as well as his wife and elves, could walk the streets, go to the bar, maintain his wedding and pay as bills from his toy factory as a being real human. Fatman can manage to bring this narrative in a very elaborate way thinking of the realistic air of the story.This fantasy picture that links comedy and action has no super jokes or sketches designed to be explicitly informed, but it is able to hold your attention in a very interesting way. Imagining the serious, plausible explanations and techniques in a subtle and objective way for the existence of all this fable, the film generates a good dose of humor and curiosity.With subtlety in presenting this magical figure hidden in the form of a common businessman, with many years of marriage and that practice shooting and crossfit, this movie conveys empathy with the good old man - strong as hell -, discredited in human kindness and Christmas, as well as that of a bankrupt businessman after trying to pursue the famous ""American dream"".Bluntly, arcs of redemption or even great moral lessons, Fatman captivates with curiosity, the air of comedy it involves, and the action and shooting scenes with the villain of the film, played by Walton Goggins, an assassin cold, calculating and distressed with Santa Claus, as well as the sulky child who hires him to kill him.It is not ideal to have very young children in the room when watching this movie, but the production's Rambo style makes it fun to watch at various times of the year.",Fatman

This movie goes to some extremes in every aspect of the Santa Claus story line. Not something from your childhood. Don't think that you will see a jolly guy in a red suit, reindeer, or anything traditional. Just a guy running a business in modern times (okay, there are elves), and having to put up with the worst of his bad list.Classic Gibson.

I liked Mel as Santa and Walton as the bad guy (the little kid was good), but it seemed like there wasnt enough script to go into the movie. Much of the violence was offscreen and there wasn't enough language to make it Rated R. It was extremely slow (albeit funny) until the last 20 minutes and it was then over. It needed more action.

183,JRodFilms,"'Fatman"" is just as boring as Christmas Mass",4,23 November 2020,"I kind of wondered why I wasn't impressed by the trailer to 'Fatman'. I also wondered why I sort of ran to the theater to see it. It's really because movie theaters are open in my area, and I have been enjoying Mel Gibson's career resurgence. Since I didn't really follow ""Fatman"" leading up to its release, I didn't know much about it except that it sort of is a 'Revenge Santa' movie. Given Mel Gibson's reputation with his films being violent, and my interest in alternate Christmas content ala 'Silent Night, Deadly Night', I was willing to give 'Fatman' a try.The concept of ""Fatman"" sounds like something out of B Movie Heaven: When a spoiled brat receives a lump of coal for being naughty, he hires a hitman to kill Santa! Unfortunately, ""Fatman"" never charters into B-movie territory; but takes itself entirely way too serious. Sometimes this works, most of the time it doesn't. There is entirely too much buildup and not enough payoff.Fatman has a charming, almost Hallmark movie-of-the-week like quality; such as the location of the film being set in North Peak, Alaska, and that Mel Gibson's character name is actually Chris Cringle. Taking the realism even a step further, Cris' business of bringing joy to the world has been in a steady decline, with the kids around the world seemingly turning more bad. With profits not being what they're used to, the government is forced to step in to subsidize the cost.The idea of a child hiring a hitman to kill Santa sounds like the perfect opportunity to see a Jolly Ol' Saint Nick from Hell. ""Fatman"" never dives into those waters, but instead focuses on the Cris Cringle we already know: He is a family man and he loves his elves. I don't think I caught the reason as to why our antagonist Billy had entirely way too much power in his hands. By the end of the film, ""Fatman"" of course has the opportunity to destroy Billy. If the reason for Fatman letting him get off easy was for a sequel, then my faith in a higher power has diminished.",Fatman

The kids these days, you see, just ain't up to snuff and as a result of their epic naughtiness Santa's gift giving has dropped precipitously. This lack of good boys and girls in turn has halved his U.S. government gift procurement stipend - like a federal Christmas stimulus program - Santa figures he adds three trillion to the U.S. economy - and he's in dire straits financially and contemplating retirement. Luckily, Uncle Sam sweeps in with an offer to have the elves build weaponry during the slow months, which Santa reluctantly accepts.You can pretty much forget that part of the movie though as the Army guys are totally unnecessary, and just added for some half-assed political commentary about the military industrial complex or something.The real antagonist comes not from Santa's budget, but from Walter Goggins, a Santa-hating hitman, who is hired by a disgruntled, spoiled child. Goggins is pretty great, even if he's a little all over the place, because the movie's a little all over the place. Apparently his hatred of Santa is somehow the result of his abusive childhood - he asked Santa for new parents? - but this is never fully explained and like the Army bit is just kind of unnecessary backstory. Accept him as your weirdo hitman with a grudge against Santa - he needs no sadness or redemption. The kid who hires him is an acceptably clichéd rich, spoiled brat.",Fatman

But letting the source and cause of all the bloodshed in this movie off the hook merely because he's a 12 year old boy was a very unsatisfactory decision on the part of the writer, producer, and director.

killing of totally innocent people are NOT exactly Christmas fair.
Bad boy Billy, a rich,spoiled little twerk hires a hit man to kill Santa and
cut off his head. In the meantime, Billy steals grandma's checks and tries to
poison her to death by spiking her milk. The hitman does his job but at the shootout, the hundreds of elves and 1000's of soldiers supposedly at the scene, magically disappear. Chris Cringle miraculously survives, finds Billy and warns him Never to be a bad boy again. End of Story. This movie is definitely NOT a feel good Christmas movie.",Fatman

Now i like Mel Gibson since his early days of mad max through to Lethal Weapon and beyond but this movie literally takes the christmas cookie....There are good actors in this with Walter Goggins as he is excellent as the skinnyman assassian and cold hearted towards his employer but he has a kind and soft side as he travels with a hamster and buys gifts for it.. Mel Gibson does what Mel Gibson normally does.. But the overall premise of trying to kill santa claus because he didnt leave a gift for christmas leaves a lot to think about.....Very slow start and if you are wanting to watch this based on the fact Santa Claus is in it then be prepared to be disappointed..😕😕,Fatman

Maybe the hitman requesting support from other killers who are disappointed by santa whould have been a good idea.

The are not. The trailer, like many others, over time has sold this picture very well, alas the final cut, is a mixed up bag of nuts and bolts that don't fit.
I think it was probably shut down due to Covid and they just never found their feet, when shooting commenced.
I like Mel Gibson, I think he has the potential for a few great films in him and I do not have an issue with Chris's wife, Ruth being black, unlike some on this board. I'm ready for a black James Bond, 2020 get over your bigotry. I did however find Marianne Jean-Baptiste's acting flat. It felt like she didn't want to be there. Why , oh why, did they build Walton Goggin's character, Skinny Man, up with an interesting hobby of collecting Santa's old Christmas presents just to drop it without explanation? Why did he buy and have shelves, of Santa's present's wrapped in plastic? He seemed to obsess over them in the first half of the film!? I think his appearance in the film with all the snow, playing an assassin is why people get that, Quentin Tarantino vibe. Django & Hateful Eight come to mind. It isn't a classic sadly and the army coming in to build panels for jet fighters!? What the heck? That's when you know it's turned the corner. It just doesn't make much sense after that. The centre can not hold. You'll probably watch it because, like me the trailer sold it but I should have known better. The trailer had the best bits in it. I did chuckle when Santa is calling around for help with the business and he's on the phone, trying to drum up business and says, ""Elon this is Chris, what have you got for me?"" Santa's little helpers have some good lines, the best is in the trailer and were not used to full effect. Elf 7, (Eric Wolfe.) was a solid actor.
As others have said this could have been a great alternative, Christmas film but it fails badly. Such a shame!!
Mel Gibson is the best part of it.

285,fiiig99,I liked it!,10,31 July 2021,"If little Billy Wenan doesn't get some discipline or fatherly guidance in his life he might end up an adult psychopath like skinny man.The time out generation and participation trophy crowd get an old fashioned reality check when they try to have a temper tantrum on Santa.The movie is about more than it appears and Santa's naughty or nice list is serious business. There has been a serious loss of moral fiber and accountability in the current generations.The audience is a winner though is this alternate Christmas themed movie. Great start, slow middle and great ending.",Fatman
286,peterfayek2002,One of Mel Gibson Top 20s,9,9 September 2021,"Actually this is one of the best Mel Gibson movies ... Top 20It isn't the patriot or brave heart, but it is somethingI don't understand the hate and why people didn't understand the movie, it is 2020 so Santa Clause has changed as people changed, U. S. military now controls Santa Clause and his elf teams factory and movements to protect him cause his safety considered as national security financially and sociallyPeople aren't so nice anymore they became more aggressive due to capitalism which translates as taxes and heavy daily expenses they will attack someone like Santa Clause to steal him or even will be greedy if they didn't get the impossible wishes like getting parents back (Skinny man) or even just receiving a coal in a socket (Billy Wenan) who hired skinny man to kill him eventuallyEven Santa has changed because of their cruelty and financial pressures which affected him too, he became depressed, he never wears the same red nice clothes and riding deers he is now riding a motorcycle and focusing on the night not just to give kids toys during their sleep but simply cause he really needs to avoid people during his working hours And above all he keeps guns under his bed.This one of the best Mel Gibson Movies I've ever seen, Not Top 5 or 10 but of course Top 20.",Fatman
287,declan-12863,"Not Bad, Just Boring",4,5 December 2020,It's just a really average action and follows a very similar basic storyline just with a new coat of paint. I'd say most people like me were watching it because of Mel Gibson but the film barely follows him most of the time it's spent watching from Walton Goggins perspective (bad guy in the film) this makes him very unlikable,Fatman
288,bjbenson-04315,"Not Funny, Not Interesting, Not Good",1,16 November 2020,"I was excited about this movie. I thought the idea of a hitman hell bent on taking out Santa could be quite funny, in a dark comedy kind of way. If that was the intent, it failed. The plot is stupid. The characters are uninteresting. The only funny lines are in the trailer. The geography doesn't even make sense. It's just stupid, and in the end, I didn't particularly care if they killed Santa or not.",Fatman

291,tandrewp-02377,My new favorite Christmas movie,9,1 December 2020,"My bar for this movie was pretty low, the trailer looked amazingly dark and gritty but I was not sure they could pull off this unique concept. Well I'm glad I was wrong. It was a fun bloody dark comedy with a Santa that has the weight of the world on his shoulders feeling like a failure.Mrs clause is great too. She reminds him of why he does what he does in a beautiful way that honestly brought a tear to my eye. It reminded me of my childhood dreams and how I tried to capture them.Over all a wonderful movie. Walton Coggins is brilliant as well. Great cast of people and slips in to my number one Christmas movie knocking down Die Hard to number 2.",Fatman
292,orlink,A bit surreal comedy,10,10 January 2021,"Contrasts and surprises in many layers. Lots of very good acting especially by Gibson and the child actor Hersfield. Amazing music.

It is so surreal, fantasy mixed with elements of reality (in a way). Mel Gibson is great. Loved the elfs, I did not expect them as I thought this was some sort of action with a human Santa, and then they appear. Great. I was pleasantly surprised. Again, surreal. I agree with another review: best Christmas movie since Die Hard.",Fatman
299,kramercosmo,FATMAN - a new christmas classic,10,8 November 2020,"FATMAN is the third movie I watched from the Nelms brothers, it is their best one yet.The first one - LOST ON PURPOSE - was a beautiful love letter to the area and to the times they grew up in. A little film with a fantastic cast - a pure work of passion.The second one - SMALL TOWN CRIME - is a superb genre mix: Thriller, action, drama, Film Noir - STC has it all.And now there is FATMAN.
The plot sounds so crazy, totally out of the box.
It is an artistic miracle what Eshom and Ian Nelms did with this weird but great idea.First and foremost, the cast is just amazing.
It seems Mel Gibson was born for this part, there could not have been a better choice for Santa. At least not for this Santa.
Walton Goggins is a great actor for sure, I like him since The Shield. But he surely surpassed my high expectation in Fatman. His performance is pure gold.
Marianne Jean-Baptiste has a great chemistry with Mel Gibson, another ideal casting choice.
Last but not least, Chance Hurstfield plays the nasty kid, and he surely does a great job since I disliked this little devil soon after some minutes.The setting (the film was shot in Canada) also fits perfectly into the winter / christmas scenario. It creates the fitting atmosphere for this wild ride.FATMAN delivers the perfect mixture of humor, drama, action and violence.
Thanks to the great job of the Nelms brothers and the perfect cast, FATMAN is likely to become another 'christmas classic' like Die Hard.A masterpiece and a must-see.",Fatman

So what if it is a Christmas story with several twists? The acting was good, the scenery was good, and there is nothing wrong with the story and it was good filmmaking. The only possible thing that could be wrong is if you cannot deviate from the classical jolly Xmas story long enough to appreciate this film.

I'll take the ""FATMAN""",6,29 November 2020,"Given the year most of us have had, ""FatMan"" is the kick in the classical holiday bells we've been looking for, I'd say.With Mel Gibson delivering the crotchety/sweet and worn down Chris Kringle that only he could deliver, and the ever increasingly iconic Walter Goggins effortlessly delivering a slithering, obsessed assassin assigned to kill the FatMan himself... how could it go wrong?Well, quite easily, actually (I mean, seriously - is this flick serious?). But, rather surprisingly, aside for some mild pacing the film lacks at points, it manages quite deftly and sincerely to manage the heavy task of juggling tongue-and-cheek hard edge grit and (you guessed it) Christmas mother-flucking-spirit.It's no Christmas classic, and certainly no Tarentino, but it's not trying to be.Stuff ""FatMan"" in your stocking. He's jolly enough for this Christmas.",Fatman

Some cheesy one liners would have made this movie much better! Unfortunately it ended up just being an overly violent movie (like it seems all movies are these days) that centered around the least merry Santa I have ever seen!I really liked the premise around the film but I wish they would have overplayed the roles. Make Santa super tough, put him on a motor cycle, give him some tattoos, that would be awesome! The Santa in this film was just a sad old man and no one wants to see that",Fatman

Seriously, go see it for yourself, you might get a few laughs out of it!Now, my 10-star isn't exactly the most objective rating as well but hear me out. Remember those movies from the 80s and 90s with horrible plots? Plots so horrible, they actually want to make you see them.Well Fatman is a similar type of movie but with good production and names like Mel Gibson and Walton Goggins on board.Plot is a fun, creative one. You shouldn't take it seriously. There aren't many jokes to laugh at. The movie takes itself very seriously (but also know it shouldn't be taken that way), which is what makes it funny. Acting is good. Even the child actor Chance Hurstfield was impressive. Soundtrack was okay.Overall it was a fun trip. Which is what I expect from any movie.",Fatman

322,ksobharaj,Surprisingly serious approach makes it quite special,9,9 December 2020,"Very unusual to a movie nowadays, a very preposterous setting takes itself very seriously to the point that the smile wears off and before you know it it's taken off on a totally believable plot. I was in for some absurdity and laughs but was impressed by how they pulled it off.Santa's principles and belives have not changed but are sure receding in modern world. He's a badass, a sign of seeing the world change for long time and changing with it. But his fights are still for instilling morality and compassion. Struggles and villains come in all shapes and are moulded out of several reasons. What might seem silly, just might make sense in this.And Mel Gibson! Always a delight to watch him. He's very grounded in this for all the possible ways it would have gone off rails with a setting like this.Always loved a movie that surprised me and turned my opinion (or prejudice) on it. And this, this surprised me a lot!",Fatman

I can't tell if the filmmakers wanted to be funny (moments like the hitman's hamster and the Elves sugar buffet feel like they trend that way) and just utterly failed or if this is intended as a grim dark affair but then the magic of Santa travelling the world and a workshop of actual elves seems out of place. The actual film is a pretty unremittingly grim affair that takes itself way too seriously and has a lot of pretty graphic violence.

Welcome to the 21st century Hollywood, where money making is still the king, but also, PC is a must. The many Chinese elements certainly try to appease the vast Chinese audience, but I am not sure how that patriotic song made famous by the HK singer resonates with the Communist censors. The bloody scene is totally unnecessary give the general tone of the movie. Only explanation is because the Chinese audience loves it. I have to admit it strikes a good balance between a light comedy and a dark, Fargo-sque mystery thriller.

Mel was Mel. Nice touch with interracial marriage, this was a highlight. Dark realistic premise of Chris Cringle's lived reality. However, the film didn't know what it wanted to be. Drama/thriller like 2019's Joker? No. DramCom like so many other Christmas flicks? No. Comedy? Nope, too cheesy to be funny in parts. Western? Maybe.The kid was intolerable. Walton Gobbins was a disaster in this role, he alone ruined a new take on an old tale for me. Were there sincere likable moments? Certainly. It wasn't all bad.Yet with all that being said, the hardest pill to swallow wasn't the seemingly immortal Santa, the inept military influence, or that Santa is real. No, it was the idea that Ruth Cringle, a strong woman of color, would willfully live in Alaska.Decent movie. About what I expected. Hoped for more.",Fatman

Mel Gibson is great as manic/depressive Santa, and his wife is good too!
I love Walton's ride to Canada, all the transitions, trying to guess what music is going to be played, and the cherry on top that is ""all evil guys listen to Rush.""

Loved some of the concepts of santa and his workshop and the whole subcontracting out the elfs to US military.Could of used a bit more action midway and the grand finale could of been longer and better some how but over all fun romp with some good comedy thrown in and Christmas messaging underlying.

351,tnbobojoe,Funny premise with great execution,8,3 December 2020,"I was going into this movie expecting to enjoy it, and wasn't disappointed. The writers clearly knew how ridiculous the idea was, and played into the craziness wholeheartedly. I especially loved how both of the villains were completely larger than life and somewhat stereotypical- it's just a fun watch overall.
What I was most surprised by was their take on how Santa manages to do what he does (with government subsidies) and how he runs his workshop more like a typical factory. It definitely fit the tone of the movie, and I liked that Santa just kind of felt like an average joe who was struggling because it was a take on the character I hadn't seen before. I was also pleasantly surprised by how well developed the relationship between both of the Clauses was and found myself rooting for them throughout the film.
If you decide to watch this movie, I'd say it's best to do it with a group of friends who want to have a laugh and see some classic gun fights. The plot is fairly straightforward and you get what you expect, but there's definitely a level of charm to the film that I quite enjoyed.",Fatman

Great performances all around, and clever script and concept. Exposition is minimal, but the world-building is clear.

I saw it last night and I'll buy the DVD when it comes out because I want to see it again. So many great scenes: when Chris says I'll take the Walker too; when the elf dismantles the bomb; when hit man breaks the other guys arm during training; when the guy sells his baseball bat with the made in Santa's workshop plaque; when Ruth finishes the blanket; when Chris repairs the sled; when hit man is warning the girl to keep her mouth shut in the car; explaining the elf diet; the final shoot out; when Chris is feeding the reindeer and the government men come in and Chris looks at one and says it was a little touch and go with you for a while there wasn't it; and on and on. Don't go into this movie looking for a meatball comedy, it's more of a critique on what a bunch of selfish a-holes we can be and maybe we should do something about that.",Fatman

I liked the whole idea of santa having some other dimensions to his character. It was this that grabed my attention.

The so called 'critics' who reviewed this movie have no idea what they're talking about when they straight up say that it wasn't a good movie. I will continue to recommend this movie to all of my good friends because I know that they will enjoy it just as much as I did. I think the 'critics' didn't like this movie as much because they simply just don't know what dark-humor is. Not only was the plot fascinating, but the storyline and simply everything about this movie was intriguing. 10/10 would watch again. 10/10 would recommend. If I could give this movie an 11/10 I would. But honestly, these 'critics' must be 70 years old and unable to comprehend what humor or a good movie is.

It's got a hit man going after Santa Claus and killing hundreds... it's not dark in a good or funny way. It's just deeply disturbing and dark and I finished it and felt angry I subjected myself to that. And spent the $ to rent it.

What was the point of making this?It is far too violent for children.It is too stupid for adults.The idea of Santa having a hit put out on him by a disgruntled, corrupt, psychopathic child is interesting - and given that Mel Gibson had signed on I figured it was worth a shot. What Fatman is though, is hard to describe: Fatman portrays adult themes, profanity, and violence mixed with adolescent dialog and plots. You have an (alcoholic) Santa character vacillating between compassionate and psychopathic. You have fantasy concepts mixed with attempts at ""realism/grittiness"" and the standard injection of ""woke"" themes (Mrs. Cringle is Black?) that left me wondering who the heck this movie is supposed to be for? Adults? No - Writing is simplistic and bland. Children? No - too much profanity, violence, and adult themes. People who consider themselves ""edgy""? Maybe(?).I dont want think what was the point from the movie.",Fatman

These performances is what makes the film so frustrating. It had the bones to be cult classic that could be rewatched on a snowy day every year. The problem is, it didn't go far enough. It needed to be more comedic and ridiculous or have more of the great interaction and action between Goggins and Gibson.

434,adpantano,"Instead of shiny and bright, dark but humorous",8,13 January 2021,"Let's face it, in reality we have come to the overall dismal mood portrayed in this movie. The derogatory name given to Santa as Fatman sets the stage for the worn out Santa who is disillusioned by the behavior of kids nowadays. This affects his finances and he is forced to work for whomever can pay him well. So here comes the military contract. Add a rich, lonely kid who gets a lump of coal for Christmas and hires a hit man to kill Santa. The savior of this movie are the characters. Santa is beer-drinking, gruff, and angry version of himself and is played by Mel Gibson to near perfection. The hitman has these weird but funny hangups that lighten up his terrible assignment. And of course the military is somewhat bumbling. Mrs Santa is calm and lovingly supportive to Santa. The boy who puts the contract on Santa evokes more emotion from you than just disgust. And the actors play these roles as well as Mel Gibson. Yes, this is a new darker twist in Santa and Christmas but what it really does is reflect the frame of mind of the world lately.
