0,MartinHafer,overrated but very good,7,28 June 2005,"Some of the positive reviews I just read on IMDb make me wonder if I saw the same film they did. ""One of the greatest films ever made"" and ""a masterpiece""???!!! Come on, this is a very good film but I would reserve these raves for other films! The performances and writing for the family is amazing at times--I particularly liked the grandmother's performance. Her use of expression and manners made me believe she was real and I wanted her to be MY grandmother. Her sons, daughter-in-laws and servants were also excellent. On the other hand, Fanny was practically absent from the movie and Alexander, at times, seemed like a zombie. I suspect it must be hard to direct and write for children, as their parts just didn't feel real to me. The evil Bishop and his family were well presented and I had no problems here. The only REAL problem I had was with the bizarre son of the Jewish man who rescued the children. He was kept locked away and was either some sort of psychopath or pedophile or witch--his part was so brief and poorly presented he was just a confusion. I know that Bergman likes occasional surreal touches but to me this just looks more like an omission versus a real attempt to challenge the viewer. I THINK Bergman was trying to imply that this man molested Alexander but whether or not this occurred it just didn't fit the film.One other gripe I had is that the film seemed a little too black and white in its presentation and seems to show a real bias on Bergman's part concerning traditional morality. The Ekdahl family is rather worldly (with son Carl's MANY sexual escapades and his family's tacit approval) and sweet AND the Bishop's family is stern, wicked and visually frightening.",Fanny and Alexander
1,TheLittleSongbird,Sweden's greatest director continues to captivate!,10,3 September 2012,"The Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, Persona and Cries and Whispers are all wonderful films(The Magic Flute is also very interesting), and Fanny and Alexander is up there as one of Ingmar Bergman's best films. As ever with Bergman it is incredibly well-made, the scenery is sumptuous and you can see just looking at the film why Sven Nykvist's cinematography won an Oscar, every frame is beautifully and atmospherically composed. The sparsely-used score is likewise effective, pleasant to listen to as well as fitting well with each scene. The direction as you'd expect with Bergman is superb, even if Fanny and Alexander is perhaps different from Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries in the themes it explores and with not as much visual imagery, it all feels well-paced that I never felt myself getting bored throughout the three-hour running time. The script is thought-provoking, and the acting makes the most of their sharply defined characters, Allan Edvall's Oscar and Bertil Guve's Alexander in particular are very moving. The atmosphere Fanny and Alexander also compels you in, right from the fairy-tale cosy like feel of the start of the film at Christmas to the scary and frightening scenes with Ishmael. The story, told through the eyes of Alexander as he encounters his oppressive father, his god-fearing mother and the loving family he has, is powerful, touching and sometimes frightening. Bergman even includes some autobiographical elements that makes Fanny and Alexander all the more fascinating. In conclusion, a wonderful captivating film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Fanny and Alexander
2,SnoopyStyle,Not my cup of tea but still impressed with two scenes,6,21 March 2014,"Fanny and Alexander are young children of Oscar and Emilie Ekdahl. They come from a bourgeois Swedish family early in the twentieth century who run a local theater company. Oscar's mother supported the theater and is excited that it's actually making a small profit. His brother is even worst relying heavily on his mother. After Oscar's early death, Emilie remarries a harsh brutal bishop. The children especially Alexander suffer his cruelty.I am definitely not a Bergman film aficionado. This is a long grind for me. However there are a couple of incredible scenes in this movie. Those scenes in addition to others help me grind this out. I do have a problem with the supernatural climax. I don't understand where that comes from. Certainly, the rest of the movie don't really allude to something in that genre. I just choose to ignore most of the ending.",Fanny and Alexander
3,Hitchcoc,Remarkable and Unsettling,10,26 October 2009,"The attraction of this film confuses me I tried hard to divorce myself from the temptation to evaluate a film positively, even though I didn't care much for the characters. I was interested in; the title because Fanny is almost a non-entity. Though she shares her brother's hardships, she doesn't have much of a significant role. I also found Emilie, the mother, not very admirable. Alexander is spoiled and cynical, and then all those pompous, amoral relatives. Then it dawned on me. Bergman is just showing us a slice of life. We don't need to admire them, but rather be entertained by their woven tapestry. It is a big, powerful, haunting film, with some of the most wonderful cinematography I've seen, Nyquist at his best. The story delves into the supernatural and leaves many questions unanswered. The decadence continues and the family remains, but so do the ghosts. After viewing the trilogy: the Bergman angst-athon, this was refreshing, though many of the same themes are there. They are just presented in a different way.",Fanny and Alexander
4,Prismark10,Call me Ishmael,6,11 October 2016,"Clocking in at 3 hours this is a long movie and it is rambling as well. Ingmar Bergman with his cinematographer Sven Nyqvist has made a gorgeous looking film, the art and set direction is exemplary.The film is set in a Swedish town in the early years of the 20th Century. The focus is on the Ekdahl household, a theatrical and gregarious family, there is warmth and bawdiness.Fanny and Alexander have a seemingly idyllic family life but things change when their father Oscar dies from a stroke. Now the children become more important in the film, almost soon their mother Emilie marries the Bishop Edvard, who lives an austere lifestyle with his family. The children are not happy under this stern household which is a contrast to the warmth and love that had previously existed.In its kernel, the film is not that far departed from David Copperfield. The priest is really Mr Murdstone, who has charmed the beautiful widow but has a heart of darkness that Alexander immediately senses. As Edvard cannot gain the children's respect he becomes a brute. The film also borrows from magical realism especially in the latter part as a Jewish family comes to the rescue of the children and revenge is taken against Edvard who refuses to let their mother go.The film is leisurely paced, the second half is more interesting plot wise, although you end up shouting at the screen at Emilie. Why does she want to marry so soon and accepts Edvard's conditions. She really did not care for her children's well being at all and puts them all at risk.In some ways this is Bergman's most accessible film, light and darkness but it is also too long, even self indulgent.",Fanny and Alexander
5,classicsoncall,"""Of course you know what a lie is and what the truth is, don't you?""",7,10 December 2017,"Staying with this film for the first hour and a half or so was an exercise in extreme patience - nothing happened. It was as if you were an observer at a family holiday dinner without participating in the meal. It was simply boring beyond reason, and if I weren't steadfast about watching a film in it's entirety in order to review it, I would have given up at the half way point.And then something interesting happened. Unlikely as it was that the widow Emilie (Ewa Froling) would have married that skunk, the Bishop (Jan Malmsjö), that's exactly what happened, setting up a nasty little adventure between the Bishop and the title characters. There was a point in the story I would have gladly handed Emilie or Alexander (Bertil Guve) a bottle of rat poison to take out that monster. Not to mention that maid Justina (Harriet Andersson) who couldn't help herself snitching on the young siblings. Couldn't you have just strangled her?So it wasn't entirely a waste of three hours, but quite honestly, the best thing about this picture for me were the lavish and ornate sets, and the cinematography that brought that richness out in detail to the audience. Reflecting on the title of the movie, I had to wonder why it wasn't simply called 'Alexander' since he turned out to be the principal player. Little Fanny was cute enough but without a whole lot to do and wasn't on screen very much. My best recommendation - start watching the film about half way into the story and you'll get most everything you need to know about in the young life of Fanny and Alexander.",Fanny and Alexander
6,gavin6942,Bergman Does Dickens (Sort Of),7,5 February 2015,"Two young Swedish children experience the many comedies and tragedies of their family, the Ekdahls.""Fanny and Alexander"" won four Academy Awards, which is unusual for a foreign film. One was for Sven Nykvist, the cinematographer. Although this could be debated as his finest work or not, he was alongside Bergman since early on and deserved recognition for his contributions to cinema. He won one other time, for ""Cries and Whispers"" in 1973.Roger Ebert included this among his ""Great Films"" and said Bergman ""creates a world in which the utmost certainty exists side by side with ghosts and magic, and a gallery of characters who are unforgettable in their peculiarities."" Other films Ebert thought were ""great"" included Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal"", ""Cries and Whispers"" and ""Persona"".",Fanny and Alexander
7,jboothmillard,Fanny and Alexander,8,26 March 2011,"From Oscar and Golden Globe director Ingmar Bergman (The Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, Persona, Cries and Whispers), this was apparently meant to be his final film, he made a few more, it was however his last to be listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Basically, set in the early 20th Century in a Swedish town, for a while the focus is on the exuberant and colourful Ekdahl family and household, with the parents Oscar (Allan Edwall) as director and Emilie (Ewa Fröling) as the leading lady for the local theatre company. Their life with the many relatives visiting over winter and stuff is very happy, and we do not see so much of the children, Fanny (Pernilla Allwin) and Alexander (Bertil Guve). It is after the tragic death of father Oscar from a stroke that the children become much more important to the story, their mother Emilie is now responsible for them. She soon finds a new suitor with Bishop Edvard Vergerus (Jan Malmsjö), also a widower, and they marry each other, but this also means they are under his strict and stern rule. Alexander is particularly his target who he tries break by any means, especially when he mentions seeing ghosts of people he believes the Bishop knows about, the harshest punishment being a whipping on his behind. Emilie hadn't anticipated her husband's dark side and becoming, along with the children, virtual prisoners, so in secret she gets in touch with the rest of her family, including mother-in-law Helena (Gunn Wållgren) to intervene and help them out their dire situation. After Emilie is refused a divorce from the Bishop, it is a Jewish antiques dealer and magician friend that pretends to be interested in buying a chest, and obviously Fanny and Alexander are getting inside it to be smuggled out, this plan succeeds. While the children are safe with the Jewish man, and Alexander has met his nephew Ismael Retzinsky (Stina Ekblad), Emilie is pregnant, and she puts sedative in Edvard's drink who is feeling overly sleepy, a fire breaks out, and he is killed in it. In the end, after seeing some more ghosts Aexander, sister Fanny, and their mother with her newly christened daughter are brought back together, it seems to end on a happy note, apart from Alexander seeing the ghost of the Bishop saying ""you'll never be free of me"". Also starring Börje Ahlstedt as Professor Carl Ekdahl, Christina Schollin as Lydia Ekdahl, Jarl Kulle as Gustav Adolf Ekdahl, Mona Malm as Alma Ekdahl, Pernilla August as Maj,Gunnar Björnstrand as Filip Landahl, Erland Josephson as Isak Jacobi, Anna Bergman as Hanna Schwartz and Lena Olin as Rosa. I may not have understood everything going on, but there were plenty of highlights that made me enjoy the film, obviously the whipping scene being to me the most poignant, the costumes, and use of colour is quite vibrant in many of the scenes, and the atmosphere is both pleasant and scary, it is a must see period drama. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Foreign Language Film, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTA for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated the Best Costume Design and Best Foreign Language Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film. It was number 28 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Very good!",Fanny and Alexander
8,Quinoa1984,"(review of the 5-hour cut) A total, un-abashed work of art that you'll love or hate. I loved it, and it's likely one of the great epics I'll ever see",10,21 November 2004,"As Ingmar Bergman's ""swan song"" (which wasn't necessarily the case once After the Rehearsal and the recent Saraband were released), Fanny and Alexander was a film I saw many months ago, in its truncated, 3-hour version. I knew I had witnessed something special, something life-affirming, and above all a work that contained enough poetry, passion, and humanity for two movies. But I also felt as if there was something missing here and there. So, once the complete TV version was released, as with Scenes from a Marriage, I jumped at the opportunity to view it in its entirety. Broken up here into 5 Acts, Bergman takes another semi-autobiographical approach to his storytelling, and it's a sumptuous tale of a turn of the 20th Century family (the Ekdahls, comprising of Oscar and Emilie, the parents, Fanny and Alexander, the kids- Alexander being mostly the driving force behind the story- and also the other relatives Carl and Gustov Adolf, brothers of Oscar, Helena, Alma, Lydia, and also the housemaid Maj) who own a theater company.What makes Fanny and Alexander work as a major achievement, if anything else for my money is that all the elements seem balanced out over the acts, with story and characters, each sharply defined. The first act unfolds with attention to the little details and the more prevalent ones in a family gathering. A key speech made by Oscar is a haunting bit of foreshadowing before they set off for the family dinner. This scene, involving more or less two dozen people, is sometimes very funny, sometimes a little unnerving, and towards the end depressing. But scenes such as these reveal how wonderful and exciting Bergman can be with his material and actors- despite it taking place in 1907, you can see these people in modern settings just as easily. There's also the scene involving Oscar with his children before they go to sleep, in which he tells them a story, which ranks as one of the more memorable, touching scenes of the film - from here, we can understand how this brings to Alexander (Bertil Guve, in a performance that is touching by being so straightforward with the innocence of child-hood) to the state he's in for much of the rest of the picture.Then the second and third acts come around, and the tragedy unfolds as penetrating as I've seen in any film, much less from Bergman. It wouldn't spoil it to say that Oscar succumbs to an illness, and passes away. From here, Emilie (Ewa Fröling, a performance meant for Liv Ullman, which she fits just as well) tries to go on as usual, and it just doesn't feel the same. She seeks counsel from the village bishop, Edvard Vergerus (Jan Malmsjo, previously in Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage), and subsequently falls in love with him, or at least thinks she does. They get married, and the children are forced into leaving (almost) everything behind to live at his dreary, caged residence, a far cry from where they once lived, a place lush with colors and life in the rooms. Both of these assets are provided by an Oscar winning production design team, and the foundations of how these two, including as well the theater, display how period-perfect some of this can be.The last two acts are when things get rough, which is a standard Bergman is known for. This kind of standard, if I could call it such, includes his personal connection to the Christian church, in particular with his father being a Lutheran priest. I'm not guessing on how fact based Bishop Vergerus is to Bergman's life, and I really don't want to either. One of the things I loved about the film (than some likely hated on it's original release- I know, for example, that my father was devastated after watching this film) is how the good and the bad, or what could be seen as good and bad, are paired off, and how the middle-ground is just as clear or un-clear. Emilie is a good person, wanting the best for her children and for herself, but she doesn't know how to do that without someone to bring guidance when she cannot after grieving for her dead husband (who appears sometimes to Alexander, which is another matter). Alexander, who is a child raised with all the enthusiasm to express himself as such by his uncles and particularly his theatrical father Oscar, is good but lending himself to not being too firm on what's real and what is not. The Bishop, on the other hand, is one who, as he says at one point ""has only one mask"". His is a puritanical approach, who sees imagination in only one strict aspect, and has terms of love that are by his code of living and understanding of people. Veregus, along with his family that live in fear and suffering (Harriet Andersson's character, and with the character of the heavy, ill aunt), know little is anything about how the Ekdahls have lived. What ends up happening, even from the get-go of the third act, in the fourth and fifth acts Bergman reveals Bishop Veregus to be an immense antagonist, one that allows just enough sympathy in one or two spots to not throw something at the TV, but with the kind of language that only the most terrifying of movie characters possess. Bottom line, this character, whether you like the film or not, is one of Bergman's greatest creations, and is pulled off by Malmjso with icy, disturbing perfection; it's one of the most memorable of the kind in film I can think of, right up there with Nurse Ratched, HAL 9000, and Darth Vader.But what torment and anguish the characters, as well as much of the audience, seem to endure in the fourth/fifth acts; there also comes revelatory moments of sheer beauty and enchantment. A couple of scenes involving Alexander in the puppet shop, for example, display a level of artistry that goes between Bunuel and Disney. And a particular, long soliloquy by Isak (Erland Josephsson, not under-used at all) to the children is a poem unto itself that gives me an idea that Bergman had he not gone into theater and film, would've been one of the great poets of the 20th century. As the catharsis comes, it comes with a kind of justice that works in the only way it satisfyingly could have. With the fates of the Bishop, Emilie, and Alexander and Fanny brought to a close, as with the Grandmother, the uncles and aunts, and so on, it's all very symbolic, metaphorical, and real, and it gels together.One last note- Sven Nykvist, who one his second Oscar with Bergman for this film, creates the kinds of shots that some could only have in their dreams. When he visualizes something for Bergman with the forces of light and dark, with the subtlety and nuance, it's all the better. To put this all in another way, I could go on and on about this huge, heart-rendering work, but it all comes down to this- as an emotional, intellectual, and spiritual (surprisingly for me, who sees religion as a kind of fantasy) sort of film-viewing experience, Fanny and Alexander is one of the most profound I've ever had. Some may feel the same; some may want to forget they ever experienced it. But one thing the film does is stick with you, if only for a little while, and that's really what a film can and should do....by the way, the 5-hour version, at least in America, is only available on a high-priced special edition DVD pack from Criterion, but for the viewer who's already a fan of the film, it makes for a great holiday gift. A++",Fanny and Alexander
9,wes-connors,Ingmar Bergman's Alexander (and the Bishop),10,6 January 2008,"This may be one of the most visually beautiful films ever produced; the supreme ""last"" achievement from writer/director Ingmar Bergman and his crew, led by photographer Sven Nykvist. In whatever version you choose, ""Fanny och Alexander"" is long; but, the film is worth the time commitment. It is a masterpiece.""Fanny och Alexander"" starts out being about nothing in particular; an almost cluttered assortment of characters celebrate Christmas 1907. While in evidence, ""Fanny"" (Pernilla Allwin) and ""Alexander"" (Bertil Guve) do not seem to be major characters. By the film's end, young Guve's ""Alexander"" has emerged as the film's leading player; but, each of the other characterizations are memorable. Characters who started out superfluous become funny, scary, poignant, and/or haunting. Yet, everyone seems to belong in the film.There is a main plot, which creeps up on you. There is no way to describe the story without giving too much away; so, let's just say: A Swedish widow (Ewa Fröling), with two children, marries a Bishop from Hell (Jan Malmsjö). While each performance is remarkable, in its own way, Gun Wållgren (as the Grandmother Ekdahl) must be mentioned alongside those above. The sequences with Gurv and the antique shop residents, crosscut with the Malmsjö's Bishop and his Castle entourage, are especially magical. ********** Fanny och Alexander (12/17/82) Ingmar Bergman ~ Bertil Guve, Ewa Fröling, Gunn Wållgren, Jan Malmsjö",Fanny and Alexander
10,grantss,Really don't know what all the fuss is about...,5,9 July 2015,"Really don't know what all the fuss is about...Written and directed by Ingmar Bergman, the story of two children, Fanny and Alexander (strangely enough), and what happens after their father dies.Underwhelming, a bit of an ordeal and vastly overrated. It's over three hours long, yet the story only really develops and has some degree of intrigue from about the two-hour mark. Until then, it just drifts and all feels like background, rather than plot development. Even once it does pick up the drama, this gets resolved in a rather random fashion and then goes somewhere weird and pretentious.Overall, pointless and mostly boring. Thank goodness for the fast forward button and sub-titles (or ""how to watch a 3-hour movie in 1 1/2 hours""...).",Fanny and Alexander
11,evanston_dad,Almost a Masterpiece,8,23 August 2005,"After having seen many Bergman films, I finally got my hands on this, considered by many to be the master's masterpiece. Not really about the children Fanny and Alexander (as the title would suggest) so much as about the entire Ekdahl family, this film is meticulously detailed and highly autobiographical. It looks absolutely fabulous; cinematographer and Bergman regular Sven Nykvist outdoes himself with his crystal clear compositions. Bergman's directorial style is at times a bit too static; he lets his camera sit motionless far too frequently, fine when focused on a face or tableau, but uninteresting when simply filming a group or room from long shot. But overall, he is in complete mastery of the material.I saw the full-length, five-hour television version, and the first half of this is flawless. Documenting the Ekdahl family Christmas, the death of Oscar (Fanny and Alexander's father) and their subsequent move to the home of their stepfather and religious tyrant, this part of the film is compulsively watchable. The characters (with the exception of little Fanny herself) are painted with detailed strokes by the acting and writing, and Bergman uses his production design to great effect, juxtaposing the sumptuous interiors of the Ekdahl's home with the ascetic house of the stepfather.The movie floundered a bit for me, though, in the second half. Here Bergman indulges his preoccupation with many of the themes that he's visited so often before; because of their familiarity, they came across this time as pretentious and tired. The existential longing, the fear of death, the blurring of personas: how many times can you explore these same themes and keep them interesting? Perhaps if I had not already seen so many Bergman films I would have fared better here. As it was, I found myself checking my watch frequently in the film's final hour or so.But the overall impression I took away from this film was that I had seen an important work by an important film maker. I still think ""Persona"" and ""Cries and Whispers"" are better movies, but ""Fanny and Alexander"" is a must see for any Bergman fan, and really for any fan of cinema, period.Grade: A-",Fanny and Alexander
12,zetes,Very strange,9,30 March 2002,"SPOILERSI'm not exactly sure I get Fanny and Alexander. On the surface, it looks most like yet another dig, the ultimate dig, at the Protestantism with which Bergman was tortured as a child (his father was a clergyman). But there're also some other things, or so it would seem. I really like all the scenes with the big, extended family and their servants, who are nearly equal to their employers. I don't know what Bergman's point is with this stuff, but it's excellent.Fanny and Alexander begins with this family's Christmas celebration. Soon afterwards, Alexander's father dies. A bishop consoles the mother and eventually proposes to her. When the family moves in with the bishop, they realize all to late that he is a cruel and evil man, a slavedriver whose punishments far exceed the crimes. This part of the film, which is probably the longest, is also the weakest. Edvard, the bishop, is so evil he's reminiscent of the emperor from Return of the Jedi, able to shoot bolts of lightning from his fingertips. I personally despise religion. It's the bane of the world, all religions. However, this wicked bishop seems far too easy. Other religious figures in Bergman films strike me as more interesting. For instance, Gunnar Bjornstrand's role in Winter Light.Finally the children and their mother escape from the bishop. The film's best scenes occur after the local moneylender (played by the excellent Bergman regular Erland Josephson) steals them away from Edvard. He brings them to his home, where he and his son Aaron make marionettes. All of these scenes are extremely frightening, especially when Alexander runs into the moneylender's other son, Ishmael, a hermaphroditic shut-in with supernatural powers.The final act brings the family back together (and kills off Edvard and the rest of his family), but there is an enormously uneasy feeling about the whole situation.Like I said, I don't exactly understand this film. It's in need of a restoration and a DVD release, neither of which I think it'll get anytime soon. MGM owns it, and their business is in dire straits right now. I hope that they'll let Criterion buy it. I'd love to hear a full commentary on the film. Its level of difficulty would benefit from one. Right now I'm giving it an 8/10.",Fanny and Alexander
13,ElMaruecan82,"Closing the Arc opened with ""The Seventh Seal""... God has the final word... with Bergman's consent...",10,30 November 2016,"""Fanny and Alexander"" starts with a lavish Christmas reunion of the same epic scale and narrative value as the wedding party in ""The Godfather"". It then proceeds to an untimely death that put all the family in shock. When mourning time is over, the widow resigns to find a stronger role model for her children, she marries a rigid bishop and then life flies over the darkest and toughest pages of the Family book, punctuated with strange supernatural encounters and deep metaphysical wanderings. Eventually, death shows up again, natural or not, and the movie concludes with another family reunion, celebrating two births, and through them, life with its share of joy, sadness, silences, cries, whispers and wild strawberries. It is a credit to Ingmar Bergman's visionary practicality to make a film about a bourgeois family, spanning a relatively short lapse of time, yet containing a plot whose existential implications could cover countless pages of philosophical essays. Life and death, their meanings or meaninglessness, have never been as fully approached without ever exuding ""intellectual"" vibes. It is indeed extraordinary that such a film would also manage to tell an entertaining and captivating family drama's story. And no less extraordinary that the film, deprived from more than one-hour and half, would still manage to maintain its relevance and style (almost) intact and be such a universally praised masterpiece. But who said Ingmar Bergman was an ordinary director? This is the work of a lifetime and if Bergman really decided to make it his testimony film, he couldn't have found a better way to conclude his body of work. There's more than a story about children in ""Fanny and Alexander"", the title is rather misleading on that level, the film, set at the dawn of the 20th century, circa Bergman's childhood, shows the very world that shaped the tormented mind of the soon-to-be cinematic genius, a world of contradictions where lust is forbidden but temptation everywhere. There is this eternal presence of God, from the joyful Christmas celebration to the grim discipline of an overzealous Bishop; but the ultimate paradox of Bergman's movie is that it's less God's nonexistence than his silence that calls for doubt and anger. God is Bergman's most defining antagonist.And in this lost battle, each one finds his way. Like ""The Godfather"", the central Family, the Ekdahls, is a fascinating mix of personalities: from a gentle matriarch who keeps on her respectable facade, to her sons, they all have a different approach to life. Gustav Adolf, a baker and hedonistic man, seizes the day and enjoys flirting and partying with maids, with the surprisingly progressive consent of his wife. Carl is the second son, a failed professor who's responsible for perhaps the most heart-wrenching loser's monologue I've ever seen in a film. He's disgusted by his failure and even the consolations' attempts of his well-meaning German wife are welcomed by hatred and disdain, this is a well-educated man who've lost his faith on life and goes through it, chained to the certitude of his own mediocrity.The third son is Oscar, he manages a theatrical troop with his beautiful wife Emilie (Ewa Fröling), also an actress along with their children, Fanny and Alexander. The man is worn down by the weight of stress and after Christmas, he's victim of a fatal stroke. Alexander can't stand the sight of his father dying, he hides under a table and utters curse words during the funeral; this is a child desperately hanging on his childhood with a rather adult tenacity. But his greatest challenge comes when the existentially lost Emilie, chooses the austere yet handsome Bishop (Jan Malmsjö) as a husband, finding in this man the serene connection to reality she felt lacking in her life. Then starts the soul-wrestling relationship between the Bishop and Alexander, confronted to the tyranny of God's rules, and their punishments. You could think Bergman, as a son of a rigid Lutherian, took his autobiographical revenge, but the Bishop is less a villain than a tragic man, lost in the illusion of his own authority being endorsed by God. Indeed, from the chess game in ""The Seventh Seal"" to the agony in ""Cries and Whispers"", God is never as present as during painful moments and ironically, life is never as exhilarated as when Death is coming. But there's a different tone in this film, actually more serene, there's a sort of consensus regarding the whole illusion of life, no one is fooled. Even the dead ones aren't of any help. Only the grandmother's Jewish lover (Erland Josephson) has a foot in each world and connects mysticism and reality, as if they finally could reconcile, as if illusion was either the lesser of two evils or a survival game. And this might be why the film, for all its complexity and dramatic undertones, solved its two crucial plot points with ""lousy"" Deus Ex Machina, what an ironic but so well-put nose thumbs to us, purist and cinematic rigorists. Maybe it is a way to show that God stopped to be an antagonist, and he would always have the final word, but finally, with Bergman's consent. And here's the genius closing the arc of his religious torments like ""Scenes from a Marriage"" did for the theme of infidelity. And on that level, the best advice I could give is: do yourself a favor and watch the full version just like for the ""Marriage"" masterpiece. Surely, one hundred extra minutes of Bergman's epitaph movie is an offer a fan wouldn't refuse. And as a fan, I'll conclude the review by saying that Begman is certainly the most original and compelling director, too unfairly associated with black and white intellectual movies while there was more than that, there was human condition with style à la Da Vinci and Shakespearean intensity, he's perhaps the greatest artist of Cinema, a cinematic God with God as a centerpiece.",Fanny and Alexander
14,dromasca,the last masterpiece,10,21 December 2018,"Released in 1982, 'Fanny and Alexander' was created in two formats, as some of the other later work of Ingmar Bergman - as a TV series and as a big screen feature film. I have seen this later version yesterday at our local cinematheque and I was simply overwhelmed. It is one of those creations that make us love film as an art and we go to the cinema for. A story on screen that is at the same time complex and told in very simple and clear ways, a world where reality and imagination, history and ghosts live together. A masterpiece.The time and the landscape are the ones we are familiar with from the plays of Ibsen and Strindberg - Scandinavia at the crossroads of the 19th and 20th century. A frozen land and a social landscape in which strict moral and social rules conflict with the liberal thinking and the progress which comes with its own risks, were passions and innocence are often crushed under the family and social pressure. The Eckdahls - a rich widowed mother and her three sons - are bourgeois and liberal. We never learn how the wealth is accumulated, but it is enough to allow for the Christmas 1907 party described in the formidable opening scene look somehow like the ball scene in the Luchino Visconti's The Leopard. The fate and the success of the three sons are mixed. One of them is in debt, the other is more interested by the young au pair of his kids than by his allowing wife, and the third owns a theater and is married to a beautiful actress. When the last suddenly dies (on stage, playing the ghost father in Hamlet) and his wife decides to re-marry the local bishop his two children (Alexander and Fanny) will risk to become victims of a Dickensian fate.A whole world is created and exposed under our eyes. Houses become labyrinths were we wander and get lost together with the characters and the film cameras. Images of nature outside pace the time and seasons. The family fights for economic and social survival and for the defense of a way of life that conflicts with the rigid and hypocritical morality imposed by the bishop. Characters never leave this world even after their death, the ghosts in Bergman's film materialize, watch, touch and threaten. Theater, the other passion of Bergman, occupies an important role in the life of the heroes. The best friend of the family and the character that plays a key role in the most important moment of the story is an old Jew, an antiquarian and a puppeteer. Quite interesting to see this character of a Jew, constructed to represent an exotic counterpoint of the established rules of the society, not without some social comments about prejudice about Jews in the Scandinavian world. At some point in the action God himself is mistaken for a puppet. By the end, somehow, life seems to come back to its previous patterns, and the two children who are the intermediates by which the story is told return to the comfort of their previous lives. Danger however waits in the future. The solution of the story gave birth to new ghosts.It's quite difficult to analyze the tools of the master. I can do it, of course, but no words can do good service to what we see on screen. This film must be seen and lived.",Fanny and Alexander
15,gbill-74877,Maybe there are no boundaries,8,2 May 2019,"Special because it's semi-autobiographical and Bergman's last theatrical movie, 'Fanny and Alexander' has the feeling of a magnum opus and goodbye, though the great director would continue to work on television projects for a couple of decades more. The attention to detail is gorgeous in the opulent scenes of the affluent family, though to be honest I would have been more interested in the story of one of the servants than these boorish wealthy people, each of whom is crude in their own way. The film makes comments about class in subtle and direct ways, and we're always aware of the emotional gulf that separates the rich and their help, even though some have been with them for 40+ years. It also makes comments about the patriarchy and men, as the male characters have a wide display of less than admirable characteristics - cruel, philandering, drunken, and lacking dignity or simple humanism. As one takes advantage of a young maid whose only protest is to naively ask him to not put her ""in the family way"", he comes after a single thrust and then seems to believe himself when he says ""lovely, wasn't it?"" Bergman is merciless in deflating the male ego.I liked the reflections on aging from the grandmother and matriarch (Gunn Wållgren) which were poignant, but my favorite part of the film was when young Fanny and Alexander must move into an austere household with their new stepfather. The environment is the polar opposite, and the emotional intensity is high when he proceeds to torture them mentally and physically, all in the name of a good, stern, proper upbringing. (And as an aside, how nice it was to see Harriet Andersson playing a maid in that household) The film also has a few moments of fantasy and the ghosts that inhabit Alexander's mind which are nice touches, and the scene he has with the locked away Ismael Retzinsky is fascinating. ""Perhaps we are the same person. Maybe there are no boundaries. Maybe we all flow into each other, boundlessly and magnificently,"" Ismael says.The overall message of the film, however, seems to be put in the hands of one of Alexander's uncles, who in a rambling soliloquy towards the end says ""Therefore, let us be happy while we are happy. Let us be kind, affectionate and good. It is necessary, and not in the least shameful to take pleasure in the joys of the little world."" There's wisdom there, but I found it a little less interesting than some of the elements that had come before it, and kind of wish Bergman had pared this film down even more than what he did to squeeze it into 188 minutes. Still a fine film though.",Fanny and Alexander

Performances were great, but its writing and directing by a legendary filmmaker elevated this movie.Overall, after seeing 3 h 8 min version i can safely say - ""Fanny och Alexander"" (1982) is a great movie.

17,Bored_Dragon,Mixed feelings,7,26 December 2017,"Bergman's swan song bedeviled me pretty much. Movie lasts more than three hours and at the very beginning it already bored me to death. Still, I was aware it's Bergman so I didn't wanna give up easily. But hour came and passed and the film was close to half when I finally became agitated and pushed stop button. Settings, costumes, acting, camera work and directing are fantastic. Trouble is that it's beautifully filmed Nothing. For the duration of an average movie, we are looking at a somewhat unusual family that, at the beginning of the twentieth century, lives a boring day-to-day life. No plot, no story, drama, humor, nothing at all.One of the most boring movies I have ever seen. I went to eat something and make a coffee and after a while I got back to my computer to watch the show I started yesterday. But my precious OCD wouldn't let me concentrate. I never leave movies I once started and I simply couldn't do it now. So I got back to Bergman.Literally minutes later things began to happen and form one pretty decent story. Ok, it was still slow and nothing special, but satisfying enough to hold my attention till the end. First half of the movie had no story at all and all the magnificence of other aspects of the film is in vain when they do not have any purpose. Even if everything else is for ten, if story is terrible you get lousy movie. Story in second half of the movie is really nothing special, but it's good enough not to destroy beauty of the rest of the movie. If story was at level with everything else this would be 10/10. If there was no first hour of the movie it would be 8,5/10. But I simply can not forgive the agony first hour put me through. I'm not rating only camera or only directing, only it's soul or just the last hour. I'm rating overall impression of movie as a whole. And for that reason I rate it 7/10. But at the same time I want to recommend it as feat for the eyes of those who cherish aesthetics enough to ignore lack of plot.7/10Movie was nominated for 6 Oscars and it won 4. All 4 well deserved. In my opinion, Bergman also deserved his nomination for directing to win too. But nomination for the best screenplay sounds to me like bad joke.Actress who plays grandmother, and who is maybe even leading character of this movie, irresistibly reminds me of Cameron Diaz. I wonder is this just me or there's more people who see this resemblance.",Fanny and Alexander
18,kenjha,Bergman's Curtain Call,7,7 August 2011,"This drama about a large, wealth family is an apt curtain call for Bergman. As is often the case with his films, he is not so much interested in telling a good story as in exploring themes. He touches on all the themes that have dotted his films since the 1950s: love, death, religion, marriage (and infidelity), family, etc. For good measure, he also throws in ghosts, magic, and flatulence into this one. It is little more than a soap opera, and it's in serious need of editing. The director can be forgiven for wanting to make an epic swansong even when he didn't have the material to support such an undertaking. In her final film, Wallgren is terrific as the matriarch.",Fanny and Alexander
19,Thanos_Alfie,Definition of drama...,7,18 March 2015,"""Fanny and Alexander"" is a drama movie in which we watch a family gathering for Christmas and everything seems to be great but everything is going to change. That change happens when the father of the two adolescent siblings die and they have to stay with her mother and their step father who is a very strict bishop. In their new life the two children think the previous life with their real father and how great it was and many other things.I liked this movie because is a classic drama movie and as I said in the title I believe that is the definition of the true drama. I also liked the direction of this movie which made by Ingmar Bergman. About the interpretations I have to admit that I liked very much the interpretation of Pernilla Allwin who played as Fanny Ekdahl - Ekdahlska huset and also the interpretation of Bertil Guve who played as Alexander Ekdahl - Ekdahlska huset.Finally I have to say that ""Fanny and Alexander"" is a drama movie which in the start it makes you think that there is not something good or even hope but after some time all change.",Fanny and Alexander

21,Vartiainen,"Fine period drama, with some unique touches from the director",7,10 October 2017,"Ingmar Bergman's farewell to cinema, being his last feature film. Or rather it got torn down into one as it was originally an over 5 hour TV mini series. The film depicts the lives of its title characters, Fanny and Alexander, and their extended family, the Ekdahls, a wealthy aristocratic family living in the early 20th century Uppsala, Sweden.I've personally only seen the mini series, so I'm a bit unclear as to what was taken out for the 3 hour feature version, but let's talk about the story as a whole. The film is a pretty straightforward period drama, which is a bit surprising, given that Bergman has a reputation for the artistic side of film making. And yes, there are hints of that in this film, but not all that many. It's mainly at the very beginning, and then during the fifth act. I'd even go so far as to say that the second and third acts are downright clichéd and dull. That's how formulaic they are.That being said, the acting is really good, the sets and costumes are gorgeous, there are some truly touching scenes even in the dullest acts, and the characters, the Ekdahls especially, are remarkably likable. The first act might be some of the finest character and world building I've seen in years. There's a metric ton of characters to introduce, all with their quirks and motivations, yet the film pulls it off flawlessly. Well, at least the mini series.Does the rest of the film meet the expectations laid out by this marvelous first act? Yes and no. As I've said, the second and third act are kind of clichéd, and the final act gets really bizarre, but I'll give it this: It's memorable. I'll remember this film. I enjoyed watching it, and while it might not be the finest drama I've ever seen, at least I got something out of it. Which is not as common as you'd think.",Fanny and Alexander
22,BeneCumb,"A decent portrait of an era, but too slow and too long",6,3 September 2012,"The film, of course, is well directed, actors are pleasant (although the children Fanny and Alexander are not much seen during the first half), and background/costumes provide additional value, enabling this sequence of different scenes to be combined and better understood. At times it seems like 17th-18th century opera (only without music) where decorations and luxurious clothes form an integral part of performance. Fortunately, the film is not black-and-white.However, I am not so much into the-rich-cry-too films, and Fanny och Alexander is definitely one of them. It is always so that there are intrigues, hate and idleness around wealth and money, but less wealthier will never understand this -- for them, making their daily living is the most important and all-comprehending issue.As for the historic dramas, I prefer e.g. British or French similar ones (Howards End, for example). And noble life in Uppsala seems (and surely was) more dull and less majestic than in Western Europe.",Fanny and Alexander
23,runamokprods,"Maybe Bergman's greatest film, and that's saying a lot!",10,26 May 2012,"As many already know, this exists in two forms; the original, longer TV mini-series, and a version trimmed down for theatrical release.But this is a masterpiece however you cut it. Somehow, in one film, Bergman has managed to combine tragedy, broad and subtle humor, melodrama, philosophy, mystery, magical realism, kitchen sink reality, controlled performances and big bombastic performances, etc. and weave it all into an organic whole with a wonderfully (and shockingly for Bergman) positive message about the joy of life, the importance of savoring family, friends, passions, and the moment itself while we can. Populated by an unforgettable gallery of characters based on Bergman's own familial history, this is an intimate epic that takes us inside the lives of an upper-class, artistic Swedish family soon after the start of the 20th century and the misfortunes and triumphs that befall them. Not quite like any other film I've ever seen – either by Bergman or anyone else. This is a child's eye view of the world, mixed with the wisdom of an aging man looking back, with a kind eye, on life itself.A personal note: It's strange to say, but I found the feature version slightly stronger than the 4 part TV version it was cut from. For me, there is something a little more focused and impactful about it. Perhaps that's just because I saw it first, but much like Altman's 'Vincent & Theo' (which also was first shown as a European mini-series) I found the extra material took my attention a few too many places, and sometimes answered mysteries I liked as mysteries.Your best bet is to get the beautiful Criterion blu-ray set, and watch both versions for yourself.",Fanny and Alexander

Time and space do not exist...""",10,8 June 2005,"""Fanny and Alexander"" (1982) was announced at the time of its release as Ingmar Bergman's swan song, his last film for the big screen. It is his most optimistic and enchanting blend of romance, tragedy, comedy, fantasy, and mysticism. Set in Sweden in the beginning of the 20th century, the film follows the lives and adventures of two children, brother and sister Fanny and Alexander Edkahl.I love Bergman in every mood and in every genre - I love him dark, bleak, harrowing (""Shame""), mysterious (""Persona""), merciless and devastating (""Scenes from a Marriage, ""Face to Face"", ""Autumn Sonata). I love his lighter, smiling side (""Wild Strawberries"", ""Smiles of a Summer Night). Even for a master of Bergman's powerful talent, ""Fanny and Alexander"" is extraordinary - a profound film which is also one of his most accessible works.Pablo Picasso said once, ""When I was 9 years old, I could paint like Rafael; as an adult, all my life I tried to learn how to paint like a child"". In his final film, one of the greatest masters of dark and sometimes morose psychological studies looks at the world with a child's eye. The words he chose to finish his film with reflect the hope, the happiness and the magic that can be fully felt only in one's childhood: ""...Anything can happen, anything is possible.

28,Cosmoeticadotcom,Very good,9,11 September 2008,"Why Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman's 1982 final 'filmic film', Fanny & Alexander (Fanny Och Alexander), bears the appellation it does is a mystery- one of many in the film, since the first titular character, Fanny (Pernilla Allwin) is a third or fourth level supporting character at best, and in the three hour theatrical version of the film she is not even mentioned by name for nearly an hour into the film. The film really should be called Alexander & Fanny, or simply Alexander, since it most closely follows two years in the life of young, handsome, brown-haired Alexander Ekdahl (Bertil Guve)- the original 'boy who sees dead people,' from 1907 to 1909. Better yet, it should really be called The Ekdahls, for it is that whole family that is central to the film, especially Fanny and Alexander's beautiful blond mother Emilie (Ewa Fröling- a more intellectual, sensuous, and earth motherish version of Denise Richards, who bears a remarkable facial resemblance to Guve; especially in the cheekbones and puffy lips). Her deep, gorgeous blue eyes hold a viewer's attention, as do the eyes of Liv Ullman, who was originally offered the part, but turned it down. Yes, there are many things that do not make sense in this film- both in the internal narrative and the external aspects of the tale, but this is not necessarily a bad thing.The theatrical version did win four Academy Awards; for Best Foreign Film, Costume Design (Marik Vos), Art Direction-Set Decoration (Anna Asp), and for the cinematography of Sven Nykvist. This triumph is best illustrated in the scenes of the death of Oscar Ekdahl (Allan Edwall), where beautiful and ornate clocks and shiny accoutrements are contrasted with a bucket of vomit. But it is the 312 minute television series is unquestionably a great film, although it does not have the unadorned greatness of earlier Bergman classics, like Wild Strawberries, Winter Light, nor, most cogently, Scenes From A Marriage- Bergman's earlier TV miniseries that was also released theatrically in a truncated form, but which is a better film, especially in the comparative shorter versions. The shorter version of this film feels chopped up, has too many plot holes, due to some questionable editing by Bergman, especially when compared to the longer television version of the film. Why, as example, does Bergman retain any of the stand alone scenes of Carl Ekdahl and his marital woes in the shorter version, since they go nowhere and contribute nothing to the denouement, and where the best scene that character has is of farting out a burning candlestick to entertain the children? here is an example where leaving a bit of a plot does no good and it should have been wholly excised. By contrast, there are a number of scenes from the longer version that should never have been removed- such as Alexander's run-in with the ghosts of the daughters of the evil Bishop Edvard Vergerus (Jan Malmsjö- who was Peter, the feckless friend to Erland Josephson's Johan, in Scenes From A Marriage)- who torment and puke on him, or the dramatic showdown between Carl and Gustav Adolf and the Bishop, after they have engineered the rescue of the children from the Bishop's home, and revealed the Bishop as a philanderer who owes 110,000 kronor in debts.Yet, Fanny & Alexander deserves its place in the Bergman and filmic canons, even if it does occasionally suffer from some of what can be labeled 'old artist's syndrome'- i.e.- the tendency to over-sentimentalize the past. Bergman was 64 by the film's release. Fanny & Alexander, while a great film- especially in its longer version, is not all that its greatest boosters claim.Oddly, it is the shorter theatrical version of the film- with its many narrative gaps and unresolved issues, which feels a bit too long, not the significantly longer television version. Yet, despite the above named divergent themes, and the presence of 'the other' in the film, the inexplicable works, and works superbly- especially in the deeper, longer, and richer television version, where we get glimpses of the Bishop and his evil clan far earlier in the film, as well as more depth on important characters like Carl Ekdahl and Isak Jacobi. Perhaps it is because most of the film is told from a child's eye point of view, which always warps reality to its own psychological needs, or maybe the whole film is just a child's dream, for early on Alexander Ekdahl falls asleep. Does he ever really wake up?Whatever interpretation one wants to apply to this film, it is essential to the canon of Ingmar Bergman, and captures an essential bit of humanity past, just as superb films like Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story or Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver do. It will be relevant for as long as humanity exists, just as those other great works are, for despite its setting, we all know people like the Ekdahls and Vergeruses. That it lets us know a bit more about ourselves is merely icing on a damned tasty cake, one that remains tempting even as eaten, and gets better with each viewing. Having seen it thrice, both versions and the theatrical version with comments, this claim is no mystery. Swallow now.",Fanny and Alexander
29,gizmomogwai,Fanny and Alexander the great,8,11 August 2012,"Well, maybe not quite great, but certainly a worthy effort for Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, who directed some great classic films in the '50s and '60s. Fanny and Alexander debuted in 1982 as a three-hour movie that eventually scored an Oscar for foreign film. It follows a young boy named Alexander and his sister and mother coping with the father's death. Eventually the mother marries a bishop, but he is a stern authority figure for Alexander, who soon comes to hate him for that.Why is it three hours? That's long (considerably longer than The Seventh Seal or Persona), and the first hour is kind of a waste. There's much about the Christmas celebrations of the family before the father's death. I guess it's to set up the family as well off and happy to contrast with the rest of the movie, but nothing much happens in the beginning and the farting uncle was a vulgar low point. However, the story picks up after the father dies and it becomes a rather engaging film.Fanny and Alexander can be compared to Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (1975)- a mother remarries, the son doesn't like his stepfather, the stepfather physically disciplines the boy. This one differs in that there's a minor supernatural element- Bergman's film is more metaphorical. The stepfather isn't necessarily evil (discipline is important), and Alexander told a rather hurtful story about him, saying ghosts told him that the stepfather locked up his prior family and was thus responsible when they died while trying to escape. Alexander had lied before, but given the other supernatural elements of the film, it's possible the story is true. Either way, the stepfather goes a little far in the punishment. There's a sense of injustice when the mother wants a divorce but learns it would mean losing custody of her children. The news of the stepfather's death may consequently be taken with ambivalence. The film itself is harder to be ambivalent about- the bulk of it is wonderful, colourful and engrossing, and should leave the viewer feeling satisfied.",Fanny and Alexander
30,KnightsofNi11,Mystifying,8,18 July 2011,"Here's a film that you will truly have no idea what you're getting into before you see it, especially if you're like me and haven't seen an Ingmar Bergman film yet. Fanny and Alexander is life through the eyes of a child. It's a highly autobiographical film that tells the story of young Alexander Ekdahl and his sister Fanny as they live their luxurious life with their mother and father. But unforeseen events strike down in their lives, making drastic changes that change the two children forever. This is an incredibly peculiar film that has an eccentrically offbeat feel to it. It is of a calibre that doesn't seem to fit a story about two children, but it does. This is a wondrous and magnificent tale that keeps you engaged and intrigued for its entire three hour run time.This film shows uncanny amounts of storytelling finesse. It tells its story so clearly and so eloquently that you forget it is just a film about children. You get the feeling that it is so much more, and indeed it is. It is a story about life, love, eternity, magic, mystery, the supernatural. The list goes on. It seems like a lot and that's because it is. This film covers a lot of ground both physical and psychological, even existential. There is so much to take in with this film that I'm not sure it is possible to understand it all after the first watch. It is easy enough to follow the surface storyline, which is excellent and greatly engaging. Underneath is a different story, however. What lies underneath twists and turns and makes you think more than most films do. It's almost overwhelming at times how much subtext is being quietly presented, especially when you don't even notice it until it's too late to decipher it all.I left this film with a lot of unanswered questions, but I certainly felt accomplished after finishing it. There's a certain nuance that causes you to feel something during this film, even if you can't quite place what that something is. For me I felt intellectual and existential as I absorbed everything that takes place in this film. I felt challenged by the depth and complexity of the film's subtextual level and so I greatly enjoyed interpreting the film for myself. But the great thing is that if you don't want to interpret or absorb this film you can still enjoy the fantastic storyline that lies on the surface. The story is told so skillfully and with such eloquence. Subplots weave in and out beautifully and the characters develop into such fascinating human beings as the film moves along. This film feels so real and you can feel all of the personal nuance Bergman inserted into the film, as it is very autobiographical.I'm not sure if the storyline itself is the autobiographical part. I'm sure parts of it reflect his life, but what I really think is the ultimate reflection is the look and feel of the film which Bergman illustrates so well. Fanny and Alexander is a somber film that ambles along quietly. It is subtle and immaculate. Bergman's quiet camera movements give the film its consistently calm yet distressed undertone. The film isn't loud or bustling, but there is a lot of turmoil underneath the quiet that is louder than any Michael Bay film. There is something so beautiful and so elegant about this film that you feel so engrossed in all of it, as well as touched by its somber beauty. This is true artistry at work. Bergman works his magic here to make a film that is so stunning and yet so subdued. It is a contrast that often comes off as too pretentious or too forced, but not in Fanny and Alexander. Here it is done just right.I'm not entirely sure what I've made of this film so far. It is so much to take in and so much to breath out. This is a beautiful film, no doubt, but it is just so difficult to get everything out of it that you know you can and this makes it difficult to truly fall in love with the film. I won't forget this film and I'm sure I'll revisit it one day to further my interpretation of the film. But what I can say for now is that it is a true work of art that deserves all recognition it gets. Few films can achieve the quiet illustriousness that Fanny and Alexander does, and that is something to be amazed by.",Fanny and Alexander

The film is two years in the life of an affluent Swedish family around 1910, from the viewpoint of a small boy.Fanny And Alexander is by some distance director Ingmar Bergman's most accessible film. It manages to be simultaneously epic and intimate: it marks the transition of a faintly bohemian family, with a theatre director and his actress wife at its head, to a different setting and mood, in which the deceased patriarch is replaced by a devout pastor. The film is affecting and enthralling, and largely based on the lives of the director and his own parents.",Fanny and Alexander

It is not a two hour Hollywood blockbuster.Once you get over that first thirty minutes of slow pace it is actually a good story.It basically is set in turn of the century Sweden and follows the family life of a young brother and sister over a year or so.Apparently part autobiographical from Bergman it shows what millions of kids have to tolerate each year, a remarriage and all the repercussions of that.The film does have some fantasy elements. I'm thinking of ghostly appearances of a dead dad etc. but despite the length it keeps the viewer on side.From a technical perspective the film seems high spec for a foreign language, non-Hollywood production.

33,barryrd,Bergman film finale ambitious but disappointing,7,30 December 2020,"I saw this movie once before and was tremendously impressed. I wanted to see it again. The movie still had a great impact on me but left me disappointed. Maybe the whole movie was too long to take in this cinematic summing up by Director Ingmar Bergman. The great Christmas feast was opulent of course with the dazzling sets and costumes of the extended family household where Fanny and Alexander spent their early childhood. The benevolent grandmother of the theatrical family who presided over this extravaganza was a reassuring presence. She possessed compassion and wisdom. The transition to the stark parsonage of the clergyman who became the stepfather was jarring. The narrow minded and suffocating atmosphere was a shock for the children and their mother. They hardly expected to be transported to such a dark place. The punishment the clergyman administered to Alexander was very powerful. It was clear that the boy had to come to terms with the presence of evil in the person of this man who represented a harsh and repressive form of Christianity. This film did not deliver in the way that Bergman's other movies did-using shorter stories, well defined characters, and crisp dialogue. Ultimately it is too overblown and lacking in focus. I think this film needed to be stripped down to a maximum two hour story which could have delivered a far more coherent message.",Fanny and Alexander

But Fanny och Alexander is a splendid production, beautifully made, so superb it even evokes feelings of having come from a novel. Excellent characterization throughout, all the way down the cast, lending that magic touch to the costuming of the early 1900s. Mesmerising throughout, the film is not a single minute too long. The development of the story-line is superbly handled in an absorbing and coherent manner, manifesting the great empathy between director and actors. If the cinematography is visual poetry, the script is philosophical and full of awareness or consciousness of things in life, but not at a pretentious, abstract and theoretical level, but at a real human dimension.If you only have 10 videos in your collection, Fanny och Alexander should be one of them.

Instead, I'm almost overflowing with thoughts about it. First, to address my two tiny nitpicks from the previous review. The fart scene... I don't really mind it anymore. I even kind of look forward to it. It gives Carl a mischievous sense of humor, something to take a little bit of the edge off his darker side. I also suggested that Ewa Fröling (Emilie, the mother) isn't quite as good as the rest of the cast. I will revise that: she isn't quite as distinctive as the rest of the cast. With so many grand personalities running around, it's hard for Emilie to leave a strong impression. But this time I realized how good Fröling is, nailing many of the subtle shifts the role demands.Speaking of grand personalities, among an amazingly strong cast, Gunn Wållgren (Helena, the matriarch) towers above them all. It was her final screen performance, and what a fantastic swan song. I want this woman to be my grandmother. She exudes endless warmth and compassion and patience. I must seek out more of her work, having only seen her in this and one of her earliest films, ORDET (and I can't recall her role in that at all).This is a film that celebrates the creature comforts of life, finding pleasure in ""the little world."" For as much as Bergman gets saddled with labels like ""austere"", here we see him practically spitting in the face of austerity. The Ekdahl home is joyously lavish, stuffed with artwork and food and precious items. And of course there's also the packed-to-the-rafters shop owned by Jacobi, filled with exotic and supernatural mysteries. Where Fanny and Alexander suffer is in the stifling environment of the barren Vergerus household, forbidden from bringing any of their belongings (the bishop reluctantly allows Alexander to hold on to his battered teddy bear). It's a wholehearted endorsement of material, physical decadence. ""Let us be happy while we are happy."" Bergman is careful not to completely idealize the world of the Ekdahls, however. We see Carl's unbearable cruelty to his wife, Gustav's endless philandering which is amusingly tolerated by his spouse (two more wonderful casting choices in Jarl Kulle and Mona Malm) and even hints that Oscar is sexually distant towards Emilie. As much as they revel in the joys of life, they haven't quite got the male-female relationships right... after all, it's still Bergman we're dealing with.The director is exceptionally generous with his faith in the audience. In some of the finest examples of magic realism, we are shown impossibilities without explanation, and are trusted to make of them what we will. It is a story that is much concerned with the power of imagination, and of course Bergman's love of the theater and its ability to fire the imagination. As Oscar spins an improvised fairy tale about a common chair to the children, for a moment we believe every word he's saying. With that same magical power of storytelling, Bergman makes us believe in ghosts and mummies and evil forces.It's such a phenomenally beautiful piece of work (thanks especially to Nykvist and the set design) that always offers me something new, and keeps me enthralled throughout the entirety of its 5+ hour running time (okay, the ""Hamlet"" rehearsal drags a bit, but it has such thematic resonance). I think I feel a stronger personal connection to SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE, but Fanny is an astonishing film on every level. It may or may not be my ""favorite"" Bergman, but I think it's his most stunning achievement.",Fanny and Alexander
36,chaswe-28402,Much ado about a little world,6,8 January 2017,"Scenes from the Ekdahl Saga. The last time I tried this epic I must have abandoned it after the prologue, because all I remember was the off- putting flatulence, which had stayed with me ever since. This time I made it through the full five hours, spread over two evenings, and I'm sad to say the result is an unsatisfied sense of emptiness.This is a very peculiar, confessional sort of performance, and I wish I could compare it with the three hour version. I should like to know what was cut out. It gives an impression of having been put together in a haphazard, arbitrary manner, as if the auteur couldn't decide what he wanted to say. A collection of family photographs dis-arranged in half a dozen old albums.The unfolding events are loaned some significance by the marked Shakespearian backbone. In what is evidently a semi-autobiographical account, Bergman/Alexander is given two, if not three, fathers: his actor-manager Hamlet-type ghost father, and his odious Claudius-type ersatz father, presumably modelled on his real, Puritanical father. This person's malignant ghost was also still around after his convenient demise by fire, plot-wise, apparently arranged by witchcraft. An Oedipal twist. The faded pageant of the Ekdahl theatrical family is definitely insubstantial, occasionally full of sound and fury, but basically of negligible meaning in the wider world. Could that be the film's message ? Its nearest Bergman relative is The Face (aka the Magician), a mysteriously underrated effort which was rejected for its Oscar nomination, but is one of the Swede's best, at least as good as The Seventh Seal. There is a lot of talk about masks in Fanny and Alexander, reminiscent of William's opinion that all the world is a stage. But Greek to many of us. After Shakespeare come Ibsen and Strindberg. Another kettle of fish.Two episodes puzzled me more than the rest, and I wonder if they were cut out of the three-hour version, or at least cut down. One is that in the Epilogue we are shown two babies, looking as if they were identical twins, side by side in closely juxtaposed cots, and identical baby trappings. Looked at from the other side, however, the cots are shown as distinctly separated, and Jarl Kulle, in his barmy emotional speech, only addresses his by-blow with his lame maid, whom for some reason he wants to set up in a coffee-shop, whereas she wants to run a milliner's of sorts. The other baby, nameless, must be Emilie's, by the bishop. Query ? It's a complete riddle to me why we are told any of this.The second peculiar event is the hysterical anti-semitic spasm, and most of the fifth act, which affects the repellent bishop, who parades as Fanny and Alexander's uncle/father, and then gets his just deserts. We learn that time and space do not exist, the universe is expanding, and there is obviously no method in the madness of the gloomy Scandinavian, in spite of the usurper's death.I can't say it was tedious, since I watched it all the way through, wondering what was going to happen next, but just felt disappointed at the end. The answer was that there was no answer to any of the mysteries. Why did Alexander have such unusually large ears ? How does a bishop accumulate debts great enough to bring him to bankruptcy ? Why was Ismael a woman ?",Fanny and Alexander

It's headed by grandmother Helena, her three sons and their wives, and the two children of her son, Oscar, and daughter-in-law, Emelie--Alexander about age 10 and his younger sister, Fanny.The film includes all of Bergman's devices, including death, clocks, beautiful cinematography, close-ups (though not as many as usual), and reflections on the meaning of life (though not obsessively).In one sense I would call ""Fanny and Alexander"" Ingmar Bergman's final revenge on his difficult, straight-laced Lutheran pastor father. The Lutheran bishop in ""Fanny and Alexander"" does not present well, and ends badly. Religious folks don't do well in Bergman movies, and this was no exception. As in many Bergman films, the setting includes people of wealth with a casual approach to marital fidelity. Fantasy and/or dreams play a significant role as is the case in many Bergman films.One of Bergman's early actresses has a significant bit part in the movie--Harriet Andersson plays the maid who tattles on Alexander to the Bishop about Alexander's story about the death of the bishop's first wife.There is a prominent Jewish character in the film, which is unusual. There is a much larger cast of characters than in most Bergman films. The theater version was a bit over three hours long; it was also released as a five hour and twenty minute mini-series for which I don't have the stamina.Generally I would say Bergman raised no new issues in ""Fanny and Alexander"" and was more ""Hollywood"" in his approach.

A tribute to the actors and the restoration of the theater's magic. It captures life, death and everything in between. Hatred, love, joy and sorrow are mixed with every little everyday problem. And it speak so much about being human.Sven Nykvist's classy photo is, as usual, extremely beautiful and so, the spectacular scenography. Seeing the Swedish actor elite act in front of the camera is magic and Bergman's script and dialogue contribute to the magical atmosphere. This is one of the best Swedish films that has been made, but despite its magnificence, it should not be denied that every ones in a while It becomes quite sprawling and a little incoherent. And the tempo is hardly staggering. When Lydia sings for her husband and the other adults in the fine lounge, we hear the whole song. At that speed level, it is, and continues to be. But fortunately it doesn't matter, because everything is so magnificent.Gustav Adolf's emotionless speech may sum up, perhaps not the whole film, but an approach to the family we have come to know. The end is marked by hope, but a final sight lets us know that for Alexander, nothing ever disappears for good. But he can probably live with that.",Fanny and Alexander

However, I actually found Bergman was more fitting of ""the boring overrated filmmaker"" label than Welles.However, I found this film to be considerably better and more interesting than the other Bergman films I have watched. Some say its more ""accessible"", that is, people without the highly acquired taste for Bergman can appreciate this work. I would agree, I found this to be quite entertaining.

44,akash_sebastian,An Ornately Shot Period Piece that Beautifully Studies Both Childhood and Adulthood.,8,17 October 2014,"Ingmar Bergman's 'Fanny och Alexander', originally intended as the director's ""swan song"", is a five-hour five-act epic which explores the lives of the different members of the Ekdahl family. The First Act beautifully explores the family's get-together at Christmas, and sheds some light on the individual families of the three brothers as well. Then the remaining acts go on to follow the ups and downs of the two siblings, Fanny and Alexander, and their mother Emilie, and how everyone in the Ekdahl family tries to cope with it.Each of the characters in the movie is so uniquely fascinating, and really have something to offer to the combined family as well as the movie. The rich colours and cinematography, the in-depth exploration of the characters' lives, the movie is filled with heartwarming and hilarious moments; there isn't a single dull moment in it.All the actors involved with the movie have done a brilliant job, especially the beautiful and charming Ewa Fröling delights us with her talented performance of Emilie Ekdahl. I wonder why I haven't seen her in many movies; she really has the ability to captivate you with her eyes and emotions. Helena's conversation with his son's soul and Isak Jacobi's monologue with the children were really entrancing.'Fanny och Alexander' is an ornately shot period piece that beautifully studies both childhood and adulthood (not of the same character). As critic Aaron Hillis from 'Village Voice' says so aptly, 'nothing else in his (Bergman) oeuvre addresses so directly his childhood escapes into fantasy as the by-product of a harsh Lutheran upbringing.' It explores many themes like loss, prison-like childhood, polygamy, etc., but the story is essentially about the importance of family. Overall, the movie is quite life-affirming and memorable. Please watch the five-hour long cut to get the director's intended vision and proper impact of the epic.",Fanny and Alexander

There wasn't a poor or mediocre performance in the entire work. My favorite was the performance by Gunn Wållgren (The grandmother). Like Catherine Zita Jones in Chicago, this woman steals the scene from all who share it with her. Not only is her acting flawless, but the character that she plays is easily the most compelling...although I cannot figure out why...My twelve year old (I fast-forwarded through the two naughty scenes) thought that the most brilliant sequence was the grandmother wailing in the room where her son lay in his coffin. The door was a little ajar and she simply paces and shrieks like an animal while her grandchildren watch through a crack in the door. I agree with him...Look for the movie to take off after the first extended scene of the grandmother with the holy man...",Fanny and Alexander

I had a opportunity one day of rent any movie. I always take a long time to pick anyone. So, who is whit me gets angry. Days before i had read an article of Ingmar Bergman's ""Fanny och Alexander"". That night, in a fast selection after like an hour of think what i want to see, i pick ""Fanny och Alexander"". In that moment i didn't know that i made an excellent decision.""Fanny och Alexander"" or its Spanish title ""Fanny y Alexander"" or its English title ""Fanny and Alexander"" told the story about a big Swedish family. There is Fanny and Alexander. Is Christmas and all of the Ekdahl family go to the grandma house to celebrate that beautiful evening. But all have a story to told. Suddenly, Oscar, the father of Fanny and Alexander, die. His wife now is alone, but, in loved of a Bishop, she with her children's go to live to his house. But now how they stepfather, he makes an incredible religious oppression. For other side, not much time after Oscar's death, he appears to his children's... then, Alexander is questioned about lying. And then we are questioned about if we are lying, or if grown ups are lying. And then, the real reality is our real imagination.Is hard to say few things of an extensive work like ""Fanny och Alexander"" because its unique in its kind. This work is a haunting masterpiece of a filmmaker who i don't know much. I only have see ""Smulstrontället"" (Another beautiful masterpiece). But i think that with this two works, i can take now an image of Ingmar Bergman, as a creative and sensitive filmmaker. With certain mysterious qualities, ""Fanny och Alexander"" told us a story of questions based in children's and grown ups mentalities, its problems and its pleasures. Minute by minute, the movie, with a ghostly touch, it makes us more sensitive, and, at the same time, we cant despite some moments of complete nostalgia. The film confronts different subjects like family, death, childhood, religion and reality. Its a metaphysical work which explores reality based in that things that we think real and in that things that we think that are just imagination, specially from a kid like Alexander. And the we questioned about the real reality, which doesn't exist. Each one had its reality. I think that the only reality in this moment is Alexander's reality. He cries when he thinks that God go to show to him a face. He wants to live a normal life, a life that the bishop don't wants, just maybe his childhood was horrible and he thinks that if he want that Alexander be a good man, he cant live with any toys, locked with his sister in a room. Then we see its reality confronted with supposed real reality of grown ups. Then, we found Alexander wishes, which are the imagination confronted with the ""real"" reality. He hates the bishop. The bishop don't hate Alexander, its afraid of him. At the end we found to grandma with Alexander in his arms. ""All go on, the time and space don't exist. In the thin mark of the reality the imagination creates new patterns"" As much of you know, ""Fanny och Alexander"" runs with a duration of more of 3 hours, but there is a special version for TV, which runs with more of 5 hours. When i was seeing the theatrical version, i think in a few seconds how can be the TV version. But... well, sometimes i think that its not so important, maybe the theatrical version is more feeling packed, and TV version is more slow and complete.

48,ozjeppe,Sumptuous production of some of Bergman's favorite themes - but far too disjointed - and where the hell is Fanny?!,6,9 August 2010,"This is Ingmar Bergman's semi-autobiographical Life and Times of wealthy theater family Ekdahl in 1907 Uppsala, mainly told from the eyes of young Alexander as his mother is widowed, remarries a harsh bishop, and moves into his church estate with both the children. A fairly gripping saga, gorgeously photographed and sumptuously produced, with marvelous performances from Malmsjö and Wållgren... but mostly a more artistic gem to admirably behold rather than be moved by and involved in. Considered a masterpiece by many, not by me. Why?Well, I caught the 188 min' version, and many bits - although enjoyable on their own, such as Kulle's monologues and erotic shenanigans - seem to be from completely different films altogether in tone, patched up to a big quilt with unfitting seams, in contrasting the children's ghastly torment of their stepfather (Alexander's head-to-head battles of will with him IS a highlight), with the unrelated, more easy-going content from the family's head estate. The relatives fates from the first act are unresolved and completely detached from the remaining main story: Emilie, her failed re-marriage and the children's struggle. They all honestly don't evoke terribly much emotional sympathy because we don't really get to know them; for example, Alexander misses his dead father and hates his stepfather... and that's basically all. And we also really have no other sign of the family's togetherness than their spoken confirmations, which contribute to this film's most disjointed, highly inconsistent feel with quite a few leaps in the storyline. Perhaps the TV-series version is more cohesive?Bergman's love for the theater is of course ubiquitous, both in establishing the family's relation to it, as well as much of the overly theatrical acting/line delivery, heavily metaphysical & religious symbolism and solemn theme presentation (with a nod to August Strindberg at the end). That style blend is of course a matter of preference, and I'm not a huge fan of it, presented this way (NOTE: this is my third Bergman altogether). And one major question truly arises: where the hell is Fanny in this movie?

50,hunter-friesen,"A film that is masterfully made and directed, but goes on and on until it becomes a chore to watch.",6,18 January 2018,"Ingmar Bergman's 1983 classic has been heralded by many as one of the greatest films of all time, and definitely the best to come out of Sweden. The sets and overall theatricality of the film are mesmerizing to look at and the direction is second to none. However, Fanny and Alexander is a film that is beautiful to look at, but almost a bore to listen and think about as it trudges its way through so many different stories that it becomes hypnotizing to watch. While titled Fanny and Alexander, the film mainly centers on the large and wealthy Ekdahl family. The family comprises of the matriarch, Helena, and her three sons, Gustav Adolf, Carl, and Oscar. All three have wives, but Oscar has the most beautiful, Emilie, and two children, Fanny and Alexander. We watch, mostly through the children, as their lives unfold and how they interact with each other as they experience both joy and tragedy.The film is very slow and meticulous with its 188-minute runtime (312 if you watch the miniseries), drawing out every detail and giving us a look at each individual family members personal life. While this does allow for great character development and chemistry, it hurts the film overall as too many details are covered for you to remember or end up caring about by the end. There is also a wild plot shift by the end of the film where spirits and different realities come into play. Bergman is famous for included mystical elements into what seem normal films, but here he should have abandoned that idea as it confuses the audience about what is really going on. For what it lacks in writing, Fanny and Alexander redeems itself in directing and production. This is by far one of the best decorated and positioned films ever made. The sets are all grand in scale and everything is put in exactly the right spot. The elegance of the house shines brightly and makes you want to pause multiple times just to look at everything in the frame. Bergman guides us through his film with such ease that it makes you wonder how a single man could plan and execute all of this. With this being his final feature film, it feels fitting for him to end here by doing what he does best. 
The cinematography is astounding as we see the beauty of Sweden during all seasons. The winter landscapes, while cold and dreary, still produce a sense of wonder. The summer months give off the essence of life as the frame is filled with lush trees and the occasional sighting of wildlife.Complimenting the production is great acting by the adults, especially Gunn Wallgren as Helena. She plays her character with such warmth and caring and is the best part of the film. The interactions she shares with her family will surely make you remember someone in your life just like her.Another great performance comes from Ewa Fröling as Emilie. She plays one of the most important and well-developed characters in the film. She goes through a roller coaster of emotions as events play out that change her life as well as her children's futures. Near the very end of the film, she shares a passionate scene with Wallgren that perfectly caps off her journey as a mother. The child actors that play the titular leads don't fare so well when it comes to making their characters interesting. They mostly act dormant in most scenes and make you wonder if they will ever do something worth noticing. For a film titled Fanny and Alexander, the characters of Fanny and Alexander are the least compelling to watch or care about.Fanny and Alexander is a film that should be watched by film lovers purely because of its amazing production, cinematography, and directing. But for the casual fan who is looking to see an epic tale, be ready for a long sit for a payoff that never gets close to reaching its potential.",Fanny and Alexander
51,kurosawakira,Without Any Rehearsal,10,3 May 2013,"Stately and magnificent. Every frame exudes aplomb: but it's like every moment, carefully planned beyond the tiniest minutiae, just happened, naturally, without any rehearsal.In the narrative there are all sorts of things happening: there's the theatre and the life of the Ekdahl family that loosely starts to resemble the theatre they're involved in — at first they play Shakespeare, but when Emily and her children move away, that life begins to rot as well. There's the idea of Shakespeare transposed to the domestic life of the little children, Alexander being the one who sees ghosts. Then there's the magician, Isak Jacobi, who obviously practices Kabbalah. It's his magic that frees the children, that is, Bergman's magic. The scenes in Jacobi's house are appropriate in how they reveal to us — if we hadn't guessed it already — the inner workings of this world. Some may see it is superfluously esoteric, but I see it only necessary considering Bergman's fascination with such themes, especially in ""Det Sjunde Inseglet"" (1957). And then there's the vanity of it all, strikingly on display in the scene where the two Ekdahl brothers visit the bishop's house to make their case. This film is also one of the most beautiful examples on how to use color cinematically, and I can't help but feel that somehow Kieslowski's ""Trois couleurs"" (1993–94), despite being more painterly and approaching Tarkovsky in its immediate abstractness, treads the same paths.This is a masterwork, so nuanced, so articulate.",Fanny and Alexander
52,dkncd,Realist theatre style meets the supernatural,10,30 October 2007,"I should note that this review is strictly for the 188 minute version, as I have not seen the 312 minute version. With that in mind, ""Fanny and Alexander"" is Ingmar Bergman's acclaimed chronicle of a well-to-do Swedish family in the early 1900s, seen often from the perspective of two children, Fanny and Alexander.The early 1900s are brought to life with opulent, colorful sets and scenes and appropriate costumes. Stylistically this film blended two major streams. Firstly, it followed a style reminiscent of realist Ibsen-like play where we are presented with an attractive surface situation only to slowly learn of the deep problems and complex relationships of the characters beneath the surface. However, there is also a strong supernatural element to the story. From this angle, it was interesting how Bergman wove ""Hamlet"" into the film both with direct references to the play and with the motif of a recurring ghost.A chief adjective used to describe this film is ""accessible"". I agree with this description in the sense that the film touches profoundly on themes including death, sex, hardship, child punishment, imagination, infidelity, the role of women in marriages and ghosts for a lengthy duration without becoming boring or overwhelming.The first third of the story focuses on developing the adults and their relationships surrounding Fanny and Alexander. At first the film takes its time exploring the film's setting and then becomes increasingly engrossing as it focuses on characterizations and the film's interminably clever dialogue. The last two thirds of the film focus on the title characters, Fanny and Alexander and their touching story. All of the characters are well-developed and the performances are superb all-around from Fanny and Alexander to the adult roles. ""Fanny and Alexander"" is a meticulously constructed and engaging story of a Swedish family in the early 1900s.",Fanny and Alexander
53,crculver,"A sort of capstone to Bergman's career, with some of his perennial religious and interpersonal concerns, but tremendously life-affirming",8,29 September 2015,"Released in 1982 in a 5-hour version for Swedish television and cut to 180 minutes for theatrical release, FANNY AND Alexander was meant to be Ingmar Bergman's last film. Though the great auteur lived on another 25 years and even wrote and directed some smaller projects, FANNY AND Alexander can still be seen as a great capstone to decades of legendary cinema.FANNY AND Alexander deals with the great two preoccupations of Bergman's career, namely the absence of God and the unbridgeable gaps between human beings, but the result is wonderfully life-affirming. Fanny and Alexander are the children of Oscar and Emilie Ekdahl, actors in Uppsala circa 1907, but the film gives a panorama of the extended Ekdahl family, presided over by grandmother Helena, uncles Gustav Adolf (a restaurateur and the film's most comedic presence) and Carl (a professor who has fallen into debt and is trapped in a loveless marriage), their wives and children, and the selfless Jewish shopkeeper Isak Jacobi. This Swedish family lives in an Old World opulence that is hard to believe for audiences today, especially for a country whose class system by and large disappeared after the war. The rigid interaction among people not closely acquainted and the deference of servants to their employers make for gestures as alien to us 21st century viewers as a Noh play.In a way, FANNY AND Alexander is like those big novels of a century ago, by Tolstoy or Galsworthy, dealing with the vicissitudes of a whole family. The vaster family drama, however, is only a backdrop to a more personal one: Fanny and Alexander are soon orphaned, and their widowed mother eventually remarries, this time with a cruel clergyman. The children move from the freedom and comfort of the Ekdahl home to the austere bishop's place, where the children are punished for the slightest infraction by beatings or being locked up in the attic. The Ekdahls' torment living under the bishop is the great crisis of the film, and their unexpected liberation from it presents Alexander with a burden that he will carry into his budding manhood.The original television version is the way to see Bergman's final masterpiece. Don't be daunted by the length: 5 hours should not be a problem in an age when people will watch an entire season of a sitcom on DVD in one sitting. FANNY AND Alexander is not slow, meditative cinema like, say, Andrei Tarkovsky or Béla Tarr, but rather Bergman is always presenting the viewer with some engaging little drama. The theatrical cut, which Bergman made only with the greatest regret, is a very different (and much weaker film), cutting out much of the film's magical realism, the touching meditations on growing old represented by the character of the grandmother, and some vivid depictions of early 20th-century Sweden.",Fanny and Alexander

I never did quite see why it's considered one of Bergman's greatest works, but I was able to stay with it right up the appearance of Ismael, from which point I just wanted it to be over.Perhaps in the long TV version all the second half's mystical mumbo-jumbo is better-justified and we learn why Bergman (insanely, in my view) cast a woman in drag as Ismael and why little Fanny is a title character when she is utterly superfluous to the story. But at this point I can't imagine spending the five hours necessary to find out.",Fanny and Alexander
55,Kubris,Pretentious and messy,7,9 October 2012,"The first Bergman film I've seen is the director's last: I was excited, his reputation puts him in the upper echelon of directors, as far as I'm concerned, and I thought I could stomach his 'more accessible' film easily- I've seen tougher. This is a review of the 188- minute version, and perhaps that influences some of my opinions.Took in all kinds of things- why does the statue move? What does it say about Alexander? I tried to get a grasp on who's in the family: but then it all- falls- apart. Maybe I'm not yet ready for this type of film, but my god as an objective viewer I was sadly, sadly disappointed. The exposition at the very long Swedish version of the Godfather's opening fails: which bearded man is which? Who is the old lady? Who the hell are Fanny and Alexander's parents? On that note, where's Fanny? The titular character doesn't appear for nearly an hour and never does more than stand around and sometimes stick up for her brother, but she has about as much emotion as Bella from Twilight- yes, that comparison just happened. I didn't know who the father was until he died (that's not a spoiler) and didn't connect with who the mother was until we see her grieving in admittedly an excellent scene, one of the best.The kicker is that the family is interesting but it doesn't come to much. Helena, the grandmother, is a wonderfully warm presence and one of the film's great cheers. Gustav Adolf is very lively, but I am baffled that the whole family is OK with him having impregnated his mistress, one of Helena's housekeepers. His wife is OK with it! Everyone treats it like a normal thing! Carl and his wife are just miserable, but their plot goes nowhere, and finally Isak is cheery and likable. The film's greatest, saving strength is its acting: the performances are sublime, and the chemistry between actors is that of a tight- knit family. The tyrannical Edvard is not even that horrible of a person, only a stark contrast from Oscar, but his portrayal and the way the film plays out leads us to see him as a monster.So after the ridiculously long party, and once Oscar dies, we see what the new home life will be like and then the intermission occurs. After that things change radically and things become surreal. It's captivating, especially with the minimalist piano (fantastic music throughout) but I was never sure where real life ended and fantasy began. In its context, talking to the dead makes sense: but miraculous mirages? That's the best answer even Bergman came up with, miracles. Telepathy? I couldn't buy it after seeing a family drama for 2 hours.So the plot trips all over itself, made extra painful by the aforementioned acting and the exquisite script, with amazing dialogues that translate well to English. That essentially sums up the film: top- caliber everything except for a failure to build initial thoughts on characters, and having a terrible plot rife with holes. I'm reminded of a Shakespearean comedy: I think they get buy just by having his name attached. Midsummer's Night Dream is awful. This is not awful, but not nearly what I expected. This is now the definitive example as to why plot overrules everything. 7.0/10",Fanny and Alexander
56,Harhaluulo54,Bergman's worst movie. Could be stock footage.,1,30 October 2017,"I saw the 6 hour 20 minutes long super extended cut for this movie. Movie which I've been planning to watch for years, but have always pushed the box set further and further back behind the front shelves. Now that I finally decided to give it some 7 hours of my life and watch it, I can't do much more than feel sick due to how much I wasted my time watching this garbage, and how much shorter it could've been. This is basically Downton Abbey for people who prefer their movies ""smart"" and ""tedious"" so they can say the exact opposite from what really happened and act like there is something much deeper and complex and philosophical beneath the surface while the movie itself is actually so shallow and fragile even scratching its surface destroys the whole work because all it has is its shell. But wait, maybe this is why it is so smart and deep. It is so shallow and fragile, just like life itself. Very smart and deep and philosophical, would give 10/10 and call it a masterpiece because that's definitely what this movie is and not something I'd just use to justify my rating for it and call myself smart for liking it. In a way, this is the predecessor of the movie Boyhood (2014). That movie is known as the most mediocre movie ever made, but also has metascore of 100/100, just like this movie. The main difference between these titles is that Boyhood can even mildly make the viewer identify with the main character's life and his problems there were Fanny and Alexander live their life in completely different type of mediocrity in a different time period, in a different world, which, based to this movie, is so boring I can't help but wonder how these people managed to die off for natural causes and not just kill themselves during their depressive boredom.",Fanny and Alexander
57,poetcomic1,"LOVED the Theatrical Length Version, But NOT the Long Version",10,25 October 2017,"I loved and watched and re-watched re-re-watched the theatrical release of Fanny & Alexander on its original VCR tapes years ago. I was so looking forward to the 'uncut' version as filmed for Swedish television and was appalled at how it dragged. My main complaint is that numerous aspects of the edited version are mysterious and intensely cinematic but become un-mysterious, explained, talky and boring in the long version. I have had F & A fans attack me about this but stand my ground. It is worth remembering that it is Ingmar Bergman who edited the theatrical version and made all the choices - word for word and scene by scene for what we see. Bluntly put, the long version 'explains' too much and in doing so, makes the viewer less intrigued and less involved. I give this a '10' but only for the 'movie' not the Swedish mini-series.",Fanny and Alexander
58,shneur,Bergman par excellence,6,23 October 2005,"This supposedly is Bergman's most autobiographical film, his chef d'oeuvre and farewell to the Big Screen. Alexander is the central character, though not quite a ""point of view"" one, as we often see and hear scenes which he does not. His experiences at 12 (also the age of actor Bertil Guve, who sadly did not continue in the trade) are wildly stimulating and deathly chilling at times, which I guess makes it pretty realistic for being a boy before everything became regimented and Disneyfied. Bergman's talent for portraying both male and female multi-faceted characters in the depth and texture of their messy humanity is brilliantly manifest throughout this film, and what makes it gratifying and enriching. Nevertheless, though I know it was pieced together from a TV miniseries, at times I still thought it was rather slow and could have benefited from further editing. Finally, I guess I must have missed something because no one else on IMDb seems to have questioned the disappearance of the other two siblings, a younger boy and girl, without trace or comment.",Fanny and Alexander
59,alexx668,Fanny and Alexander,8,30 July 2008,"This epic Bergman film, edited down to 3 hours from the original 5-hour television series, is roughly divided into three parts, about one hour each. Part one sees the Christmas celebration of the Ekdahl family, in a lush and almost choreographed manner, in what is basically a series of ""postcards"" of traditional Christmas fable-imagery. Nevertheless, after the jovial start, the film soon turns to a portrait of family disintegration, with various Ekdahl family members revealed to be in turmoil.Part two is much more typical Bergman fare, with a minimal and austere direction accompanying a tale of religious oppression and suppression. Sadly, while a powerful drama, like most dramas it suffers from a hyperbolic and too-dramatized plot, so that the director gets the point across (in this case the usual Bergman obsessions: the ""silence"" of god, the tyranny of the church).Part three, and perhaps the most impressive, is a galanty show cast across an Ekdahl-family friend's antique-shop and puppet-show. Here Bergman turns to mysticism and subliminal imagery, in what is a seldom-seen part of his work.The conclusion (another family feast) centers it's orientation towards a celebration of family and art, and the message seems to be simply that life goes on.",Fanny and Alexander
60,Daniel Karlsson,Probably Bergman's best,9,28 December 2003,"Although I have disliked Bergman's earlier films and thought they were by far too overrated, that did not apply to this film. I saw the director's-cut version, over five hours. A little long, yes, and there is not much music, but it's not slow, like Tarkovsky's films can be. The opening is great, and the first act, the first one and a half hour, was the part I liked the very most. The realism is utter, so is the casting; the best acting I have seen in a Swedish film, it's amazing. I can't complain about any actor, they were all extremely good. So is the dialog. Alexander had a typical upper class look, so did his grandmother, who looked extremely fresh and healthy and beautiful, for her age. All together, the language and milieus are very credible. No over-colorful costumes and silly dialogs, that is such a frequent element nowadays in historical plays, especially from America. Bergman succeeds to capture the customs and behavior that were used (and to some extent still is used) within the Swedish upper class, as well as general Swedish customs and behavior. I know this, because I am familiar with it and have partly experienced it myself. The result is sometimes amazing. Bergman succeeds to capture the atmosphere of the old times, through language and decoration. The photo is at time dazzling; some scenes are identical to 19th century Swedish painting, and I get the thought that Bergman turned to these in search for the right setting of the film.
Unlike early works by Bergman, which tend to be somewhat theatrical, the keyword here is realism, which I appreciate greatly. The actors manage, like I said, to speak and play in a way that I feel was customary at that period of time. It might be too much to claim this work to be a Swedish Tarkovsky film, but I sensed it had some philosophical material, and it is definitely thoughtful. Otherwise, I think it is worth watching for the acting and dialog alone.One of the best Swedish films ever made, and Bergman's best, in my opinion. (9/10)",Fanny and Alexander
61,Naoufel_B,Bergman's final masterpiece,9,12 November 2020,"Inspired by ""Hamlet"" amongst other classics, the shakespearean Ingmar brought to his audience his latest and most personal film of his career that captures all the main themes of his previous films (humanism, existentialism, realism and imagination), besides its great storytelling and dialogues the other major aspect of bergman's film is the beauty of its visuals and cinematography. Fanny & Alexander is a timeless magical piece by the greatest filmmaker.",Fanny and Alexander
62,gentendo,Berman's Purpose,10,12 October 2007,"I believe Ingmar Bergman's purpose in making this film is to pose two specific questions to the viewer regarding their belief in God: 1). Who is God?and 2). How do people behave when they interpret who God is? From Bergman's perspective, God is someone who cannot tell a lie and who looks contemptuously upon liars, which is also to say, He only tells the truth and praises truth-tellers. Truth is something very important to Bergman and he establishes this concept through two specific scenes. It is first illustrated when the bishop reproaches Alexander for telling lies in school. Whether or not the viewer knows if Alexander is really lying is irrelevant. The point Bergman is making is that he has established through the bishop's character the evils of telling lies. Therefore, God looks down upon liarsin this case, Alexander (if of course if he is actually lying).Second, when Alexander is accused again by the bishop of lying, he suffers even more severely when beaten with a stick. This leads the viewer to ask the next question: How do people behave when they interpret who God is? Bergman seems to suggest that when people interpret God correctly, they act calm and civil, and contrariwise, they act violent and irrational. I believe he uses Alexander as an example of someone who has interpreted God correctly, and the bishop as an example of someone who has interpreted God incorrectly. I want to focus primarily on the latter.The bishop's irrationality is established in three different ways: 1). When he first hears Alexander's story about essentially killing his former wife and children, the camera dolly's towards his face to reveal how terribly fearful he is. This is also accompanied simultaneously with a dramatic sound of thunder in the background. Both elements (cinematography & sound) suggest that Alexander is actually telling the truth and that the bishop fears exposure. 2). after beating Alexander for supposedly lying, (which of itself renders the bishop's insecurity of having to resort to violence instead of civility) he locks him in the attic. Later when his mother comes to rescue him, the viewer sees positioned in the back of the attic a slanted crucifix. This suggested element of production design opened my mind to a very poignant question and truth: What happens to truth-tellers when they report liar's lies?the liars become hard-hearted and punish the truth-tellers for telling the truth. Accepting the truth would mean the liars would not be justified in their behavior and would have to changewhich is something they'd rather not do. 3). At the end of the story, the bishop confesses to his sister that he fears Alexander. Why would he fear him? Because he is afraid of Alexander's magical powers of somehow knowing the truth of his past. Holding such truth can get the bishop into serious trouble.To summarize, I believe Bergman is showing a social commentary of humanities predilection of what can happen when we misinterpret God. By not fully understanding who God is (one who embodies all truth), there is great danger for intolerance and contention to prevail, and in extreme cases, war and violence. If the audience walks away feeling hatred towards the bishop, then they should also walk away examining how they treat others with beliefs counter to their own. The big question Bergman asks the viewer to consider is this: Am I accepting another's belief with love or anger?",Fanny and Alexander
63,paaskynen,Cinema at its best,10,16 October 2012,"This is one of those rare films in which all elements that make good cinema come together perfectly. The script is a true autobiographic culmination of Bergman's writing in that it encompasses in one story all themes he explored in earlier films. The actors, the flower of Swedish Thespians at the time, all excel in their roles. Sven Nyqvist, Bergman's cameraman for most of his career, accomplishes his own crowning achievement with the lighting, colouring, camera angles and exploratory shots in this film. Even the musical score, usually not the strongest element in Bergman's films is impressive.This film is cinematic art at its best; it has no weak moments. Bergman could not wish for a better testament to his skills as a screen writer and director.",Fanny and Alexander
64,revere-7,Not obviously the work of a master,5,22 May 2009,"The problem with any great artist is that it becomes easy to rest on one's laurels, become self-indulgent, or settle for mediocrity. After all, the fans will always stick by you.Fanny and Alexander, Bergman's farewell to the cinema (in more ways than one since it was made for television) is a problematic film - it is a well crafted work, but undistinguished, not nearly as great as some of his past achievements. Can one blame him? Not really - nobody hits a home run every time at bat.Fanny and Alexander is a long (over 3 hours) Dickensian period piece that lacks much of the trademark Bergman touches. It's well made, but not significantly different from many historical melodramas and made-for-TV mini-series' that were the hallmark of U.S. broadcast television in the 1980s. The story primarily deals with two young siblings and their trials and tribulations following the death of their father. Really it's mostly about the boy, Alexander, as his sister, Fanny is pretty much an ominpresent non-entity in the proceedings. There are also a lot of dead-end subplots featuring the children's aunts, uncles, and other relatives. And, save for a few detours into the metaphysical (mostly in the last 10 minutes), there is little to distinguish it from a run-of-the-mill Victorian soap opera.The cast - all of them - turn in fine performances, and while I can't really recommend this film whole-heartedly, I really can't knock it either. Perhaps a good time-passer if you are bedridden and need a 3 hour diversion.",Fanny and Alexander
65,ColeSear,Triumphant,10,25 October 2001,This film could never have been made in the United States. I realize when it was made Bergman had been around for a long time and had his own clout but it still has too much of a philosophical slant to be mainstream here. This film is amazing. The first hour moves at a slow pace but it really sets up the rest of the movie well and then it really picks up. The cinematography is breathtaking and while this story makes you think a lot you don't feel ambivalent towards the characters through the rest of the first film after having been slowly introduced to all the characters you have a certain identifcation that is purely emotional and blends wonderfully with the other aspects of the film. It's truly great and should be considered one of Bergman's best works.,Fanny and Alexander
66,ColeSear,A Masterpiece,10,12 January 2005,"Fanny and Alexander not only encompasses all the work that Ingmar Bergman ever did. It is truly a symphonic film experience. It is musical in the way it flows visually the way the shots move and the way the story moves about from character to character. The music itself is sparse and perfectly placed the monotonous and ominous notes add the perfect weight to nearly the last half hour of the film.In this film there are so many brilliant and unforgettable scenes: Carl's breakdown in front of Lydia, Alexander's Story about the Ghosts, Alexander's Interrogation by the bishop and Alexander's meeting with Ishmael are all the quintessence of Bergman's greatness and absolutely unforgettable.In a much overused film cliché literally every frame of this film is a Rembrant and is also Sven Nyqvist's most accomplished work.The colors are vibrant and brilliant and the frames are intoxicating.Sight and Sound magazine consistently has placed Fanny and Alexander in the top ten films of the past 25 years a few years running and it is well deserved. It is absolutely brilliant and a masterpiece that is nearly without parallel.",Fanny and Alexander
67,cmmescalona,A Real masterpiece,10,5 May 2003,"SPOILER: Most of the ideas revealed through mystery by Bergman in Fanny och Alexander have already been addressed by others. The first time I saw this film was in 1984, on tv and with a much shorter version than the one released in England in 2002, which is the full 300-plus minute original.That day I was scared -really scared- watching the scene where Alexander is been helped to let out his most evil thoughts by Ishmael, a completely mysterious character with supernatural insight. And then, a blackout. You can imagine: if I was truly scared this left me breathless.Then, almost twenty years passed until I found this remarkable jewel, in its full version, perfectly digitised and audio-enhanced in dvd. I bought a dlp projector and used a previewing room to show it to my students. I didn't know what was going to happen. But that doubt was worth the waiting.I think it's very difficult to say any other thing than breathtaking to underline what this film accomplishes. It's the reflected work of years of understanding and hard work between Bergman and Nyvqvist. One of the most powerful, beautiful, fearful and perfect films of all times. An exaggeration, like. Yes, but I think that there are no words to explain how plainly perfect this work is. The way it was written. The way it was directed. The way it was lighted. The way it was designed. The way each and every character plays his or her role. The details -not a Bergman's new- to which they paid the most dedicated attention to. The luxurious use of available light. The setting of the story. The amazing locations. Everything in this film was perfectly studied, down to the colour shifts that would take place in every shot!, forget about whole scenes!The troubling minds of all those characters whose lives are at crossroads. The powerful and eventful lives of just one familiy. The small and big affairs that affect them. Gratitude and hate. Honour and shame. Guilt and love. Fear and joy. Selfishness and generosity. Every long scene exudes with tension, pure fun or pleasure; with increasing uneasiness and abrupt changes of demeanor. With a richness that could only be found where a very skillful eye -trained to see what most disregard as common- finds beauty and harmony. And a sound that is as exhilarating as the narrative depiction.When the maxim of making ""every frame a Rembrandt"" comes to my mind, this film makes me think Bergman pushed the envelope a little further: he gives (or I'd rather say, Nyvqyst) the tratment of Van Der Meer or Bosch or Cezanne or Michelangelo to some scenes. (Think the kids playing at the nursery, the housemaidens sewing socks, the meadow and the boat, the transfixing scene of Alexander in the attic with his mother).And a story told from the eyes of two kids worth a ton of gold. Alexander's (Bertil Guve, when he was twelve-thirteen) enormously powerful and convincing role can certainly be compared to any big-theatre-role actor.Superb.

I watched it in one day but i made few breaks.The director's cut is the TV version, it's divided in few parts.We follow a Swedish family during the twentieth century. Bergman decided to start the movie with the celebration of Christmas but this movie is not a Christmas tale. It was a bit boring but i enjoyed the magic of the last part and supernatural things.

69,KobusAdAstra,A true masterpiece of epic proportions with stunning cinematography and sumptuous set,10,28 August 2016,"We are introduced to a large, well-to-do family, as seen through the eyes of young Alexander: Helena Ekdahl, his regally-looking grandmother and matriarch, who tries to keep the family together, his uncles, philandering Gustav Adolf and Carl, who continually has financial problems. Then Alexander's younger sister, Fanny, and their father, Oscar and mother, Emilie. Both their parents are actors (and some of the other family members too), whilst Oscar also works as director of the acting company. A large and generally happy family, as we see in hauntingly beautifully filmed Christmas scenes.Things change for the worse when Oscar suffers a stroke and passes away. Emilie manages the performing company for a year and then decides to withdraw from it. She is lonely and falls in love with the local bishop, Edvard, who conducted Oscar's funeral service. They get married and she moves to his household with the kids. They were in for a rude shock. They had to leave everything 'worldly' behind, no toys, their beloved books, or fancy clothes. The contrast with their previous lavish and luxury lifestyle and their new life behind cold, unadorned thick walls with bars in front of the windows, couldn't be more pronounced. In their new and austere, depressing household they had to follow strict new rules, something the kids were never subjected to. Furthermore they had to share the house with Edvard's vicious spinster sister, meddling mother and bed-ridden aunt. Alexander has a lively imagination and sometimes makes up stories, or tells fibs. He has a rebellious streak, too, and clashes with his stepfather. As a result he is caned and locked up alone in the cold attic. It seems as if Emilie is powerless, not knowing what to do to help the kids, entranced by the charismatic Edvard.The grandmother comes to learn of the kids' hardships; that they were practically being held prison, and decides to do something about it. But it is not going to be easy; the bishop is a very powerful and influential man... I watched the full, uncut and original version (part of the excellent 'The Criterion Collection'), nearly 5 hours long. (I also have the shorter theatrical version, but will leave that for another day.) It's length did not bother me in the least, and that should be a good indication of the quality of the film.The wonderful cinematography, music score, lavish sets and costumes are all out of this world. And particularly so the outstanding cast. All the actors were excellent, but mention must be made of the remarkable performances of Ewa Fröhling (Emilie), Gun Wållgren (the grandmother) and Bertil Guve (Alexander). And then the clever story-line, fluctuating between the real world and the acted world, the make-believe world.

I am fond of stories centred around families anyway but this takes the family and explores many different corners of how you are affected by your kin. All this of course happens through the eyes of two small children though mainly Alexander. It contains so many moments of sheer emotion, my favourites being the confrontation between the two brothers and the bishop, the appearance of God and the father to the boy and the end scene. A great deal of symbolism peppers the film and Bergman takes hold of the material with such expertise that one cannot turn away at any point. This film is a real treasure and I advise anyone to watch it and love it as the latter comes very easily. I know that Bergman has a reputation for being heavy handed (is this a crime?) but this film is a lyrical song to the family and should be compulsive viewing. The fact that this film is over four hours is irrelevant, as this is often the first thing people comment on when the title is mentioned.

It is superior to the shorter version.""Fanny and Alexander"" impressively portrays the lives and loves of the Ekdahl family - everyone from the widow matriarch to two newborns. This is a family of real, breathing people - imperfect and colorful. ""Fanny & Alexander"" has it all: love; death; lust; anger; enmity; religious devotion and doubt; ghostly visitations; theater scenes in which you can almost smell the props; opulent dinners; and scenes of spartan ostracism. This movie contains no Hollywood silliness: no fake battles between totally good and totally evil characters; no car chases or crashes; and no gun battles with impossibly high body counts. The first act confidently takes its time to develop, but the film is so poignant and vivid, and it grows and grows on you. Ewa Froling is apt as Emilie, Fanny and Alexander's mother. She is beautiful yet a real person - not a Hollywood bimbo. Bertil Guve, who plays 11-year-old Alexander, is a beautiful child and is very effective in conveying the joys, vexations and terrors of childhood. Jan Malmsjo is superb as the stolid bishop. You can feel the internal turmoil as he strives to govern himself. The cinematography is a joy to behold. The frame is always expertly populated with appointments, props and actors; and the colors are vivid and saturated - check out the reds and greens especially.

The lavish, beautiful costumes, the heavily detailed and atmospheric sets, the perfect performances, the writing, the masterful cinematography, the writing, and of course the direction -- all working in sync to create a masterpiece of cinema and art.It's obviously a very nostalgic film for Bergman, as much of it is based on his own life experiences in some way. It has moments of pure joy and rejoicing, and moments of cold terror, sadness, and anguish. It's a truly timeless and gripping tale that touches on many aspects of life and our relationships with family and friends, as most Bergman films do. Also like many of his films, it has a surreal, supernatural tone that one must always take into consideration to fully understand the world Bergman has created.This has been called Bergman's ""swan song"", even though it certainly wasn't his final effort or film. But it is, in a way, because it is the culmination of decades of Bergman's personal and artistic developments, an ecnore of his best themes and qualities as a writer and director.

The bishop is strict! The movie does have a high watchability witch I did not expect. Still, some scenes are boring. Too long. Dull.. And most problematic of all, not likable! Ghosts? Weird thoughts etc..But I wasn't bored, maybe because I watched it on a DVD , via a VLC player and I adjusted the speed of the movie. Mostly watching it at double speed. Going normal only at very interesting scenes.I like the person to person, up close scenes, with some emotional charge and this movie has some of those.For some reason I really liked watching this movie, although there were quite a lot of things in it I did not like.I must say though, people, this is not a movie you have to love. I know I don't. So often, we fall into a trap where we look through a lens of ""what does the world think"". Even though ""world thinks"" (in this case the IMDb) that this movie is top-notch. If you don't feel that it is, just be honest. Not easy to rate this! Seriously. I just love how it's made. The pretty Swedish girls (Maj and Emma) , the sweet grandma (Eldke) , the kids, the bishop.. very colorful characters and an enjoyable ride. But I can't let go of things which I really did not like and of some ""flaws"" (the way Isaac smuggled those 2 kids is completely impossible, unless he was having a groundhog day, and played it 40 times till he got it right). And some totally not-likable scenes.Also, the kids. Not the best cast. I want to give it a 7 , but there is something almost magically that I just like so much. Just viewing people as they are. This movie is special that way.So, where do I draw the line.At...Real rating: 8.1 = 8/10!",Fanny and Alexander
78,teodorodontosaurus,One of the most rewarding movies ever,10,15 April 2018,"It may sound strange, but my advice is to see the shorter version first in order to fully appreciate this. Being a ""love it or hate it"" type of movie, only then you can decide whether the longer version is worthy of your time or not.
I've seen the shorter version first and it left me hungry; it clearly feels rushed and incomplete; there are many moments that don't seem to interconnect very well. I admit, the cutting could have been done better for the shorter version; it feels too abrupt and affects the overall pacing. Nevertheless, it fueled my interest for the four-part miniseries; I wanted more details!
Just as I anticipated, the longer version is clearly superior because of the extraordinary character development and the inclusion of many key scenes.
It really feels that Bergman gave the very best of him and ""squeezed"" all his inspiration into the making of this movie. Everything here is extremely colorful and rich-textured. Indeed, the cinematography and dialogues (especially monologue scenes) are very reminiscent of the works of Andrei Tarkovsky. I must add that there are many semi-horror moments throughout the movie.",Fanny and Alexander

81,Forest-G,The best work of Ingmar Bergman,6,22 September 2015,"This movie won Oscar for best foreign movie , for the set and cinematography for good reason.The cinematography and the set of this movie is really gorgeous. But still I hate Ingmar Bergman as a writer.I rated 6/10 The only Ingmar Bergman movie that is an OK film, his other movie is over-rated philosophical crap. This one is still crap but beautifully shot. The actors are good but if the director (and writer) is suck, you end up with this kind of movie.Let's face it Ingmar Bergman story with religious hint is so outdated nowadays. The question about the meaning of life and death is not interesting subject anymore. The fact that 4 of his movies are still in top 250 films IMDb is kinda upsetting for me, because his movie is really boring after half way through.The thing I really hate about all of his movie, is that he never put any soundtrack in it..... yeah not a melody...PS: As writer, Bergman is better in Persona",Fanny and Alexander

It made me laugh, it amazed me by its artistic beauty, it just satisfied me in every aspect. I have been trying to watch it for so long, that it made me happy not being disappointed by it. I really cant say anything negative about this film that shows the developments and experiences of the most amazing family i have ever seen on screen through the eyes of its two youngest - Fanny & Alexander.Don't give up, even if its hard, you have to watch this one!",Fanny and Alexander

It's extremely boring, and it fell way below my expectations. The several pieces don't seem to fit well together, many characters aren't explored at all; most of them make a brief appearance before vanishing altogether, while others are just sketchy. I suspect that the 6-hour television version is better.All in all, the film is just patchy.5/10",Fanny and Alexander
84,silvershadows-09863,Not a fan,5,9 July 2020,"I love foreign cinema. Japanese, French, Nordic, etc. But I find Bergman hard to get in to. He tells stories I have no interest in. Frankly, I'd rather watch an Arne Mattsson film than Bergman. Yes, it looks gorgeous. Yes, the performances are nice. It's not story telling techniques, but the story. I have no interest in the story of a large, well off family as seen through the eyes of two children. The children are sponges, taking everything around them in. It just doesn't work for me. The first time I saw this 25 years ago all I could remember was it was too long and the farting old uncle.I found this extremely tough sledding to get through. The idea that a 5 hour version exists made me roll my eyes. Pretentious. Why not a 50 hour version where we follow people to the bathroom when they have a bowel movement.Kurosawa, Cocteau, Dreyer, Carne, Renoir, Mizoguchi, De Sica, all masters.

86,francheval,Bergman's ultimate best,10,14 February 2006,"Swedish director Ingmar Bergman has a reputation for dark, intellectual and introspective dramas, which is only partly justified because many of his early movies were rather light-hearted. Here is the longest movie he did (three hours), and the theatrical version is only half of the original which was twice as long. But length should not stop you from watching this jewel of a film, which is both complex and accessible. After all, ""Gone with the Wind"" is just as long.""Fanny and Alexander ""isn't exactly a family movie, but it is a movie about family. Family seen in all its different facets through the eyes of two children. The film is divided into three very different parts, each of them showing a different aspect of family life. It is set in Uppsala, Sweden (Bergman's native city), at the turn of the twentieth century. The story begins on Christmas Eve, and we are plunged right away into a fairytale atmosphere.Fanny and Alexander""s family seems a happy one, actually a family of theatre actors. During the Christmas Eve party held at the grandmother's heavily-furnished house, the atmosphere is joyful at first glance, especially for the children who obviously feel very much at home. But reality is not just what it seems. The children's father is seriously ill. One of the uncles is manic-depressive, and the other is a skirt-chaser who has an affair with the young maid while his wife shows a lot of comprehension. Even the grandmother keeps a secret affair with a Jewish banker (played by Erland Josephson, a Bergman regular) that has lasted for many years.The children's world collapse as their father dies. Soon after, their still young and beautiful mother marries the bishop, whose name is Vergerus (that's the name of the villain in all Bergman's movies, don't ask me why). The atmosphere in the bishop's house could not be more different from the children's first home. It is bare, silent, freezing. Alexander and the bishop hate each other from the start. This hate culminates when the bishop flogs Alexander to punish him, during a suffocating scene. War is declared from then on. Although the children's mother is pregnant, she already regrets her second marriage and seeks help from her former family.The grandma's Jewish friend, who is also sort of a magician, manages to kidnap the children by a clever stratagem. They are sheltered in his house, which is full of puppets and mysterious objects. There, a strange nephew of his lives in seclusion (the role is played by a woman). From then on, reality and fantasy get blurred, but what is certain is that the evil bishop meets a cruel fate, and the children's mother finally makes it back to her former home.The film ends as it began, with a party. Two new babies are just born : the mother's baby she had from the wicked bishop, and the maid's baby with the luscious uncle. The two of them are accepted immediately as part of the family, which is a rather precocious sign of Scandinavian open-mindedness (in 1900, illegitimate children were generally rejected as bastards).Despite the title, attention is focused much more on Alexander than on Fanny. She is there all the time but speaks little, while showing unconditional solidarity with her brother. A possible reason is that the movie seems to have strong autobiographical elements, more than any other Bergman, and if so, Alexander seems to incarnate Bergman himself as a child. Bergman's father happened to be a minister, and the director confessed that he was raised in a very oppressive manner. Thus, it is quite possible that Alexander's step family is a representation of Bergman's real family, while Alexander's real family is the family Bergman had dreamed of, unsurprisingly a family of actors.This film also displays the most accomplished use that Bergman's renowned photographer Sven Nykvist ever made of color. He was a long time reluctant to color and kept shooting in black and white well into the sixties. Bergman's first color movies had nothing special, until ""Cries and whispers"" where an obsessive use of red started to appear. The color contrasts are very strong in ""Fanny and Alexander"", and are especially used to underline the difference between the grandmother's colorful home and the bishop's house which is mostly all black and white.There are many characters in this story, and all the major adult roles are played by actors who are all very famous in Sweden. There is a special appearance by Harriet Andersson, who played the female lead in many Bergmans of the fifties, especially well remembered as the whimsical ""Monika"". Here, she is ungratefully cast as the bishop's elderly tormented servant who likes scaring the children with horror stories. As for the young maid, she is played Pernilla Wallgren, who married Danish director Bille August and became later famous as Pernilla August. She played the lead in ""The best intentions"" directed by Bille August but based on a script by Bergman, and also taking place in Uppsala at the turn of the twentieth century...",Fanny and Alexander
87,luizedumedeiros-82678,Last Bergman's masterpiece,9,21 June 2020,"It seems to me that nobody can express the human drama as the late Ingmar Bergman. In Fanny & Alexander, he treats magically the suffering of two children in a situation of tragedy and cruelty. This is Mr. Bergman last masterpiece, and surely one of the best.",Fanny and Alexander
88,thestinkhole,10/10,10,12 August 2021,"It's Sweden at the beginning of the 20th century. Teenage brothers Alexander and Fanny Ekdahl lead relatively joyful and exuberant lives with their extended and wealthy paternal family, led by the family's matriarch, their grandmother, Helena Ekdahl. The openness of family culture is exemplified by Helena's now deceased husband, who eventually became best friends with one of her lovers, a Jewish doll maker named Isak Jacobi, and her uncle Gustav Adolf's open attachment to one of the family maids, Maj, who everyone in the family loves, even Gustav Adolf's wife, Alma. Among the brothers, Alexander in particular inherited the family's love of storytelling, his parents and grandmother who are actors and who run their own theater. Things change for Alexander and Fanny when their father, Oscar, dies shortly after Christmas 1907. Although she truly believes she loves him, the children's mother, Emilie, decides to marry Bishop Edvard Vergerus, whom she met as an officiant at Oscar's funeral. She also wants a father figure for her children. Going into the wedding, Emilie has inclinations that it will be a very different life from the one she had with the Ekdahls, but she is not prepared for the hard, austere, rigid life that Edvard rules with an iron fist. Emilie, Alexander, and Fanny end up being prisoners in the bishop's harsh, humorless house. While Alexander goes head-to-head with his stepfather and tries to learn how to keep his own principles by obeying Edvard, Emilie tries to figure out a way to regain her children's own destiny, as Edvard will not consent to divorce and his ""desertion"" in the eyes of law means that Alexander and Fanny would become his pupils.",Fanny and Alexander
89,stickbob123,A Timeless Journey Through Life,10,8 April 2014,"Another masterpiece by Ingmar Bergman. After watching the 5 hour cut, I'm most impressed by Ingmar Bergman's seemingly infinite grasp of the human condition. The dialogue and scenes play out not only as imitations of real life, but artful replications. This is life viewed through an artistic lens. It explores most of what a person will go through in their lifetime--childhood, adulthood, old age, death, sex, sorrow, joy, belonging, alienation, isolation, confusion, oppression, freedom, family, art, business, religion and everything in between. It's a five hour journey through life seen mostly through the eyes of Alexander, a little boy, and it can be sweetly heartwarming or gut-wrenchingly sorrowful. There was one hard to watch scene in particular that was the most raw depiction of grief I've seen in a movie. Some of the events and imagery are mysterious, particularly towards the end, but this only serves to further catalyze intense thought and reflection on the viewer's part. Also the cinematography was absolutely enthralling. Ingmar Bergman shoots the interior of cluttered houses like Francis Ford Coppola shoots the lush jungle in ""Apocalypse Now."" There's so much in the shot that it should most definitely be too busy to be aesthetically pleasing, and yet Bergman finds the perfect way to show it to the audience. Beautiful. And his use of lighting only accentuates his mastering of the camera, especially when windows are around. And the acting is also magnificent. I can't even think of a performance to point out since they were all air-tight, and a large portion of the Ekdahl family is given even screen time. I'll probably be thinking about this movie for the rest of my life. True, blissful cinema.",Fanny and Alexander
90,christopher256_98,A great Bergman film that is unique for the director.,10,9 June 2013,"Any serious film buff has to consider the master Ingmar Bergman one of the greatest movie directors who has ever lived. He has made great film after great film, and I think Fanny and Alexander ranks among his top three finest achievements (along with The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries). It differs interestingly from every other movie of his I've seen in its taking in large part a child's point of view. This wasn't only rare for Bergman but it's rare to see a movie made by anyone that shows children, in their viewing of the adult world around them, in such a realistic and interesting way, involving both trauma and joy in these young lives. Yet the children (Alexander being more prominent than Fanny of the titles characters) don't get in the way of showing the great dynamics and complexities of the adult world as well. And these two worlds—those of children and adults—interact in pleasant and somewhat grim ways.From the start with Alexander alone in his grandmother's apartment, through an extravagant Christmas party, to the richness of the theater, to the much darker residence of the next chapter of this family's life, the movie is simply an exquisite piece of artistic beauty of early 20th Century Sweden. On a visual level Bergman has always been a master, but here he showed a more lively and ambitious side than he had before. The performances are all terrific, and I'm particularly fond of Bertil Guv as Alexander, Gun Wallgren as his reserved grandmother, and Jarl Kulle as his boisterous uncle.The movie, in spite of some quite dark elements, is quite a bit more upbeat than typical Bergman film. Those that may have admired his earlier works but felt them a little overbearing and depressing will likely welcome this ride with the great peaks and valleys of this family. Whether Alexander really has some power to see these images or if it's only a child's vivid imagination leaves room for exploration.My rating here is based primarily on the over five hour version. The two separate versions of the movie are both great experiences, with slightly different moods and emphasis, though I prefer the longer television one and that's the one I will look forward to seeing more times in the future. I understand they wanted to get a reasonable length for the theaters, but for me the shortened version lacks a lot of the richness of the other, removing great scenes especially from the back half of the film. Though either way you view it it's very emotionally involving as a work of art. It's a must see.",Fanny and Alexander
91,trekhyon5,The master of the intimate uses broader strokes with mixed results,6,3 March 2016,"A very broad story for Bergman, ""Fanny & Alexander"" contains a load of interesting themes and ideas, ranging from religion to sexuality to aging and the difficulty of growing up. It's visual style glows in warm tones of red, and the cavalcade of characters is diverse, with some nicely applied magical realism to spice things up even further.I did feel that the film kept the viewer at too great a distance to its characters, which are left a bit thin and vague for my taste. Could this be due to the alleged autobiographical components? Furthermore, I felt that the storytelling wasn't as tight or sharply directed as in Bergman's best masterpieces.",Fanny and Alexander
92,wemme,Perfect.,10,30 July 2016,"I've seen this movie twice in my life. The first time I was 18 years old, I came home an afternoon after school and Fanny and Alexander was on TV. Having heard of it endlessly throughout my childhood (pretty much unavoidable as a Swede), I was intrigued. After a few minutes, I decided I couldn't stop watching. I was completely mesmerized. I couldn't put my finger on it, but I had never seen anything like it before. I ended up watching the whole three hours (cinematic release, unfortunately) and postponing whatever plans I had. And it stayed with me. Fastforward a few years and last week, I watched this movie again, this time of older age, having seen several other Bergman movies, having read books about him and with an education in film studies. And how I cried. There is something about Ingmar Bergman that has an amazing capacity to mediate and depict feelings and thoughts I never knew how to put word to. This masterpiece, as the climactic final chapter to Ingmar Bergmans magnificent directing career, has everything. It leads you through life and death, through love and hate, through magic and disbelief, through hope and despair. Bergman has a reputation of being difficult and slow, and rightfully so (although many of his other films are fantastic too). But Fanny and Alexander is easier than his others, yet also more graceful and whole. Only once before have I experienced characters in a film resonating profound feelings and emotions of mine, and that was in Persona, another Bergman movie. Seeing so many of his actors once again on screen, this time of old age, many today deceased, join together because ""everything must carry on as usual"". I experienced a chilling encounter with life, mortality but also the hope in spirituality and beauty. Having dived into the great well of beautiful art that is Bergmans life and career, I am of course biased. But even before having inserted myself in his works, I found this movie absolutely magnificent. And I hope you might too.",Fanny and Alexander
93,Patrik_Lemberg,"I have given the vote of a perfect 10 for the five hour version of this flawless masterpiece, not for the three-hour version.",10,30 June 2004,"This film is excellent. It's beyond words. The story is much based on (real, similar and imaginary) experiences of Ingmar Bergman's childhood. The story begins at the grand Christmas celebration of the Ekdahl family in 1907. The Ekdahl family run the local theater in Uppsala, and are a family of both shared and opposite opinions, but a perfect example of blood being thicker than water. They are partly a family of unpleasant experience, yet a joyful and humor group. No cinematography tops this particularly beautiful work by Sven Nykvist, and I couldn't imagine a movie being as warm and beautiful in its raw cleverness as Fanny and Alexander. From the opening of the first scene until the ending of the last, mesmerization is guaranteed. This was Bergman's last work in cinema (although 20+ years of directing and writing for TV and the theater was to come), and he definitely ended on a high note. At the moment the full 5+ hour version is only available on Artificial Eye (DVD), which is a shame, since the representation of the movie (mainly its sound quality) doesn't live up to the standard of the movie itself - furthermore the subtitles aren't optional! Let's all cross our fingers for soon being able to watch this film well-represented on DVD. The movie isn't worth less than the best treatment.",Fanny and Alexander
94,Himadri,A monumental achievement: a summary of Bergman's career,10,24 July 1999,"Bergman knew this was going to be his last film, and I can only imagine that he intended it as a sort of summary of his cinematic career: this film covers everything - joyous celebration and high comedy to stark austerity and tragedy; and, finally, a mysterious, dream-like final act reminiscent of the later plays of Strindberg. Yet it never appears episodic: it is all effortlessly contained in this huge, magnificent film.In the end, this is a celebration of the magic of cinema: one comes away exhilarated at the sheer range of what cinema - in the hands of a master - may be capable of. It is a monumental achievement.",Fanny and Alexander
95,The_Cake_of_Roth,"Underwhelming, given its reputation",7,6 February 2015,"I've seen a good amount of Bergman's films - I love Persona, Cries and Whispers, Scenes From A Marriage, and the Virgin Spring in particular - but this is the first one I've watched where I kind of reacted with a shrug upon finishing it. I didn't dislike it exactly, but the whole thing seemed to evaporate from memory afterwards and didn't leave a lasting impression on me like some of his other films.This seems to be one of those films where I can appreciate and admire many things about it: the performances, the elaborate production design, costumes, the ambition and scope ... but without any of it having any great effect.I suppose part of my problem with it was that I felt it was somewhat uneven and lacking in focus. It's supposed to be from the point of view of a young boy, but I never felt like we were ever following him - his character only really becomes of importance in the second act ... the rest of the time, he seems to only wander into the narrative from time to time as if he were a secondary character. Because of this, I never felt like I knew him as a character or the nature of his relationship with the father before he died ... as a result, Alexander's pain and preoccupation with death/ghosts/visions never felt earned and just seemed contrived and out of place.The first act reminded of the first third of the Deer Hunter where it's sort of a panoramic portrait of a close-knit group of people - this was interesting to me and I enjoyed the interaction between many of the characters ... but these relationships become minor subplots of little consequence or are left by the wayside altogether. So it's kind of like what's the point of introducing these narrative strands if they are not going to be developed any further? Basically, the film felt like Bergman had bitten off more than he could chew and wanted to throw everything he could into this story of a family (which was intended as his swan song), with several narrative strands that lack pay off or development - they're of little consequence and end up distracting from the subsequent focus of the narrative (the mother's marriage to the bishop).The second act of the film was the most compelling for me: the conflict between the bishop and Alexander ... but this shift of focus was jarring because after the first act, I felt like we get very little of the rest of the family. It's as if Bergman really didn't know what he wanted this movie to be: a tapestry of a family that chronicles each member, a coming of age story focusing on the child, a smaller domestic melodrama with an authoritarian bishop parental figure ...Overall, I suppose my main problem with the film was how Bergman chose to structure the narrative, which I felt was too broadly outlined ... which resulted in something very bloated and ponderous. Still enjoyed much of it, but not something I see myself revisiting anytime soon.",Fanny and Alexander
96,gummo_rabbit,Shaped my visual vocabulary,10,25 January 2016,"Ever since my first love handed me a worn VHS tape with the theatrical version of 'Fanny and Alexander' on it, saying: ""This is you, this is your story"", I became wildly curious to see it, as well as flattered by being introduced to a masterpiece in such a way. Of course, the tape was so worn from multiple viewings that by the time I got round to it I couldn't watch it properly. It took me a couple of years before I finally saw it in a cinema, and I came outside just reeling. Now, more than ten years later, having grown familiar with the TV version as well, I am still in awe.This week I am watching the TV version (on my Criterion DVD), one episode at a time. The Prologue alone just blew me away. Visually, it is as precise and complete as it gets; I wouldn't hesitate to say it touches perfection. I find it so powerful in the way it treats its themes - most notably the power of imagination in childhood - that most scenes have become an archetype in my personal visual vocabulary. I think that's the mark of truly great art. My first love and I lost touch long ago; I could never thank him enough for handing me this treasure.",Fanny and Alexander

The author of the film does not usually put points, but shows the final situation.This episode smooths out suspicion from the previous situation, there is no disharmonious sense of the possibility of tragic events and there is no optimistic mood at the same time. Everything is natural and everything can be.The picture really deserves the ""Oscar"" in the category ""Best Foreign Film"" and for Ingmar Bergman it became the third gift from the Academy.In the cinemas was a shortened version of the film little more than 3 hours, the full directors version is 4 series with a total time over 5 hours.Strong and beautiful film from Ingmar Bergman, I recommend to view. 9 out of 10.",Fanny and Alexander

99,patriciasmaynard,One of the best films in history,10,3 November 2017,"When I watched this film the first feeling I get is that it's like reading a great book. That's how comprehensive it is. That's how much depth there is, created by Bergman here. I normally say that films can't compare to books, but this film is something else. This film has characters that are fully formed.Bergman's created a magical, fantasy world that at times tends toward the supernatural, but then throughout the story is fleshed out as realistic as they come. This is what makes the extraordinary scenes even more extraordinary than it already is. I heard that this film is unlike Bergman's others. I'm not so sure about that. It's longer, yes but the longer version is far superior to the theatrical version. I loved the longer scenes that were added to the television release. There Bergman has more time for more magic, and more time to develop some of the secondary characters. The title gives away the two main characters, the two children Fanny and Alexander. However the film is also largely about their parents and relatives. You wonder why Bergman named the film after them then. It's probably to underline the difference in the attitudes of these two characters with Alex rising to the top, and Fanny in the background. I wonder whether this reflects with the realities that Bergman's painting for us. What I enjoyed the most is the relationship between the priest and one of the female characters. I won't give away the details, but some of the acting scenes between them and their family members is quite incredible. As is usual with Bergman, there's also some theatrical scenes but you'd expect that, again, from a family of actors. I love the way Bergman brings in the theatrical world into this family and it certainly rubs that magical touch that we come to love in his films. Fanny and Alexander may not be as fancy as Persona, but I feel that the quality here is much higher.",Fanny and Alexander
100,tony mcarea,An Ingmar Bergman Masterpiece. One of the Greatest Films Ever Made!,10,13 October 2006,"There are so many things I want to say about this film that I don't even know where to begin. I guess I'll start by saying that this has been the shortest 5 hours I've spent watching a film. At first I had planned to watch it in parts as the film is divided in acts, but I was so instantly taken, engrossed and fascinated, that I just felt like watching the whole thing in one sitting. I know that a 5-hour long film can sound very intimidating and exhausting, but the film is specifically divided in 5 distinguishable acts that make it more digestible, and believe me, it's so absorbing that you will barely notice you spent all that time watching it; it's that good. I've skimmed through the 3-hour theatrical version, and while it is a great film, some of my favorite parts are either shortened or completely cut from the film, which for me, lessens the impact the whole 5-hour extended TV version has. Both versions work, of course, but if you want to get a greater understanding of Bergman's vision, I totally recommend the extended version.Now onto the film itself. What can I say? It's magnificent. A grand, rich and glorious tapestry of life, family, love, hate, imagination, art, fantasy, reality, religion, magic, death, faith, spirituality, God, despair, redemption, youth, innocence, maturity, old age and the supernatural. Fanny and Alexander is all of these things and even more. I don't want to go into much plot detail, but point out what I liked so much about the film by mentioning some of my favorite scenes and commenting on them. And in this film there are plenty. Rarely I've felt the sense of familial warmth and love in a film or elsewhere as I have with Fanny and Alexander. The first act shows us a Christmas dinner family celebration, and it is instantly intoxicating and beguiling, and you're instantly drawn to these flawed-yet-loving and caring characters that constitute this large, happy family and Bergman's direction is so vivid that you totally feel the joy in sharing and the affection and love. One of my favorite scenes in this part is Oscar's (the family patriarch and owner of the family theater) heartfelt and candid speech about the importance of the theater, this ""little world"" as it is referred to, and how art can reflect the ""big world"" and help us have a greater endurance during bad times. This theme is more thoroughly explored in an enchanting and beautiful scene in which Oscar explains to Fanny and Alexander through the simple story of a chair how art is connected to life, how important and essential art is in enriching our lives, helping us have a deeper awareness and appreciation of the world at large, and how there is more to what meets the eye, an inner life lying underneath the surface of things. Bergman was raised within a very strict and oppressive family, and I'm pretty sure that the Ekdahls is the kind of family (Loving, supportive, encouraging, freethinkers) he would've liked to be raised in. I echo his (likely) sentiment. Likewise, if I got a profound sense of love and family in the first act, when tragedy strikes in the second act, I got a great sense of suffering and despair. One of the most strikingly moving scenes in the film involves Oscar's wife, Emilie, giving these primal, animal cries of grief over her dead husband; the scene is simply heart-wrenching. Similarly engrossing, is the open and penetrating conversation between Emilie and the bishop about her faith and her spiritual confusion and longing. But in the third and fourth acts is when the characters' resilience are really put to the test. None of the pain, humiliation and the frailty of the human heart throughout the film is better illustrated in a scene of tremendous impact in which Alexander is severely punished by the bishop and Fanny has no other option but to stand and watch as her brother is being physically abused, only moments later to see her defiantly turn down the bishop's affections. Another favorite scene during this act is Helena's - the family matriarch - beautiful and eloquent soliloquy to her son Oscar about the joys and pains in life, the futility of fighting against its forces and just living it as it comes. It is what it is. Another standout is Isak Jacobi's (a family friend and magician) metaphorical story that encapsulates the importance and at the same time the futility of searching for meaning in life. Some of the film's most intriguing, revealing and fantastical moments are in this act. In what's probably the greatest moment in a film full of great moments, is Alexander's encounter with a mysterious character named Ismael. I think this scene is the climax of the film as it brings closure to Alexander's arch. There's also a deep sense of the supernatural as it is suggested that everything, fantasy and reality, the logical and unexplainable, the material and the ethereal, the good and even the bad, is a manifestation of God. I feel that with those statements, Bergman is telling us that he probably managed to finally exorcise the demons that had been haunting him throughout his life, or at least come to terms with them, as his on screen alter ego Alexander has as well. All of this told, detailed and presented with the skill of a master storyteller.I was fully enraptured by this film. I love the way it beautifully conveyed the relevance of art and imagination and how they're actually essential for humanity. I loved how it showed life in all its joyful, fantastical, realistic, tragic, resigned and ultimately hopeful glory. I loved its sense of completeness yet also leaving the viewer with an air of mystery that implies the endless possibilities of life. A masterpiece and easily one of my favorite films ever.",Fanny and Alexander

103,haroonr1,"Alexandar (only), not Fanny",6,24 July 2007,"This movie, at least the way it has been edited and released in its theatrical version of 188 minutes, is really only about Alexander. I'm not sure why it's called ""Fanny AND Alexander,"" because Fanny really doesn't have much to do in this film except just be present as a character with almost no lines and no real scenes either. Pretty much everything is from the viewpoint of Alexander. Is this an editing flaw? Were many other scenes left on the cutting floor? This is a fine film but certainly not an outstanding one that people make it out to be.Please don't submit irrelevant flames by saying what a great director Bergman was.. That's not the point I'm disputing. He made some very good films. Only, this is not one of them.",Fanny and Alexander
104,thomas-laine,"I'm trying to understand, but...",5,21 April 2010,"Fanny and Alexander isn't utterly terrible. I enjoined parts of the film very much and thought I'd gotten the hang of it on several occasions. However, the film has several peculiarities that make me question Bergmans talent for composing a unity. The whole film seems to be merely a series of loosely connected scenes. Is Bergmans ambition to make a realistic portrayal of the times (the beginning), a lascivious farce (the erotic adventures of Gustav Adolf), an artistic endeavour to portray children's odd fantasies and views of the illogical adult world (the end)? For me, Bergman seems to fail completely in composing a cohesive film.The big interest in the film lies on the personalities of the characters, and Bergman does succeed in portraying the bigger part of them credibly (Alexander, Carl, Oscar, the bishop). However, illogical characteristics of other characters make me doubt Bergmans understanding of the human nature. For example: Gustavs wife lets Gustav play around with other women without feeling jealousy. This could work if only the film in the whole would aim on being a farce or allegory of sexual oppression of women. In the context of the rest of the film, however, these details spoil the credibility of the film as a character study.In the case of the bishop Bergman seems to rely on insufficient reasons for making him appear as such a beast of a man. Why does Emelie suddenly start hating her husband so passionately? He is slimy and idealistic but nonetheless the same man with whom she originally fell in love. Bergman doesn't motivate these feelings, and for me, paradoxically, the bishop appears to be the true victim - haunted by an ignorant director. As far as the bishop's injustice is concerned I take it that spanking wasn't uncommon in those days. Nevertheless, Emilies hate becomes known already before the punishing.Also, I couldn't really comprehend the poetic and incredible ending. Later, I read on the internet how to interpret the scene where Isak comes to save the children. Putting this scene in the context of the rather realistic earlier parts of the film, it seems to me far-fetched that Isak should have conjured the children in the chest invisible and at the same time made their bodies show up in their room to convince the bishop he wasn't taking them anywhere.Considering these confusing aspects of the film I wonder how much was cut from the original five-hour film. On the other hand, it is self-evident that skillful cutting and planning plays an important part when rating a film. Fanny and Alexander should be understandable without having to see any edited scenes. Regardless of what is said above, I refuse to believe that the whole film-loving world could have been fooled to like Fanny and Alexander. I must have missed the point somewhere on the way. Maybe the film needs a second chance.",Fanny and Alexander
105,stevenso-677-931508,"Fanny and Alexander and the themes of faith, men and women, and the artist.",8,5 March 2010,"Faith, men and women, and the artist. These themes, used by Swedish director Ingmar Bergman in his film ""Fanny and Alexander"" not only make for a compelling movie but also offer insight into Swedish culture along with hints of autobiographical elements of Bergman life.""Fanny and Alexander,"" made in 1982, was the last feature film directed by Bergman. The film was released twice; first as a 3-hour long feature and second as a 5-hour long feature, which was intended to be shown as a TV-movie. In the 5-hour version characters in the film are explored more in depth. For the sake of understanding my review, I felt it would be appropriate to note that my opinions of the film are based off the 3-hour long feature.""Fanny and Alexander"" tells the story of a young boy, Alexander, and his family set in a Swedish town representing Uppsala, Sweden between 1907-09. Alexander's family, the Ekdahls, come from a wealthier background and are all gathering for Christmas Eve dinner. During a good first portion of the film we are introduced to a variety of the family members and exposed to their personal, and often troubled backgrounds. We also learn that Alexander's parents are involved with the local theatre. Soon thereafter Alexander's father dies of a stroke while rehearsing on stage for an upcoming play. Distraught from the loss of her husband, Alexander's mother, Emilie, finds comfort in the local bishop, and soon accepts his proposal for marriage. Emilie and the children then move in with the bishop. Quickly the children are forced by the bishop to give up their possessions and live under his strict, unforgiving, and at times, violent, rule. The family, longing for their past life, then becomes prisoners of the bishops house. Luckily, Emilie had been secretly in contact with her mother- in-law, Helena, and the Ekdahl family plans to intervene and save Alexander and his family. Without giving the rest of the film away, the ending explores Alexander's relationship with himself by questioning his faith and his hatred for the bishop.Faith is explored in the film the same way faith is viewed in Swedish culture- with skepticism. Alexander having encountered the ghost of his father and exploring his hatred for the bishop- a religious man- offer Alexander with a conflicted view of humanities goodness and its connection to a god. An example of this in the film is when Alexander meets Ismael. Through this interaction between the two characters Alexander confronts his inner self with the help of Ismael, who can be seen as the 'darker side' of Alexander. Alexander, through this connection, overcomes his fathers death and confronts his hatred for the bishop by imagining the bishops death. Bergman's own childhood comes into play with the use of a clock- used as a symbol of death or of a visit from a ghost. Faith is explored in a very self-oriented way that appears magical and surreal, while questioning human goodness.Man and women in the film is also another important theme in the movie and can be a peak into the taboo subject of 'Swedish Sin.' Men and women are shown throughout the film to be acting off the basic instincts of sexual desire. They first appear to be perfect citizens of society. However, they fall to temptation when the characters begin to lust after, and engage in behavior that 'proper' Swedish society tries to repress. For example, Alexanders uncle Carl's relationship with the nanny girl, May. Carl, who has a wife, runs off to engage in sexual activities with the nanny, which as a result, bares a child. Carl's wife seems to have no reservations against her husband for engaging in an affair. Another example is the abusive sexual relationship that Alexander's mother is put in. Though we don't actually see the acts, Emilie becomes pregnant with the bishops child even though she no longer loves him. She appears weak and bruised as the family lives longer with the bishop. This, among other instances in the film call into question the true nature of humanity and what roles men and women play in society.The artist in the film is Alexander. He is the one who creates and uses his imagination by making up stories, such as the time when he made up the story of how the bishop killed his former wife and children. The bishop tries to rid the artist from Alexander by punishing him, but is unable to do so. The use of a theatrical set in the Jew's household, and the puppets that inhabit it, also create a surreal and magical world that provide an appropriate context for Alexander to explore the question of faith during his confrontations with his father and Ismael. It is no wonder why Bergman, who was not only a playwright for theatre, but also heavily influenced by theatre for film, uses theatrical elements in ""Fanny and Alexander"" in order to express his themes. Bergman use of the 'magic lamp' in the film is also one of Bergman's favorite childhood memories, where it was common for him to make up stories with the 'magic lamp' pictures. The artist in the film enhances the context in which Alexander reflects personally on something as surreal as art- faith.Overall ""Fanny and Alexander"" was a great film, with an engaging storyline that is full of in- depth meaning that can be explored and interpreted in many ways. Between the relationships of faith, men and women, and the artist is society, Bergman offers a peak not only into his personal life, but also that of Swedish society and the relationship of faith in humanity.",Fanny and Alexander
106,paldi,Breaking a little bit with a brand at the last,8,19 February 2012,"To say that Ingar Bergman is the quintessence of Nordic film—not just Swedish film—is up there on the list aptly titled ""Understatements of the 21st Century"".It can easily be argued that he is one of the most famous Scandinavian figures, among such names as Ibsen, Hamsun, and Kierkegaard.So, what does his legacy leave us with? What does Fanny och Alexander, his last film and gift to his movie-going audience, give us? It gives us a cinematic experience as long, rich, character-driven, and complex as his own directing career. It also tries to be a bit more uplifting than the rest of his works, but joy is apparently relative. Apparently as relative as one's enjoyment of this movie. To begin with, Fanny och Alexander is quite obviously an Ingmar Bergman film. One can very well understand this from the opening scene, in which Alexander, alone, hears a clock chiming in what is very clearly an opulent home. It is three in the afternoon. Then the audience observes with Alexander a naked female statue begin to dance.Weird stuff is in store.From this first scene it is fair to deduce that you're going to be getting a good amount of typical Bergman fair. I f you're familiar with Bergman, there are some themes you'd expect from a product carrying the Bergman label: involvement of the theatre, involvement of artists and jesters, faith and doubt, and an observation of the relationships between men and women. This last theme is not just an exploration of erotic relationships between females and males. Bergman also portrays husband and wife, husband and mistress, clergyman and widow, adulterer and wife, and basic human camaraderie. Above all, the panoply of relationships in Fanny och Alexander goes to show how much Bergman intended for this last film of his to be a portrait of reality. If it does not seem as uplifting as some claim it to be, at the very least the relationships portrayed in it are for the most part not anymore dysfunctional than relationships in the real world.One scene in particular also exemplifies this intended ""realism"": an older man takes a gaggle of children up the stairs, proceeding to amuse them with his prowess at flatulence. For a world-renowned,artistic director such as Bergman, this scene seems childish, inane, and superfluous, among other things. Inane it is, but for a reason—this kind of behaviour is found in real life, even among the more well-to-do classes who are at the centre of this movie. Superfluous it may be too, but it is not the most superfluous bit about this movie. Perhaps it was due to the condensing of this film down from five hours to a mere three, but often times one will find that scenes drag on unnecessarily long, or are too long. Perhaps this is a technique Bergman utilised to add a further dimension of realism. But if this is the case, then Bergman's reasons for choosing which scenes he to drag out are puzzling at best. Christmas parties, especially ones where everyone is enjoying him- or herself, do not last as long in our memories as the Christmas party scenes in Fanny och Alexander.Undoubtedly the strangest and most controversial scene in the movie is the scene with Ismael and Alexander, in which Ismael (who is supposedly a man but actually a woman(?)) wants to become one with Alexander and help him fulfill his wish to end the life of his step-father. Ismael invades(?) Alexander's mind, and narrates the death of his step-father, step by gruesome step. It is not clear if these two actually caused the events which led to the death, or if Ismael has some kind of seeing power, or whether this bizarre narration was how Alexander's young mind choose to rationalise the death. One would presume this is an important bit of information if one wants to understand the story, but it is never clarified. The only thing that we do know is that the step-father really did die due to the events exactly as narrated by Ismael.So, what is reality? Perhaps the events Alexander encounters (talking with ghosts, a nonsensical layout of an apartment he cannot navigate, the bit with Ismael, and an eerie encounter with a puppet of God that at first strikes the audience as a dream sequence) is realism in that this is a realistic rendition of how children experience and rationalise reality. Alexander's family is not exactly ""normal"", either: his family owns a theatre, and is prone to drama. His mother is an actress, and does not behave as most other women would in the early 20th century. She is very much a child herself, and she admits at least once that for the majority of her life has not taken things very seriously.Alexander is a child. Children experience reality in a very fragmentary way, and magic is very much a real thing to them. Alexander also does not have any very good role models or adult figures from which to learn a good perspective of reality. As such, all of the strange things are perhaps Alexander's view of reality. Overall, this is a very Bergman film. It is pretty, complex, artistic, and driven by characters. Initially, too, it's full of whatever Bergman thought he should put into it. It is not clear, however, how much of this was essential to the film, and how much of what was essential to the film was lost when it was abridged. It ends up seeming superfluous and rambling at times. That, however, could very well be Bergman's intention. He was a director who knew what he wanted, and what he wanted made him famous. It is only to be expected that in what he knew was going to be last film, he'd direct whatever pleased him.",Fanny and Alexander

The rhythm and visual and artistic brilliance of every shot in this film are so excellent and perfectly balanced and executed that it knocks me out. Again and again. There are so many levels in this Masterpiece, so much light and darkness, so much Body and Soul, so much reality and mystery, so much of what life is about but so hard to describe and express.

109,b-torold,The best movie ever made in its genre,10,15 January 2005,"What can one say? I don't know how many times I have spent watching Fanny & Alexander. Started at the premier in 1982 (when I worked at Sandrews), and the last 10 years or so after recording the 5.12 hour version. By the way, I would really recommend everybody to concentrate on the long version, since there are simply to many great scenes cut away in the 3 hour one. Its always hard to describe in words what makes this movie, that little extra, but I think it simply got to do with that everything is perfect. Script, personal characters, performance of the actors and so on. In its way its also a movie perfect to see again and again. You always find something new to discuss. Like what is Alexander's dream about, how do they succeed in kidnapping the kids, what really happens between Alexander and Ishmael, and so on? But you can simply forget all about that end enjoy this masterpiece. If I had to pick my favorite scene I think it would be the one when Gustaf-Adolf and Carl Ekdahl is having a meeting with the Bishop, trying to convince him to return Emely. I also heard that this scene is described by Borje Ahlstedt as the best he ever made, and then remember that also Jan Malmsjo and Jarl Kulle is performing at the top and the structure and dialog and the physiological undertones are perfect, what more is there to say? Many people go back to the bible to find piece and understanding. In my case I use Fanny and Alexander, it simply that good.",Fanny and Alexander
110,sjmichaels73,Not as good as I expected,7,1 April 2005,"After seeing _The Best Intentions_, which Bergman wrote and based on his parents' early relationship (though he did not direct it), I was very eager to see _Fanny and Alexander_, as I had read that it was also somewhat autobiographical and contained many similar themes. I was blown away by _The Best Intentions_ and thought it was one of the most thought-provoking, emotionally engaging, and well-acted films I had seen in years. I was disappointed, though, by _Fanny and Alexander_. The story seemed jarring and incomplete at times (to be fair, I saw the 3-hour version, not the 5-hour version). I especially thought that the relationship between the Bishop and Emilie was depicted so sparely as to be nearly inexplicable, particularly in its decline- Emilie goes to the Ekdahl's, declaring her hatred for the Bishop, *at the same time* as we see the Bishop's cruel punishment of Alexander, not *after* the punishment. There is little indication of what has actually been happening prior to Emilie's visit to cause her hatred of her husband.I also found the scene with Ishmael to be so over-the-top that I found myself stepping back from the film to say, ""Oh, come on!"" Many scenes are beautifully filmed, and most of the actors are excellent. Overall, though, it wasn't a ""10 out of 10"" for me.",Fanny and Alexander

114,he_hate_me-1,Perhaps the Greatest Film Ever Made,10,17 April 2005,"I absolutely detest making distinctions like this, but I would rate this the best movie of all time purely on the way it affected me. Viewing this film for the first time left me with the feeling that I would never again experience the world in quite the same way. The second time only deepened my appreciation for the simplicity of the story and the depth and precision of every detail. The third time I viewed the five hour Swedish Television version and realized that I was watching the equivalent of a Tolstoy novel on film. The highest compliment I can pay to this movie is that in being a child of the eighties, an adolescent and young adult in the 90's, and well, now venturing towards middle age in this young century, few works of media or ""art"" escape my mind's deconstruction of them, or my generation's greatest blessing (or greatest curse:) a very well developed sense of irony. Fanny and Alexander (along with a few of Bergman's other films including 'The Virgin Spring"" and ""Wild Strawberries"") is the exception to this rule. There is no way to simply break down how Bergman casts the spell he does. His work gathers you in, completely envelopes you, and at the same time is utterly impenetrable to any form of rational criticism. In the end you are left with a pure emotional response to what you just experienced with little idea of how Bergman took you to that place. You believe television, media, advertising, the constant bombardment of images into your brain has desensitized you to pain, agony, regret, violence, disappointment, dreams, longings and questions of God and death, and then Bergman gets a hold of you. I can only say this work is what one would call truly ""spiritual"" art, and Bergman's films are the only place I have ever experienced this phenomena.If cinema is the closest we have to a truly ""magical"" experience, then Bergman is and perhaps forever will be the greatest magician of them all. Fanny and Alexander should be preserved along with the works of the greatest masters of art in any medium. Every time I see this film, no matter what state of mind I'm in, it somehow makes me fall in love with movies and life all over again.Thank you, Mr. Bergman, for spending your life sharing your dreams, visions and nightmares with us.

Their views and ideas about their own history, their ancestors and themselves and, unfortunately, about their children too.

I was so enthralled by this movie that I was hesitant to see the recent Criterion release of the full 5-hour-plus version originally filmed for Swedish television. I was worried I would be disappointed or that my all-time favourite film would somehow be diminished.I could not have been more wrong. The full 312-minute version of Fanny and Alexander is even more rich, more haunting, more compelling, more insightful and more emotionally impactful than the theatrical version. It is more novelesque, and treats the viewer to the most multi-dimensional characters ever put to film, and with some of the best performances ever captured.

Second, congratulations on your superb observation of the extremely obvious: yes, there is much symbolism in this film. It is, after all, a Bergman film. And finally, while the movie does center, at times, around Fanny and Alexander, there is much more to it than that--and much of the movie is NOT from their point of view.I don't mean to nitpick but little things like that bother me. All that aside, a fantastic film.",Fanny and Alexander
122,dadeeo44,The Emporer has no clothes!,5,12 January 2011,"There, its been said. Now viewers can be honest about this disjointed, inconsistently written, poorly edited, mediocre film. To be fair though, the acting, set designs, and cinematography were high points. Skimming some of the IMDb reviews before seeing this film, I came across comments like, ""Every frame a Rembrandt"", ""triumphant"", ""Bergmans swan song is his ultimate masterpiece"", ""could be the best European film of all time"". i just wish I read some of the reviews with less than nine or ten stars before I invested over three(!) hours on it. With a Metascore of 100, apparently no critic wants to be criticized for 'not getting it', for not being able to appreciate the artfulness of this mess. But if you don't derive your paycheck from reviews, you don't have to deceive yourself or pretend to like it. Be real and and admit it was just OK. And by the way; Seven Samurai was horrible. Come on, you know its true!",Fanny and Alexander
123,sambb26,The mother was awful,7,5 April 2011,"When I recently saw Fanny and Alexander, I really enjoyed both the Grandmother and the Father, It was touching and sad that the father died and I was so awed when the grandmother comforted Alexander. But the Mother Emilie was a heartless person, Seriously.First when he touches his fathers hand and he shrinks away in fear, she tells him not to be childish, how would you like if I told you not to mourn over your husband and to be more mature and stop bawling.Second, She has hardly ever shown him any kindness.Third she marries the Bishop and when Apparently he lies about them being in a traveling circus, she admonishes him instead of realizing, that maybe he feels hurt and lonely and simply wants his father back.fourth, When she makes a comment about how its not like hamlet, Hello you just married a Bishop right after his father dies, and now the Bishop is treating him cruelty, are you blind and stupid woman? I haven't quite finished it yet, but I hope to god that she shows sorrow and kindness for her stupidity to Alexander!",Fanny and Alexander
124,perofoslo,Fanny och Alexander; Ingmar Bergman's last and best Opera,10,22 December 2003,"Ingmar Bergman's last (but for TV specials), and best film may be a two act drama? Fanny och Alexander exists in two versions (Film/TV) and lasts about five hrs. It may be seen as a play in two large acts (as a classical opera), or as a French dramatic opera with a prelude and five acts (including ballets). I prefer to view it as two acts:Act One; Religion and hate:A description of protestantic religion with several links to Bergman's earlier films and a lot of autobiography? This act seems to contain most of the usual darker subjects of Bergman's art: Hell, angst, sin, guilt and death. The act is rather ugly and disturbing with its 1500s style although it is set in early 1900s. It makes me feel very bad...Act Two; Family and love:This act is a 'tour de force' of the happy Bergman of 'The Magic Flute'. The 'feel good' and beautiful look of this act is probably stronger than any other film ever made. Tolerance and universal love and wisdom seems to flow from every character (both ""good"" and ""bad""). The sin, guilt and death is present, but it is all accepted as a part of life. I think I have never felt better from a film than during this very operatic film act...The best film I have ever seen - I do not love his earlier films, but have great respect for his art in general.Few gunfights and explosions, but with enormous force due to the contrasting acts that seems to paint a picture of the lost European culture of the la st two centuries.Do not miss this film!perofoslo",Fanny and Alexander

so i think i was round 10 years when sa it
this movie messet me up :D hahaha
i lived in uppsala when they made this movie and after i watched it , i never went to visit does places the movie was recorded",Fanny and Alexander

127,atilla_korlar,scandinavian darkness,7,1 June 2020,"What I know about Sweden is Olof Palme,Nobel awards, Volvo cars, ikea and its wonderful gluten-free cakes and Swedish patties, I think it is also necessary to add Bergman",Fanny and Alexander
128,austingalusza-912-437388,Bergman's Best,10,13 December 2014,"Fanny and Alexander is a wonderful film. It explores the deepest emotions and fears we all push away from our lives and magically ties them in to our youth and age. The tones of the film change drastically and so does the flow of emotion. Starting off comedic, charming, and festive, Bergman paints in his 1982 masterpiece the harmony of a Swedish family Christmas. A variety of fantastic characters are introduced including the two young children of an actor (Fanny and Alexander) They are young, innocent, and are both beginning in their early stages of life to experience the world in new and frightening ways. After a dramatic loss, the children are then taken into a grim world of harsh religion and bleak discipline. As the film progresses, the great concepts of life, death, and of course God are eerily twisted into the strange and magical odyssey, all from the perspectives of the youthful main characters. By the end of the film, we are left puzzled and haunted, yet opened and refreshed. Fanny and Alexander is a brilliant emotional trek of a film. It s Bergman at his best.",Fanny and Alexander
129,thetreeoffilm,Fanny & Alexander Is An Undisputed Masterpiece,10,6 October 2014,"Fanny & Alexander is my favorite film of all time. It centers around a brother and sister, Fanny & Alexander, growing up in a great culture, until (SPOILERS) their father dies, and they go to live with their mother and stepfather. Her stepfather is an abusive perfectionist. The story follows through the brother and sister's tough childhood. The movie perfect in every way, from the sound mixing and editing, superb production design, exceptional acting from adults and children alike, flawless shot composition and cinematography, amazing screenplay and dialogue, but all plays second fiddle to Bergman's raw and beautiful direction. The chemistry of the two child leads is so realistic. You can't see a single character, not even the extras, as nothing but their characters. Meticulously crafted, brutally honest, and flawless in every way, Ingmar Bergman's Fanny & Alexander is my favorite movie of all-time, and I hope more people will see this work of art.",Fanny and Alexander
130,tgold78,Absolutely Awe-Inspiring,10,14 November 2006,"You could call this my opinion of Bergman's Fanny and Alexander...as opposed to a review. I really don't feel the need in describing or summarizing this film. Any review, as I see it, would be pointless. Words just can't convey what makes a truly great movie as good as it is. The best ""review"" I could give Fanny and Alexander is to just see the damned thing. If you can't sit through it, so be it. But, those who are willing to give it their attention, I promise, will be rewarded continuously through the film's duration. Anyone who sits through the entire film, especially the full-length version, I think, will find it difficult to say that they were bored. More than likely, they will find it easy to say, ""That was a damned good movie."" I, myself, was surprised. Previous to seeing F&A, I had never seen a film quite this long. I'm glad I did. I'll also throw this in: most film buffs, I think it's safe to say, will always consider Bergman to be the master of gloom. This may be true, but I think Fanny and Alexander proves beyond any doubt that his ability to express the joy that exists in life is every bit as great, and truly refreshing.",Fanny and Alexander
131,Arlette08,Need Help regarding a quote,10,9 June 2005,"I appreciate the depth of Jack' summary and I agree when he says this movie is profound. (I just happened to find this movie site.) It's been years since I've seen this movie but I have tried to live my life based on a quote from this movie. Does someone have the exact words? The scene is the toast part of the dinner speech and the father says something similar to this: ""Life is short so let us enjoy these days by being kind, generous and happy."" I hope that I am always touched by the beautiful simplicity of these words but if anyone has the exact quotation I sure would appreciate it. Maybe it's time to see this movie again!",Fanny and Alexander
132,hannadunakin,A powerful film that is worth your time,9,2 November 2016,"Fanny and Alexander is truly an extraordinary film that is worth one's time. I cannot stress enough how much of a masterpiece this film was, and I won't let anyone tell me otherwise. The film version (which is what I saw) was actually the cut version. It was originally made as a four-part TV movie, that if watched all at the same time, would be a total of about 6 hours. Although very long, if it's at all like the movie, count me in!The beginning of the movie is a little slow. All the characters are being introduced, so the story isn't developed until Oscar Ekdahl passes away unexpectedly. Now before I continue, it's important to note that the Ekdahl family is very close. The one who keeps the family together is the grandmother Helena Ekdahl. She is passionate towards keeping her family together, especially during the holidays, which is like a marvelous party in the Ekdahl household. The Ekdahl family is so loving and wonderful, that they even consider their ""help"" family. The beginning of the film is based around Alexander and his imagination and thoughts. Fanny isn't truly introduced until Oscar's death, which was Fanny and Alexander's father. With almost no time to mourn, their mother Emilie Ekdahl marries the towns bishop, Bishop Edvard Vergérus, in hopes of starting a new life, little did she know, a completely new life is what she would get. Emilie, Fanny, and Alexander moved into the bishop's home where he lives with his mother, sister, sick aunt, and maids. The bishop makes it very clear that his new family could not interact with their ""old"" family, the Ekdahl's, and from there, things begin going down hill. Emilie thought that she would have the same loving and cherishing marriage and family like she did before, but she was wrong. Especially when she discovers the relationship between Alexander and the bishop. Alexander is abused and mistreated frequently, with no reason, and Fanny is always forced to watch. After such discovery, Emilie also finds out she is pregnant with the bishop's child.This movie made me cry, laugh, yell, and feel every emotion possible. I was hesitant to watch this film because I'm not a fan of reading subtitles, but Fanny and Alexander has definitely opened several cinema doors for me. I can safely say that this will not be my last foreign film. As much as I loved Ingmar Bergman's directing in this movie, I need to acknowledge the camera work by Sven Nykvist. He made the brilliant choice of having many wide shots of characters, which I thought really set the mood of each scene. Not only that, but he took advantage of the small spaces he had in some of the scenes by moving the camera around a lot. What was also outstanding was how the lighting was chosen throughout the entire film. It was always bright and cheerful in the Ekdahl household, but in the bishop's house, it was always dark and scary. Some beautiful art that shouldn't be left unnoticed.What I found quite interesting though was the fact that Fanny came first in the title of the movie, because the focus was mostly on Alexander, what he did and thought. Sometimes we would learn a little bit about Fanny, but only through Alexander. Might I remind you that Fanny isn't even really introduced until her father's death, and to top it off, she rarely speaks. So why was the decision made to put Fanny before Alexander? Is there a symbol or significant scene about Fanny that I missed? All in all, I would recommend this movie to any cinema lovers. It is a must see. If you didn't like foreign films before, you will after watching this film. It is powerful in so many aspects, and I promise, you will not be disappointed.",Fanny and Alexander
