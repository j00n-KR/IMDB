0,TheLittleSongbird,A few good performances and some nice visuals save a rather average film.,5,11 June 2009,"I will say I liked most of the performances and what we are given is a lovely looking film with a superb idea for a fantasy. However, on screen, it doesn't quite gel, as in terms of plotting and dialogue, the film is merely average. Anne Hathaway is naturally lovely as Ella, a girl who is given the gift of obedience at birth, and Eric Idle is good as the narrator. Joanna Lumley has fun as a rather pantomime character, loosely based on the wicked stepmother from Cinderella. The film does have some lovely costumes and sets, and it does have a sense of fun, especially at the beginning. I also liked the the character of Prince Char. However, the film does suffer from some superficial scripting, that lacks the irreverence and wit of a fantasy such as Enchanted. The story starts off very well, but then turns into a series of underdeveloped vignettes and nods to other fairy tales, including the over-familiar brother- kills- brother- and-nephew scenario inspired by Hamlet. I liked Cary Elwes in Princess Bride, the Jungle Book(live action) and Cat Returns but I will confess I didn't very much here as Edgar. He just seemed over the top, and the lack of any malevolence from him or that unconvincing CGI snake made them rather forgettable villains. Minnie Driver is a lovely actress, but I didn't like her accent very much, she has a perfectly lovely voice, why decide to do an accent that doesn't suit her? I also didn't like the soundtrack very much, I liked the fact that Hathaway did some singing, but the song seemed out of place in this sort of film. The ending was a bit of a letdown, because the idea of making the entire cast doing a song and dance number, all seemed rather pantomime to me. Overall not a terrible film, but not a great one either, merely average. 5/10 Bethany Cox.",Ella Enchanted
1,bkoganbing,Char And Ella,7,11 February 2010,"Before Anne Hathaway became an obedient slave to Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada she was under an obedience spell in Ella Enchanted, courtesy of her hip fairy godmother Vivica Fox. Though I'm not sure why this is such a good thing for anyone, it does provide some of the plot basis for this updated pop version of Cinderella.Anne Hathaway as the dolefully obedient Ella is wonderful in the part, even getting five finger discounts at the village medieval mall because her stepsisters tell her to. A chance encounter with Hugh Dancy as Prince Charming intrigues Dancy because he's treated as a fairyland rock star with any number of willing groupies including the stepsisters longing to become queen.But if evil Uncle Cary Elwes has anything to say about, that ain't about to happen. He's gotten real rich and sassy off the onerous taxes the people have to pay and using the forest ogres as scapegoats.Over 50 years earlier Disney Studios did the famous cartoon version of Cinderella with such lasting hits as Bibidi Bobidi Boo and A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes. I don't think any of the songs will gain the lasting fame those two did, but they're easy to take move the plot along where needed.Cinderella for the 21st century, just what this old world needs.",Ella Enchanted
2,SnoopyStyle,Curse too broad and unreasonable to escape notice,6,28 September 2013,"Baby Ella (Anne Hathaway) was given a 'gift of obedience' by Lucinda the fairy (Vivica A. Fox). It is more of a curse which the unreasonable fairy refuses to undo. She must do everything she's told to do. It's really unreasonable that nobody notices this curse. Are the townfolks really stupid? When her stepsister (Lucy Punch) notices the curse, Ella has no choice but to leave and try to undo the curse. In the meanwhile, Prince Charmont (Hugh Dancy) has fallen for her.Anne Hathaway is cute and lovely. She and Hugh Dancy make a cute pair. But every time somebody does the curse and can't figure it out, it gets really annoying.",Ella Enchanted
3,Prismark10,Not too enchanting,1,11 April 2015,"Ella Enchanted is based on book, I understand that the filmmakers have taken some liberties with the adaptation and in this case there are six writers credited in this adaptation which rather tells it own story.Ella Enchanted was given the gift of obedience by an obnoxious fairy which causes her problems as she has to literally obey all commands a problem when her stepsisters move in with her As you can gather the film is also a reworking of the Cinderella story made more hip.The casting of Cary Elwes as the villainous uncle of Prince Charming is there to remind you of the far superior The Princess Bride as this film is appalling. It wants to attract the Shrek type of knowing satire but the film is so awkward with some bad special effects such as the CGI snake.Every time the step sisters commanded Ella I cringed. I kept thinking what will happen when men try to command Ella at some point of the movie and what they might get up to. After all this is supposedly a family film.Awful in so many levels (why does Ella's father just disappear from the movie and also not told of her gift) and badly misconceived. The songs were nice though with a cheesy musical finish (borrowed from the Shrek films.)",Ella Enchanted
4,lee_eisenberg,this is gonna take some explaining,6,2 November 2013,"""Ella Enchanted"" is usually the sort of movie that I would heckle, but Anne Hathaway is not someone whom I heckle. It's true that she started out in roles like ""The Princess Diaries"", but her later turns in ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and ""Rachel Getting Married"" showed her to be more than just another pretty face, although I do find her quite attractive. Watching the movie, I assumed that the kingdom under its current governance was an allegory for racism: the giants, elves and ogres are only allowed to do certain things, with all prestigious careers reserved for humans. One could argue that using a fairy tale setting to address racism is inappropriate given what racism can lead to (i.e., genocide), but what are ya gonna do? I read that the movie took some liberties with the novel on which it's based. I of course had no idea that it's based on a novel and will most likely never read the novel, so I only have the movie to go on. I actually didn't find it to be a bad movie, mainly since it pokes fun at the fairy tale genre by incorporating modern things (escalators and even a Ray Charles song). Worth seeing.",Ella Enchanted
5,jboothmillard,Ella Enchanted,5,30 January 2008,"I have seen quite a few new plays and mocks on the old fairy tales, including Shrek, and this I suppose could be another one. Basically Ella of Frell (Anne Hathaway) was born with a special gift given to her by fairy Lucinda Perryweather (Indepedence Day and Kill Bill's Vivica A. Fox), the gift of obedience. Her gift to her is obviously a cruse, to everyone who knows her it is really weird (the don't know), but anyway, Ella has to do absolutely everything anyone says, intentional or suggestive orders, even the ridiculous and odd. She is sick of this curse, and knowing she is in love with Prince Charmont (Hugh Dancy), she wants to rid herself of her curse by going to Lucinda. In the end though, after Lucinda refuses to take her gist back, and with order from villain Sir Edgar (Cary Elwes) to kill Charmont at midnight, she looks in the mirror and orders herself not to obey ever again. Charmont does dismiss her for a while because he saw the dagger, but there is a happy ending and wedding. Also starring Aidan McArdle as Slannen of Pim, Joanna Lumley as Dame Olga, Minnie Driver as Mandy, Jimi Mistry as Benny, Eric Idle as The Narrator, Patrick Bergin as Sir Peter, Bend It Like Beckham's Parminder Nagra as Areida, Lucy Punch as Hattie, Jennifer Higham as Olive, Steve Coogan as Heston the Snake, Jim Carter as Nish the Ogre and Heidi Klum as Brumhilda. Hathaway is pretty fit, the well-known faces add some interest, and there are a few good gags with the obedience thing, a pretty okay family film. Worth watching!",Ella Enchanted
6,sunwarrior13,Anne Hathaway Shines As Ella,8,9 October 2012,"Ella Enchanted is a romantic-comedy film that stars Anne Hathaway as Ella and Hugh Dancy as Prince Charmont together with Cary Elwes, Steve Coogan,Aidan McArdle,Minnie Driver and Vivica A. Fox. It plays with the usual fairy tale genre.It was directed by Tommy O'Haver.Adapted from author Gail Carson Levine's award-winning children's book of the same title,this modern fantasy Ella Enchanted is about Ella,who is given the gift of obedience and which also happens a curse. Under no circumstances can Ella refuse anything she is asked to do. Tired of being taken advantage of, Ella leaves home to find her Fairy Godmother and return her unwanted gift. This simple errand soon turns into an amazing journey.Ella lives in a magical world in which each child, at the moment of their birth, is given a virtuous ""gift"" from a fairy godmother. Ella's so-called gift, however, is obedience. This birthright proves itself to be quite the curse once Ella finds herself in the hands of several unscrupulous characters whom she quite literally cannot disobey. Determined to gain control of her life and decisions, Ella sets off on a journey she hopes will end with the lifting of the curse in question. The path, however, isn't easy -- Ella must outwit a slew of unpleasant magical creatures ranging from ogres to talking books with evil plots. Though perilous, Ella's adventures turn out to be necessary obstacles in the path toward finding herself, and maybe even true love along the way.In its innocence, sweet heart and abundant wit, it has more going for it, by my accounting, than a dozen more expensive-looking films.Also,Anne Hathaway is a charming performer with a bracing freshness about her that carries the film as she establishes credible chemistry with Brit actor,Hugh Dancy.Overall,it is an endearing, enduring, and fun fantasy film.",Ella Enchanted
7,neil-476,Book? What book?,8,13 January 2008,"I'm sorry for those who felt that this film spoilt their enjoyment of the book - I'm all too familiar with the phenomenon from other films (The Shining looms particularly large in this department).But I wasn't aware that there was a book, and I loved this film.It was funny, charming, and had heart. All the cast were excellent, pretty nearly all the gags worked, the visuals worked, and the story - even if it was different to the book - worked too.Plus I thoroughly enjoyed the musical numbers, too.Recommended for those who like a light touch to their fantasy (and who haven't read the book).",Ella Enchanted
8,anaconda-40658,Hathaway Enchanted.,6,2 June 2015,"Ella Enchanted (2004): Dir: Tommy O'Haver / Cast: Anne Hathaway, Hugh Dancy, Cary Elwes, Vivica A. Fox, Minnie Driver: Magical family adventure about individuality set in the fairy tale setting of castles, elves, ogres, giants, and fairies. Ella is born and given the gift of obedient by a wayward fairy. After her mother passes she is informed of her gift but suddenly her father is set to remarry a selfish woman with two nasty daughters who learn of her gift. She is cursed to do everything she is told lest she can find the fairy godmother who distributed the gift. Along the way she is assisted by a Prince who doesn't realize the scheme set by his uncle the King. Imaginative plotting that goes astray in its concluding action. Inventive work by director Tommy O'Haver with a hilarious performance by Anne Hathaway as Ella. She must master her gift particularly when others attempt to use it for tragedy but her breaking of the curse is clever. Hugh Dancy as the good Prince is standard issue. He falls in love with her and is nearly assassinated. Cary Elwes plays the sadistic King in the film's second standard role. Vivica A. Fox excels in the limited role of fairy godmother who reverses gifts. Minnie Driver is limited as a house fairy who was kind to Ella. Elements of Shrek combine with moderation prove effective. Wondrous visual effects render this film truly enchanting. Score: 6 / 10",Ella Enchanted
9,Smells_Like_Cheese,A lot of fun!,7,20 November 2007,"I think Ella Enchanted has to be one of my new favorite guilty pleasure's. I knew that this film wasn't all that, but for some reason, I really enjoyed this film. I think I just needed a fun clean comedy to just smile with. As cheesy as it was, this was just such a fun comedy to watch. It put a new twist on the fairy tale classics without over doing it. For the most party when they do the new songs, or things that are supposed to only work in today's ages, when they put it into movies that are supposed to take place in the medieval times, it doesn't work, but Ella Enchanted made it fun for the kids and the adults as well. Anne Hathaway is such a beauty and has such a presence on the silver screen, she as a perfect choice as Ella. She and the whole cast looked like they had the ultimate blast creating this movie.Ella from Frella is a young peasant girl who has a horrible curse on her, she has to do everything that is told of her, no exceptions, no objections, she has to do it. To make matters worse, her step sisters have found out about this curse and are taking horrible advantage of it. But when she meets the kingdom's heart throb, Prince Char, she tells him of how he can make the kingdom a more wonderful place and what to do as king, he's fascinated with her and they fall in love. But the king in place, Sir Edgar, will make sure that Ella will not have a word in what Char does, but also make sure that Char does not have a word in as well.Ella Enchanted is a wonderful film, I thought it was all in good fun and is enjoyable for the whole family. I especially loved Sir Edgar's demise, it was so simple, but so funny. I know I just might be a little easily amused, but sometimes you need to be to enjoy a movie. Ella Enchanted is a well made film and has a real fun story to it. Plus it just looks like everyone enjoyed making it, which adds a little more excitement to the film. I would highly recommend Ella Enchanted if you are looking for a few laughs, it's a cute story with a fun fairy tale twist.7/10",Ella Enchanted
10,Buddy-51,when will these chintzy fairy tale movies ever end?,3,13 April 2006,"Thank goodness ""Brokeback Mountain"" came along or poor Anne Hathaway might have spent her whole life starring in saccharine modern day fairy tales like the ""Princess Diaries"" movies and ""Ella Enchanted"" - and we might never have discovered her depth and versatility as an actress. Actually, even with this limited material, Hathaway still manages to shine through most of ""Ella Enchanted,"" which otherwise comes across like a live action, dumbed-down version of the ""Shrek"" films, replete with a mixture of old fashioned settings and contemporary pop culture references - and creepy ogres with their butt cracks showing.As a baby, Ella of Frell is put under a spell by a mischievous fairy, a curse that forces the young girl to obey any command she is given no matter how slight, trivial or even unintended. This makes life tough for a progressive freethinker like Ella, who is otherwise spending most of her time as a social crusader, fighting to undo the many injustices that beset the kingdom in which she lives (the segregation of giants, elves and ogres from the rest of the population being the main one with which she is concerned). However, I am quick to add that when she isn't rallying for elfish equality, she's doing what every other heroine in these types of stories is doing - which is falling in love with a handsome young prince who manages to sweep her off her feet and secure her a place as first lady of the land. The film also comes complete with an evil stepmother and two vile stepsisters, a dastardly king, a coronation ball, a trek through the forest with two sardonic sidekicks, and even the performing of anachronistic modern day pop songs a la ""A Knight's Tale"" (and doesn't Heath Ledger have a great deal to thank ""Brokeback Mountain"" for as well?!). It's a pretty dismal affair all around, but then what can one expect from a movie that chooses the ghastly ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" to serve as the film's closing dance number?",Ella Enchanted
11,Robert_duder,Cute and fun...a live action Shrek,8,26 July 2005,"Ella Enchanted is a cute and fun story mostly for kids revolving around the Fairy Tale World much the same way Shrek did. There are pieces of numerous different Fairy Tales spread throughout the film and the movie has everything that a Disney Tale should have....romance, a prince, a girl with a curse, wicked step family, an evil king, ogres, elves, you name it they are all here and of course the happy ending.Ella Enchanted is the story of Ella who at birth was given an odd gift by one of her fairy godmothers. She was given the gift of obedience which in turn causes he to do anything and everything she is told to do. Only her mother and their trustworthy house fairy knows of this ""curse."" They instruct Ella to never tell anyone for fear someone might use her for the wrong thing. Her mother passes away and eventually her father remarries in order to support them. The new stepmother comes with two unfortunate evil stepsisters who eventually figure out about Ella's horrible secret and vow to use it against her. Prince Char, nephew of the (secretly) evil current ruler Sir Edgar, is next in line and ready for his coronation. All the women in the Kindgom are crazy for Char except Ella who is dead-set against the conditions in the Kingdom that segregate Orges and Elves and Giants and treat them like slaves. When Char and Ella meet accidentally while Char is trying to outrun his female fans Char is immediately taken by Ella and the fact that she speaks her mind and isn't swooning over him. Finally fed up with her curse Ella sets out an adventure with the talking book Benny to find her Fairy Godmother Lucinda and have the ""gift"" revoked. Along the way she meets up with an Elf who wants nothing more than to be a lawyer, and none other than Prince Char who offers his help to find her Godmother and talk to Sir Edgar about turning over the laws outcasting elves etc. As they travel the two fall madly in love and when they reach the Kingdom Ella's evil stepsisters offer Sir Edgar Ella's horrible secret in exchange for Prince Char's hand in marriage. When Sir Edgar confronts Ella with her curse he demands that she murder Prince Char when he proposes to her at the ball. Now Ella must do everything in her power to fight the curse she has known since birth, right the Kingdom and get her prince.The film's demographic is children, mostly girls, and it hits that demographic dead on with a strong female lead in Anne Hathaway who of course plays not much a different part for her role as Princess Mia in the Princess Diaries. She's easy to watch because she plays the shy, clumsy, girl next door very well but is also a very strong willed character actor. Hugh Dancy plays a more down to Earth type prince and has decent Chemistry with Hathaway. The story really rests on the enormous cast of interesting cameos and characters. Minnie Driver (who usually annoys me to death) plays a small role as the House Fairy Mandy, Sir Edgar played by Cary Elwes is the perfect fairy tale villain, over the top and bound to get his and his sidekick snake Heston is a great sidekick indeed and reminiscent of the snake from Disney's Robin Hood. Slannen the legal elf is a great sidekick for Ella, and Benny the talking book (formerly a man) has some great moments as well. All these unique and original characters make this such a cute movie for families and just fun to watch. It is different and yet typical and still has everything that makes it great. I highly recommend this one for family movie night, you'll have fun with it. 8/10",Ella Enchanted
12,MLDinTN,a feel good fairy tale,7,5 March 2005,"I thought this film was entertaining and fun. It's certainly nothing that makes you say wow but at least it wasn't crap like a lot of movies now days. It's about a girl named Ella whose fairy godmother casts a spell on her to be obedient. Now Ella's around 18 and her father remarries. One of her new stepsisters figures out she has to do what she's told. So she tells Ella to steal and say hurtful things for fun. The sister is also obsessed with Prince Char but guess who he likes instead. Of course, it's Ella who at first isn't fond of the prince because of political matters. The movie tries to be very PC by having Ella wanting to free Orges and elves from ""slavery"". I know it gets a bit silly with that part. The king is Char's uncle. And he has the silliest thing in the movie that was so out of place, a talking python. But that's the only animal that talks. If they were going that route, then birds, dogs, horses,etc... should have talked also. And no one is shocked by the talking snake. Of course, Ella's curse is used against her. Will she break it? Well, it's a fairy tale so what do you think?BTW: I really liked the music, but Ella should have broken the curse in a more creative way. It leaves you to wonder, why couldn't she have done it earlier? FINAL VERDICT: I thought it was an entertaining 90 minutes and recommend it.",Ella Enchanted
13,g-bodyl,Not the Greatest Film!,6,5 May 2014,"I really wanted to like Ella Enchanted, but I really couldn't. It seemed to have a decent plot, but the movie on the whole is pretty lame. It's very cheesy and gimmicky and not that funny. There were a few amusing parts such as when Ella was forced to do every command thanks to a spell, but in the end, this film is only for little kids.Tommy O'Haver's film is about a girl named Ella who has been given the gift of obedience. But when the curse is reaching it's limit, Ella decides to find the fairy who gave it to her so it can be removed. Meanwhile she falls in love with the Prince Charmont.The acting is so-so. Anne Hathaway was still in her princess years when this came out, so she does the best she can do with the predictable script. Hugh Dancy as Charmont wasn't that great. The best roles came from the smaller performances in Cary Elwes and Minnie Driver. They should have had more scenes.Overall, Ella Enchanted tries to succeed as a charming fantasy romance, but it ultimately fails. It's by no means horrible, not it's not that good. There were several amusing scenes, but nothing that can truly save this film. I was reminded much of Shrek and the Princess Bride, but not really in a good way. Honestly, I wasn't expecting to like this and I, for the most part, did not. One thing for sure, the little kids will like this. I rate this film 6/10.",Ella Enchanted
14,vincentlynch-moonoi,Great fun film; Hathaway shines,8,27 May 2013,"This is one thing I really like about premium cable channels. This is not a film I would have ever gone out to see, but I caught it and home and quite enjoyed it.First off, this film doesn't take itself too seriously. There are so many things here that remind me of other film genres...and somehow they all work and come together. Things like inside jokes and references to current culture may seem out of place, but they work...sort of like they did in the old Crosby/Hope Road pictures. At a few places characters break into song...like in a Bollywood movie. An ancient fairy tale with modern music and dance. And lots more. You'll find yourself smiling.Second, the performances by the key actors are fun. First up is Anne Hathaway...whom I've always enjoyed, but who shows sides of her talent here that we don't always see. Hugh Dancy is just fine as the Prince. Cary Elwes shines as the goofily evil Prince's greedy uncle. Aidan McArdle is a great sidekick as an elf who wants to become a lawyer. And I always enjoy seeing Minnie Driver, who here is a household fairy.There are good special effects here, and they're not excessive to the point of distraction. The photography is very good and the sets are lush, with a great deal of it filmed in Ireland.I'm surprising myself here and giving this film an ""8"", in part just because it does something few films do -- it's something really different! And great fun! This is",Ella Enchanted
15,tabuno,Entertaining But Flawed,6,24 January 2019,"15 November 2004. Without reading the book, I can't really compare the movie to the original source. Unlike my original fear that Ann Hathaway would be forced into some super-human martial arts expert quite out of character of this type of movie, the kicks and flips were kept usually to an acceptable minimum. Her curse or enchantment wasn't as upsetting as I'd thought it would be to bear...in fact her plight was used to great affect in the movie and with tact. The director, however, went overboard, particularly at the end with kung-fu Chinese martial arts over-extending their stay making the ending really lame in part. For the most part, Ella Enchanted was enjoyable, but the presentation just didn't seem to hit the high notes of what the material really offered. Ann's character didn't seem to allow her to really stretch much more out of her usual role and the Cinderella theme really seemed over-used (even if it might have been in the original book). Six out of Ten Stars.",Ella Enchanted
16,kenjha,For she's a jolly bad Ella,2,2 June 2006,"Retelling of Cinderella story starts off well enough but then comes the remaining 90% of the movie. It took five screenwriters to come up with the unbelievably lame script that tries so hard to be hip and witty. The whole concept of Ella being given the ""gift"" of obedience becomes tiresome very quickly. A game cast of familiar faces plays cartoon characters. To say that this film is an embarrassing display of mediocrity would be to overpraise this turkey. The production values are cheesy and the direction is obviously the work of a hack. It looks like a low-budget TV movie and the producers should have been arrested for trying to make people pay to see this in a theater.",Ella Enchanted
17,filipemanuelneto,"It's pretty funny, and that's what matters most here.",6,4 December 2017,"There are films that are meant to be great. Others, however, are just meant to be fun. This film belongs certainly to the second group, having been thought of as a family comedy. The plot is clearly based on Cinderella's tale, but here she is cursed to obey because of a bad-taste gift given by an unconventional fairy godmother. The whole story then develops in her effort to free herself from this gift and the way people take advantage of it to manipulate her. Gradually, everything becomes more predictable and my interest has diminished but never disappeared because it remained funny enough. The way Ella and the Prince know each other is, in my perspective, the poorer solution the script could have created to cross them. The idea of ​​that talking book sounded kind of stupid too. Dialogues and even some jokes are sometimes common and boring. Throughout the film, medieval elements and things from our time (miniskirts, fan clubs, automatic ladders etc.) intentionally intersect and blend. The film also tried to introduce some Disney- style musical moments, but I have some doubts about whether or not it was a good idea.Anne Hathaway, still very young here, excels in her character, adorable and yet full of personality. Hugh Dancy was a satisfactory Prince, the same could be said of Aidan McArdle and Joanna Lumley, who played supporting characters. Cary Elwes was a predictable, weak and rather risible villain, but I think it's the bad idealization of the character and not the actor himself.Overall, this movie is worth it if you just want to laugh a little or spend an hour and a half with family in a nice way. However, if you are looking for a cinematographic work of art, this film is not for you.",Ella Enchanted
18,matthewssilverhammer,"Take note, Shrek...",8,17 July 2018,"THIS is how you do an anachronistic fairytale send-up.

19,lisafordeay,I wasn't enchanted with this one at all but I do have a soft spot for it,5,28 September 2010,"I used to have this on DVD and I thought it was going to be fun and enjoyable like Disney's Enchanted which was outstanding but when I watched this film It was somewhat of a mixed bag for me.Based on a book the story is about a young woman named Ella(Anne Hathaway) who has a spell cast on her as an infant by her fairy godmother Lucinda. So she goes off on a journey meets a handsome prince named Char(Hugh Dancy)who doesn't know that she is under some spell so he agrees to help her find the fairy godmother. She then meets some elf who wants to be a lawyer (Aiden McArdle)who also helps her find the godmother.The only good thing I liked was the Somebody to Love song which is sung by Anne Hathaway who was a great sing. The rest was ok but I hated the part where Ella nearly kills Char. Hugh Dancy was cute as the charming prince Char who falls in love with Ella, Joanna Lumley as the stepmother was so annoying her accent was really annoying. The ugly step sisters were irritating they were like nerds from high school(no offense)and the charcthers weren't fun or exciting at all i'd rather sit down and watch Enchanted then this pile of crap.The ending where she marries Char was alright but the big number in the end was cheesy.5/10",Ella Enchanted
20,smatysia,Surprisingly cute,7,14 July 2009,"It seems that many, many commentators disliked this movie because it wasn't at all like the book. Fair enough, I suppose, but movies seldom are. In any case, I haven't read that book, and was blissfully unaware that this film was supposedly adapted from one. I found it surprisingly cute. Many of the campy things hit the mark, like the ""medeival modern"" anachronistic setting, reminiscent of The Flintstones cartoon wherein it was filled with modern things constructed from prehistoric materials; and the modern songs transposed to the time setting herein. That last was a bit like Moulin Rouge, which annoyed me at first, but then grew on me. I don't believe that I've seen this Anne Hathaway before, but she is intriguing. Her vivacity and wide smile remind me a bit of Julia Roberts. Can't say that I was much impressed with Hugh Dancy or Aiden McArdle. Minnie Driver was most charming as the incompetent fairy, and Vivica Fox was quite amusing as the lush fairy. It's too bad that Parminder Nagra's part was so small, as she always lights up a screen. And Cary Elwes couldn't hide his amusement with the material as he munched on the scenery. I say check this out, if you aren't going to throw a fit over the book.",Ella Enchanted
21,davispittman,Magical family fun!,8,25 April 2017,"Anna Hathaway's Ella enchanted is a delightful slice of family oriented fun that just about anyone can enjoy. Anne Hathaway was a great choice to play Ella, she's innocent and radiates kindness and has a very fairytale like essence to her. Hugh Dancy is a great prince, I'll be honest and say that I don't know whether I would've liked another actor better, he was good, but i don't know that he was the best choice. Hathaway is different because she was for sure the best choice, I don't think anyone else could've played Ella like she did. Vivica A. Fox is here too, she plays the Lucinda, the fairy that gave Ella the ""gift"" of obedience when she was a baby. All the cast does a good job with their roles and they enhance the film overall. The script is pretty well written, it achieves what it sets out to do and it keeps you interested, especially with the scenes where Ella and Char are together. They both have good natural romantic chemistry and the script provides them with good dialogue. The set designs are commendable and they are very appealing to look at, the same goes for the costumes. The movie has its moments of heart and romance, humor, and it's times of adventure. 8/10 for Ella enchanted. Great pick for a family movie night!",Ella Enchanted

23,invisibleunicornninja,A bit funny.,6,8 April 2018,"The only thing that this movie really has going for it is that its a bit funny, though a lot of the humor is pretty cheap and unoriginal. The story is poorly executed, partially due to the random bits of narration and the over reliance of characters being dumb. The acting is ok. Some of the actors are terrible, a lot of them are pretty bad. There are a lot of obvious green screens in this movie. The set designs and costumes and effects aren't that great.

While channel surfing Hathaway's fresh looks caught my eye and she does have a very pleasant and natural screen presence. But this one has more than that going for it - simple script and plot, other attractive stars, Elwes (didn't he used to be a good guy?) mugging it up as the villain. The few musical/dancing numbers are wonderful, almost magical they're so good. No playing down to the kids with a wink to the adults, it's just straightforward teen fantasy fun. And there's a lot to be said for that, I'm sick of most of the other stuff.",Ella Enchanted
25,gkeith_1,The snake stole the show.,10,30 March 2009,"Don't judge a movie on a book. The movie is made to sell tickets. That said, here are my comments: My friends and I discuss Cinderella movies and plays. We know they are different from each other. I have even bookmarked the YouTube 1957 TV Cinderella starring a young Julie Andrews. We talk about the 1997 Drew Barrymore ""Ever After"". I notice that Ella in Ella Enchanted is somewhat tough and strong, like Drew in Ever After. The stepsisters are always stupid and dumb, with the second one always dumber than the first. This reminds me of a ballet Cinderella I saw, where the stepsisters were played by tall men with long dresses. It was hilarious. Did I mention how much I like Disney's cartoon Cinderella? That was just divine.The 1957 stepsisters were hilarious, too. They were jealous and envious of Cinderella. They tried to be courted by the prince, but only ended up acting dumb, dumber and dumbest. When the prince saw Cinderella, he dropped the stepsister (with whom he was dancing) like last week's old garbage.I liked the Cinderella movie with Brandy. That was sweet, with an interracial theme. I feel that all of the characters worked well.Ahem! Back to Ella Enchanted. I liked Hugh Dancy in ""Evening"", where he played a drunk, happy-go-lucky American wastrel, son of a rich New England family. He was cuter than ever in Evening. In Ella, he is a charming Charmont.I liked Ella Enchanted. You must take each movie for what it is, and do not compare it to a book. Books cannot be made true on the screen. Changes must be made for production purposes. Character additions are the prerogative of the screenwriters and directors. I liked the snake and Sir Edgar in Ella. I felt that they helped carry the movie.A lot of Ella-movie haters hate all girl-movies, anyway. They think that Shrek or Harry Potter are the only good things, or even Lord of the Rings and that type of male-favorite schlock. As for myself, I always stand up for fairytale movies -- the more female-oriented, the better. Girl movies don't seem to make the gigantic b.o. successes as do some of this masculine drivel that I discussed at the top of this paragraph. Here's to more Cinderella movies!!!!",Ella Enchanted
26,natashabowiepinky,An Ella of a good time!!!,7,5 February 2013,"One of those films with a little something for everything, it is Shrek-like in its satirical depiction of fairytale life but also doesn't forget to weave an interesting enough tale to keep us captivated. Anne Hathaway is luminous in the lead role, and this is ably supported by a mostly British cast of thespians who all add something to what is a rich and varied tale. Whether its the musical intermissions, the subtle jokes or the many funny ways Ella's curse is utilised, it just all works... And it is indeed an 'enchanting' film. It is also very different from the book on which its based, which is a nice change. So you can indulge in both!!",Ella Enchanted
27,TheNorthernMonkee,rare moments of joy don't save this weak story from feeling distinctively amateur,4,16 August 2005,"SPOILERS Fairy tales help us feel good about life. Often changed beyond belief from their original style (just look at Disney's alterations to multiple different classics), they make you smile and forget the real world for a while. It's particularly inappropriate then for Eric Idle's narrator to literally tell you to get back to reality. Telling the story of 'Ella Enchanted', Idle is just one of many flaws with this predictable and vomit inducing film. Possessing few moments of true pleasure, the story is average and feels incredibly amateur. Badly shot, often badly acted (a shock considering some of the names on the cast sheet) and always awkward, you do wonder why you finish with a smile on your face.As a baby, Ella (Anne Hathaway) is given a particularly awful present by a self absorbed fairy (Vivica A Fox). Unable to turn down a request, Ella finds that everything in her life revolves around doing the commands of others. Increasingly frustrated by two awful step sisters (Lucy Punch and Jennifer Higham) and their demands, Ella decides to put an end to this once and for all. Setting off to find the fairy, Ella's adventures are just beginning.This is the first time that this particular viewer has seen Anne Hathaway perform on screen (having avoided 'The Princess Diaries') and it's not difficult to see why many like her. The perfect Hollywood starlet with a wide smile and an almost constant air of 'cute', Hathaway is yet another of these up and coming beautiful women. It's a shame therefore that she's also an awful actress. Doing the typical blowing the hair in a 'oh no' sort of way every time she is ordered to do something, Hathaway's style is hardly the most diverse. At the same time though, she's hardly given a helping hand by her supporting cast and a dreadful story.To possess a cast including Eric Idle, Jimi Mistry, Jim Carter, Cary Elwes and Joanna Lumley, you'd expect some better performances. Whilst Carter and Lumley are blatantly out for a laugh and seem to enjoy themselves, others including Elwes and Idle are truly dreadful. Singing everything in rhyme, Idle really should view this as a mistake to remove from his c.v. He strolls around in different outfits and he never looks comfortable. It's almost like the poor man is using the film as a vehicle to show himself to a younger audience. Bad choice there Eric, you're doing yourself no favours with this film.Predictable from the outset, a sick bucket is a useful companion if you want to watch this. The worst part about this is that these moments often occur just when you've witnessed a rare funny moment or a decent satire of society. For example, one minute you get Hathaway telling Hugh Dancy's Prince Char (obviously changed to make him look more hip and to avoid any references to the current British monarchy) that he has a responsibility to do particular actions for the good of his kingdom, and then the next you find her singing and dancing for what feels like an eternity. It's just so dumb and pointless.Without trying to really destroy the whole fairy tale aspect of the story, let's just point out that you just know that there will be a porn equivalent out of this film within a short space of time. Here's a cute girl who does whatever she's told, and yet with the exception of one moment when Cary Elwes tells her to touch her toes and he stands behind her grinning, you never sense any sort of sexuality about it. There would be teenage boys pointing this out and making countless rude comments, although lets be honest, most are probably out having a better time than watching this garbage.Another problem, and the final real criticism (promise) of this film, is that more often than not, it feels like it has actually been filmed and put together by a bunch of toddlers. Obscure camera zoom modes (feeling stolen from an Alanis Morrisette video), weird use of colours, woeful soundtrack, the entire film just feels incredibly amateur in design and completion. This is one of Tommy O'Haver's few films and true-fully it feels like it. The man has screwed up major with this shambles and the sooner Hollywood stops offering him work, the better.It's perhaps fitting to make a nod at the films aims and the horrifying fact that on one front, they succeeded with honours. This, for all intense purposes, is an awful, awful creation. Rarely entertaining, vomit inducing and badly made, it really should feature on any persons 'most hated' list. That is, except that for whatever evil reason, you DO find yourself smiling at the end. You know you shouldn't, and by all the laws of the universe, it should be an impossibility, so how does this happen? It's tough to explain really. Perhaps deep down, we all just like to see mindless dross with a happy ending. From an analytical point of view, as viewers you should finish the film wanting to put all those who made it on trial for crimes against humanity, so please stop smiling.'Ella Enchanted' is a dire waste of time. Badly acted, badly written, badly films, vomit inducing and mindless drivel, the film has very little going for it. For some reason though, and against all natural law, you can't help but smiling after it. You probably should be locked in a mental institution for that fact, but sadly the doctors were smiling too.",Ella Enchanted
28,brookenichole-98054,This movie is insane!,9,31 March 2020,"Ella Enchanted is crazy and fun. The fantasy is definitely there as the movie moves along. The story is one crazy thing after another. Many situations Ella and her friends are put in are very out there. There's romance added in which wasn't terrible but I found myself laughing a lot at how bad the acting could get.
Anne Hathaway was great as Ella. Hugh Dancy not so much. I have seen him act better in other movies. The songs in the film are alright nothing too amazing. I didn't understand the need for a musical sequence twice but it's PG.
I would say watch this because it's fun and you could get a great laugh out of it.",Ella Enchanted
29,Mightyzebra,A very good adaptation of a book.,7,26 December 2007,"Unlike a lot of films based on books, this one is incredibly good, not only true to the book in quite a few ways! Of course, there are a few things changed from the book, but perhaps for the better. :-) A wee baby called Ella has an unusual gift bestowed on her by her fairy godmother. This is the gift of obedience, which is actually much worse than it sounds! Anything that anyone tells Ella to do, she must do it, even horrible things! This makes her life much different compared to other children...Funny when necessary, gripping in good times and slightly scary in others, ""Ella Enchanted"" is a well-done film. All set in a fairytale style, this film is sure to delight a good few people, ranging from quite young children to adults. Enjoy ""Ella Enchanted""! :-)",Ella Enchanted

This to the delight of her evil half-sisters...One day she sets out to have that spell undone, meanwhile winning the heart of prince Char and gaining new friends in the form of elfs and giants.It's all jolly and friendly (read: boring), and I would advise against everybody above the age of 16 to watch this (except perhaps for fans of Hathaway or anybody else from the cast full of stars).4/10.",Ella Enchanted
31,bopdog,Great for tweeners and young teens. Mediocre for adults.,7,4 January 2005,"I had read that this movie was similar to 'The Princess Bride'--- and it might be. That's why I saw it, anyway. 'Ella' was different to me--- not quite as smug and self-congratulatory as the earlier movie. Not quite as appealing to adults either, however. 'Ella Enchanted' was well done from a technical standpoint-- bright, coherent, watchable, etc. But the plot was lame, and many of the leads were so annoying (think Strawberry Shortcake meets Justin Timberlake), that during the first hour I often felt the urge to walk out. I stayed, though, and the latter portion improved.I was initially dissatisfied with 'Ella', but then thought, Hey-- it's a kids' movie. Tweeners and younger adolescents will probably identify with it, and enjoy it. So, for what it is, a movie for younger audiences, I gave it a 7 out of 10. For general audiences, however (meaning, for adults), it is probably more accurately a 5 out of 10. But that lower rating would be mean spirited, so the 7 sticks.",Ella Enchanted

33,christian123,A sweet and charming movie,3,29 March 2005,"Ella Enchanted is a charming film that's good for the whole family. In this storybook fairy tale gone wrong, Anne Hathaway plays Ella, a girl given the magical gift of ""obedience"" by her fairy godmother at birth which turns into a curse because she can't refuse any command, even from those who abuse this fact. To try to regain control of her life, Ella goes on a quest to get the ""gift"" removed, meeting ogres and giants and a dreamy prince (Hugh Dancy) along the way. The plot sounds stupid but the movie is a lot better then I expected it to be. Its hard to take the film serious at some points though and sometimes its not exactly clear what the plot is. I have never read the book so I can't compare but my friend said that they change a lot of things. The cast, for the most part, is pretty good with the best being Anne Hathaway but she needs to start picking different roles to avoid being a typecast. I thought the acting from Hugh Dancy was horrible and it would have been better if they would have gone with someone else. Vivica A. Fox, Cary Elwes and Minnie Driver all have small roles and all do good job. The film is of course cheesy at some parts and all the gimmickry can become annoying after awhile. The film is pretty predictable but that shouldn't turn you away .The film is only 96 minutes long so it isn't a real punishment to watch the film. There are some things about the movie that didn't make sense and there are also a lot of pointless characters that could have been used without. In the end I think kids will really like Ella Enchanted Rating 7/10 if you have never read the book then you have a better chance of enjoying it. However, if you have read the book then you will probably hate it {like my friend did} because they change a lot.",Ella Enchanted
34,daisukereds,"Well, that was.. interesting",6,1 September 2021,"A small child is ""blessed"" with a gift of obedience, and has to do what she is told.She goes on a small adventure to lift this curse, and also fix whatever affects the kingdom.For more than one reason, it reminded of Mel Brook's Robin Hood: Men in Tights.It feels kind of cheap and a bit rushed. But it is very well produced! In general, it's more cartoonish than expected, and has a highs chool movie drama feel. With interesting CGI (specially that great-looking snake for the early 2000), music set pieces, very good production design (the soldier's armors) and a rather scattered plot, it's enough to entertain.More than anything, the cast of known actors kept me interested. The roles given to the charming Hugh Dancy and the graceful Anne Hathaway weren't as bad. And Cary Elwes is always a treat! Even as a comical villain (which reminded me of Prince John from the animated Robin Hood Disney movie), he is always so good.Watch it if curious.. otherwise, you aren't really missing out much.",Ella Enchanted
35,Ddey65,"Delightful story, but kind of unsettling",6,5 April 2007,"This movie isn't the first time Eric Idle narrated a fairy tale. There was that sketch on Monty Python's Flying Circus, where he reads a series of them that turn out to be more scandalous than even he expects. This time he narrates a tale by Gail Carson Levine(sort of), which is somewhat of a re-write of Cinderella, The Wizard of Oz, and a few other fairy tales thrown in, along with the addition of female empowerment that those other tales lacked.When Ella of Frell was born, Lucinda Perriwhether, a fairy godmother who was a fair-weather friend of her mother's put her under a spell that made her automatically obedient, a convenience for her parents, but not so good for Ella herself. Her mom(Donna Dent), and other godmother Mandy(Minnie Driver), both of which are amateur fairy godmothers know this, and try to get her to take it back. Unfortunately, Lucinda refuses and threatens to turn her into a squirrel(something she enjoys doing), so they let her keep it. This gave her plenty of problems in life, and the older she got, the more problems the spell gave her. Her mother never tells her about the ""gift"" until she's eight years old, and nobody but her, Lucinda, and Mandy know about it. Long after her mother dies, her father marries a shrew named Dame Olga(Joanna Lumley) with two teenage daughters, Hattie a manipulative bitch(Judy Punch), and Olive an idiotic kleptomaniac(Jennifer Higham).Lamia, the kingdom in which they live isn't exactly so ideal. It's ruled by the evil King Edgar, who has segregated Giants, Elves, and Ogres(although he may be right about the ogres), and Ella and her friend Areida(Parminder Nagra) are dead set against it. Still, most of the girls around her don't care, because his nephew Prince Charmont is apparently a dream-boy. And since he's part of the monarchy, Ella hates him even though he's nothing like the king. Hattie, who's the head of the Prince's fan club, realizes early into the entry of Ella's family that she and other people can control her for some reason. When Prince Char speaks in front of a crowd of swooning teenage girls, Hattie abruptly cancels Ella's anti-monarchist demonstration. When she stumbles upon the Prince and drops her purse, he makes her stay in the middle of the road while he retrieves it, and almost gets hit by a horse-drawn wagon, only to be rescued by the prince. When her evil step-sisters force her to shoplift and get her to blame it on her best friend, she realizes she has no other choice but to but to find the old fairy godmother to try to get her to reverse that spell. Luckily Mandy has Benny, an old boyfriend she accidentally turned into a book, who can help her find Lucinda... sort of. A few clues later reveals that the woman is somewhere in Giantville, and Ella and the Benny-book are off.On their way to Giantville, she comes across an elf named Slannen, being hassled by some peasants. After she rescues him, he joins her on her journey. Thanks to the king, all elves are forced to sing and dance for humans, and this elf is dead set against doing so. He wants to be a lawyer. They also comes across some ogres who try to eat them, despite her push for their re-integration, and Prince Char comes to her rescue again. Slannen makes her invite him to come along, since Lamia is on the way. Upon arrival, the prince finds that the giants are used as slaves, and after some coaxing by Ella to lend them his ears, he finds that many of the giants, ogres, elves, and other non-humans have good reason to be upset with the royal family.The highlight, of course is Anne Hathaway's cover of Queen's 1976 hit ""Somebody To Love,"" which she only sings when commanded to by some giants who fail to get Slannen to do so. Slannen falls in love with a giantess named Brumhilda, played by Heidi Klum. And believe it or not, some of the other giant girls are even cuter, but that's besides the point. It seems that both think the myth of how each species are supposed to act began with the Brothers Grimm. In the meantime, Prince Char offers to let Ella spend some time in the hall of records to look for Lucinda. As you can expect, they fall in love after all. But Sir Edgar has other plans for the prince. And when he finds out about Ella's ""condition"" through Hattie, he uses her against the beloved Char. Being that this is a fairy tale, you can probably guess what kind of ending to expect. The operative word in that sentence being ""probably."" As enjoyable as this movie is, when I read about fans on the book who complain about the movie's apparent misinterpretation of it, I find it disturbing. I'm not saying they're not right(because I'm not one to judge), I'm just saying they're harsh. Moreso than critics of the adaptations of ""Maniac Magee,"" and ""The Power of One."" This is the unsettling part. Like so many storybooks, this was was rewritten for the silver screen, perhaps too rewritten for some people. I also wondered if Sir Edgar's talking pet snake Heston(Scott Grimes) was the true evil behind the King's agenda, especially since he's got statues of himself in some parts of the castle. Sure, the use of 20th Century pop-hits are an extraordinary anachronism, but that can be easily forgiven. And if you can forgive that, you shouldn't have as much of a problem with the rest of the movie. So I say, give it a try whether you've read the original book or not.",Ella Enchanted

She is so charming and likable that you are willing to go along with her on this journey.  Now if only the movie was not so uneven.  It tries to cram too much into this movie.  Most of the supporting actors are either not funny, such as the obnoxious Joanna Lumley as the (yawn) wicked stepmother and her equally unfunny stepsisters, or wasted such as Minnie Driver and Vicia A Fox.  Despite the similarities, this is not as good as either Shrek movie. Some jokes work, but most misfire.  Ella is supposed to be an obedient person because of a spell that was put on her when she was a child.  She goes searching for her fairy godmother to reverse the curse.  Unfortunately, the movie does not turn into the adventure expected.  It goes back and forth with misunderstandings and evildoers with messages of empowerment and tolerance squeezed.

Special-effects wise the film is okay and most of the characters serve their purpose well in the over-all story.What I can't stand are the films refusal to dedicate itself to either comedy or drama.

41,lyubitelfilmov,"""Hilarious"" mockery of a poor girl, or Three funny horses: stupidity, absurdity and delirium",5,4 January 2021,"Fantasy, comedy. A screen adaptation of the novel of the same name by American writer Gail Carson Levine. After the New Year and Christmas pictures, I decided to take a little rest, and decided to watch a few films with a charm and charm, or simply, the beautiful Anne Hathaway, and the first in line was this fantasy comedy, which I looked at a certain time ago. And here's my brief opinion - Three funny horses: stupidity, absurdity and delirium. I confess that at the tenth minute I wanted to turn it off, but I restrained myself with an incredible effort of will, so now you have to listen to what I have to say about the pros and cons of this star-and-striped film.
So the pros:
1. Anne Hathaway - the whole picture rests exclusively on her. She pleases with her acting and her efforts are visible, unlike most of the participants. And the script is simple here - another variation of my favorite fairy tale ""Cinderella"" in a magical world with a mixture of classic fantasy and American modernity. The heroine has one moment - namely, the curse of ""obedience"", which turns her life into a real nightmare. In the frame, she looked great, and the role is suitable. Sincerity, courage, kindness - she succeeds in everything, and her cute expression cannot be put anywhere. A real diamond of this soulless creation.
2. The Wizarding World - as I said earlier - is a mixture, and quite good, but if you don't look closely. Because it is extremely difficult to combine such things. I was very pleased with the references to popular culture, in particular to the American one. The topic of racism is even covered quite well, and it is not annoying, as in some other films.
So the cons:
1. ""The Curse of Ella"" is the reason for the very development of the script, it is also the source of problems, especially of a logical nature. It happens! I don't know how it was in the book of the same name (because I didn't read it), but in the picture itself it looks like that. Why do bad people forget at the right moment about the given weakness of the heroine? Why do those around them not notice this weakness, although it sticks out with the modesty of a lustful tenth grader? The question is rhetorical.
2. Humor - well, if you suddenly wanted to laugh here, then it is better to look in the mirror - there is much more funny, because you are clearly mistaken in the picture. It's just that the humor here lies in the fact that various bad people literally mock the poor girl, forcing her to do things against her own will and to her own detriment. Do you really want to laugh at this? After all, there is no more humor here at all, even though look for it with a magnifying glass or microscope.
3. Chromakey - squalor in one word. How could it have been released for hire, even in 2004?
4. Silly farce - a barely combined magical world plus humor, built on the humiliation of the main character, plus caricatured images from fairy tales and fantasy with grimacing actors add up to what? That's right - a stupid farce that cannot even cause a smile. Even a distant shadow of a smile, even a distant one. It's a pity to be honest.
A little about the main characters:
1. Ella from Frell, played by Anne Hathaway, is a kind and honest, and also a beautiful girl who must end the curse of ""obedience"" before this very curse ruins her. The heroine is clearly copied from Cinderella (which is not even hiding). I've already commended Ann for her acting and stuff. The only thing standing in this movie. Love you Ann!
2. Prince of Charms performed by Hugh Dancy - the future king of a magical land, meeting the beautiful Ella on his way. Naive, brave, hot plus and not stupid in appearance. A classic prince from fairy tales, what is there to hide. Nothing interesting. Hugh played at an average level, and it was not really that, and to be honest. Everything was decided by the appearance as - - no way!
3. Sir Edgar, played by Cary Elwes, is the guardian of Prince Char and his uncle, who is currently the ruler of the kingdom. Well, you understand, who is the bad man here? Come on, everything is already obvious, especially from the very first appearance in the frame. Carey here clearly enjoyed the role, and it shows. Well, at least the person was happy, unlike the audience.
This movie failed miserably at home and worldwide. There he is dear, for trash work ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, comrades is trash.
I hope that the next picture with Ann doesn't disappoint like this one.
As a result, we have a bad fantasy comedy with the charming Anne Hathaway, without humor, without normal fantasy, with bad acting, terrible chroma key, which turned into a silly farce.
I pull the grade up to average only for the adorable Ann.
My rating is 5 out of 10 and I do not recommend this picture for viewing!",Ella Enchanted

Now she cannot refuse any request or instruction, no matter from whom they come. Having grown up, Ella goes in search of the treacherous Lucinda to free herself from the spell. Whoever she meets on the way: elves, orcs, and giants. And how can you outwit them, having such a trait?",Ella Enchanted
44,TheSeaLion,Generic,4,21 September 2014,"""Ella Enchanted"" is the kind of kids movie that, if you're older and have kids or younger siblings, you can sit down and watch it with them, they'll enjoy it and you can just forget it afterward. For a kids movie, it's not unbearably stupid, nor does it treat kids like they don't have brains, it's just a very generic kids fairy-tale movie filled with simplistic, one-dimensional villains, musical numbers, goofy side-characters, and an obvious love story.Ella of Frell (Anne Hathaway) is is given the gift of obedience by the fairy Lucinda (Vivicia A. Fox) and must keep her gift secret so people can't use it against her. After Ella's mother (Donna Dent) passes away, her father (Patrick Bergin) remarries several years later to Dame Olga (Joanna Lumley), Ella's generic evil stepmother, who has two daughters who are Ella's generic evil stepsisters, Hattie (Lucy Punch) and Olive (Jennifer Higham). The two stepsisters discover Ella's gift of obedience and use it to make her life miserable, forcing her to steal from a mall and get rid of her best friend (Parminder Nagra). Ella, ventures out to find Lucinda to take back her gift, with the help of her house fairy Mandy's (Minnie Driver) boyfriend Benny (Jimi Mistry) whom Mandy has accidentally turned into a book, Slannen (Aidan McArdle), an elf who wants to be a lawyer, and Prince Char (Hugh Dancy), whom Ella is at first repulsed by because she believes he is like his evil uncle Edgar (Cary Elwes). As they search for Lucinda, Ella and Char begin to fall in love with one another and Edgar, learning of Ella's obedience, hopes to use her in his plan to assassinate Char before he can claim the throne.The villains of the film are all generic, one-dimensional characters that we have already seen before. Edgar is the evil uncle who wants to rule the kingdom who has killed his brother and now wants his nephew out of the picture, like Scar (Jeremy Irons) from ""The Lion King"". Then, we have the mean stepmother and stepsisters who treat Ella poorly, like with the stepmother and stepsisters from ""Cinderella"". While the main characters are given a little more to their characters than just a generic character-type, it doesn't always lead anywhere. Slannen says he wants to be a lawyer and that he does not sing. He has one quick moment where he acts like a lawyer, but in the last scene of the movie he is singing when he has made it clear he doesn't want to sing or perform.The two main musical numbers that I remember being performed in the movie, Elton John and Kiki Dee's ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" and Queen's ""Somebody to Love"" serve no purpose to the actual story. They aren't like the songs you would get in a Disney movie where they are used to further the plot, these songs bring the movie to a screeching halt. It feels like these songs are in the movie for two reasons: 1. Because it's a kid's movie and kid's movies need musical numbers in it, and 2. To show off Anne Hathaway's singing. Now, Anne Hathaway is a talented singer and she does a fantastic job in this movie, especially with ""Somebody to Love"", but that does not dismiss that these songs are pointless to the overall movie and bring the movie to a standstill.At the end of the movie, Ella breaks the spell of obedience by looking at herself in a mirror and telling her to no longer be obedient. For the whole run of the movie, I was questioning why neither her mother or Mandy the household fairy told her to not be obedient to anyone ever again, which would have solved the whole movie within the first ten minutes. I find it very hard to believe that no one in Ella's family thought of this idea for all the years that she had the curse.""Ella Enchanted"" is a movie that the best way to describe it would be generic. It's not terrible, but it does not stand out when it comes to the long list of kid's fairy tale movies that exist. It has the regular love story that you can see coming from a mile away, simplistic villains with no depth or charm to them who are just made as evil as possible so you hate them and like the heroes more in comparison, goofy side-characters, musical numbers, and all the other stuff you'd expect to find in a kid's movie. Once again, it's perfectly acceptable for kids. While generic and simplistic, it does treat kids like they have a brain and if you have kids or a younger sibling, you can watch with them and forget about it when it's done without feeling like you've lost brain cells.",Ella Enchanted
45,quiqueperezsoler,Wasted potential. Not faithful to the book but too random and dumbed down to make the best out of the good premise,6,14 April 2020,"I have a high tolerance for light, cheesy and cliched teen movies but I always feared the day I'd have to draw the line. There are so many reasons this movie should work: the well casted actors and especially lead actress Anne Hathaway who by that time was one of the most popular female leads after her breakthrough in The Princess Diaries, an although loosely adapted version of the book that lended it its name, interesting premise and subplots keeping some of the more interesting aspects of its source material; and finally, the good-hearted attempt at inserting more layers and messages to the overall story through the characters.However, the movie fails in so many aspects. Granted the CGI and special effects of the time were bound to age badly given the initial budget of the movie, but that could have been overlooked if it weren't for the dumbed down dialogues and interactions amongst the characters. The over the top performances of the villains, the heroes and the creatures never feel charming but rather odd and misplaced as the constant pop culture references make this fantasy world really hard to ""believe"".Yellow cabs, woden escalators, malls, fan clubs, alcohol controls... The setting looked like a cheap amusement park ""fantasy land"" ride meets New York City, teen fan clubs and birthday parties with bouncy castles (bouncy castles... in a fantasy land filled with Castles). The movie fails at trying to imitate Shrek's far far away land that succesfully merges pop culture into the fantasy world but never overstays its welcome. Not to mention the bursting into musical numbers all of a sudden which serve nothing to the story and that halts the movie very damagingly.But ignoring the inconsistencies and looking at its entertainment value, there are so many things going on for it, so many moments where there's something interesting that makes use of the premise's potential of an always obeying girl (like the ending betrayal, that's the sort of potential the premise had but never exploited).The book it's very vaguely based on has so many interesting themes from which to draw from but others that are actually quite unoriginal and copied from other stories. And the most frustrating part is that this film brings new ideas and alterations to the story that actually improves it but they are overshadowed by over the top performances, cheap humor and very obvious costume make up. It is a waste of potential of the production value of a high budgeted film which's quality reminisces of direct-to-video movies.IN CONCLUSION, the movie it's a great watch for very young kids because it has great themes and messages in some moments. But it's a very unfortunately badly executed film because it wastes the star cast and the premise's potential opting for a, there's actually no better term to describe it, ""dumbed down"" version of a fantasy story. It was not meant to be taken too seriously but neither does it evoke that charmful, heartwarming and heartfelt cheesy experience that make teen movies so endearing.",Ella Enchanted
46,TheArgentWolf,Could've been better,8,16 December 2004,"I saw this film recently, and contrary to what I expected, it was really good. I went to the premiere, expecting it to be a babyish film, when in fact it was for all ages. I think Anne Hathaway should step away from her more stereotypical fairytale movies (i.e. Ella Enchanted, The Princess Diaries) because they're getting old. I think that Lucy Punch's character was far too annoying for me to like this film a lot, but I thought Jennifer Higham's character was really sweet (Well, as sweet as an ""ugly sister"" could be.) As usual with her performances, I thought Joanna Lumley was hilarious. Two other strong performances in this film were Minnie Driver and Hugh Dancy. Minnie Driver, in particular, was brilliant. However, I do think they could have picked a more attractive person to play Char.The scenery and set and general plot of the whole movie was good though, and I may invest in the book version to see how much has been changed.All in all, I do think there are things that this film could have done that would make it better, including better casting.",Ella Enchanted
47,bonniejoy-978-68763,Hollywood Messed Up,3,7 March 2016,"The story of Ella Enchanted, according to the book is a gorgeous Medieval version of Cinderella where a girl named Ella gets cursed to be an obedient child. When I read this story I fell in love with it for it's timelessness, characters, the story itself, the conflicts, and the creatures of the land.The story of Ella Enchanted, according to the movie is a hip modern, pop cultural retelling of the Medieval story of a girl named Ella who gets cursed to be an obedient child. When I saw the movie I did not see Ella Enchanted in almost any way other than the main character's forced to be obedient, there are fantasy creatures, she falls in love with Prince Char, and is under her step mother and step sisters. So as you can see, there is already a bucketload of wrong with this movie. First off, the story was suppose to be timeless and fantastic, and this movie stole other movie references, pop songs, added fangirls, modern inventions, modern clothes (for the giants), and the dialogues were very dated. All of that caused the atmosphere of the movie to be way too dated and less magical and whimsical. Also adding onto that, the jokes are a groan fest, because they've been done to death. Most of them consist of giant puns, farts, nut shots, and modern jokes that have nothing to do with the story. In fact, if you cut those jokes out, you're not missing anything. Second, the story is i the same clichéd pattern: Girl has problem, she has controlling enemies, girl meets guy, hates him, she sets out to prove herself, gains allies, guy saves girl, they start falling in love, something separates them, love saves her from curse, epic battle (or not as epic in this movie's case), villain's (not) death, they marry, and happy ending. Forgetting that the original story was not like that at all, there are more clever ways to make the story work, but this movie doesn't try hard enough.Third, this movie tries to make Ella a strong female lead, which I'm all for, but this movie shows how much she really needs a man. Think about it, she has to be saved twice by Prince Char, and it is only through the power of love that she finally breaks her curse, something she was clearly not capable of as a kid. It feels like the movie's saying, ""Just remember kids, you need a man in order to break your curse."" If you want a story where a man doesn't save the day I would suggest watching Mulan, Frozen, or just reading the book Ella Enchanted. Those stories did not have to rely on falling in love with a man to make the story interesting, epic, or inspiring. I'm not against men saving the day, unless it is botching one of the most original stories or if it is done in the most clichéd and lazy way, which is exactly what this movie did. Also by focusing on Ella's strong character trait, it causes her to have no real character development. I think this is one of the reasons people aren't too fond of Anne Hathaway as an actress, because despite that she tries to everything she can to make her characters interesting most of them still wind up being bland, sappy and way too perfect. I don't blame her, but I blame the writers.Fourth, the forced villains. Honestly, the king killing his nephew Prince Char not only had nothing to do with the original story, but was entirely pointless. It only served to make the story juicier. I'm pretty sure a girl struggling to fight her curse and her step family is enough to fill a plot. By adding the villain Ella Enchanted became two different stories smashed together: the story of Ella cursed with obedience and the lazy story version of Prince Caspian. Even the author knew how to make her story interesting without having to rely on Hollywood clichés, why couldn't this movie do that?I have not mentioned all lazy faults of this movie, but these are some of the basic sins of the movie. Compared to the book itself, the film takes a backseat from originality and from being a masterpiece. I encourage you to read the book. It is a lovely Cinderella-like story, not just with a real strong female lead with real character development, a gorgeous setting, and a magical feel to the story.",Ella Enchanted
48,HBeachBabe,A cute fantasy,7,14 June 2004,"Boy, I'm glad I saw this movie before reading the comments here.  I found this film to be delightfully funny and sweet.  sure it's utter predictable but so what?  Yes, in the 'fractured fairy tale' department it's a far cry from the genius of Princess Bride or Shrek, but it's an entertaining enough 90 minutes.  The effects are decent (they can't all be Lord of the Rings perfect) and I found myself laughing frequently.  I'm certainly glad I was completely unaware that this was based on a book as most of the negative comments here seem to be from people who complain about changes.  I can say, that not knowing the original, this story flowed just fine.  Certainly, if one were to over-analyze the plot one could come up with innumerable ideas based on the idea 'if she must always obey, why doesn't this happen?' but that's not really the point here is it?  it's a fairy tale for young girls.  My partner's 18 year old little sister (who made me watch this as I never would have on my own) loved it, and I had to admit that I liked it enough to give it a thumbs up 7 out of 10 rating.",Ella Enchanted
49,lethalweapon,Shrek-inspired Live Action comedy. Nicely done.,6,9 November 2012,"The protagonist, Ella, has been gifted/ cursed with obedience as she was a baby, by the woefully incompetent fairy godmother. All her life, she is forced to do things she doesn't want to/ mean to do simply because somebody told her to.She managed to grow up without serious issues, but now, her dad has remarried and given her two step-sisters, who just found out that they can manipulate her to do anything they want. She decides to go seek out her godmother and force her to take back her 'gift'. On the way, she meets up with the prince of the nation and his corrupt, power-hungry uncle. She also fights for the ogres, giants, elves and others who had been exiled by the kingdom by the villain.I would call it a Shrek-inspired live action movie. The plot is aimed at kids, but is fairly enjoyable throughout. You have Dr. Seuss-like prose used by the narrator, puns (the prince charming of this tale is called Prince Char), features inner references (Elves are not that short... It's just a myth propagated by the Grimm brothers, Ella is forced to steal some glass slippers, etc), and ripe with anachronisms (The story is set in medieval times, but shows a mechanical, manually operated escalator, references a magazine called 'Medeival Teens', has the prince going to inaugurate a mall, an anti-aging stew made of bat feces and something from oxen - called batox, etc...)Overall, it was enjoyable. The song and dance bits felt weirdly out of place, however.",Ella Enchanted
50,Scorching,Nothing enchanting about this,6,26 December 2004,There have been complaints of how some studios would target young audiences with less than sterling films. Well I guess this is one film that supports such a claim. First and foremost I thought the plot was sub-standard at best and lacked any originality. Just run-of-the-mill stuff for this movie. Where have we seen this plot line before? Yes I realize that this film was conceptualized to be a fairy tale but the filmmakers could have done something to spice things up.This movie was a disappointing comedy film. Again some of the stuff felt rather recycled. The dwarf who was supposed the scene stealing comic relief in this one was annoying more than anything.Anne Hathaway in earlier in her career was very charming and seemed like she would develop into a good actress. But as the months/films go by eventually you expect her to somehow graduate into more mature roles. Well based solely on this film she has yet break free from the image generated by her earlier films like The Princess Diaries. She is a good actress but I feel that if she continues to make films like this then she might be remembered more as just one of those stars who were unable to fulfill her potential.,Ella Enchanted
51,johnmichael-2,Surprisingly rewatchable,8,8 December 2007,"I have watched this movie at least a half-dozen times in the past few years. It is not high entertainment, and it's nowhere near my Favorites List, but it is really a charming little gem.The good things first: Anne Hathaway does wonderful in her role as Ella, and she and Hugh Dancy make a lovely couple, both before they begin to like each other AND after they begin to like each other. The artistry and set pieces do not strive for excellence, but they stick to a bright yet alluring simplicity. It's a fun movie to look at, and the special effects don't clog the screen.The storyline, too, is good. It's about a girl named Ella (Hathaway) who was been given a ""blessing"" of obedience, meaning she must do everything she is told to do (this, of course, leads the mind off in naughty direction, but I mustn't go there now). Naturally, she wants to get rid of it, so when she is forced to do something particularly nasty, she plucks up her resolve and goes to find the fairy who gave her the blessing in the first place. Of course, she runs into Prince Char along the way, as well as a colorful cast of characters.It's all great fun, and there's some tremendously funny lines. Ella's stepsisters, Hattie and Olive, deliver some of the biggest laughs, due Hattie's complete, air-headed nastiness and Olive's complete, air-headed stupidity. I can't bring myself to ruin any of their lines, but there are some fantastic ones.Now for the bad: The villain, Char's uncle King Edgar is the most stock, most cliché villain in all film history. It's like the writers didn't even try to make his character any good; in fact, it's as if they tried to make it purposely insipid and idiotic. Sure, all his actions were realistic and explainable, but he has to go off on his ""boasting-villian"" speeches (""The Incredibles"" calls it ""monologuing"", which is the perfect word for it). It is SO STOCK. SO Cliché.Another bad thing: If you read the book first, you will HATE HATE HATE HATE this film. You will loathe it. You will despise it with all your being. I was lucky enough to read the book after watching the film, and so I was able to see the two as entirely different works of art. Not only does the film think up a completely new plot for the premise of Gael Carson Levine's Newberry Honor novel, but it changes it from an extremely traditional fairy tale to a hip, tongue-in-cheek romp. It's not bad to have a ""modernized"" fairy tale, but it is jarringly different from the novel. I am lucky in that I have separate the two works in my mind, but if you have read the novel and haven't watched the film, it'll be very painful for you. I do suggest you read the book, however, if you can mentally break all ties it holds to its adaptation.In all, a fun movie, and very rewatchable, too. Perfect for the kids, and even a nice little guilty pleasure for the adults. There are better films out there, but this is in the upper percentile for modern family films.",Ella Enchanted
52,divyanka,Ella Enchanted - Very Entertaining for Audiences,8,13 February 2016,"Ella Enchanted is a creative movie based on the book by Levine. This story is partly based on classic Disney princess stories, including some aspects from Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella. The cast is well-chosen and there is a good amount of humour in the movie to keep the audience interested. The characters are also well-chosen and play their fantasy roles nicely.It is unfortunate that there are some inappropriate moments in this movie, such as certain phrases spoken, but these will not likely be understood by children or decent-minded people.I would give this movie a rating of 8/10. I feel that the main actress, playing the role of Ella, could have done a better job. Other than that, this is a movie that one cannot stop watching. Enjoy!",Ella Enchanted

Ella struggles in the beginning to cope with her gift. In a twist of fortune caused by her stepsister Ella meets Prince Charmont which would be the turning point of her life. Ella Enchanted manages to insert humor with enough character growth that even adults can enjoy, even if it is primarily directed for young girls. Ella becomes a wholly different person harboring contempt to the crown and becoming the land's queen upon her marriage to Prince Charmont. The rest of the cast also bring good performances. Hugh Dancy, as Prince Charmont, has great chemistry with Anne Hathaway.Ella Enchanted, however, is a poor film artistically. Fantasy films like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter showed how spectacular fantasy can be when done right and Ella Enchanted is not that good looking, owing to its low budget.For those willing to invest time with the film, they can still enjoy it but would yearn for something more.6/10",Ella Enchanted
55,CalvinValjean,"This Is an Awful Movie, and I'll Tell You Why...",4,29 September 2007,"I won't make outlandish statements like ""this is the worst movie I've ever seen"" because it's not, but this really was terrible, and I understand that it's supposedly nothing like the book. I haven't read it, and actually I thought the film's basic plot was inventive, but the execution was just atrocious on every level.I absolutely love The Princess Bride and Shrek, which are the two best of this fairy-tale satire genre, but this tried too hard to be like those that it felt like a cartoon. Every gag is stupid (there's a primitive hand-turned escalator in the market-place. Ho ho. What is this, The Flintstones? The girls in the village wear ""I Heart Prince Char"" tee-shirt and kiss the floor during a tour of the castle. The joke gets milked to death). Every performance is over-the-top (especially the two step-sisters). Anne Hathaway and Cary Elwes are two great actors and both are misused. Sir Edgar is an undeveloped villain, and the way he gets ""defeated"" is the most tacked-on resolution imaginable. The editing is for the most part disjointed.What exactly is the deal with Ella's father? Why does the mother never tell him that his own daughter is enchanted? Why is he never around? Him and Ella have about one scene together in the whole film. It seems to me they should've just killed him off early in the movie, since that's what happens in Cinderella anyway.Worst of all is a running gag where the characters keep singing anachronistic songs. The ""Somebody To Love"" sequence is fine, since Hathaway is actually good at it. But the ending, where the entire cast breaks into song with ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" just left me with my mouth open. It's like the filmmakers decided to go all A Knight's Tale/Moulin Rouge on the audience, except that in those movies the songs were worked into the story with feeling. Here it's like the characters jump out of the narrative and break into exaggerated dance moves that're totally out of character for them. Yes, Shrek could get away with that kind of goofiness, but that was a CARTOON. Most of Ella Enchanted feels like a cartoon, and maybe that's how it should've been made.Oh, and one last point about this trainwreck of a movie: why does the lovely Minnie Driver speak in an American accent? It's not like it really mattered considering half the characters did have British accents, and it was stupid to ""vulgarize"" her gorgeous voice that way.",Ella Enchanted

I am not a fan of Harry Potter at all but I do love fairy tale and fantasy movies with an appealing story and this sounded appealing to me. When I started watching it I was immediately drawn into a fantasy world with entertaining characters and knew I was not going to be disappointed. It does refer clearly to Cinderella at 1 point which is a good fairy tale. I think it contained pretty much all the fairy tale creatures I could wish for. As the movie does have many funny moments (or at least to me it was funny) it has kind of a Shrek feeling to it but the stories are pretty different. I can see similarities in the romance however between the lead characters. Shrek is great but I liked this one better which is mostly down to personal preference. I was glad that this movie was not anything like Harry Potter and I guess this was just used as a marketing stunt. That Anne Hathaway (who played her role magnificently as usual) did stop starring as Disney princess character was kind of sad.

60,astro_92,This movie makes me very happy!,10,8 June 2005,"Ella Enchanted is a sheer delight of a motion picture! It keeps me amused from start to finish. I've never read the book before but I don't think that doing it now would be necessary because the film has it all. Anne Hathaway, in my opinion, is a very gorgeous actress. The Ella character is so much like me: very friendly, entertaining, compassionate, honest, caring, lovable, romantic, cheerful, easygoing, cautious, responsible, helpful, sensitive, and dedicated. Her best friend, Areida, also displays these attributes and qualities.The other characters are also very interesting, particularly Ella's stepsisters, Hattie and Olive. Hattie is an insensitive young lady who is not very sweet at all. In other words, Hattie is very arrogant, pushy, selfish, jealous, impatient, manipulative, intolerant, ruthless, and over-demanding. The character of Olive is not as hateful as Hattie but she still takes advantage of Ella in any way that she possibly can. Also, Olive's adorable pigtails make her look like an over-sized toddler!The evil Sir Edgar character is played wonderfully by Cary Elwes, who plays an almost similar role in The Princess Bride (1987). Sir Edgar is very greedy, dishonest, egotistical, sadistic, overbearing, and impractical. He is not very bright either, but that's just how his character was written to be. If movies like these did not have villains then movies like these would not have plots.Ella Enchanted is truly a magnificent film for families to view together.

But I doubt it. People compare it to shrek. I get the similarity based on the employment of music and dancing. But story wise, it's use of clever paradox was more like ""princess bride,"" with nothing clever and a telegraphing of humor punchlines so intense I all but expected a laugh track.

64,fha-2,A Splendid Romp in Fairland,7,4 April 2004,"Given Hollywoodâ?Ts penchant for mean-spirited violent films, â?oElla Enchantedâ? is a refreshing frolic into imagination and fun.  The film is basically a spoof of Cinderella in which the title character Ella (Ann Hathaway of â?oPrincess Diariesâ? fameâ?), who has been stricken with a spell that compels her to be obedient to any command, spends her free time along with her cousin Mandy (Minnie Driver), protesting discriminatory practices against the kingdoms of elves and ogres.  She quickly becomes enmeshed with the soon-to-be-king, Prince Charmond (Hugh Dancy) who is unaware of the evil machinations of his uncle (Cary Elwes).  What Ella really wants is not love; instead, she wants to become free of the obedient spell that her evil stepmother and stepsisters have unreasonably exploited.In spite of the action taking place in a land hundreds of years ago, the tongue-in-cheek dialogue, and the music is very twenty-first century. Much of the shtick is quite humorous with scenes such as the ogres wearing their pants with the crack of their buttâ?Ts exposed like present-day gang members or your local plumbing contractor.  The film should not be taken too seriously.  It is just simple fun, with many so-so funny one-liners, and the opportunity to escape without being hammered by blood and guts.The film was adapted from the novel written by Gail Carson Levine and is directed by Tommy Oâ?THaver (â?oGet Over Itâ? and â?oBilly Holidayâ?Ts Screen Kissâ?).  The cast also includes Joanna Lumley (Absolutely Fabulousâ?), Eric Idle (Monty Pythonâ?) and Steve Coogan (â?o24 Hour Party Peopleâ?).  This little fairy tale wonâ?Tt win any academy awards, but itâ?Ts good clean fun set off by a really nasty and evil uncle you learn to hate rather early in the movie.  Unfortunately, Minnie Driverâ?Ts role is quite subordinate to Ellaâ?Ts and very little of her fine talent is exposed. Ella may seem a little too sweet, but she is feisty in her own right and delivers quite a nimble exhibition of retaliation against the wickedness of the kingdom.",Ella Enchanted
65,mysticwit,Disenchanting Musical Distractions,5,13 April 2004,"I really wanted to like this movie. A lot.  But whomever got involved in production dumped too much crap in it, too much singing and pop culture and it weighed it down, despite an otherwise good story.Anne Hathaway is enchanting and the enchantedly cursed girl who's forced to obey any orders directed at her.  When she tries to rid herself of the curse, she gets entangled in a princely plot.  Sounds like fun, but it keeps getting distracted.  It's got a fantastic cast, including Jimmy Mistry (<i>The Guru</i>), Hugh Dancy (<i>The Sleeping Dictionary</i>) Cary Elwes (<i>The Princess Bride</i>), Minnie Driver (what hasn't she been in?), Viveca Fox (<i>Soul Food, Independence Day</i>), Joanna Lumley (<i>Absolutely Fabulous</i>), Patrick Bergin (<i>Sleeping with the Enemy</i>)... it's even narrated by former python Eric Idle. Really, it should be quite fun.  But instead it's got so much singing and dancing the story gets lost, which is a shame, because it's a good story of a girl who's very goodness is used against her,  but still has to find a way to save the Kingdom and herself.I haven't read the Gail Carson Levine book, but I can only assume that with the three other writers listed on IMDB.COM, it's not only Tommy O'Haver's direction that's at fault.

66,kwongers,"Very enjoyable - funny, witty, smart, and definitely ""enchanting""",8,10 April 2004,"I have to agree with Roger Ebert (which I seldom do) on this one: `Ella Enchanted' is the best family film so far this year.  I liked it a lot.  The writing is smart and witty.  The setting is stylistic without feeling plastic-y.  The characters are daffy and very likable.
When she was a baby, Ella of Frell was given the `gift' (haha) of obedience by the fairy Lucinda.  Ella must do exactly as she is told, all the time. As she grows older, her gift (curse, really) poses problems when her widowed father remarries a snotty, stuck-up woman.  The woman has two stepdaughters who uncover Ella's secret gift and use it against her.  Ella finally decides to go out to find Lucinda and make her take back her gift.  Along the way, she campaigns for the rights of ogres, giants, and elves, and falls in love with a handsome prince.A plot like that leaves a lot of room for adaptation to the big screen. Now, I haven't read the book (so I can't say if the movie `lives up' to the book) but I will say that the screenwriters did a terrific job.  The script is often funny and very witty.  (One of the funniest scenes is when Ella is in the giants' bar and reacting to their orders of `sing', `put some soul into it,' and `dance'.you don't want to miss this scene!)  I also thought the pacing was excellent; I never felt bored and the movie lasted just the right amount of time.  The look of this movie is also delightful, refreshing and easy on the eyes.  Although everything is fairytale-like, from the buildings to the costumes, there is a sense of modernity that adds quirky style to the story.Despite the excellent writing and style, a movie like this can't succeed if we don't like the heroine, Ella.  Well, the movie does succeed wonderfully because Anne Hathaway, who plays Ella, is likable, intelligent, charming, and beautiful.  She is luminous with a big, funny smile.  Hathaway's sweetness is one of the reasons why we are so entertained by the movie. (Imagine if Hilary Duff, who is not likable, not charming, and not as beautiful, played Ella.  We'd probably wouldn't feel any sympathy for a ditzy, verbally-challenged, Hilary Duff version of Ella, and the movie would probably be awful.)Another reason this movie is so successful is its wealth of supporting characters.  Prince Charmont (Hugh Dancy) is handsome, sweet, and also ver y likable.  Dancy's chemistry with Hathaway is quite something to behold; these are two people so likable and sweet that we want very much for them to be together.  Also adding to the delightful daffiness of the plot are Slannen the Elf (Aiden McArdle), Benny the Talking Book (Jimi Mistry), the evil Prince Edgar (Cary Elwes), his talking snake Heston, the household fairy Mandy (Minnie Driver), and Ella's two stepsisters Hattie and Olive. Although Hathaway is the clear star of the movie, the supporting characters add a real emotional depth to the story.Music is also a pretty big part of this movie and it works to a large extent, jazzing the movie up and inspiring the characters.  This is a really great movie; I think anyone - children and adults - would like it a lot. You'll have a ball.",Ella Enchanted

68,Gloryous,Hugh Dancy steals the hearts of women young and older,10,20 February 2006,"I just happened to rent this movie on a whim. It turned out to be a very refreshing spin on the old fairytale of girl meets prince and falls in love. The story is different and exciting, and the prince is very charming, and very handsome. I must have watched this movie over and over for about 10 days. The story is for kids, but the romance and the charm of the movie is for any age. I loved the music and Anne Hathaway of Princess Diaries has a fabulous singing voice. She belted out a song by Queen that was just so awesome. The music was fun and made me want to learn the words, the story just was so cool. It combined many fairy tales into one, and made a delightful combination. Hugh Dancy I had seen in Daniel Deronda and so he was no stranger to me. I thought he was handsome in that film as well as this one. I liked the comedy of this film as well. The different characters, and the lively sets, made it one of my favorites. I sometimes just turn it on to listen to the music. The dance scenes have great music as well. Whoever choreographed this movie just did a super job. Anne Hathaway played the part so well, she was a joy to watch. She is just so pretty. She and Dancy were pure magic on the screen together. I hope they make another film together. This is a film the whole family can enjoy, it should be right up there with any Disney classic.",Ella Enchanted
69,french-michaelfrench,Entertaining and genre-referential,7,21 May 2006,"Not too fond of Anne Hathaway as an actress, though perfect in this role. For a slight film, there are plenty of references across the fantasy genre; Princess Bride, of course; Disney's Robin Hood; Shrek; Narnia; Games Workshop (look at the colour of the ogres and the guy with the cauldron); you spot the ones I have missed. For people who suggest there are too many ""hip"" references to fit well in the fantasy genre, I say only that Shrek managed very well with it and this film cannot be blamed for trying to keep up. It's not as good as Shrek of course, but then nothing is - but it's better than average and worth a look for some undemanding entertainment. The children enjoyed it a good deal especially as the lie in the film about rabbit killers led to a visit to the Cave of Caer Bannog in the original and best fantasy spoof (which also had Eric Idle in it and a Holy Grail...)",Ella Enchanted
70,cestlavie03,"poor on accuracy, but fun nonetheless",7,10 April 2004,"I will keep this review to a minimum and spare readers the summary of the plot, because a lot will get lost is going back and forth from the movie's summary and the book's. This movie is a fun movie... it has a lot of modern witt and leaves you feeling bubbly at the end. However, I myself have read the book many times over and love it, and those who are die-hard Ella Enchanted (the book) fans will be sadly disappointed with the difference. This movie is hardly anything like the book - sans the names and basic plot that Ella must be obedient. That is a real downer in itself, but somehow doesn't ruin the book for me. This movie was fair. It wasn't horrible, I actually enjoyed sitting through it. Anne's performance was better than expected and in the end you'll love how everyone lives ""happily ever after"" and the comical death of the bad guy. The only real problem I have is the song sung at the end, and the horribly painful-to-watch dancing of the cast. Overall, I would reccomend seeing it if you want a good break from the real world and feel like being immature for a day, even if you're merely curious. But it may end up being one of those movies you only want to see once.",Ella Enchanted
71,Uxbridge,Better Than Expected,9,25 April 2004,"First of all, this film has decent cast in various roles. Hathaway proves that she is no mistake as an actress, and she broadens her talents by showing that she can sing as well. It's nice to see good actors like Bergin and Elwes on screen again (particularly Elwes, who revels in his villainry). As a fan of Lumley's, she was awesome and bitchy in her role as the stepmother, while Punch was perfectly cast as her daughter in an ""acorn doesn't fall far from the tree"" personality display. McArdle and Fox are funny as the smart-alec elf and collision-prone fairy, and there's an amusing cameo with supermodel Heidi Klum as well. Nice touches include modernish conveniences in a clearly medieval world and a fairly good soundtrack. It's lighthearted and fun and worth the trip to the cinemas to see, and it's not just for kids either.",Ella Enchanted
72,wessel-1,Pale compared to Shrek and Shrek 2,2,20 July 2004,"After seeing the trailer some time ago, I really wanted to see this movie, although I *thought* may be a little to old for it. After seeing it, I *know* that I'm to old (for it, I'm actually in my prime).The movie isn't that bad, it's got a strikingly beautiful main actress, the stepsisters were ... really loathsome (good acting ... I hope it *was* acting), and like raisins in a loaf of bread it had some nice ideas and scenes. It probably may even be interesting and good from a pre-teen / pre-logic perspective, but it withers away from a more critical look.There were just too many things with the gift/curse of obedience that defied the inner logic of a story. How is that supposed to work? Either new orders can cancel the aforementioned order, in which case a simple ""Tell the truth what happened"" would make using her *much more* difficult (and ruin the plot), or there can be orders, that can't get cancelled. In that case, the first thing after the godmother left would the to order the child to follow her own inner judgment/nature from now on and ignore all other following orders unless they agree with her judgment/nature. OK, that would end the movie after six minutes. There is a third option, that orders are to be followed or ignored *as the story demands*, which defies any inner structure of a good story and makes it very incoherent. Unfortunately, this option (and sign of a crappy work) seemed to be used.Also the curse seemed to make even impossible or improbable things possible. She could actually freeze in the air, so the money problems of her father could be solved by a simple ""Dig up the largest unclaimed treasure/gold mine in this area."" or ""Go and win in horse racing."" This wouldn't make it such a bad gift after all.I wonder why the writers didn't chose an other way to deal with this gift. She would have to follow the orders, but she could choose *how* to follow them. Like dealing with a devil (or advocate) shows, there are a lot of possible ways to follow an order. If someone says ""Bite me."" it doesn't necessarily mean ""Bite me NOW."", so there would be no need to follow it that moment (and in an other context, this could even be enjoyable for both). The order ""Put my clothes in your closet."" says nothing about how they end up there (torn to pieces would be a good idea) and ""Give me that amulet."" doesn't mean that you can't put in in her hand and then crush her hand around it. Seems far fetched? Perhaps, on the other hand she seemed to have this freedom, like the scene practicing her mandolin or gathering poison ivy instead of regular flowers. This would make using or dealing with her *extremely* difficult. On the other hand ... it seems strange that she even survived so long. A simple ""Go to hell!"" or "".... you"" would be devastating (I suppose this critic gets censored if I write a certain four-letter-word everyone knows but everyone seems to be afraid to let it get written - hmmm, why do I have to think about ""Harry Potter"" all of a sudden?).Compared with other movies, the story pales in contrast with ""Shrek"" or ""Shrek 2"". There are some similarities (like throwing the book away), but the quality differences become clear by comparing *how* they treat fairy stories. In Ella they simply copied and rode with the story for some time, like the godmother actually giving gifts, the mother dies, the evil stepmother and her dumb and evil stepsisters ... they simply dip into it and pull out whenever the have the chance to be political correct (which gets annoying - especially when taken to these extremes - an Ogre who has human flesh on his menu would and should eat steel - I mean what was that line about ""I let you live to find your food elsewhere."" or something like that ... would you let a man-eating ""person"" run free close to a populated area? What if that ""person"" searches the next farm and eats the farmer? This is equalism without any reason.). Some things they took from other stories they didn't use well. It's one thing to make a reference to a movie or story, but an other thing to simply steal it without adding an unique touch. This was especially annoying with the would-be King and his adviser the snake. This was a simple copy of ""Walt Disney's Robin Hood"", even to the look of the would-be king and the behavior of the snake. Blatant thievery from good movies doesn't make a movie better, it just makes it worse.Shrek on the other hand just plays with fairy tales, they didn't actually dip into each separate story for some time but took only the key elements and used them in a creative and unique way. Comparing these two movies is like comparing a child's story with good works of Shakespeare (with the difference, that Shrek even manages to address all ages of the audience from 5 to over 100 which Shakespeare does not).So, all in all this movie wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good either - certainly not as good as it could have been, not even close. It may be good for pre-puberty children, but for older children and adults the forced political correctness and plot holes become extremely annoying.2/10 (one for the main actress, one for the rest)",Ella Enchanted
73,White_Prophet,Not as good as I remember - 65% (Fine),6,2 July 2018,"As a kid, i liked this movie quite a bit so there is some nostalgia there that brings this movie up a bit for me. I think that Anne Hathaway did a good job in this, there is decent chemistry between the two leads, and the premise of the movie is still pretty engaging. However, re-watching it today the movie doesn't quite hold up. The movie is a bit too childish with some very cheesy and cliched dialogue. Overall it's a decently fun movie that works best for a younger audience.",Ella Enchanted
74,laurakay76,"Not bad, but could have been better",6,11 August 2007,"Despite the fact that ""Ella Enchanted"" is a children's novel, I really enjoyed it. It was clever, entertaining, and impressively original for having been based on the age-old story of Cinderella.The movie is a lot better if you've never read the book.There are a ton of discrepancies between book and film. Now, I realize that whenever you translate a book to the big screen, some things are going to change, or be lost, or be added. I also realize that not all film adaptations can be Lord of the Rings. But for some reason, the makers of THIS film didn't seem to feel that Ella's original predicament -- receiving the ""gift"" of obedience as a baby which forced her to do anything anyone told her to do -- was enough for a movie. They swapped out Prince Charmont's very nice parents for an evil regent who tries to force Ella to clear his path to the crown, and added a few moderately amusing but altogether bizarre song-and- dance routines. Most of those scenes had me outright cringing. They also took away Ella's position as the protagonist-narrator and inserted an additional character to tell her story.That's not to say the movie is entirely without merit. The casting is excellent; Cary Elwes is a delicious villain, Eric Idle is a delight as the narrator, and Anne Hathaway sparkles as Ella. And I was pleased to see that the film does remain true to the source material's underlying message -- that in spite of whatever happens in your life, you have the power to make your own happy ending.All in all, it's a good film for the kids. But the book is better.",Ella Enchanted
75,kzoofilm,Hathaway is truly enchanting,6,9 April 2004,"Although there have been no shortage of Cinderella stories in the past few years (""Ever After,"" ""The Princess Diaries,"" ""The Prince & Me,"" etc.), ""Ella Enchanted,"" loosely based on Gail Carson Levine's Newbery-honored novel, at least puts a delicious twist on the old tale: What if our heroine had been given a ""blessing"" by a dim-witted sorceress that compelled her to always be obedient to anyone who gave her an order? In other words, what if the fairy godmother was an albatross?As played by the effervescent Anne Hathaway, Ella is a smart young woman eager to seize control of her own destiny. Once in a while, she's able to make the curse work to her advantage, such as the time a nasty playmate snaps ""bite me!"" But when a hostess sets down a cake in front of Ella and tells her to ""dig in and stuff your face,"" or Ella's obnoxious stepsisters force her to take the five-finger discount at the local Galleria, the results are messy embarrassments.Although ""Ella"" has numerous fairy tale trappings -- including ogres, elves, giants, talking books and, of course, a virile young prince -- it happily upends the old storybook idea about waiting around for someone else to come to your rescue. Noticeable traces of ""Shrek"" and ""The Princess Bride"" abound (as well as a touch of ""Moulin Rouge,"" since the movie's gleefully goofy musical numbers are built around such tunes as ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" and Hathaway's full-throttle version of Queen's ""Somebody to Love""), yet ""Ella"" manages to stand on its own as an entertaining tale about self-empowerment.Director Tommy O'Haver has made fine use of a sturdy cast, including Joanna Lumley as Ella's severe stepmother, Hugh Dancy as a blissfully ignorant prince whose eyes are opened by Ella, Vivica A. Fox as the sassy conjurer Lucinda who insists she has a ""no-return policy"" when it comes to her dubious gifts, Minnie Driver as an understanding housekeeper, and Cary Elwes, the one-time hero of ""The Princess Bride,"" as a snickering prince regent scheming to steal the throne. Obviously delighted at the opportunity to visit the dark side, Elwes puts a perverse purr into such benign words as ""frolicking"" and ""romancing.""It's ultimately Hathaway's show, however, and she makes the most of it, showing off her natural knack for physical comedy, her sterling singing voice and her beguiling charm.",Ella Enchanted

I bought this DVD knowing nothing about it except what I had seen in the theatrical trailers, which seemed to indicate that the film was a kind of ""fractured fairy tale"". I'm pleased to say that I was not disappointed. Anne Hathaway is beautiful, multi-talented and brings to mind a young Julie Andrews. The fact that the cast included roles by Minnie Driver and Vivica Fox was also a plus. But what really blew me away was Hathaway's rendition of the Queen song ""Somebody To Love Me"". (Chapter 14 on the DVD) Which I have watched at least two dozen times. That scene alone made the price of purchase worthwhile.(Oh...you'll probably like the rest of the movie as well!)",Ella Enchanted

I love the escalator in the medieval mall, and also just looking at prince char (I've come to understand his fan club more than I did as a child😂) I think my biggest complaint is that I wish they would either have further committed to the songs or just done away with them entirely, as it stands they're an awkward middle ground with just the two.

79,lilqtpi8913,Completely Deviates from the classic children's Novel by Gail Carson Levine,4,10 April 2007,"The names, and places are left the same, but everything else is completely different.Ella's father is dead instead of a very distant, self loving traveling salesman. Which leaves Ella in basically the same situation as Cinderella, living with her two ""horrible"" step-sisters, and ""evil"" step-mother.Now I """" those words because in the book that is how they truly are. The sisters are horrible while the mother is simply evil, but in the movie they are set out to be the comedic bad guys. You know the ones that you really aren't afraid of and just want to smack them silly for all the retarded junk they are saying.The plot is tweaked quite a bit (though you must beg the question as to why, because the book is so short they would have been able to fit everything in in the same amount of time). Ella is still looking for Lucinda and her curse is still going strong, Char is still the main hunk, and there is a happy ending. But where it goes wrong is Char is set up to be a dumb person. Instead of Ella trying hard to win his affection back after she was forced to tell him she didn't love him, Ella is instead trying to save Char's life from his comedy-driven evil uncle who killed Char's father (doesn't happen in the book) and wants the crown for himself, and in order to do that he has to kill the only heir to the throne, Char.A simple story line that is amusing, enter in the fact that two of my favorite actors appear in this film Cary Elwes (Robin Hood: Men in Tights) and Eric Idle (Monty Python and the Holy Grail). Also it has in it Anne Hathaway (Ella) who sings Somebody to Love beautifully in the film (only wish she would have acted better) and handsome Hugh Dancy (Elizabeth I - HBO TV movie). The film is good, but over acted, too juiced up on the slow, annoying comedy, and suffers from a poorly written script. If you truly want to see this film, rent it first, listen to the charming songs, Somebody to Love and Don't Go Breakin' My Heart -sung by the cast, including Anne and Hugh at the very end of the film- and enjoy the spectacle of oddities that surround the film.",Ella Enchanted

But I loved this movie. I get a tremendous kick out of being able to spend a couple of hours falling in love with Ella all over again. This is the kind of film that makes me glad to live in the era of DVD. I have already shared the wonder and the magic of Ella Enchanted with a couple of family members who missed it in theatres. I even bought my mom her own copy for her birthday. It is a rollicking re-imagining of what was already a great re-imagining of the classic concepts of fairy tales. And in my personal lexicon of modern fairy tales, Ella stands right up there with The Princess Bride. I heartily recommend this one for the entire family.

If that wasnt bad enough, most of the things she is told to do requires massive suspension of disbelief. To make matters worse, Ella, the main character makes the dumbest possible choices to keep the stupidity going to the very end.

She looks gorgeous, no doubt. The kingdom looks so old and ancient, yet the minds of the villagers can be so modern, like do you think there would be girls cheering and holding 'I LOVE YOU, PRINCE CHARS' board back in the olden days? No, right? It would have been better if it happened in a modern and civilized world but I believe there wouldn't be any elves and giants and fairies then, would they?

Personally, I really enjoyed Anne Hathaway's singing scene -- that girl can sing! Sure, there are some flaws -- this was not Minnie Driver's best role, and Gisele Bundchen (sp?) isn't exactly the finest actor out there (and in this role she didn't even look that fabulous which usually takes the edge off any other subpar acting roles.)

But isn't there a little girl in every woman who still believes that she can win the heart of her Prince Charming? ""Ella Enchanted"" is a movie for all of those who still believe in the fantasy (even just a little bit!) and all of those who like to escape to an alternate reality where dreams really do come true.  It is full of innocent love and obvious comedy with a few good musical numbers thrown in for good measure.  The movie-goer is invited to put on their rose coloured glasses and view the world as it might be if we did indeed live between the pages of a book.  What would our taxis look like, or our malls?  And how could you marry the notion of being a strong-willed, independent woman with being a soft-hearted, sweet girl who's falling in love? Anne Hathaway continues to elude a screen presence full of spunk and charm. Hugh Dancy is suitably rugged and handsome (in a teenage girl's dream kind of way). And it is a real treat to see Cary Elwes as the cartoon villian, oozing charisma and character, the complete opposite (although just as charming and handsome!!) as his heroic turn in ""The Princess Bride"". All in all, any fan of the romantic genre or the fairy tale comedy (yes, indeed the elements of ""Shrek"" are palpable!) will love to carried away and certainly this movie ""won't go breakin' your heart.""",Ella Enchanted

Why is Ella suddenly a crazy protesting teenager, and Hattie an obsessive Fan Club president who french kisses the floor? Why is Olive a dipsy silly nothing?!? In the book, Ella tries not to obey the orders she is given, and struggles, but in the movie, she does everything right away. And why, may I ask, was Lucinda suddenly a crazy drunken fairy, isn't she meant to be helpful in the end? Why is Mandy a stupid fairy who casts spells all the time?

She's so believable and adorable, and she pulls it off with an icky sicky-sweet almost-Disneyeque cartoon-like lines. To me, that's very high praise for any actor/actress with trite dialogue who is sincere.Ella Enchanted is a step below The Princess Bride - but The Princess Bride had better actors (the key to me was Christopher Guest - aka Mr Jamie Lee Curtis - play a great role as the six-fingered man - way before he did Waiting For Guffman). However, Ella Enchanted is enjoyable.I think Anne Hathaway is a decent actress with limited material (I think she was better in the first Princess Diaries). But I think Hathaway is a better actress than Amanda Byrned and Alexis Bydell (Gilmore Girls). Hathaway needs a great script and a good supporting cast to not a play a typical ingénue or débutante. She has pretty good talent and a great screen presence, I hope it won't be too long until she makes it big - unlike in Europe, where they recognized any talent young.",Ella Enchanted
93,changeling69,She is one to watch,9,22 April 2004,"WOW! First off a damn fine movie, I have not read the book but to see that kind of cast line up says something for the movie.  Comedy almost as offbeat as Shriek, and I truly can't say enough good things about it.  I didn't check into much before going cause I wasn't expecting much, however to see stars like Eric Idle one of the best of the Monty Python bunch, Mimmie Driver, Cary Elwes, and more working their magic in the movie was a pleasant surprise.  The big one was Anne Hathaway when she belted out `Somebody To Love' I was totally entranced.  She is one to watch for; I have a feeling she is only going to get better.  I know I will be eagerly awaiting each movie she does.  She has a charm and style that comes across in her characters very well.  Mike",Ella Enchanted

But I enjoyed most of it, and I'm a 50yo guy, so if you see it with your daughters you won't regret it.It won't take the place of Labrynith or Legend, but it can sit on the shelf beside them without a qualm.  It does belong in that genre.  I'd say it somewhat reminded me of the Tenth Kingdom.  Or perhaps Shreck as Live action?Sure- it's no LotR. But that's nothing to be ashamed of, is it?One caveat- if you despise disco type music- modern light Pop- then you migh want to skip this one.",Ella Enchanted

What utter chaff. I think maybe he read the book and never actually saw the movie.I loved the children's book this was based on, which is why I went to see the film in the first place, and if the producers would have remained true to that story this could have been amazing. Instead it is pop abomination. I can't blame the actors too much as the script and direction were inept and saccharine.It really is a shame because the book, which only shares one similarity with the movie (besides character names), is really an incredibly compelling and creatively told story.The costumes were cheap as can be. The story they used in the movie was trite as can be. You barely cared about any of the characters. And the inclusion of all the modern elements just lost any magic the setting could have had in this film.Just plain bad. Nothing at all that was even decent about this movie.",Ella Enchanted
96,bethy_joy,Too bad they couldn't have gone with the book,2,23 June 2007,"If they had called this movie something else, and changed the names of the characters, I couldn't have had a problem with it. A cute, fairy-tale-turned-modern live action Shrek wannabe. Alas, they had to associate with with one the best children's fantasy books out there. There is almost nothing of Lavine's conflicted, independent, stubborn, lovable Ella in Hathaway's representation, though I will go as far as to sat she *looked* like I always thought Ella would look. With such an excellent plot in the book, one wonders why it would need to be changed to have modern points such as screaming fangrils, and an Elf who wants to be a lawyer. Here are only a few of the major things that bothered me, although the extensive list is much too long to write out. 1. The evil uncle. Why? Why would you need a bad guy? The real villain is supposed to be Ella's curse, and her fight against it, as well as Dame Olga and Hattie's pettiness. There is no need for an evil uncle, or that ridiculous talking snake. A waste of Elwes' talents. 2. Slannin. Do you know now many times that name in mentioned in the book? 2. Slannen is the elfish potter that is mentioned once by Sir Peter, and once by another elf. Not important. Ella does not have a sidekick. That's the point- she has to do this on her own. 3. Mandy. From kind, gray-haired comforter and confidant to bumbling, clumsy oaf. Mandy is supposed to be Ella's secret fairy godmother, and the reason she cannot just magick Ella out of her situation is not because she is incapable, but because it is Big Magic, and the only fairy dumb enough to do Big Magic is Lucinda. 4. The ending was completely ruined. In the book, Ella breaks her curse when Char commands her to marry him. She knows she can't because there is the possibility of someone commanding her to kill him. She knows she must do the right thing, so she refuses to obey. Her love for Char is enough to break the curse, and it is her moment of triumph. It is the ultimate mental and emotional climax, and her marrying Char just seems an outspring of that. In this adaptation, she breaks the curse, but there is another 45 minutes of the movie, in which Ella breaks out of prison, and... fights ninjas? 5. The singing. We know Anne Hathaway can sing, so what does that have to do with the movie? And how much more Shrek can you get with a big closing musical number? 6. Ella's reaction to a command. Gee, I wonder if there's any magic on that girl, when there is a little ping, and her back goes ramrod straight every time someone says something to her. From that reaction, there was no need for Hattie to come to a revelation that Ella was obedient. Anyone could see it from a mile away. In the book, Ella fights her curse. She pauses, she plays games (when Mandy tells her to bring almonds, she brings only two), she wills herself not to. In this way, she staves off her curse for a few seconds, even though they cost her dearly.Again, with such a wonderful, and much loved book, why is there the need to completely change the plot? I see the need for revision in translating a book onto the screen, but there is no need to disregard the book's plot altogether. If a book is popular enough for there to be an audience for a movie, well, there is a reason it is popular. I also very much missed Ella's voice, as the book is told with her as the narrator. Ella is introspective, and gives the view of a conflicted rebel, who selflessly sacrifices her happiness for the safety of the man she loves. I was bitterly disappointed with a movie that promised much in the way of a fresh take on the tired Cinderlla story, and only delivered- well a tired old Cinderella story with a dash of Shrek silliness, though not done half as well. I beg you, read the book! It is well worth your time. This movie, however, is not.",Ella Enchanted
97,coltsfan1693,Absolutely vile - terribly disappointed,1,22 August 2009,"When I heard that one of my favorite books was going to be a movie, naturally I got excited. Gail Carson Levine wrote a beautiful novel about a girl named Ella put under a spell to be obedient in every way. It is well-written and any girl would love this book (but the writing might be understood by a teen audience). It contained humor, romance, and ordinary teenage problems twisted into a medieval fairytale setting. It had lovable characters like Slannen and Mandy. However the movie was a BIG disappointment. The director changed everything! Introducing fowl new characters with cheesy lines, actors, and special effects. I wonder what Levine thought of her novel after seeing this horrid film adaptation of a lovable classic.",Ella Enchanted
98,maddieweber,Makes me want to dance,10,11 April 2004,"Perhaps it was because I saw this movie with an Australian bloke, and a New England lady that we found this so wonderful, but probably it was just because we couldn't stop laughing/singing/and dancing in the aisles.This movie has moved to the top of my list of movies to buy when they come out on DVD. Much to the typical plot line of romantic comedy/musical film, this movie incorporated elements of action/suspense/and horror, much to our moving viewing delight. I predict that this is the Must-See-Movie of the pre-summer rush. Take your children, take your grandmother, take your college roommate, none will be disappointed.But do be prepared for Cary Elwes to be the evil villain, although it broke my heart, I'm sure yours will remain intact.

99,madisonpine,Well ... Ummm ... What can I say? ...,8,21 December 2004,"Well, let me see. Anne Hathaway was OK as Ella. Hugh Dancy was almost sloppy as Char. Opposite to the other movies, the plot was good, the acting was bad. This movie went far from the point. It made it seem like Ella was running from Hattie and Olive (all the time), that Hattie and Olive were trying to get Ella from running after Char (when she wasn't) and ... and ... so much more. Hugh Dancy made Char seem quite unreal. He looked like he was faking trying to run from his fan club, and (this is the script's fault) who would want marriage only after, say, 3 days. And why, when King Edgar said the oldest daughter in the family would marry Char, would Hattie blurt that Ella was obedient? It's like blurting a good point about your enemy/ rival when you're totally against them. In the beginning, the castle and the landscape gave the impression of medieval England or wherever. But at the end, Ella was like some pop princess. It was a pretty good movie, but they could of done better. A lot better. 7/10 (I liked the book. A lot)",Ella Enchanted
100,passthepopcorn6,Maybe if you're five...,3,14 May 2005,"Being a huge fan of both well done movies and books, I have never before had the displeasure of watching a movie and wishing to gouge my own eyes out--until today. I know that sounds completely horrid, but it was the single thought running through my mind throughout the entire movie, which happened to be playing on one of my movie channels.First off, the best part of the entire movie was the narrating--Eric Idle, in no matter what context, will always be a delight to have on screen. That was the one bit of the movie that brightened the 96 painful minutes. I expected a lot of good from Cary Elwes, and am disappointed to say I was let down--but of course, how could I not be let down by his character? His character DOES NOT EXIST in the books, yet he is the main point of the movie. Even then, I at least figured a completely random character could be well acted. But alas, all the random, totally non-canon characters in this movie were awful, including the man-book with apparently no purpose but to give away plot points whenever it happened to be convenient. Creative? Pssh. They weren't kidding when they said ""Loosely based on Gail Carson Levine's book."" Even the bits that they did take from the book were still completely twisted and mangled.The one moment of good acting in the entire movie is in the room of mirrors, the climax in which Anne Hathway attempts to stop the ""horrendous"" deed she's been ordered to do (personally, in that moment, I was actually sort of hoping she'd go through with it, but I digress). The expression on her face, and the emotion in her voice is the best we've seen from her yet, but of course the moment is completely trashed by the next blunt, Captain-Obvious-inspired words out of Prince Char's mouth, delivered so flatly and unemotionally that you wonder if he's already dead.Visual-wise, unless you enjoy Medieval retro, it's not very pleasing. The special effects are so under par that you can nearly see the computer mouse still designing the CG-snake halfway through the movie. At one point, I couldn't help but look at Prince Char's ballroom suit, and wonder if they'd even picked a time period at all, let alone research it. I don't think it would have been considered formal even in today's society, especially not for a coronation. And I won't say much for the sets, because I was too busy shaking my head to pay much attention.But the dance scene at the end--when Anne Hathway rips off her long ballroom wedding gown to reveal a Barbie Princess short dance skirt and begins in a drawn out, choreographed dance that the entire congregation somehow turned up to rehearsal for--was the epitome of bad, and the point where I turned and asked for a spork to gouge my eyes out with.Usually, even if book adaptations are terrible, I'll at least enjoy them if they stay true the the general feel of the books, even if the canon information is way off, such as in A Series of Unfortunate Events. The feel of Gail Carson Levine's book was a journey, tough-it-out feel, like a musty old castle, with just the right amount of humor mixed with thought-out twists and blunt reality. The feel of this movie was bubblegum, and convenience.If you have children that play with Barbies and dress up as princesses, take them, they're certain to enjoy it and to have a nice little scenario to play out later. But if you're a respectable movie-goer, opt for something that makes sense.",Ella Enchanted
101,da_skitz,What have they done...!?,3,18 September 2005,"I'm not usually an opponent of turning books into movies, nor am I opposed to altering books so that the movie version flows better. (For example in 'The Lord of the Rings', 'Cider House Rules' and the 'Harry Potter' films). However I was appalled at the treatment given to this book on film, and am very disappointed in Eric Idle for being a part of such a disappointing project.Ella of the book, like the one on the screen played by Anne Hathaway, is a spunky, independent and feisty girl placed under a 'curse' by the well-meaning but often clueless fairy Lucinda, who gives her the 'gift' of obedience. Thus Ella must do as she is commanded, whatever it is, which as you can imagine creates problems when she falls in love with Prince Char, heir to the throne of Frell. The plot centres around Ella's attempt to break the curse and win her prince in the end.This sadly, is where most of the similarities end. While in the novel the world of Frell and its surroundings is entirely magical and fantastical, this movie, in an attempt to make it more appealing, decides to create a medieval American suburb complete with the giggling high school girls and their high school politics, and a Prince whose popularity and notoriety one can only liken to Justin Timberlake. The characters for the most part retain only their names, and their characters are given an about face. The cold, calculating ruthless father of the book is benign in the movie, the upright, socially aware, intelligent yet mirthful prince is turned into a clueless fool. Thus the potential for meaningful exploration of their relationships with each other, especially the relationship between Ella and Char, is shot to pieces.As a film it is incredibly mindless, and will leave many asking, what is the point? One does not have to patronise the American audience by making every story resemble its own. The book had so much potential as a movie, and Anne Hathaway was a good choice for Ella, but I cannot give this movie anything but a negative review. Maybe someday a more delicate treatment of the novel will emerge, and that I can guarantee will be a hit.",Ella Enchanted

'Ella' was a pleasant surprise.Hathaway is a truly gifted actress. (What's with her career, though? Going from type-casting (Ella, 'Princess Diaries') to trashing her ""good-girl"" image ('Havoc') is risky. Remember Elizabeth Berkley, anyone?) Carry Elwes makes it look so easy, yet you never 'catch him acting.' (The casting irony was not lost on my daughter, a Princes Bride fan. Smart kid.)I enjoyed the anachronistic jokes (the escalator at the medieval mall cracked me up), for the same reason that I love Rocky and Bullwinkle. The only non-G-rated thing I found was a flatulence gag. I found the Cinderella/Knights Tale/Shrek riff struck just the right note. Original? No. But not every movie has to break new ground, be another ""Citizen Kane,"" nor remain true to the book. The film and book bear little resemblanceTwo mediums. Two storytellers. Two results.

The book was great, and the movie was nothing like it. The film should not have been called Ella Enchanted, it should have been said that this film was ""inspired by the characters from Ella Enchanted"" Not based on it. The plot is nothing close to the book and certain characters are ignored. This being said however I thought the film was brilliantly cast and it was fun if you haven't read the book in a while so your anger is dulled.

There are a number of disappointing changes in the movie that I don't care for,(for starters, the dad is a real prick in the book) and I really urge any viewers to read the book as it was wickedly enchanting (urgh).The movie was still kind of cute and entertaining and I did enjoy it but it just didn't stand up to my expectations after reading the book. cheers.",Ella Enchanted

I cannot explain how utterly disappointed I was with this movie. The book was original, funny, dramatic, and entertaining. The movie was a complete mess.Anne Hathaway gave a great performance, but nothing could help the script and poor directing. Levine's book could have easily been adapted. I don't understand what Laurie Craig was thinking. And the anachronisms in this movie were just odd, not interesting like in Moulin Rouge.The ogres made entertaining villains in the book. The movie, however, decided to eliminate this element, and have a ""save the ogres"" campaign instead. How boring! The ending is different as well, and not in a good way. I recommend the book. Not the movie.",Ella Enchanted

The story is surprisingly original for a fairy-tale. The humor is so nicely brought by all the high class actors. The narrator, that is not an infamous actor for some people, is so humorous..that he just earns an Oscar for his scarce words that he adds to the movie. The other actors do their very best to make the best of it..and they succeed. Anne Hathaway didn't participate in many movies..but in some of them, she has proved her acting-quality. Remember my words: 'Anne will become something great. She is one of the promised ones!'It's a nice movie to see with a friend (preferably of the other sex), then you will fully enjoy the magic of the story. ENJOY!!",Ella Enchanted

I suppose if you didn't read the book, it can be fun, but I went in expecting something and was grossly disappointed. The acting was bad, and the settings corny. I understand it was intended for the fashion-obsessed younger crowd and fans of Hathaway from her other movies with Disney, but...please...stick to the book!",Ella Enchanted
109,ndn109,lotsa existential Marxist fun (SOME quasi-SPOILERS),7,11 April 2004,"Who'd have thought Ella Enchanted was really about class issues, particularly regarding race relations?The fun fantasy film follows Ella's attempt ostensibly to marry the hunky prince, but primarily what she desires is social reform. All of the ogres, elves, and Giants are oppressed and under-represented by the fascist, speciesist monarchy government led by a sinister, Richard IIIish surrogate King.Luckily, Ella is able to imbue in the literally Charming - if easily coerced - prince enough of a sense of social justice that he can stand up to his evil uncle who plans to usurp the throne for himself.Along the way there's a lot of delightful supporting characters, who populate a landscape rich with gloriously colorful architecture and delightful, often comical special effects that reminded me of what it was like when special effects were fun and actually added something, rather than how they are often used now as a show-stopping spectacle.Anne Hathaway, who has positively unquenchable movie star charisma, is challenged to overcome the deterministic factors that are getting in the way of her attaining what she wants - in this case, a magic spell that makes her obedient. To do so, she is required to garner up the existential energy to shed the deterministic barriers to her freedom and the scene where she does is pleasant and convincing.Most pleasant is the political subtexts that can be read into this film, where the minority communities literally band together to, in essence, overthrow the royal ruling class (of course this is done in a fun, basicaly nonviolent fairy tale fashion). In an election year, it is refreshing to see ideologically progressive films like this, particularly one whose very political agenda is confirmed quite blatantly in the last scene of the film.
After Ella has completed her act of political subversion and married the prince to live happily ever after she throws the bouquet (freedom, political action) to the next person who will be asked to do the same task. In this case, that next person is the chick from Bend It Like Beckham, the only actual minority figure in Frell, an otherwise whitewashed community. Basically, the filmmakers are putting a challenge to the working class minority community to carry on the Marx-fueled political action enacted by Ella in the film. By democracy or by any means necessary. An interesting and seductive political message for what looks, on the surface, to be a kids' movie.That said, it isn't perfect. I found the musical numbers unsatisfying; they seemed more like nods to Moulin Rouge! and Shrek than something that director Tommy O'Haver actually wanted desperately to do. The sequences are just not choreographed with the same energy and wit as the rest of the film is. Also, some of the humor falls kind of flat, but God Bless them for trying anyway. There's really no hackneyed, been-there comedic sequences; everything, even the stuff that falls flat, feels pretty fresh.This is the best family-friendly movie I've seen since School of Rock.7/10",Ella Enchanted
110,foramomentintime,Feeble fable.,3,21 April 2004,"Ella Enchanted is a very weak romantic fantasy that annoys more than entertains. Anne Hathaway plays a young girl named Ella who is cursed at birth to do what ever she is told to do, which includes public humiliation and taking care of her bratty sisters. She grows tired of this conduct and tries to rid this curse but in her quest to do so, she runs into a prince who is next in line for the throne but is in danger because of his evil uncle wants to rule the kingdom instead of him. Now this is as simple as the plot goes, and I'm being too kind. The movie is really aimed at children with low attention spans, and the humor to be found here does not hit the mark. Maybe if it was a bit edgier, it could have work better but because it caters to families, it lacks a real source of humor.It would be a decent rental to keep your kids busy for an hour and so but you will fall a sleep if you see it yourself.",Ella Enchanted
111,allaboardtheskylark,"Easy to watch, yet surprisingly deep",9,20 May 2005,"Ella enchanted should be incredibly average at best, from the synopsis of the film it would appear to use all the Hollywood clichés including many that a lot of viewers will have seen in the Shrek franchise.But, Ella is actually a very charming movie, it sets out to entertain a pretty wide audience demographic and to a large degree it succeeds. It would be preposterous to suggest that any of the actors were stretched by the roles that they were asked to play; but Anne Hathaway remains easy to watch, with a confident style to her acting and looks gorgeous throughout.Hugh Dancy plays the dashing, yet oblivious prince with ease- although for British viewers you may consistently be reminded of Will Young; they are uncannily similar.The films budget doesn't always seem to stretch to the greatest special effects, perhaps best evinced by Anne's singing sequence with the giants; but at no point does this really take anything away from the film.It is clear that the film has been crafted to appeal to a family audience, but for those with a background in sociology or media studies some of the issues raised by the 'imperialism; of Sir Edgar will seem very familiar. For instance the representation of the elves as reluctant entertainers, forced to put on shows at every opportunity could easily be equated to the idea of 'Emotional Labour' discussed by Hochschild or more broadly the 'Disneyization' of society discussed by Alan Bryman.This film is destined to remain in the shadow of 'Shrek' in terms of it's depiction of 'fairy tales with a modern twist' but I truly believe that it is good enough to stand on it's own, it might be predictable but it is consistently amusing and always entertaining. Well worth purchasing on DVD in my opinion.",Ella Enchanted
112,DaFonz,A cute kid's movie,6,11 September 2004,"Some people (mostly from the US) seem to have a difficulty with certain types of humor other than ""Home Improvement"" series.This movie contains some elements that are to some extent a parody of fairy tales, filled with the intentional typical jokes.The 'kung fu' kick was a parody on Shrek, but Shrek got it from Matrix. That recognition is part of the joke I believe.I liked this, because it was simple and easy going, just as it was intended.. and safe to show your kids of all ages. You know we need more of those too.Seems like the complaints about these movie are adults who recognize this doesn't tickle their sense of humor. But it's aimed at a much younger audience I think.Having that said, this movie is little more than 'cute'.. it's like a story line we could think of ourselves in 10 minutes and many more because it is a small variation on many similar stories.If your kids like the classic cinderella type movies, get this one for them for a little change.",Ella Enchanted

Is there too much shown? I think the narrator could be cut, as could the ""household fairy"" and Ella's friend; that would cut out the beginning when Ella is a child, and the storyline about racism. Maybe the director and writer thought the audience was too dim to figure out Ella's ""gift"" of obedience without being shown it at the very beginning. It is a cute story, and most of the actors do well, and the idea of having classic rock songs sung is great -- particularly the Queen song Hathaway performs in front of the giants. Still, Hathaway only looks good from a medium shot (in close-ups she looks confused and confusing...her features are uneven) and the way the director mixes up real outdoor scenes with studio and blue-screen shots gives the whole picture an uneven look. Here's a suggestion: give Ella a different quest (maybe to solve the whole political issue by confronting Char and his uncle) and have her gift of obedience keep getting in the way...the way it is (wanting to lift her curse) seems to make her so self centered. And, along the way, she accepts her ""gift"", solves the political issue, and then the curse is lifted.",Ella Enchanted

If you've read the book and enjoyed it then you probably should not see this movie. If you can put aside the book then you can probably enjoy Anne Hathaway being charming and the stupid, 'Knight's Tale meets Shrek' type movie that this is (without their redeeming qualities). My 12-yr-old daughter enjoyed it once she got past them ruining the story but I thought it was dreadful.I hadn't yet read the story when I watched it so I wasn't biased then but now that I have I'm even more appalled.

I really enjoyed the movie (as did my girls - they watch it over and over). It was just fun and sweet. I really enjoyed the ""modern"" and comic spin on the fairy tale, medieval setting.I couldn't wait to read the book. I will admit I was a little bit confused when the storyline turned out to be different, but as I continued to read I really started to appreciate the common themes between movie and book - and how they'd chosen to portray them in the movie. I also appreciated the book on its own. I was glad that it was different from the movie. It was the same yet different in a way that made it fun to read. I didn't already know how everything was going to go or how it would end - except in a general ""happy ending"" sense. The book followed the Cinderella story more closely, while I didn't make the Cinderella connection to the movie at all.After reading the book I could understand why they chose to put the story on screen the way they had though. From my perspective anyway, I think to put it on screen exactly as in the book would have taken some of the magic out of it. It was definitely magical and just right in the book but in the movie I really think it would have come across as cliché - just another telling of the Cinderella story. Instead, the movie honored the themes of the book while stepping things up for the screen - spinning the story differently and making them bigger than life/outlandish (if you will).Highly entertaining and I'd recommend book and movie to anyone - especially if you have little girls. Just remember - to get the best out of both - watch the movie first!",Ella Enchanted
118,sk-112,Ella Enchanted,10,26 September 2006,"Anne Hathway is excellent as Ella of Frell. I love the movie Ella Enchanted because I have seen Princess Diaries and Princess Diaries 2 - Royal Engagement. I think that Joanna Lumley is really funny as Dame Olga who is Ella's wicked stepmother along with her ugly daughters. I hate it when Ella is taunted, bullied and bossed about by her ugly wicked stepsisters Olive and Hattie. I loved it when Ella mixed the button hole flowers in with poison ivy and they all got hives. I also loved when Ella told prince Charmont who was the president of his fan club. Especially he said thank you to her for telling him so he now knows who's name to put on the restraining order. I remember the actor who plays prince Charmont's evil uncle from Robin Hood Men in Tights. His name is Cary Elwes and he played both Robin Hood and Sir Edgar in Robin Hood Men in Tights and Ella Enchanted. I think that Ella Enchanted is an excellent fairytale movie that I have ever seen.",Ella Enchanted
119,imdb-457,Read the book instead,3,29 November 2004,"The book is fantastic: my six-year-old daughter and I both loved it. The movie is a clichéd hack job: the soul and depth of the book are completely absent. The character development of Ella's father, Mandy, Areida, and even Hattie and Olive, so enjoyable in the book, is simply gone, replaced by cardboard cutout characters. Ogres are missing their powers. Apple the centaur is gone. The whole Finishing School is gone. Lucinda's lesson is gone. Three royal balls are reduced to one with no magic pumpkin. And the whole movie-invented plot about enslaving the elves and giants was much better done in ""Shrek."" Simply put: If you've read the book, just skip the movie; and if you've enjoyed the movie, read the book.",Ella Enchanted
120,dipschidt,AWFUL!!! Rape of a perfectly good book.,1,1 May 2004,"When I read the local paper's review of this movie, I was leery, especially at the mention of ""medieval malls"" and musical numbers. But my daughter is a big fan of the book, and I promised I would take her to see it. Be careful what you promise.The book has a clever premise. Ella is given a ""gift"" by a fairy godmother--the gift of obedience. She must do whatever someone tells her. Fortunately, only Ella and her faithful house fairy know about this. The rest of the story roughly follows the story of Cinderella, but with Ella as a more resourceful heroine than the typical fairy tale damsel in distress.This movie takes that basic premise, and the characters set forth in the book, and pretty much runs it own way with it, with disastrous results. When Viveca Fox showed up as Lucinda, I knew we were in trouble, and it just got worse. It's as if the producers decided you couldn't make a movie aimed at young girls without throwing in shopping malls, teen idols, or fart jokes. Loosely based on the book is about the only way you could describe this piece of garbage. It looked like rape to me. If I were the author, I'd be suing. I haven't wanted to walk out of a theatre this badly since the godawful ""Neverending Story.""Read the book, and let this film die the quiet death it deserves.",Ella Enchanted
121,Vanillean,Don't expect the book,8,9 April 2004,"I admit, when I heard there was a book of this, I read that first, then went to see the movie. I loved the book, it was quirky and delightful to read. However, the movie really strayed from the book-which most movies do. My main problem with the movie is that it more made fun of the time they lived in then focused on the book. Yes, it was humorous, but I would love to see a movie made that doesn't focus all of its attention to making, for instance, stairs becoming an escalator. But the movie was pretty cute, same formula as are most romantic movies, boy and girl meet, fall in love, have a fight, make up, fall in love, etc.  But if you do see the movie, definitely read the book (if you already haven't)- its better than the movie, and everything seems to flow together much better in the book, (again, which is the case with most book-to-movie adaptations.) I'd give this movie 6/10.",Ella Enchanted

Come on, who can't be in hysterics when Ella breaks out into a Queen song with giants as her backup singers.Although we have the book, I've never read it, but I've got to compare it with the movie. I never dreamed it was like this. It's such a ""twisted"" movie. Cary Elwes plays a Sydly Wisplash sort of king with his extreme over acting ... he must have had such great fun doing this movie. Yeah, it's kinda dopey here and there, but there's always a surprise just around the corner.",Ella Enchanted

What a mess!I realize this is fiction and fantasy, but still, did it have to insult my intelligence as a movie-goer.  Beside holes in the storyline and all too convenient plug-ins to the plot so things would move along when needed, I'm still not sure if the moral of this story is believable.  Think about the classic fairy tales and fantasy stories our parents told us when we were children.  Sure, they were pure fiction, but I don't ever recall a point in any of those childhood stories where I raised the question, ""Gee, that doesn't make any sense"" or ""why the heck would anyone do something as stupid as that?""Ella Enchanted is FULL of points raised such as these.  Although, Anne Hathaway is as cute as a doll.",Ella Enchanted
124,jemdoll,I feel sorry for the actors.,1,8 May 2004,"One day Anne Hathaway will look back on Ella Enchanted and admit publicly that it was the most embarrassing movie she's ever made.  How could she not? This movie's a joke!  I can understand that perhaps while reading the script, a person could visualize that this movie would turn out to be one of those dashing period pieces.  I wasn't expecting a Merchant-Ivory film (Ella Enchanted comes from a kid's book after all), but this movie turned a perfectly good book into a 1970s nightmare.  During the last few minutes, the actors inexplicably start a song and dance number to Elton John's Don't Go Breakin' My Heart and Anne Hathaway dances around in a miniskirt and go-go boots.  I shouldn't have been surprised at the disco-themed ending because throughout the movie, even the special effects looked like they were done in the 1970s.  Though I must admit that Mary Poppins cleaning up the nursery in 1964 looked more convincing than the giants in Ella Enchanted. I feel sorry for Anne Hathaway (she should have left this movie to lesser-talented starlets), but I weep most for Hugh Dancy, the handsome British actor who plays the prince.  It's sad that in his first American movie, this classically trained stage actor is wearing leather stirrup pants and singing an Elton John song.  Oh, the shame!",Ella Enchanted
125,jaggerlyn21,THE MOVIE WAS SO GOOD!,10,25 September 2004,"I loved Ella Enchanted! It was cute and funny and all around entertaining! I'd see it again in a heartbeat! I especially loved Anne Hathaway, who i think is an amazing actress. I thought she did an amazing job in the role of Ella. She and Hugh Dancy had real chemistry and made the movie very watchable. While it has a Cinderella vibe to it, it was significantly different than a lot of other Cinderella versions and was just a great movie all around! And I was surprised that Anne Hathaway had such a good singing voice! (All the more reason to see the movie) Ella Enchanted was so good...I really enjoyed it! I can't stress that enough. I highly suggest seeing Ella Enchanted..Over and over again! I give 4 it stars!!!!",Ella Enchanted

I would recommend it to anyone. I really liked it and I think it is a delightful family film with a twist of comedy and a love story. I really liked the story line and I thought all of the actors did a wonderful job in the movie. I am going to be buying the movie in a little while and I will watch it many times. I think that everyone should rent it or buy it, but either way you have to see it. I hope this helped many people who are thinking of seeing it. I really liked it and I hope everyone else does too.",Ella Enchanted

Though I wanted to watch something else, my friends stomped on my idea and forced me to see Ella Enchanted.At first glance i thought the movie looked stupid. I was wrong It wasn't stupid at all. It was HORRIBLE.I can't believe it! I like Anne Hathway, i like her other movies, but this is ridiculous. The acting was terrible, the whole plot was terrible, everything was terrible! The jokes were all wrong; too modern for the movie which was set at that time.And to wrap it up, I'm proud to say that i haven't even read the book yet, and i am still terribly disappointed with this movie. my friend, who read the book, was disappointed too (obviously).If you actually happened to enjoy this movie, I would say you need to watch much much much more other (better) movies.",Ella Enchanted
128,elekanahmen-1,One of my childhood favorites... destroyed,3,9 November 2005,"If you are seeing this movie because of the book with which it shares its title (and not much else), spare yourself. Had this been an original film, not based on anything, I might have enjoyed it somewhat as a bit of silly fun. But it continually advertised its self as a film translation of a book that is near and dear to my heart, a book which I had been longing to see made into a well-done film. Unfortunately, when it comes to being a translation of the book, the movie is pure garbage. They've taken the most basic premise of the plot, the names of the characters (in most cases, ONLY the names), and discarded just about everything else. The characters are, for the most part, shallow reflections of themselves (if they're even recognizable at all), and the plot has become silly, cheesy, and full of pointless and totally unnecessary pop-culture references. Gone are the interesting and well developed character interactions, and Ella's curse, which in the book was a constant source of true emotional and physical discomfort, is, with the exception of its use as a catalyst in the end of the film, mainly exploited as comic relief. This was a story that would have made a wonderful movie on it's own merits. It didn't need to be put through the MTV Hollywood wringer.And no matter what anyone says... you can't call something ""Ella Enchanted"" if it has no stair rail.",Ella Enchanted

When I saw the whole thing for the whole thing for the first time. I really enjoyed it. I thought that Anne Hathaway did really good playing that character. Hugh Dancy did a great job playing the prince. Cary Elwes did a good job too. All other people who worked on that movie. Did a great job and also worked really hard. This movie is worth watching it has a lot of things. Like elves,ogres,giants and more. It has really good music too. It is a kind of movie I will be watching a again and again. It is a kind of movie that whole family will enjoy.",Ella Enchanted

I seriously recommend this movie to fans of the book and to anyone who loves a good fairy tale told right. I can't say anything bad about the movie, it is one of those movies you can watch over and over again and never get bored. The characters are witty, smart, funny and very versatile. And the background of the movie is beautiful. As long as you do not compare the movie and the book viewers should be very satisfied.

The star spangled packed cast brings you in, but the production and everything else keeps you locked onto the screen. I've watched this masterpiece 69,000 times and I would watch it 69,000 times more. The emotions this movie pulled from me cannot be pulled from anywhere else. I grew up watching this movie, and after 8 years I decided it was time to watch it again. It blew past all my expectations and showed how well of a film it is to entertain those of all ages. I've seen some people critique the cgi, especially that of the snake. Let me tell you this, if I saw that cgi snake in real life, I would jump out the window of my two story house and start singing ""I believe I can fly"" because that cgi was ahead of its time. This movie is my drug. If I could inject it like heroine, I would. I hope more people can appreciate this movie for what it is, a sensation.",Ella Enchanted
133,ignorethemail,Worst movie I've seen in 2 years,2,9 February 2005,"The acting, the dialogue, the story itself represents the very worst in movie making. It was embarrassing to watch, and even more embarrassing that people have given it a 6.4 Rating (as of Feb 2005) here at IMDb. I can't believe there are actually people in America who believe this kind of garbage is worth their money. Anne Hathaway was surprisingly insincere (her acting) and watching her and the prince and the elf was like watching a train wreck where the train goes flying off a cliff in flames and explodes in a treacherous dark canyon below. But seriously, the fact that this awful piece of work gets anything above a 6.4 demonstrates that Fat America has no taste at all, that the walmart-esquire society we live in is pleasing to most people, that they just want to sit down in front of a fairy-tale no matter how bad the acting, no matter how bad the plot, no matter how awful the CGI backgrounds etc etc etc",Ella Enchanted
134,rawr_its_mary,Ella Disenchanted,5,21 August 2008,"The movie was decent enough. It was one of those movies where you can sit down and watch it when it's on TV and get a kick out of it - it's enjoyable enough. If you forget the part where it's nothing like the book. It might as well have been its own separate entity. Like a really bad crossover fanfiction that takes characters from Ella Enchanted and throws them into a really stupid movie like Date Movie or Epic Movie or something.But the thing that really irritated me was the fact that the writers saw fit to drop the whole ""Cinderella Story"" plot. There was a reason it was called ""Ella Enchanted."" The name ""Ella"" was taken from ""Cinderella,"" obviously, but the writers saw fit to take out the pumpkin coach and mice horses, the evil step-family, the lost glass slipper and the prince using it to find Ella. Instead, they replaced it with silly musical-esquire numbers, shallow humor, present-day spin offs that were thrust into the medieval era (such as, but not limited to, ""Batox,"" the mall, and the escalator - which was nevertheless very clever), an attempted murder, and a random, jealous villain.It did extreme injustice to Gail Carson Levine's story, and to the Cinderella legend itself. The only really admirable things about it were the performances of Hugh Dancy (love him!) as Char, and Anne Hathaway as Ella. They kept it going, though they were restrained from reaching their full potential in the roles due to the writers' restrictions on the characters. And it's a shame, because I'm a huge fan of the book, and was so excited for the movie, and I ended up being extremely disappointed. I hope that someday, someone makes this movie (I hesitate to say ""remake"") and rights all these wrongs.",Ella Enchanted

Despite all the complaints from the readers, I thought it was original and funky-it actually reminded me a little of Shrek. But its originality came from the fact that there were actual people. I'm sure if Shrek were a book (for all I know it could be) it would be horrible to the readers, but I just want all the people out there to know that this is an adorable movie not just for pre-teens. I love the sort of anachronisms. The evil Uncle is ridiculous, but I sensed a very satirical tone. This is a great movie- I suggest watching it with an open mind-especially if you've read the book. Just forget the book, and accept the movie for what it is! I had to do that with Harry Potter...",Ella Enchanted

So ultimately, I highly recommend seeing this movie. I would very much like to see a true-to-the-novel adaptation too.

It's great entertainment for kids, and it's fun to watch on a rainy afternoon when you don't feel like thinking.The plot is very basic and predictable - almost charmingly cheesy. Some of the acting is a little ridiculous and forced - however, I will say that I liked the chemistry between the two leads, who are both decent actors. There are kids' movies, however, that do much better than this, and I can't help but feel a little disappointed.The worst part is that I have read the book, and I loved it. Gail Carson Levine is one of the best children's' authors out there, and she has a very unique style of twisting fairy tales into new stories. I would resent this movie less if it was not connected with the book, because they are two very different works with very different purposes. I would have liked to see a movie that worked with the book more closely.",Ella Enchanted
139,operjas,Fantastic,9,30 August 2004,This movie was wonderful. It's so rare these days to go to watch a movie with my daughters and truly love it. It reminded me so much of the Princess Bride and the Pirate Movie. The leading characters were fabulous. Honestly what wonderful chemistry. I'd love a sequel. Oh for all you fans of the book I understand your disappointment but honestly I don't think it would have worked as a movie if they stayed true to the story. The major elements were there and I don't think people should be so serious about it. I enjoyed the book very much but then I was able to enjoy the movie even more. Ella seemed much younger to me in the book than in the movie and Prince Char not as charming. All in all I think people should take them as separate stories and I'm sure they will find they are both great in their own ways.,Ella Enchanted

The movie is nothing like the book and it is a disgrace. The book was a Newbery honor and sold extremely well. If they keep to the story line and just don't buy the basic ideas books would be much better movies. They made a movie out of the book, but not a movie OF the book. The movie is horrible and somebody needs to buy the rights to it and remake it! It wasn't just the changes, everything about this movie was disappointing. It was cheap and poorly made.

The cast was not exactly the best i think Anne Hathaway playing Ella has stereotyped her as the princess actress i also have to say that i hate Minnie driver playing the clumsy fairy god mother and i hate prince char he just plain annoy me but he was OK compare to how much the wicked step sister annoy me i hate their over acting that just killed the characters and i spent the whole movie wanting to throttle both Hattie and olive necks. i also found that this movie was made up of mostly annoying characters and ones that over acted, another example the guy whom played king Edgar, but my final verdict on casting it was terrible down to the guy who start telling the story. Another thing i hate were the effect they were just so bad for today modern technology. By the end of the movie me and my friend had decided that this movie was pretty bad but what made us think that the world had come to end and that we want to kill ourselves to stop the pain is just after Ella and char had got marry they broke out in to the song don't go breaking my heart.

I really, really feel sorry for the people who actually paid real money to watch this disaster of a movie. Spoiler: I really despise how they have the old Victorian Era setting but also have modern invention, like the escalator. No actor or actress in this world could make this abomination half decent.

The interesting opening scenes were great as they transported you to the fairytale world. I was very happy to see Eric Idle was the narrator and Anne Hathaway was brilliant and instantly likable as Ella, with Hugh Dancy the perfect handsome prince. The Elf (another familiar face- Dudley Moore in 'Not Only But Always') is wonderful as the sidekick. I also thought the story was very good, it was slightly predictable at first, but then there were some interesting twists, where I think the usual fairytale storyline was changed to great effect. The way the Fairytale land echoed aspects of home were amusing, with wooden escalators, taxi carriages In a way, I liked it more than Shrek, because of the fact that it was less 'polished' and maybe more British. I would definitely recommend 'Ella Enchanted' to anyone who wants a fun and entertaining film.",Ella Enchanted

The glass slippers for ex. in the book Char gives them to her. Also only Ella calls him Char. As much as I loved the book the movie was good because of Anne Hathaway. She played an amazing role in the Princess Diaries. After hearing that she was going to be Ella, I had to see it. She is my favorite actress. If you haven't seen this movie watch it.

It's about a young girl Ella who is given a gift of obedience it's a shame that Anne Hathaway isn't doing family films as she is so good at it i haven't seen a film this good in a little while even Hugh dancy plays a brilliant prince char and he could become very popular with the lady's.A must see! for people of all ages.,Ella Enchanted
147,giraffeblimp,An insult to Levine,3,5 November 2006,"Let me preface this by saying that if I hadn't read the book, was under 10, and thought Shrek was the best thing since sliced bread, I would have enjoyed this movie. Not loved. Enjoyed. But in comparison to the book and--heck--other movies, this movie stinks. The acting is cringe-worthy. Eric Idle and Cary Elwes are the only standouts, and that's just because they evoke memories of good movies. Costumes are okay, but nothing special. The music so doesn't fit (song and dance routines? Really?). Now let's get to the heart of what killed the movie. They didn't keep the plot, characters, or atmosphere of the book! Why not just name it something entirely different, because that's basically what it is. They demolished every single character (if they even included them). Everyone was shallow and so annoying. Ella and Char's relationship was really massacred. The climax of the book, the single most powerful scene (where Ella refuses to marry Char) was taken out. But it's completely necessary to resolve the plot. All parallels between the story and Cinderella were removed. And they modernized it. Yuck. Protest rallies? Fanclubs? This isn't Shrek. If they had been true to the book, the movie couldn't have failed. But they weren't, and the result was a complete and utter disaster.",Ella Enchanted

The movie was intended to be somewhat corny.The only way I could describe it is as: Cinderalla meets Shrek meets LOTR meets Harry Potter meets Moulin Rouge meets Princess Bride.This is not my typical movie favorite - I prefer movies like the Godfather, Goodfellas, Casino, LOTR and even the Harry Potter series.However, this is simply a fun - good hearted movie in which one can get lost for a couple of hours.",Ella Enchanted
149,arrode,This movie was the biggest disappointment ever.,2,19 May 2007,"I hate people who whine about book to movie adaptations sucking and I usually just glaze over such reviews, but for the first time I feel compelled to agree and complain myself about just how awful this movie really is. I read Ella Enchanted when I was in the 5th grade and many times since then. Even at 20 now, the book is still one of my absolute favorites and cherished stories from my childhood. When I heard the book was being made into a movie, I was excited. I ended up seeing the movie with my kid sisters and was horribly disappointed. First off, I can't believe how much the story morphed from the original and still was able to retain the same name. The storyline is NOTHING like the book at all and that's not a good thing. They basically took a serious and heartwarming Cinderella-esquire story and transform it into a weird humor parody with bad acting, cheesy backdrops, and a dumbed down and stupid storyline. Half the characters in the movie didn't exist that way in the book and the ones that were added were nothing special. I always expected that if Ella Enchanted were to be made into a movie, it would have the same seriousness and visual design as other ""fairy tale"" movies like Ever After, but they made the entire thing ""blingy"" and flashy and very, very fake. The character casting was pretty awful. The hatred you feel towards Ella's two step sisters is nothing compared to the way they are displayed in the book. They were made almost to be idiots in the movie with the whole ""Char fanclub"" thing. The prince himself lost a ton of depth and storyline in the movie. The entire love between him and Ella felt fake and at no time plausible. While Anne Hathaway really was a beautiful girl and could have potentially played Ella well, this movie's design and implementation was altogether awful. Do yourself a favor and either:A) Read the book and then prepare yourself for a horrible movie B) See the movie first, like it for what it is, then read the book and find out what the movie lacked. Going in with weak expectations if you've read the book is the only way you'll find any enjoyment in it really. 2/10 for me.",Ella Enchanted

As it is, I have yet to see a film that has so little to do with the novel. As far as I can tell, the screenwriters read the back of the book and improvised. In the process, they turned a strong Cinderella figure into a puppet who, every time she's given an order, hears a bell (Pavlov anyone?) and thrusts out her breasts before obeying the order. There really is no excuse for the manner in which this film was produced and I only hope Levine is more careful with whom she allows to adapt the rest of her novels.

I plan to find the book and read it with him.Later that night we were listening to a song on the soft rock channel on TV and he heard the song ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" and said wasn't that in the movie.

153,mec81589,OK movie but made the book suck!!,6,1 May 2006,"TRhis movie was really good, and i loved the plot and the storyline it was cool and really funny but what ticks me of is that this movie was based after the book Ella Enchanted, one of my favorite books of all time and it totally ruined it. The only thing that was the same in the book and the movie were the names, the plot was wrong, char's parents were alive, Ella went to finishing school not college, they didn't even have college back then, she was only 16 close to the end of the book, she set out to break her curse not save char and her and her father hated each other, and Mandy was an extremely good fairy, the best part and the most relating to the Cinderlla story was that she was forced to be a slave and that never happened and i am sure they did not have malls with escalators. don't get me wrong i loved, Loved the movie but it had nothing to do with the actual book at all. alone they are both good but together they the movie ruined the book for some people. I suggest that you read the book and don't just watch the movie because if you do you will miss out on all that really is Ella enchanted, the movie dopes not follow the book.",Ella Enchanted

Though the actors deserve credit for putting on a good show this movie was horribly made and did not do justice to the book at all. While the book is a moving and lovely story, the movie is little more than a mass of junk that coincidently happens to have characters of the same name. That being said, this terrible rendition of a beloved book has just made me love the book that much more.",Ella Enchanted
155,chrissykinsx,Missed the point entirely.,3,29 August 2008,"I've seen a lot of negative comments pertaining to how awful the film is based on the fact that it isn't like the book. Instead of jumping right into that, I am going to discuss the movie as it's only entity.Going into the movie it truly is 'enchanting'. A cute narrator and bright colors that would put neon to shame. It is an adorable movie - if you haven't reached middle school yet, or you enjoy cute fantasy stories. It's a cute story, but all the musical parts were really unnecessary ( Annie, sweetheart, stay away from miniskirts ).As far as a move itself, I give it a 7.Now let's move on to the fact that this is 'based' on a book. I think Gail Carson Levine must have hit her head on something hard many times when she saw what they did to her book - they changed characters from one thing to something completely different ( Slannen wasn't always an elf with large ambitions, he was a TRADER who wasn't in the book for more then five to ten pages, Mandy was an older woman, Dame Olga was fat. Read the book to figure the rest out ). In the book things are so much different that I was sick to my stomach that Hugh Dancy and Anne Hathaway were wasted in this atrocious chop up of the book.The 'based on the book' rating doesn't even deserve a 1. I give it a 0.5.Overall, I give Ella Enchanted a 3.5. In the future I hope this movie is remade into something closer to the plot and less insane ( with less Elvis and Queen, thank you ).",Ella Enchanted
156,lindseylou,"Okay for Kids, but for Fans of the Book its a no no",2,21 July 2006,"There are times when the fangirl in me has to decide whether or not I enjoy how much something deviates from the original material, fullMetal Alchemist is a prime example, If I had read the manga first I most likely would not have enjoyed the anime as much as I have, however watching interviews from the producer via Adult Swim.com lessened the blow, I noticed major discrepancies between the two but I embraced both of them because for a pretty good portion of the manga and anime they stay consistent with each other.With Ella Enchanted, that consistency broke off within like five minutes. Maybe even the first minute, Eric idle is a great comedian and actor but he wasn't necessary. And the music? It just didn't seem to fit with the tone of the book, I would have thought the book would have had a more Hans Zimmer- esquire style of music, dramatic scores and instrumental pieces that would help the feel the tension between the duty to her gift and her duty to her love for Prince Char.What did we get? Anne Hathaway singing her heart out looking for somebody to love.On top of that, It was too modern, Batox? Okay for a small laugh, References to a chain store? Ookay, I can see it happening I guess, A Man powered elevator? Pushing it, Fanclub? Are we talking about the same book? Ninjas?! What the heck were these writers on when they wrote this!? The masterful clay worker Slannen? A Wannabe Lawyer. Pretty much every other elf? Comited to a life of ""Singing, Dancing and Tomfoolery."" No. Just no.Mandy? She became a young klutz, and Lucinda wasn't changed into a squirrel at all and the book seemed to be more of a thing for time instead of vital to the plot. Did we really need to see about two minutes of Benny just sitting on a table then being recycled, Wouldn't a ""They mistook me for scraps,"" or something or whatever he said work just as well without showing us? Those two minutes could have easily went to trying to make the love between Prince Char and Ella seem more realistic. Like, having them actually talk to each other instead of him just pulling mindless heroics over and over. He's saves her like five times in the course of the movie, and that's off the top of my head.Also, Edgar? Cary Elwes is a good actor, but I hate his role in this, I could see him as maybe the father of Char if this was a more book based version, or maybe I can't because its been a while since I read the book. And that snake? Probably the most annoying part of the movie, behind the dance and song numbers and trying to work political issues into what was once an rather simple plot.Areida? I cried during her part. I still do, I should not cry for someone who has about thirty seconds of screen time. They could have seriously used her to the extent they had in the book, instead, we pretty much get the broke off with her five minutes in. And the only time we see her again is at the end. She had some things with Char in the book.But What am I talking about? The only thing this has in common with the art piece that is the book, is names of people and places. The gutted major character points and plot points just so it could fit more to a schedule and a script that should have been redone by the author of the book.I give it 2 out of 10 because anyone who could rope Anna Hathaway into this piece of trash has to have some talent.PS. Any things I got wrong about the book I am so deeply sorry because I have not read the book since before the movie came out",Ella Enchanted

It would be charming if it were a cartoon like shrek but it's just too weird as live action. The casting and the acting was eh. I don't understand the mix of seventies and medieval clothing and the queen songs don't really fit but whatever. This movie is only good for a cheesy laugh.,Ella Enchanted

When I heard about this movie I thought it was going to be at least somewhat close to the novel is is based off of, but no. While the book is a children's book, it is wonderfully written and the story is amazing, I could picture everything in my head, and that is why I was disappointed with the movie. It was not like the book. If you have read the book, this movie will disappoint you greatly, but if you don't then it is not that bad of a movie. However if you do see the movie before reading the book, don't read the book, b/c it will only cause you to be disappointed in the movie.",Ella Enchanted
159,AntiDisneySequel,You would cry too if you'd read the book,1,2 October 2006,"This movie was an obliteration, adding and subtracting key characters, the lame pop-culture-y-ness of it all, the twisting of the plot, the whole thing was a fiasco. They obviously didn't consult Gail Carson Levine at all when making this, because if I were her, I never would have let this movie be made the way it was. I was sitting in the movie theater with my sister fuming the entire time about how unrelated the movie was to the book. Hello, since when does a fat old cook with a double chin get translated to Minnie Driver? I walked into the theater expecting a nice fairy tale, not any of this medieval teen crap. I knew it wouldn't be just like the book, and it my curiosity that brought me to see the train wreck in the first place, but even reading the book now, it just makes me angry at the horrible injustice that happened when this movie was made.",Ella Enchanted

When I found out they were making it into a movie I was thrilled! However, after seeing the movie I must say it was very disappointing. Many of the events in the movie did not even take place. There are characters that aren't even in the book as well. This movie just had some similarities here and there to the book but over all completely botched the plot. Even if you were to think of the movie as something not even associated with the book, it is still very cheesy with so-so comedy. I laughed maybe three times the entire movie and it was only a faint ha. All in all this was a pretty horrible movie that was made to give the masses a few cheap laughs. This was a big let down and I only hope that if any more books are made into movies, that they are done much better than this one.",Ella Enchanted

BAD IDEA. needless to say, I saw it as soon as it came out. I wanted to cry. Not only in the beginning, or at the end, but throughout the movie. how could someone create such an awful cheesy story and say it was based on such a wonderful book?! not only did they add cheesy and unconvincing MAIN characters and change totally the personality of some of the most important characters (i.e. Mandy) but they also changed the whole plot! instead of watching this movie, buy the book! it will be so much more rewarding!",Ella Enchanted

I even daydreamed about being asked to play the title character if was ever turned into a movie. I was over the moon when I heard it was being done, and Anne Hathaway was to play the character because at the time, I love the Princess Diaries. Needless to say, they took a wonderful, incredible book and turned it into a piece of Disney feces. The book should have been done in the style of Harry Potter, LOTR, or Stardust, and instead it was made into a stupid child's movie. Frankly, I was still a child when it came out so the fact that I still hated it surprised me even more. I'd love to see a remake of this that stayed true to the novel.",Ella Enchanted

166,mcoyle0610,a travesty to one of my favorite books.,1,19 September 2007,"I highly anticipated this movie's release, as Ella Enchanted has been one of my favorite books since I first read it about 10 years ago. It's a great story, a twist on the Cinderella story that's sweet, funny, interesting, and engaging to both younger readers (as I was when I first read it) and to older ones (I'm in college now, and I still love it). That said, this COULD have been a really fantastic movie--there was a lot of potential. I've seen the movie once, and it was more than enough. I watched it with increasing horror as the original story was ripped to shreds by a producer/director/creative team/WHATEVER who clearly did NOT read the book or even get what the story was supposed to be about. They turned it into some fantasy-feminist-musical disgrace. The whole movie is simply a joke, and to cap it off they have a god-awful song and dance sequence at the end involving Elton John, Kiki Dee, Anne Hathaway in white go-go boots and a miniskirt (singing dreadfully, I might add), and knights and ogres dancing and leaping across the screen.If I read another parent review about this being some fantastic movie, a classic for children, I'll flip. Putting the raping of the book's plot aside, the movie itself wasn't even GOOD. It was horrible and ridiculous.",Ella Enchanted
167,bethe515,Great movie to watch with my kids,9,22 March 2008,"I am not one to be able to sit through all the cartoons and TV shows my kids (4 and 8) watch easily. They have no problem watching the same shows over and over, so this was a nice refreshing way to sit through TV with them. It is easy to watch and they both like it very much. You have to take it for what it is - a fairy tale and not a serious Oscar worth drama. The acting is fine, the premise is of course unbelievable, the costumes are excellent and the characters are developed well. Anne Hathaway does a great job being believable as Ella who has the ""gift"" of obedience. You can feel her pain as she must do mean and unspeakable things to people. Of course some of the things she has to do bring a chuckle. The parallels to the story of Cinderella are subtle and charming. Viveca Fox is hilarious as Ella's Godmother. Ella and the future king are very cute together.",Ella Enchanted
168,tamsin-24,I wanted to like it,6,29 June 2009,"The luminous Anne Hathaway seems perfect as Ella Frell, and Hugh Dancy is mostly adorable. But this whole movie felt like it was trying too hard. The character of Ella's father was very uneven, and Minnie Driver was wasted in her role as Ella's aunt. The tongue kind of got stuck in the cheek, I think. If Ella was truly a 'slave' to her step family, would she have been allowed to go to University? They were trying to make Ella into a forward thinking woman by today's standards (well, almost!) and that's what made a lot of the attempts at humor fall flat. The 'moral' of the story - that no one can truly MAKE you do what you don't want to do - was sort of fuzzy. At times it seemed as though the narrator (Eric Idle) was needed because the story became hopelessly muddled. Cary Elwes played his part broadly and with a barely concealed twinkle in his eye, what a total opposite from his part in The Princess Bride! It's too bad, though, that Ella Enchanted couldn't have been a bit more like that movie instead of stumbling and not quite falling into what it became.",Ella Enchanted
169,clhancock-1,Terrible,1,13 June 2008,"The film version of Ella Enchanted surpassed my expectations alright... I expected it to be bad, and it was definitely much worse than I ever could have imagined.I'm another one of the people who read the book before seeing the movie, so naturally I was very disappointed in the screen adaptation of one of my favorite childhood stories. That aside, I knew when I first saw the preview for the movie that it wouldn't be my kind of thing, nor would I enjoy the Hollywood makeover it seemed to have gotten. So I didn't watch the movie! I refused to see it in the theater and I avoided it until now, when it just so happened to catch me by surprise on TV.Even with my low expectations, this movie still managed to make me so angry I felt the need to create myself an account here on IMDb just to write how let down I was. I thought that the main problem was in the writing itself. I know that a movie based on a book is supposed to represent one person's vision of that book, but I definitely think that this went beyond interpretation and far into the realm of sellout. It is offendingly obvious that not only minor parts of the story, but even the biggest parts have been changed to suit a celebrity-obsessed, media-controlled audience, and of course to make as many people rich as possible.So many things were different that the movie should not be allowed to share the same title as the great book I read when I was younger. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who was even a remote fan of the book, and I give it 1 star out of 10 only because giving 0 stars doesn't count as a rating apparently.",Ella Enchanted
170,chochang1413,"Completely untrue the book, such a letdown for devoted Ella Enchanted readers.",1,11 October 2008,"This movie was an extreme letdown. I grew up reading Ella Enchanted pretty much every week for a good 6 years, and of course I was expecting a lot from the movie. But disregarding my high expectations, the movie was pretty much completely different from the book. The only things that were similar were the characters names, and okay Hattie was very good. I really don't think the writers of the script even read the book past the back cover. Ella's childhood was not correct, her orders from Hattie were not correct, her relationship with Char was not correct, her breaking of the curse was not correct, the interpretation of Slannen and the Elves was completely off the mark, Mandy was not the same at all, there wasn't even any of the Boarding School thing, Areida was not correct, the singing of modern songs in the movie was so not the mood that the book is striving for. I think there needs to be another version of this movie made, and this time Gail Carson Levine, the author of the book, should have some say in it. If I were her, I would be horrified at the perversion the writers did to her award winning book.",Ella Enchanted
171,katharina_of_padua,another outrageous Hollywood perversion of good fiction *spoilers*,4,24 August 2004,"The plot line of this movie deviates so entirely from that of Levine's Newbery award winning novel that it doesn't even deserve to share the same title. Where the book delivers humor and warmth with every turn of the page, the film resorts to a washed out bag of Hollywood tricks. I'm sorry but giant-farting cannot compare to the type of fun loving humor contained in the original story. You will see none of Char and Ella's banister sliding here. Or Ella's quick wit and humor. Instead the movie resorts to inserting into the story a theme of social equality, staring an Ella whose primary character trait places her in the role of picketer and activist. As sickeningly modernized as the entire film was, I'm surprised thing didn't end with ella starting a medieval guild version of the aclu rather than keeping to the ""sexist"" classic fairytale royal wedding ending. If you want your daughters to be insipid, brainless, hattie/olive types, who enjoy the mall and posters of teen stars and anything pink, by all means encourage such base and washed out entertainment. If not, don't let them waste their time on poorly made movies. They could be reading a book.

As such, when I had learned about the movie being made, I was very exited! However, I was so disappointed in the result. I found it borderline insulting, in fact. I realize that it is nearly impossible to follow a book too closely when producing a movie based on the story, but this was just horrible. It had almost nothing in common with the book. Character names and the curse itself are the only real common themes. Even if it is hard to follow a story too closely, the movie should at least have some similarities to the book it is based on! I'm not sure they tried to keep anything the same at all. Looking at the movie from the viewpoint of one who hadn't read the book, I'm still not impressed. It had its moments, I suppose, but I found it to be rather dull and witless. I suppose a young child would enjoy it, but I didn't. But then, it was intended for a younger audience, so I suppose I have no real right to complain. Still, I don't recommend this movie. Read the book.",Ella Enchanted

It was cute and sweet, and had some very funny bits here and there with a gag or two.  It wasn't half as bad as I thought it was going to be.  Yes, I agree that they left a lot of stuff from the book out and added a lot of unnecessary things, but all in all it turned out to be quite enjoyable.  I especially liked the Prince Char fanclub- they were a riot and had their parts down to a tee.  However, I totally did not get the whole snake/evil uncle thing.  That didn't come from the book, and I didn't understand it. What I didn't understand most of all was the (I suppose you could call this a spoiler) poisoned crown.  Ok- and HOW exactly do you poison a crown? Anyspam, loved the movie, I want it on DVD now.  I recommend anyone to see it- yes, even those of you who think it should have stayed ""true to the book.""Oh yes, and I must add, Eric Idle did lovely narrating.

They got 90% of the names correct, but they didn't do much else right. They invent an evil uncle with an equally evil pet snake. Force stupid laws upon characters. NOTHING IS LIKE THE BOOK. It's actually rather infuriating and I don't understand how Levine could have allowed this to happen to one of her greatest novels. If you haven't read the book, I strongly urge you to try it. Levine creates this beautiful world where the mythological and the medieval mesh together so well. The real Ella is under a spell which gives her a rebellious attitude, she has a kind heart, and a love of languages. The relationship between Char and her develops slowly and naturally.

Even though it incorporates all of these films wonderful attributes, it brings some fresh and new life that is truly unique. It makes you feel as if you are in the center of the adventure.

180,Xannadee,"Different from the book, but still good",8,11 April 2004,"Die hard fans of the book - of whom I must consider myself one - might be annoyed that the only things that are kept the same are the names and the basic concept that Ella has the ""gift"" of being obedient. I try not to let this influence my opinion of the movie as its own entity, and as a consequence I believe that the movie was very good in and of itself. There were several parts in and of themselves that were quite entertaining, like the elf who wanted to be a lawyer (vaguely reminiscent of Rudolph for those of us who grew up in the 80's) and Regent Edgar's evil talking pet snake being mauled by the prince's fan club. And the mixing of modern ideas like fan clubs, malls, and pop music with a medieval setting provided intentionally ironic laughs much better than did the attempt at the same of ""A Knight's Tale."" The one change from the book that did irritate me was how Ella's obedience was more of a plot device than the purpose of the story. Instead of a story about a girl's quest to be strong enough to override pressures on her, the movie was an attempt to uncover Regent Edgar's evil plot take over the kingdom. As a consequence, the story was much more about Prince Char growing into a good king than about Ella's problem. But that did not stop it from being a good movie. But if you want a fairy tale rewritten to make the heroine stronger, the book is better than the movie.",Ella Enchanted

If you loved Ella Enchanted the book I warn you: DO NOT SEE THE MOVIE!!! The only resemblance the movie had to the book was the names, places and the fact that Ella was cursed to always be obiedient. Ella's father IS NICE. Not, mean, lying, or selfish. Mandy is YOUNG AND PRETTY, not old and plump...oh, and she accidentally turned her boyfriend into a book because she actually uses magic, but isn't very good at it. Prince Char had an evil Uncle (who owns a talking snake.....pointless) who killed Char's father. The Ogres are NICE, NOT pursuassive, NOT hairy, and their butts hang out like stereotypical plumbers'. The elves are forced to sing and dance, Slanan wants to be a lawyer...the giants are FORCED to grow crops and Kupoduk (spelling...I have no idea) resembles a mob boss. That's only HALF of it, I'm NOT kidding. Not only was this ""movie"" entirely disloyal to the book...it wasn't even good...not even remotely. The ONLY thing I will say for this movie is that the actors they chose to portray Char and Ella were perfect (the way they looked anyway) Char was insecure and Ella wasn't nearly as funny and clever as she is in the book.",Ella Enchanted

Fully enjoyable, as long as you don't take it too seriously.While girly movies are often shallow, in this one, heroine Ella stands up for the rights of all creatures and crusades for social justice. (She protests events with signs that read ""say no to Ogre-cide"".) Though she also happens to predictably be thin, pretty and a good dancer, she tries to be a quasi role model and seems to succeed.It is the tongue-in-cheek factor, though, that makes different from the standard, formulaic nature of most movies of this genre. It won't win any Oscars, but it's two hours well spent.",Ella Enchanted

Definitely has some childish elements but overall the film just works.  It is fun for kids and kids at heart alike. I went with my fiance and her sister and we all enjoyed the movie very much. If you have any idea that you might like this movie, then don't miss it! They really did a great job of blending a fantasy tale with modern touches and fun 70's music.  The movie pokes a lot of fun at itself and that is probably the main reason it gets away with this interesting blend of fantasy, romance, and comedy.  This little movie surprised me.  It exceeded expectation and I hope they come out with a whole series of Ella movies. They have enough interesting characters in the first one that they could really take the story in many directions from here.  Fun Movie!",Ella Enchanted

I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and I expected the movie to be similar to the book.  If you enjoyed the book, you may or may not enjoy the movie.  The movie and the book have very few similarities, though both were entertaining in their own way.  I liked the acting of Anne Hathaway, which made the movie as good as it was. The movie would not have been watchable without her (in my opinion).  If you are not picky about the movie sticking to the book, you should enjoy the movie.  If you have seen the movie, and not read the book, I highly recommend reading the book.  If you are unsure about seeing this movie, wait to rent it.  I rate this movie a 7 on a scale of 1 - 10.",Ella Enchanted
185,Sillybrry,"Cute, lighthearted ""fractured fairy tale""",10,3 May 2004,"""Ella"" is an adorable break from the melodramatic Hollywood hum-drum. Reminiscent of ""Shrek"" and ""The Princess Bride"", this is NOT a movie to see if you're looking for serious filmmaking, or great drama.  ""Ella"" is not about either of those, though some of the special effects are well-done. The movie is a tongue-in-cheek poking of fun at the classic Cinderella story -- okay, raise your hand if you couldn't figure that out from the title. Admittedly, it's been done, and often.  So have a lot of other things, like meteor strikes and alien invasions -- but we keep going to see them, don't we?  So yeah, if you're looking for Oscar-winning drama, skip it.  If, on the other hand, you're looking for a fun, happy film to see with your kids and the chance to giggle at a few dreadful puns, this is the movie to see. Anne Hathaway unquestionably carries the film, beautifully and effortlessly, and it's worth the $7.50 just to watch her smile for an hour and a half. All in all, the film is cute, silly and a great time for the family.",Ella Enchanted

It was quite a surprise. With a cast of well known actors, they really did put this movie together well. There were lots of cute and funny moments. Anne Hathaway looks gorgeous throughout the movie, her hair never being out of place. Cary Elwes plays a very despicable bad guy, and he's quite good at it.The costumes and set design for the movie is very creative. It reminded me of being at a Renaissance Festival. Things were so out of place, such as having a shopping mall, and escalators that were powered by two old men. The costumes for the lovable characters weren't anything extravagant, but the people you love to hate sure did have some memorable outfits.The whole movie is a big parody of fairy tales that everyone will find amusing. The singing by Anne Hathaway herself is a very nice touch since she sings so well, and really adds to the amusement of the movie.",Ella Enchanted

I wondered if it might be too babyish or girly for them, but there was nothing to fear... we all enjoyed it very much! This movie is clean, clever, funny, and has a lively soundtrack that draws from the 70's. It's set in medieval times with lots of references and tie-ins to modern times. There's some fighting, but no real violence and no bloodshed (except for one minor cut on a hunky bicep). This isn't particularly deep or thought-provoking, just spunky good guys on a mission versus really despicable bad guys... a nice way to escape for a couple of hours.

I just happened to be channel surfing and hit upon it. I was thoroughly ""enchanted"", particularly by Anne Hathaway's performance. The premise of the movie itself was hilarious. I loved watching for all the different anachronisms shown throughout the movie (i.e. escalator, elevator, cab, etc.). I don't know if they could have picked a better cast. It was rather strange seeing Cary Elwes in such a role, considering his more recent movies. Minnie Driver is not my favorite actress, but she worked really well in the role of the house fairy. The best scene has to be when ""Ella"" is forced to sing for the giants....loved it!!! I highly recommend this movie to everybody I meet. I can't wait to add ""Ella Enchanted"" to my DVD library. It should go well with my other Anne Hathaway movies...she rocks!",Ella Enchanted

They leave out her trip to finishing school, going with Char to the menagerie, and, not to mention, where's Apple? Oh, and Ella's mom dies when she's older, not when she's little, that's where she meets Char. When someone gives her an order, she tries to resist all the time. They left out the healing soup with the unicorn hairs, too.The book is a billion times better than this horrible filth they heaped on while adding the name of Ella Enchanted.

190,americanaussie88,A Ton of Fun,9,27 January 2005,"I had so much fun watching this movie, a piece of light hearted fun that everyone can enjoy. *If* they remember the opening lines of the movie; this is a fairytale. And is therefore not to be taken seriously, it should be watched for the pure enjoyment of getting away from the daily humdrum.I have seen this movie twice and both times the audience was literally buoyed by the fun of the movie, though I must say the best parts and lines come from Uncle Edgar(a deliciously evil Cary Elwes) and Heston the snake(the slimy voice of Steve Coogan is wonderful). That is not to say that the two leads(Anne Hathaway and Hugh Dancy) are not bright and funny in their parts, they are. Only that the wonderful and memorable lines come mainly from the more evil characters.Joanna Lumley (as the evil Dame Olga) and Minnie Driver(one of her best yet, possibly only beaten by her surprisingly good turn in ""Phantom of the Opera"") are also great in their minor roles, providing colorful characters and not just filling in screen time. Aidan McArdle(Slannen the Elf) is wonderful comic relief each and every time he appears, as is Lucy Punch as the horrid Step-Sister and chief fan-girl(shudder). Eric Idle, Jeniffer Higham, Jimi Mistry and Parminder Nagra are also memorable, particularly Jimi as Benny, Eric as the Narrator and Parminder as Ella's best friend, though I think Parminder's talents are woefully under recognized in this film and I would love to see her in more main roles like in ""Bend it like Beckham"".But I digress.Hopefully those watching this movie will remember the fun it is supposed to be and not fall into the trap of over analyzing this piece of light-hearted happiness.",Ella Enchanted

Which was written by Gail Carson Levine. I was excited at first to hear it would be made into a movie but was really disappointed to see it had strayed from the original book plot by very much. Especially the setting, it was quite cheesy and corny how they try to make fun of fairy tale genre. It was stupid how they put some Modernized elements in there. As i sat there watching this horrible movie, i was wondering why Gail C. Levine allowed them to wander away from the original book plot and setting, to allow such a wonderful book be ""frankensteined"" into this horrible movie.I laughed hard when i heard from an interview with Hugh Dancy (who plays Prince Char)when he said ""...and make it into a better, more modernize version."" More like a horrible.But i guess it was aimed towards younger children, begin 14 i find this was quite silly and corny. If the movie writers/director had not strayed from the book plot/time setting, then i bet it would of been a better film at least.I give this a 1/10.",Ella Enchanted

Second, anything good these days has something to do with QUEEN, so when she started singing, i could not hold it in, i laughed so loudly the entire cinema echoed. The story line is not any good, but there are so many funny bits and bobs in there that it is well worth your while to watch this film. Overall, it gets 10 potatoes from me, with ten stars each. This is a great film, just the funniest thing. If we had more films like this, the world would be a much happier, lighter Bush free world.",Ella Enchanted

But this is a delightful bit of fun, romance, magic and tomfoolery for those who find such things to be diverting.While being less realistic than ""Ever After"", Ella Enchanted bears several striking similarities to that version of the Cinderella story but with tongue-in-cheek humor. Anne Hathaway is luminous as Ella whose fairy given ""gift"" of obedience makes her obey everything she's told, but whose ""heart makes her good"". She and Hugh Dancy click playfully but with a certain honest sincerity in their roles.While all roles are played in a fun manner, some go quite over the top.

You have a prince, elves, giants, well you get the point.Ella is a girl from the small town of Frell. At birth she was given the magical gift of obedience by a fairy godmother. This magical gift proof to be actually a curse as everyone learned that she always does what she is told. Thanks to this magical gift, Ella is tricked into attempting to kill the prince (the love of her life) by the prince's evil uncle. Even though the story line was very similar to other fairy tales and the movie was totally predictable.

This (at least, I think) is one of those movies that gets more humorous the more you watch it. I read the book and thought it was better than the movie, even when I had seen the movie first. I would really recommend both, but they are very different yet similar so don't be expecting the exact same things to happen, but they are pretty close. If you liked this movie, I would recommend 'Elf', 'Daddy Day Care' and 'What About Bob?'. Anne Hathaway did a great job in her part. In the book most of her feelings are very different then what they show on the outside, and Hathaway did a great job portraying that.",Ella Enchanted

It truly is a charming movie with a wonderful twist on the cinderella story. Anne Hathaway was truly remarkable and its one of those feel good movies that we don't seem to produce anymore. As far as someone's comment that it doesn't meet up to either of the Shrek Movies standards, I disagree! It has the same amount of feel good humor as either of those movies without being as crud as Shrek. The only tihng I would have changed would have been further development of some of the characters, like ella's best friend. But then again you can only make a movie so long. If you want movies to compare it to I would say that it you like ""The Princess Bride"" or either of the ""Shrek"" Movies you will enjoy Ella Enchanted.",Ella Enchanted

But not by much. Anne Hathaway is slowly but surely becoming a potent force in the film industry, and in some ways, she carried ""Ella Enchanted."" She was fresh, funny, and lovable right off the bat, and when you're looking for a sweet, Cinderella-esquire story, that's what you need. Of course, there were a few unnecessary scenes (i.e. Why did Prince Charmont need to remove his shirt for a full ten whopping seconds? What's up with the snake persona?), but my personal favorite (the salute to Queen's ""Somebody To Love"" at the giant's wedding) compensated for it. In conclusion, the film will not win any awards for cinematography (ish) or visual effects (nope), but may reside on a few living room shelves of those who appreciate a shining actress and a nearly-too-sweet storyline.",Ella Enchanted
198,vampyrgrl,Unworthy Adaptation,3,18 February 2005,"I have both read 'Ella Enchanted' and seen the movie and I have to say that the film version does not do the story justice. While many people complain about movie adaptations of their favorite books, I feel I have the right to say something about this.While Gail Carson Levine's novel is an original, inspired story with deep, multi-dimensional characters, the movie is anything but. The characters in the movie are watered-down, two-dimensional versions of their original selves. Char and Ella, instead of being strong and independent, are shallow and predictable. Hattie and Dame Olga, instead of being horribly cruel and unfair are instead merely mildly annoying. And Mandy is just a farce of her original character, acting completely and utterly ridiculous. 'Ella Enchanted' is a story about character development and inner strength. Without the wonderful characters, it falls apart.And that's not even taking into consideration the changes in plot. While the book doesn't have a central 'bad guy', that doesn't mean it lacks plot or creativity. Yet Hollywood seems unable to grasp this, instead deciding to add a one dimensional 'bad guy' and change major aspects (that did not need to be changed) of the plot.I was sorely disappointed in this adaptation. Instead of wonderfully recreating a brilliant story, it instead turned it into a vapid, shallow teen movie that is no different from the generic drivel being produced in Hollywood nowadays except for its setting in an enchanted kingdom.",Ella Enchanted

I actually liked the movie up until people started singing. It was a good song and all, but obviously aimed at little kids. The basic storyline was similar to the book, but the book was SOO much better. The elf was random and tried too hard to provide humor. Hattie and Olive were obviously supposed to be funny but they just looked stupid. Ella was good, and I loved her friend. Char got on my nerves a little. The scene where Ella is forced to harm Char was amazing, very powerful, probably the best part of the whole movie. Overall I enjoyed seeing it once, but the second time I saw it I was bored to death.

Gail Carson Levine created a wonderful and well-written story that I highly recommend for everyone. But this movie has no right to bear the same title as that wonderful book. It has almost nothing to do with it. I could find no plot in this movie. And there were countless reference to Twenty-first century life. When used well and in moderation, this can be very funny and only make a movie better. But, as with the rest of the movie, they went too far. I am aware that movie makers have to cut out certain parts of books made into films, but they took out key parts and replaced them with things that were idiotic and made no sense. The stupid musical numbers and narration that Eric Idle is much to good for only made this moronic, low-brow excuse of a movie make even less sense.",Ella Enchanted

The movie has some singing and dancing that are actually done quite well. There are references to the present which can prove to be quite funny.

205,Alliehop,A travesty,1,27 August 2005,"This is the first time I've felt compelled to write a movie review. But ""Ella Enchanted"" was my favorite childhood book, and this movie completely butchered it.As a stand alone movie, it's a mediocre, predictable Shrek rip-off. But as a book adaptation, it's a travesty. The only similarities between the book and this movie are the characters' names. The plot has been twisted into an unrecognizable mess with the name ""Ella Enchanted"" slapped onto it. Whereas the book was truly funny, heartbreaking, imaginative, and magical, the movie relies on cheap, tacky slapstick humor and sentimentality. Why, why, WHY, did they discard the wonderful ideas in the book (sliding down stair rails, the Cinderella parallels) and add inane ideas instead (like the evil uncle and annoying singing and dancing routines)? There have been some truly good, faithful to the book adaptations (the BBC's ""Pride and Prejudice"" is one example). This doesn't come close. Please, don't bother watching this movie.

I have to say that Anne was just beautiful and it's a shame that she didn't have a better script. The chemistry between her and the prince was truly ""enchanting"" and sweet. They are the only reason that I'm not giving this one star. Perhaps the author of the book was taken over by her own spell, where she was ""too obedient"" and let Hollywood do whatever the heck they wanted with her beautiful book, turning it into a big hot mess.

If they wanted to make their own movie, they should have instead of fooling us into thinking it would be the Ella Enchanted us girls read when we were little and admired because of its interesting storyline.

208,frenchymr04,What is wrong with Hollywood?,1,8 June 2005,I am an Ella Enchanted book fan. I think that the book was a great read for people of all ages. When i first heard that a movie was going to come out i was excited because i had always thought it would make a great movie. That excitement soon faded away once i saw the preview then the actual movie. The director did a horrible job in turning the book into a movie. The whole story line was practically changed and the whole trying to make the book more modern was a horrible idea. Not only did the book change the story line but it also changed the mood and tone of the whole idea. The movie was so bad that even if i had not read the book and only watched the movie I would have thought the worst of it also.,Ella Enchanted
209,ecknigh,Fun movie to put you in a great mood!,8,25 February 2015,"Ella Enchanted incorporates real life characters with a magical fairytale-like world. The plot combines a romantic love story with humor and action and adventure, which makes this movie perfect for brightening your mood. One could say that this movie has a lack of originality. The plot much resembles that of the Cinderella Story. Like the character Cinderella, Ella is misfortune with an evil stepmother and two sisters, who strive to make Ella's life miserable. Also, Cinderella's stepsisters try to intervene in Cinderella's relationship with the prince, just as Olive and Hattie (Ella's stepsisters), try to prevent Ella from marrying Prince Charmont. A difference in these two stories however, is that Cinderella's godmother helps her, whereas Ella's godmother is the source of her problems. Although this movie was intended for a younger audience, I would recommend not allowing very young children to watch it. There are bar scenes that show many intoxicated people, and Lucinda is also drunk in a few scenes. Although surrounded by alcohol at the bar scene, Prince Charmont and Ella do not participate in such activities, which may serve as a good example to young children. However, the script of the movie contains slightly crude humor that some parents may consider inappropriate for their younger children. At several moments during the movie, I was frustrated with Ella's situation. For example, since Ella was forced to kill Char because Edgar ordered her too, the simple solution would seem to be for Ella to tell someone to order her not to follow Edgar's command. Perhaps the curse would not make that possible, but the exact parameters of the curse were not explicitly stated in the movie. Another part of the movie that was frustrating is that Ella kept her curse a secret from Prince Charmont. I understand why she didn't tell anyone else, because they would just take advantage of her. It would have made her life much easier if she had told Char about her curse, especially when Edgar ordered her to kill Char. However, Ella not telling Char about the curse is what makes the proposal scene and the rest of the movie more suspenseful. In the beginning of the movie when Ella's mother is passing, her mother tells her ""what's inside you is stronger than any spell"". I didn't realize until towards the end of the movie that this foreshadowed the proposal scene. Ella's love for Prince Charmont was so strong that it defeated her dreadful curse. In the moment where Ella is holding the dagger over Char's head, she is overwhelmed with her mother's voice saying, ""What's inside you is stronger than any curse"". I think that is an excellent use of this quote, especially since it was her mother's advice and last words. Ella Enchanted was released in 2004, but the movie soundtrack consists of some songs dating back to the seventies. ""Somebody to Love"" by Queen, is played when Ella is ordered to sing and dance in the bar at Giantville. Instead of joining in, Char stands back and watches Ella. Because of the lyrics and the moment of time in the movie, I thought that something climatic was going to happen regarding their relationship, but nothing happened. I was disappointed that Char didn't join Ella in dancing because it would have been the first romantic moment between them. The closing song is from the 90's – ""Don't' Go Breaking My Heart"" by Elton John and RuPaul. In this final scene, the entire cast is in the castle. Regardless of each character's role in the movie, good or evil, they all join together in dancing. The choreography is more cheesy than impressive, but that's one of the reasons why this movie is great for a younger audience.",Ella Enchanted
210,Kuty712,"An Abomination, and a Waste of a Superb Story",1,26 August 2005,"If you've ever read Ella Enchanted, you will be shocked that a movie studio couldso thoroughly ruin an excellent story. At it's heart, Ella Enchanted(the book), is a story of love, frustration, and other human emotions.Although you may find yourself smiling at times, it is more of a romantic/angsty fairytale than a comedic fairytale, complete with one graying fairy godmother, two banister-sliding protagonists, and three masque balls (excluding Sir Peter's and Dame Olga's wedding reception). What Ella Enchanted does NOT contain is an evil talking snake. When Ella finally is able to find the strength to save not only herself, but Char and the entire kingdom, you are so happy for her that, chances are, you cry. As a matter of fact, I would say I cried more than I laughed reading this book.Watching the movie, I was speechless. It was extremely tacky and went for cheap, easy laughs. At best I can call it a poor imitation of Shrek, except that would be an insult to the highly entertaining Shrek. There is no place in Ella Enchanted for an evil royal uncle and his talking serpent, and definitely no place for a singing Ella, or a dancing cast. (Nor a screaming fan club!). The well-developed character of Areida, which I'm sure Parminder Nagra could have played well, was cut down to a mere cameo.This movie lacked human emotion. Ella was not nearly as frustrated as any normal person would be at her curse. (Hello? She breaks out in song and dance!) Don't get me started on the range of emotions Areida could have covered. And of course Hattie is way too obnoxious and not nearly as manipulative (read: not obviously annoying, but cruel) as she could have been. If it were one actor's performance I would call it poor acting. In this case, I would have to lay my blame almost entirely on the director and screenwriters. With such promising material, they managed to create an hour and a half of rubbish.Even the movie's visuals gave it a much more modern feel, with colors too vibrant for any over the age of 4. Half the time I felt like I was watching the Teletubbies. I would say the maximum age that these cheap laughs could amuse is 8 years old.I read the book when I was probably around 10 or so, and have read it innumerable times since then. It truly appeals to all ages, because, unlike its movie version, it deals with true emotions, not cheap humor and anachronisms, which, honestly, do not add to the story.In short, forget the movie, read the book!",Ella Enchanted

In the book she is a girl wise beyond her years, a bit clumsy, but for the most part she is rebellious and has a fire about her; she draws you in and you can't help but be captivated. Although seemingly strong in the beginning she turns into a lovesick damsel in distress about halfway through the film.Moving to Char, my main complaint is how they brought about his relationship with Ella. How are we supposed to believe that he is ready to marry Ella within about one weeks time? It is possible, but unlikely. The book gave Ella and Char what....a couple years filled with meetings and a friendship and letters....especially Char's incredible last letter to Ella! They make him out to be less charming in the movie...in the book Char had insight as to how to run the kingdom. In the movie he didn't even give an effort to his kingdom's well being. Of course they had to play around with minor characters as well. Mandy turns into a young, clumsy oaf of a fairy, and there is no mention of her being Ella's fairy godmother. Ella's father, who I thought to be more snide and disinterested in his daughter's life, turns into a loving, caring parent (probably a better image for the younger audience but still). Whenever I read the book I always thought that Ella's father evoked a bit of Billy Zane's character in 1997's Titanic (Billy Zane played Cal, Rose's fiancé, a man more interested in money than anything else). They could have given more thought and emotion to Areida's character (hell they could have given her an actual role!) and don't even get me started on the horrible invention that is Char's uncle Edgar. The only idea worse than his character was the idea that he should have a CGI snake! They even had to fool around with Dame Olga and company!Finally the plot. They left out some of my favorite scenes! When Ella and Char walk in the menagerie and see the centaur, the boarding school idea is left out, the wonderful budding romance we are given hints to at Ella's father's wedding, and the three balls that would have been amazing to see! It's almost as if within the process of weeding out minor details they decided to completely rearrange the story plot line. Above all the movie did have its good aspects, however they force the film to fall under the category of cutesy children's fairy tale instead of the beautiful coming of age story it should have been. They took a book that helped countless young girls become independent and turned it into a hapless ""happily ever after once the villain is slain"" tale that demerits the type of woman young girls should strive to be. When will Hollywood stop taking the soul out of literature?",Ella Enchanted
212,chanigihic,Complete Sh*t,1,7 November 2015,"First off, this movie was disastrously bad for raising my children and saving my failing marriage. The themes are god-awful, and promote an Orwellian existential nightmare. Honestly, the acting is wooden all throughout. They utilized a literal wooden puppet for Anne Hathaway(or at least they had to, because her acting was so stiff and robotic). The story was moody and depressing, and honestly, a little insensitive to African Americans. This is the sort of film that gives us Americans a bad name. I'd give it a 0/10 if I could because it's so bad, but I'd rather just go watch Grey's Anatomy. Grey's Anatomy is a show that succeeds on all fronts and delivers exactly what this movie is lacking in...substance.",Ella Enchanted
213,Luv2dance767,Tear Tear,10,31 July 2005,"Do you know what's sad? I have only seen this movie once. And I love it so much. Man. This is one of Ann Hathaway's best. It's really inspiring. WOW. I Love it. It's really... I can't explain it. It's amazing, really it is. I really want to add it to my collection. Some day? It made me cry. It did. Did you know you have to right 10 lines for this review thing? SHESH! I only have a few. Well. IT was good. yup.. And I like Ann's Hair. yup. It was wonderful....uh-huh.... I want to be an actress so bad. Really. It's just amazing. I Love it. I hope fairy tales come true. I hope my dream of becoming an actress comes true. If you are a director and are reading this could you please e-mail me. ANd If you are not don't e-mail me please. I get to much Junk mail anyway. La la la......do do do......OK I think this is 10 lines...I hope so....""to be or not to be!"" OK LEaving...sorry! Adios! CHEWBACCA ROCKS! ~ KRisten",Ella Enchanted

215,absurdlyme,fell flat,5,30 September 2005,"i have read the book version of Ella Enchanted and it still remains to be one of my favorites. It's magically without being babyish and with just the right amount of humor, wit, and romance. So naturally i went to see the movie version with high hopes. What i got, ahem was singing. the movie brought me to tears with it's butchering of a great story, with its needs to make the story more modern. It's disloyalty to the book made the story seem just silly and without purpose. that's not to say i thought the actors were bad. not true, most of the them were in fact charming and of course nicely played. To those who haven't the book, the movie is simply put, just nice. To those who have, it falls flat.",Ella Enchanted
216,robotheadloner,Awesome movie! The plot is straight forward and clear with a great twist.,10,24 October 2018,"It was very entertaining. The plot is clear. The main protagonist has a clear goal in her mind. There are some funny scenes that bring laugh to me, but the reason behind it, the big 'how' that the protagonist got into that position made me cringe for a while. The plot reflected a concept of our everyday life that we usually don't even notice or realize how important it is and simplify it into a fairy tale.I would recommend this movie for everyone who want to see some new and kinda modernize medieval fairy-tale style movie with the main plot not about cliche love or romance as the center of the plot.",Ella Enchanted
217,hhrforever,"Winner of the ""Worst Adaptation Ever"" Award!",1,19 December 2005,"Warning--if you have read the book, do not see the movie--you WILL become violently ill! O'Haver, the director, looked at the story (a beautiful, classic book by Gail Levine that everyone should read), and decided that he didn't like the current plot--so he made up a new one, and still had the gall to say that it was ""based"" on Levine's masterpiece of a book (kudos to ""I, Robot"" for actually being truthful and honest enough to say that the movie was ""inspired"" by the books--it's something for O'Haver to one day aspire to). He also made up new characters and changed the old characters to fit his new plot--Char's parents are dead, and there's a new evil uncle (Elwes) with a cheesy snake servant who is trying to kill Char and take over the crown--there's also a new elf friend of Ella's who wants to be a lawyer (can you say Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer?), but is forced to only sing and dance by this new evil and tyrannical uncle created by O'Haver--ogres are also now not evil, but only ""misunderstood""! And Ella's father is nice and caring, Mandy is no longer her caring, sensible fairy godmother, but a ditz and a magical klutz, and the wonderful old-fashioned world created by Levine has been warped and cheapened by the director so that it's a faux modern world (the modern costumes add to the cheap and fake look of the film). Overall, the movie bears little resemblance to the book in anything but the title and character names, and is the worst adaptation I have ever seen, as well as a silly and stupid movie in itself. Hathaway does indeed reprise her role in Princess Diaries (another terrible adaptation with changed character names, setting, roles, etc, though not as bad as this one)--to the extent that there's even a debate scene that mirrors the one in Princess almost exactly (forget finishing school--they have modern school in the movie!).In short, don't waste your money on this film--use the money instead to read Ella Enchanted--believe me, you'll get much better and higher quality entertainment this way, for a lesser cost!",Ella Enchanted
218,eva_mckenzie,"Horrible waste of time, and worse if you read the book.",3,12 January 2006,"I read the book and I thought it was such an original and cool story. So here they make a movie of it. Naive, I thought it could be good. For some reason, they thought it would be cool to make it ""modern"" (ex: modern school, fan club) They completely changed the story, the characters,that evil uncle is just too dumb for words, Ella's friend was cut out of the story, and that snake was pathetic. Oh and the father was supposed to be kind of selfish, not at all as it was portrayed in this movie. The sisters were just horrid. Hattie was supposed to be cruel and manipulative, but instead she had a fake mean personnality. I was so disappointed that they could make such a horrible movie with that amazing book. This film is for 7 and under. I give it a 3 out of ten.",Ella Enchanted
219,johnk_222,Hardship !!,10,22 January 2006,"The reason why i wanted to give a comment is that, no because of the love at the end of the story. I was interested in the the hardship she had to take to overcome the spell given to her. Because I too have tough time in my life and that gave me a motivation, to be determine to try ,try and try till i Succeed. No matter what comes on the way.I also like the princess choosing the correct girl in marriage.Please give me your comments in what you have read above and Please do advise me. Thankyou, John",Ella Enchanted
220,thegreenbastard,The greatest disappointment I've ever had,1,8 August 2006,"As a kid, ""Ella Enchanted"" was one of my favorite books of all time, still is. I must have read that book three times. You can imagine how excited I was when I found out they'd made the movie. Yeah, sure I knew it would be more of a kid's movie, but I was still interested.However the movie did the book absolutely no justice what-so ever. The storyline wasn't even close to the book in any way, the movie should have had a different title altogether for all I was concerned. Yes, it was a children's movie, but it was so incredibly cheesy, that I could have shred the DVD, and sprinkled it on my homemade pizza. The characters were fake, the singing was lame, and Anne's acting was sub-par at the best of times. They had so much potential and used none of it. The book implies a world full of visual wonder, characters full of emotion and life, and conflicts and situations that are serious and offer great character development-and all of these points are completely in conflict with what the movie provides. If you are interested in this movie, please take my advice, read the book and leave the movie alone!",Ella Enchanted
221,chatoyant_8,"Horrible Adaptation, but overall a very ""feel-good-about-yourself"" movie.",6,7 January 2008,"SPOILERS Ella Enchanted must truly be one of the worse, most off-story movie adaptation of a wonderful novel. Nevertheless, it is a feel-good film that is enjoyable to watch over and over again, without getting boring.I myself had read the book and was thrilled to hear that there was a movie adaptation. So i brought the DVD, and...sat through the whole film correcting the inaccuracy of the tale. The director was a fool to waste the wonderful storyline in the book. Instead, he transformed the classic, Cinderella-like story into a typical Hollywood cheap crowd-pleaser.The story starts with Ella's curse taking part. It follows some of the things she does, and establishes her character. Then, suddenly out of the blue her kind dad (whom was evil and selfish in the book) marries Dame Olga, whose daughter Olive and Hattie, whom the latter is president of the Prince Char Fan Club. The movie follows through with Ella getting the best of them, and eventually getting serious with Prince Char. And Blah Blah Blah Blah....I despise the director into making up totally unrealistic portrayals of the characters in the book. Hattie, is the President of the made-up Prince Char Fan Club, portraying Prince Char as a hunky, dreamy teen who girls drool over. In fact, in the novel, Char was a soft-spoken, kind guy whom nobody drooled over, and was all serious king-ship business. Also, they portrayed Olive as over-stupid and although she was very comical, i can't help but despise her lack of common knowledge. In the book, she was not THAT dumb. Slannen, who was totally changed in the move, WASN'T an elf who wanted to be a LAWYER! Who had ever heard of a thing like that! Its pure stupidity and comical effects to put him in there. Slannen was a much smaller, supporting role in the novel, being the generous chief Trader in the elves, whom gave Ella some precious gifts. Arieda, another horrible portrayal, wasn't a little girl being pushed around during pre-school. She was an Ayorthian who was Ella's best friend. Parminder Nagra was totally underused and was wrongly pictured. There are lots of other wrong portrayals. READ THE BOOK AND FIND OUT.What i didn't like about this film is the old conventional way the plot follows. I didn't like the way the director took so little from the novel (apart from Ella and Char's characters) and pushed the story into a predictable fairytale. The main characters fall in love, the Evil man dies, the evil stepsisters suffer, the Evil Stepmother loses etc...However, from my not-so-friendly review so far, you would think i hated the movie. Although VERY VERY wrongly portrayed, i finally started to think it wasn't so bad after my 8th screening on my TV. I watched it 8 times, yes, 8 times before it got tolerable. I quite like the singing and i'm a sucker for romance, even if its just fairy-tale Prince-Princess thing.Anne Hathaway was alright as Ella, although she could have been more free-spirited and confident. Hugh Dancy was eye-candy to me...nothing special here except he's very handsome!! I happen to think Anne and Hugh would make a good couple! I enjoyed Slannen's performance and Jimi Mistrys too. Minnie Driver was the one i didn't like. I think this is one of her weakest performances yet. She absolutely sucked as Mandy (not to mention she is supposed to be plump).Overall, solid performances and a very typical fairy tale makes this movie a good one to watch over and over and over again. On rainy nights and sad times, this will cheer you up, although you might groan of predictable-ness. However, this is a very poor adaptation of the book and i would not recommend any one who has read the book to watch this movie. You might just puke.",Ella Enchanted
222,catcmack,Not worth your time,1,24 March 2006,"This movie is based on an award winning book by Gail Carson Levine. This movie completely ruins the book. I like the casting for the step family and for Ella and prince Char, but everyone else falls flat in comparison to the characters described in the book. Some of the movie characters aren't even in the book or are only mentioned in the book but given big roles in the movie. The plot is also radically changed, and while the book is to long and has to much to put all of it in the movie, not all of the changes were for the best. The movie comes off trying to be Shrek, when the book itself has a tone more like the Lord of the Rings books or the Chronicles of Narnia books. The writing is sloppy and childish, and by changing some of the key characters like Mandy and Lucinda the movie loses some of the impact that made the book great. The movie has some good parts, but overall it's not worth watching unless you're young and can't yet read. Go read the book, it's a million times better. 1 out of 10. Awful",Ella Enchanted
