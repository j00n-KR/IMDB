0,Leofwine_draca,Gory superhero twist,5,10 March 2020,"BRIGHTBURN is a horror genre twist on the superhero genre that can basically be described as a dark version of SUPERMAN. The extremely light plot sees a baby delivered to Earth in a meteorite and brought up by a childless couple; a few years later it transpires he's evil. I found this one severely lacking in terms of depth and narrative intrigue; it's a literal take-it-as-it-is kind of story in which the cast is ill-serviced by the shallow material. Saying that, the film benefits from solid direction and decent effects; there are also a string of surprisingly graphic set-pieces which help to retain the viewer's attention.",Brightburn
1,Prismark10,Brightburn,3,13 October 2019,"Brightburn is essentially a twisted evil Superman origin story.A childless couple Kyle and Tori Breyer adopt a baby boy whose alien craft lands on their rural farm. Brandon is like a normal child until he turns 12 years old.Then Brandon exhibits erratic strange behaviour. He has dark thoughts which manifests in his drawings and writings in his scrapbook. Brandon injures a girl at school and when he feels threatened by someone, he goes to kill them in horrible ways. Eventually even his parents realize that their sweet boy no longer exists as Brandon manifests special powers.Produced by James Gunn who made the Guardians of the Galaxy movies and written by his family members. This should had been an interesting 'what if' take on the superhero genre.Instead Brighburn opts to become a dumb, violent slasher horror film. More Friday the 13th and The Omen as Brandon is the child you cannot harm.",Brightburn
2,claudio_carvalho,Bleak and Pessimist,7,12 August 2019,"Sometimes we watch a film that does not end the way we want (or expect). ""Brightburn"" is one of those films. The story begins almost as a rip-off ""Smallville"", with a boy from another planet raised by farmers in Brightburn, Kansas. However when adolescence comes, the powerful boy turns into an evil creature instead of a conventional hero. And from this moment on, he becomes a cruel being incapable to be destroyed and the film has a bleak, pessimist and unpleasant conclusion. Is ""Brightburn"" a bad movie? No, but probably will not please many viewers. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Brightburn - Filho das Trevas"" (""Brightburn - Son of the Shadows"")",Brightburn
3,nogodnomasters,Take The World,6,26 May 2019,"In the first 10 minutes, we are given the plot, minus some details. A farm couple in Brightburn, Kansas pray for a child and get one in a spaceship from Krypton maybe. They raise Brandon as their own child who is very bright. It is all fun and games until he turns 12 and then it becomes a different film from science fiction to science slasher.The film was fairly decent but could have been better. PLOT SPOILER: It was fun watching Elizabeth Banks die a horrible death.GuideL F-word. No sex or nudity.",Brightburn
4,kosmasp,"Is it a bird, is it a plane ...",7,2 August 2019,What would rhyme with that? Hmmm ... now maybe you've read the summary so you know. Or you just heard that it's a superhero horror movie. And boy is it a horror movie. This indeed is not meant to be shown to kids - level of violence is through the roof - no pun intended.As with many horror movies it does contain quite a few cliches - one of them characters being unable to see what is right in front of them. So while certain things could have been avoided ... it would not have made a good movie or only a short one. This aims to please or cover a certain base of viewers. You should know if you belong to them,Brightburn
5,classicsoncall,"""He is something we found in the woods.""",7,4 December 2019,"Not much creatively new or original here except for the idea of a potential super-hero gone bad. I had to groan when Tori Breyer (Elizabeth Banks) revealed the space ship her son landed in. It was derivative of the the story of baby Kal-el who eventually grew up to become Superman. Instead, and with no development of the character, Brandon Breyer (Jackson A. Dunn) grew up to be so evil that his own father took him hunting in order to put a bullet in his head. Bad move there, Dad; that heat vision only works one way. The film is presented as a horror flick, and there's your expected share of gore I guess, but the premise offered so much more and couldn't deliver. There's one scene that will make you squirm when the baby sitter takes a glass sliver to the eye, and if it happened to you, the film would be unwatchable. For anyone else, it still is.",Brightburn
6,jboothmillard,Brightburn,6,20 March 2020,"I heard about this film a little bit during its release, and film critic Mark Kermode talked about it on BBC News The Film Review, I had an idea of the concept of it, so I was looking forward to seeing what it had to offer. Basically, in 2006, in Brightburn, Kansas, a spaceship crash-lands on a farm owned by Tori (Elizabeth Banks) and Kyle Breyer (David Denman), who have been trying but failing to conceive a child. Inside the ship they find an infant child, the couple adopt it as their own and name him Brandon. They hide the spaceship in the barn cellar and decide to hide the truth from him. Twelve years later, Brandon (Jackson A. Dunn) has been drawn to an alien message transmitting from the hidden ship. He sleepwalks to the barn and tries to open the locked cellar, but Tori stops him before he can do so. The next day, whilst trying to mow the lawn, he struggles to start the lawnmower and inadvertently launches it into the air, tossing it far away. He approaches the overturned mower still running. Curious of his newfound abilities, he is shocked to find he can stop the turning blades with his hand. Brandon displays high intelligence in school, which other students tease him about, apart from the classmate Caitlyn (Emmie Hunter). Brandon celebrates his twelfth birthday with his parents at the diner, where Tori's mother Erica (Becky Wahlstrom) works as a waitress, along the parents' friends Noah (Matt Jones) and Merilee McNichol (Meredith Hagner). Noah gives Brandon a hunting rifle, which Kyle refuses to let Brandon have. Brandon becomes very angry at not having his gift, causing a scene, so Tori and Kyle take him home immediately. The next morning Kyle suspects there is something wrong with Brandon as he finds he chewed and mangled his fork. While Tori finds photos of lingerie and swimsuit models, surgical diagrams, and graphic photos of human organs in Brandon's room. Brandon, Kyle, and Tori take a camping trip, and Kyle attempts to talk to Brandon about sexual things, because he is exhibiting signs of puberty. Encouraged by his father's talk, Brandon sneaks away from the campsite and travels to Caitlyn's house, hiding in her room until she notices him. After returning home, Kyle observes the chickens in their coop terrified of Brandon, and later that night, finds they have been slaughtered and the door taken off. Kyle insists Brandon is responsible, but Tori insists it was an animal attack. During an exercise at school, Caitlyn accused Brandon of being a pervert, so he crushes her hand in retaliation. He is suspended and required to meet with his aunt Merilee, the school counsellor, but Erica demands that Brandon be arrested. That night at home, Brandon is drawn to the ship again, he breaks the lock on the cellar door and is seen by Tori levitating above it, chanting the ship's message. Her interruption causes him to fall and cut himself on the spaceship, the first time he has ever been injured. Tori decides to reveal the truth about his arrival on Earth. Brandon, knowing the truth, leaves in anger, and finally deciphers the ship's message: ""Take the world."" In his rage, Brandon develops heat vision. Brandon visits Caitlyn with flowers, she tells him that her mother has forbidden her from talking to him. Wearing a red mask and cape, Brandon stalks Erica while at the diner, as she closes it, and murders her. Police investigate the scene, finding a symbol looking like two Bs back-to-back drawn on a window, and Erica has disappeared. The following day at school, Brandon threatens Merilee when she says she is required to report his previous actions to police. That night, Brandon stalks Merilee at her house until she goes to bed. Noah arrives home from the bar with Kyle and friends to find a masked Brandon hiding in the closet. Kyle threatens to tell his parents, prompting Brandon to lash out. Terrified, Noah tries to escape in his truck, but Brandon lifts and crashes the vehicle, killing Noah. He uses Noah's blood to draw the same symbol as before on the road. Brandon returns home, he lies about where he has been, and refuses to give his shirt to Tori, as it is covered in blood. A grieving Merilee calls Kyle and Tori, who meet her at the hospital to learn that Brandon had gone to her house, contradicting Brandon's story about playing soccer. The next morning, Tori and Kyle inform Brandon of Noah's death, but Brandon has no reaction, which alarms Tori and angers Kyle. When Kyle accuses Brandon and grabs him, Brandon violently shoves him. Kyle finds Brandon's blood-stained shirt and shows it to Tori, but she refuses to believe Brandon killed Noah. Kyle plans a hunting trip as an attempt to kill Brandon. Kyle points the gun at Brandon when his head is turned, he shoots him, but the bullet bounces off his head. Brandon kills Kyle with his heat vision. Meanwhile, Sheriff Deever (Gregory Alan Williams) arrives at the Breyers' house and asks Tori to see Brandon. Tori tells the sheriff that Kyle and Brandon aren't home, so he shows Tori the symbol found at the scenes of Erica's and Noah's deaths. Tori recognised the symbol from Brandon's previous drawings, but claims ignorance, and later finds Brandon's notebook with disturbing drawings of his murders and his message to ""take the world"". She realises that Kyle was right about Brandon. She attempts to call Kyle, but Brandon answers the phone and informs her that Kyle is gone. Brandon returns home and destroys the house as Tori calls the police, but Brandon brutally murders the sheriff and Deputy Aryes (Annie Humphrey). Remembering that the ship is Brandon's weakness, as it can harm him, Tori runs to the barn cellar. There she finds Erica's mutilated body nailed to a wall and surrounded by symbols in blood. Tori arms herself with a piece of the ship to stab Brandon during an embrace but fails when Brandon anticipates the attack. Enraged, Brandon flies Tori through the barn roof and above the clouds and drops her to her death. An airplane flies towards Brandon, and the scene goes dark. The next day, police, paramedics, and FBI are at the farm investigating the airplane crash, which killed everyone on board. Brandon is seen on the news as the only surviving resident of the area. During the credits, Brandon begins his worldwide attacks which is covered in various news reports. A conspiracy theorist named Big T (Michael Rooker) discusses assorted destruction in Brightburn, the existence of other super-beings, and pleads with humanity to act. Also starring Abraham Clinkscales as Royce, Christian Finlayson as Fauxhawk and Jennifer Holland as Ms. Espenschied. Banks gives a very good performance as the adoptive mother who defends her destructive son at many moments, and Dunn is obviously very sinister as the evil pubescent son and indestructible monster. It is essentially the origins of Superman, with similarities to the 1978 Christopher Reeve movie (a childless couple in Kansas adopt an extra-terrestrial boy with superpowers), but seeing what would have happened if he had gone in the other direction and turned into a supervillain. It is a clever twist on the traditional comic book-based genre movie, it it is well-played out, well-paced, very dark, and has slasher style jumps and gory moments, a worthwhile superhero horror. Good!",Brightburn
7,Tweekums,What if Superman were a sociopath,7,21 July 2021,"Tori and Kyle Breyer are a young couple living in Brightburn, a small town in Kansas. They long for a child but are unable to conceive. Then one night a craft crashes in the woods; in it Tori finds a baby boy. They see it as a gift, name him Brandon and raise him as their adopted son. He seems fairly normal apart from being exceptionally intelligent; then, as he reaches puberty he starts to change. He gradually becomes much stronger and develops superpowers; powers which he tries to hide from his parents. Occasionally they become obvious and anybody who crosses him or discovers his secret is in real danger... and if he isn't stopped the rest of the world might be too.This film is a fun mix of a superhero and horror genres. It starts at a fairly gentle pace but once it becomes apparent that Brandon isn't like other children the horror elements kick in. There aren't a lot of deaths but those that there are, are surprisingly gory. The idea of having somebody with superpowers who has no intention of helping anybody, has zero concern for others and a willingness to kill makes a nice change from those films centred on all the do-gooding superheroes. The way Brandon discovered his powers and quickly started to abuse them was handled well enough although it might have been good to have a couple of off screen incidents before showing us his darker side so it wasn't obvious he was bad so soon... that is a minor quibble though. The special effects are pretty good; making the gory scenes disturbingly impressive. The actors do a fine job bringing their characters to life. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of horror and superheroes... it could almost be an origin story for a new character in TV series 'The Boys'.",Brightburn
8,BA_Harrison,Super psycho.,7,29 November 2019,"Brightburn is what I would call a 'What if?' movie, where the makers take a well-established idea and ask 'What if...?'. In this case, 'What if baby Superman came to Earth and, instead of using his powers for good, grew up to be a nasty little git capable of extreme violence?'.The film opens as the prayers of childless couple Tori and Kyle Breyer (Elizabeth Banks and David Denman) are answered, a spaceship crashing near their farm, the occupant a baby boy. Naming the child Brandon and raising him as their own, the Breyers are happy until their 'son' hits puberty. With raging hormones comes the urge to do whatever the hell he wants, no matter who he hurts in the process.Produced by James Gunn, written by Brian and Mark Gunn, and directed by David Yarovesky, Brightburn is technically proficient, with impressive special effects, great cinematography, and fine performances all round (youngster Jackson A. Dunn is surprisingly good as Brandon, and Banks proves she can act far better than she can direct). There are quite a few effective scenes of tension, and some gnarly moments of gore (one character losing his jaw bone is especially unsettling).On the whole, I had a good time with this twisted take on the familiar Superman story, although the bleak ending did leave me a little less than satisfied: with the issue of Brandon's reign of terror left unresolved, the whole film felt like it was merely setting the scene for a more expansive sequel (something I wouldn't be averse to, but I can't help but feel a bit cheated).6.5 out 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",Brightburn
9,paul_haakonsen,Surprisingly enjoyable...,6,22 June 2019,"Alright, well ""Brightburn"" was definitely a movie that snuck in from the sideline. This particular addition to the superhero genre was a much needed and welcomed addition. And I must say, as I am not a particular fan of the superhero genre, then ""Brightburn"" was a lovely refreshing change of air.While ""Brightburn"" in its entire wholesome is by no means a masterpiece, then it is definitely a memorable and outstanding movie in the sense that it uproots the superhero genre and makes it a darker and turning it into a 'what if the person imbued with super powers turned out to be vile and evil...'. And that was definitely an approach to the genre that I enjoyed. So thumbs up to writers Brian Gunn and Mark Gunn for this accomplishment.It was a movie that borrowed heavily from the Superman lore, but it was actually good with a 'what if he turns out to be evil' twist on the origins of Superman.There were some pretty nice visual effects in the movie as well, which definitely helped add enjoyment to the movie. And director David Yarovesky took this to a very visceral level in some of the death scenes where Brandon Breyer (played quite well by Jackson A. Dunn) killed some people.For me it is always refreshing to watch a movie where I am not familiar with the actors and actresses, as that means that there are no associations to previously portrayed characters. So that was definitely a thumbs up for ""Brightburn"". The movie was quite nicely carried by the likes of Jackson A. Dun, David Denman and Elizabeth Banks.While ""Brightburn"" is not going to be a classic, it is definitely a movie that is well worth taking the time and effort to sit down and watch. I enjoyed the movie from start to end.",Brightburn
10,BandSAboutMovies,Interesting take on Superman,6,21 December 2019,"Comic books had several decades before the dark side of heroics - remember the grim and gritty eighies? - became a big deal. There have been comics like Watchmen, MiracleMan and Rick Veitch's Maximortal that showed exactly what would happen if superheroes were either not raised properly or left unchecked.Brightburn feels really close to those last two books, but allows superhero movies to finally find their dark side.Produced by James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy, Slither) and written by his cousin Mark and brother Brian, Brightburn is all about Brandon Breyer (ah, an alliterative nickname, well done comics fans), who is really an alien who crash landed in a Kansas town where his adoptive parents Tori (Elizabeth Banks) and Kyle (David Denman) have tried to raise him as normally as possible. Then again, there's that spaceship he crash landed in, hidden in the barn, that keeps calling to him.Brandon has turned into an overachiever in school, which means that he's shunned by the other kids, except for a girl named Caitlyn. However, his nascent puberty and realization that his powers make him superior to humanity mean that things won't end happily for anyone involved.This movie ended up being way better than I had hoped, moving into more horror movie than superheroic effort. The scenes of Brandon's abilities being used on normal flesh and blood humans are incredibly startling. There's also a glass to the eye scene that would have made Lucio Fulci proud.If the school that Brandon attends looks familiar, that's because it's Patrick Henry High School in Stockbridge, Georgia, the same school where seasons 1 and 2 of Stranger Things were filmed.In the end credits, Michael Rooker plays a YouTube conspiracy theorist named the Big T. He shows what is basically a dark version of the Justice League, with a sea creature instead of Aquaman, a witch with ropes who could be Wonder Woman, an alien being and even the Crimson Bolt, who was Rainn Wilson's character in James Gunn's movie Super.Brightburn is an intriguing take on superhero movies. Just be prepared - this has more gore than nearly every movie we've seen this year.",Brightburn
11,LeonLouisRicci,BIZARRO...LOW-BUDGET...HORROR-SUPERHERO HYBRID..FEELS NEGLECTED,7,10 September 2021,"We Need to Talk About the Consequences of a Neglected Child. Most Likely the Outcome will Lean Toward the Negative.This Film from the Dunn Family and others Feels Neglected with just the Bare Minimums to Attain a Theatrical Release and Avoid the Usual Dismissals of its Low-Budget Brothers.

Content with the Source Inspirations and Not Much Effort to Expand and Make it Their Own.It has a Laziness about it that Fosters No Favors in the Art it is Creating and as a Result the Public, Critics, and Anyone Considering it might Sense a Short-Change Fraud at Worst and Indifference at Best.Worth a Watch with a Hope for the Sequels to Find a Conviction for the Conceit.",Brightburn
12,CinemaSerf,More of a damp squib.,5,24 November 2019,"I have always found the idea that every superhero has to be a goody two-shoes makes me want to reach for a bucket. Here, I thought, at last, an all powerful being that comes to Earth - à la Superman - but turns out to be an evil little Zod. Well that was the premiss. Sadly, the execution is lacklustre and uninventive. Jackson Dunn - with/without his red eyes - is about as menacing as a goldfish and sometimes the whole thing borders on the laughable. I was the only person at the screening - speaks volumes.",Brightburn
13,zardoz-13,Villain Burning Brightly in This Super Villain Adventure!!!,10,3 June 2019,"Mash up ""Superman"" with ""The Omen,"" and you've got the elements of ""Hive"" director David Yarovesky's ""Brightburn,"" co-starring Elizabeth Banks, David Denman, and newcomer Jackson Dunn. No, this isn't your ordinary, standard-issue, run-of-the-mill, superhero 'origins' saga, since our hero amounts to an anti-hero. Nevertheless, ""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island"" scenarists Brian Gunn and Mark Gunn have patently recycled the basics of ""Superman,"" but they have turned everything upside down for something radically different. Meantime, despite its grim finality, Yarovesky has presented this bizarre material with style, irony, and gore. If you've ever rooted for evil supervillains to triumph when you knew they never could, ""Brightburn"" is a breath of fresh air! Clocking in at a meager 91-minutes, this atmospheric but larger-than-life yarn generates enough atmospheric dystopia and ambiguity to keep you captivated. In a typical Hollywood release, the villains are doomed always to destruction. Such is not the case with ""Brightburn."" Mind you, ""Brightburn"" is no ""Avengers: Infinity Wars."" Indeed, ""Brightburn"" is neither a Disney/Marvel release nor a Warner Bros./DC Comics release. Interestingly enough, James Gunn-who helmed the two ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" extravaganzas-served as producer, while Brian and Mark are two of his three younger brothers. Altogether, ""Brightburn"" clashes with the cultural imperative that all superheroes must defend the rights of the weak and the innocent. By the time you finish watching this R-rated movie, you may wonder if it isn't a fluke of nature. Do the filmmakers plan to pursue a franchise? And if so, who will they conjure up to pit against their youthful villain? Some hints about the future can be found at the end of ""Brightburn"" as an unhinged YouTube conspiracy theorist (Michael Rooker) rants about government efforts to cover up the appearance of two enigmatic superheroes, vaguely similar to DC's Aquaman and Wonder Woman! Believe me, you've never seen anything like ""Brightburn."" This low-budget, $6 million adventure has already coined twice its budget!Kyle (David Denman of ""Logan Lucky"") and Tori Breyer (Elizabeth Banks of ""The Hunger Games"") are a married couple who desperately want a child, but they have had no luck. One evening when they are trying again to impregnate Tori, they hear a loud smashing racket, and something in the woods surrounding their farm bursts into flames. The next thing we know the Breyers are shooting home videos of an adorable infant that survived the crash of an unidentified flying object. After adequate voice narration about their new addition, ""Brightburn"" makes a giant decade-long leap, and their adopted son Brandon (Jackson A. Dunn of ""Avengers: Endgame"") finds himself in junior high school and on the verge of puberty. Brandon is kind of a know-it-all nerd who alienates himself quickly from his classmates when he provides ad infinitum answers to his science teacher's questions. Initially, one of his other classmates, Caitlyn (Emmie Hunt of ""Forever My Girl""), tells him smart guys finish first. Things between these two youngsters, however, don't go as planned. Brandon lives with Kyle and Tori on a farm. In fact, they live in Kansas, but we never see them actually farming. Kyle raises chickens, and he owns a vast amount of acreage. They have a sprawling barn with two silos, but we never see them herding livestock. Meantime, Kyle and Tori have made the barn off-limits to Brandon because he could hurt himself playing in there. Secretly, they have stashed the weird spacecraft that brought him to Earth in a cellar in the barn. Tori loves Brandon with all her heart and soul, while Kyle is struggling still with fatherhood. At one point, to alleviate Brandon's own sense of horror about life on Earth, he feeds him candy, and it calms Brandon down. Until he has trouble cranking up a lawn mower, Brandon has lived a relatively normal, down-to-Earth life. When the lawn mower doesn't crank, he experiences an unusual fit of rage and hurls the machine like a javelin into the sky. The mower flies about a half-mile before it plunges into a field. Brandon rushes out to inspect it. Ironically, the mower lands upside down, so its single blade is seen whirling in a visible blur. Strangely enough, Brandon thrusts his bare hand into it, and the blade abruptly stops turning with a screech. The youth examines his hand and cannot believe the blade didn't rip a hole in it. Thereafter, things take a turn for the worse not only for Brandon, but also for the unsuspecting residents of the sleepy town of Brightburn.Brandon begins to behave rebelliously, especially after he is dazed during a game concocted by his P.E. coach. This game has children standing in a small circle, while one remains at the center of it. The point of the exercise is to forge trust. Everybody pushes the classmate in the center back and forth, and the child learns to trust his school mates, because nobody is going to break the circle. Ironically, Caitlyn breaks the circle, and Brandon falls and bumps his head. The coach (Terence Rosemore of ""Triple 9"") threatens to flunk Caitlyn if she doesn't give Brandon a hand up. Although he doesn't appear injured, Brandon grasps Caitlyn's hand, twists, and then breaks it. Naturally, Kyle and Tori are shocked, while Caitlyn's mom, Erica (Becky Wahlstrom of ""Lucky 13""), insists that Sheriff Deever (Gregory Alan Williams of ""Hidden Figures"") clap him into cuffs. Later, after the school counselor, Merilee McNichol (Meredith Hagner of ""Hits""), discovers that Brandon feels no remorse for his rough treatment of Caitlyn, she starts to worry.Literally, all Hell breaks loose, and Brandon shows us he can fly, emit sizzling beams from his eyeballs, and is impervious to a .30.06 rifle bullet when it is fired at close range at his head. ""Brightburn"" is devoid of any shred of sentimentality. The protagonist is evil from the get-go, and he doesn't let anybody off easily when they oppose his wishes. Somewhere in another superhero universe, ""Superman"" should be worried.",Brightburn
14,view_and_review,The Desperation of Infertility,5,7 June 2019,"A couple struggling to have children are suddenly ""blessed"" with a child that literally crashed in their front yard in a smoldering space craft. Sound a bit like Superman? Yeah. That's what I thought too. How he was like Superman? Let me count the ways.1.) He's from another planet,
2.) He was adopted by Earthling parents who lived on a farm,
3.) He has super strength,
4.) He has super speed,
5.) He can fly,
6.) He can burn through things with his eyes,
7.) He is virtually impenetrable,
8.) And he even has a cape.Besides the aforementioned he's nothing like Superman. Come on, this has to be a DC movie right?To be honest, this kid, Brandon Breyer (Jackson Dunn), is more of an anti-Superman which is really bad news. Imagine Superman, with all his powers, deciding to go rogue. You know, like he did in Superman 3 but worse. Brandon isn't just bad, he's evil and he hurts people in the most Jason Voorhese-like ways. He goes for maximum carnage. There were some pretty gruesome scenes.Too bad Brandon Breyer was the second ultra-evil kid on screen this year or else I'd been more impressed. The movie Prodigy was about an equally evil kid with a different skill set. In fact, the two boys even look similar. They both definitely had doting, willfully oblivious mothers that all but enabled their sons by not showing some tough love. As a matter of fact, they both also had tough fathers that knew the morally right and emotionally difficult thing that had to be done.The mother in this movie, Tori Breyer (Elizabeth Banks), was exactly the type of mother you don't want a psychopath or evil alien having. The type that 1.) parents a boy from space because she's so desperate for a child.On that note allow me to digress.The Breyers really watched too much Superman. A baby boy lands on your property in a UFO and you keep it?! The FBI, NSA, CIA, or Homeland Security would have been my first call. I may have even called ICE. We can't be harboring illegal aliens! But, I suppose Mr. and Mrs. Breyer believed they stumbled upon a benign superhuman that would protect the world. I'm surprised they didn't name the boy Clark Kent.Back to the reasons Tori Breyer was the wrong mother figure for Brandon: 2.) she ignores all the warning signs that her little alien miracle might be a stone cold superkiller.Brightburn had too many problems for me. Actually, it had two problems. So, I should say it had ""two"" many problems. The first was the Superman rip off and the second was the ignorant mother. I can't stand ignorance, but I especially can't stand impregnable ignorance. That ignorance that's like adamantium armor. They say ignorance is bliss. Maybe for the ignoramus but it certainly wasn't bliss for all the victims of BB.",Brightburn
15,FlashCallahan,Injustice League.....,8,25 June 2019,"After a difficult struggle with fertility, Tori's dreams of motherhood come true with the arrival of a baby boy.Brandon appears to be everything Tori and her husband wanted, bright, talented and curious about the world.But as Brandon grows older, powerful darkness manifests within him, and Tori becomes doubtful about her son.Once Brandon begins to act on his twisted urges, those closest to him find themselves in grave danger.This high concept horror takes the best part of Superman 3 (The good versus evil Superman fight), and asks, what if the evil incarnation arrived on earth instead of a saviour? And expands on it.And the results are a better than expected film that could have elaborated on some of the narrative aspects, but decides to go straight for the eyeball with a shard of glass.Once Brandon Breyer (see what they did with his name?) hits his twelfth birthday, his first stages of puberty hit at a wonderfully subliminal rate.As any parent of a teenager knows, we get the sulking and the loud voices, so his parents shrug off the diner blowout and put it down to coming of age, but we've seen the trailer, and we know that this is the beginning of the second act.And the second act is when the film really takes off, the writers really want you to believe that Brandon will come good, that this is just a phase, but once the craft starts to beckon him, you always know that this is his calling, even though you hope he will become a saviour. The writers know comic book movies (especially Marvel/DC) and let the narrative sort of lead you on, even though every instance of perplexity from Brandon exacerbates a little bit more.Brandon is a wonderful character, ticking all the boxes of a misunderstood teen (perceived as creepy, even though he's trying to reach out) and these misunderstandings add to his frustration.Once the frustration takes over Brandon, this is when the film becomes it's own, and this in the UK is a top end 15 rated film. The set pieces int his are particularly nasty, especially the scenes in the diner, and the road scene.Once his mother realises what Brandon is, it's too late for both of them, and desperation takes over, toward the end, Teri does something, and one was really begging her not to do it, just let him be.The final third at the house is tense, but it relies heavily on jump scares to get its point across, which is a shame because the scenes with Brandon floating above the house from a distance are very eerie.But all in all, this is a surprisingly successful spin on the Superhero film, and I hope they expand the film with a lot more Rooker next time.solid stuff",Brightburn

I was very pleased with this movie, I got exactly what I hoped for. There is a good story, with the right amount of suspense that keeps your attention, the creepy parts are well done (some are brutal and gory but if you can take it you will love it). Good acting from the whole cast, even from the young Jackson A. Dunn.

The film doesn't really end anything other than kill a bunch of people for no reason and the recipe is classic horror movie: the distraught faces, the dumb ideas, the country town in a flyover state, the ""I love you but I fear you"" bull, the jump scares.In short, this film is a classic jump scare horror with absolutely no story and just a basic idea to go on. It could have been one of those ""The Haunting of..."" things and you wouldn't have known the difference.",Brightburn

Plot was just okay, some scenes had lack of imagination, ended very soon, some parts left without any further explanation. Acting was on point(apart from boy and girl, they need lessons, I didn't buy them). The weakest link of this movie was special effects(visuals,CGI). It looked very poor, something that you could see in 2000s' films. I also wasn't fan of ending. It's just doesn't make a lot of sense when you think about it.

21,Pjtaylor-96-138044,An evil Superman? That's just Bizarro.,5,22 June 2019,"'Brightburn (2019)' doesn't really feel like much more than an extended 'what-if' with some horror set-pieces. I mean, it's not really a satire or a pastiche or, even, an homage, and it doesn't use its 'what if superman was evil' premise as a jumping-off point for anything more than a few cheap scares and an 'edgy' ending. It's a shame, to be honest, because the base idea is interesting. It's not pushed to its limits or used as a clever reflection on its genre, though. It doesn't actually explore any themes, either; it's difficult to say what it's 'about', if you know what I mean. Still, it's not a bad effort, in and of itself. While I suppose it doesn't exactly live up to its potential, it does deliver a decently entertaining experience peppered with competent, if expected, scare-sequences that doesn't pander to the preconceived expectations people tend to have of 'superhero' stuff. It does have a protagonist problem, however, that makes it difficult to know who you're supposed to root for and, thus, truly care about. The run-time is, essentially, split between the troublesome tyke and his defensive mom but we're never afforded the opportunity to really get to know either. Basically, it can't decide if its villain is the antagonist. The other issue it has is one of motivation. The super-powered pre-teen doesn't have a lot to say so his desires remain somewhat distant for quite a while. When they are revealed, they aren't all that interesting as they're painted in the broadest strokes possible. They're inconsistent and don't make much sense, either. On top of that, the piece leans towards nature over nurture (without much of a debate between the two). I think this is the less interesting angle because it isn't clear how much agency is involved when the 'evil' really starts to kick in. Finally, I'll also say that the picture rushes over key developments in the 'origin' story seemingly because it knows we've seen it before; that's not a good reason to skip key details, though, and it leads to a story that seems incomplete. This extends to its unsure ending, which doesn't round anything off, really, and just sort of highlights how aimless most of it feels. Like I say, the in-the-moment experience isn't bad. There's some tension, a few effective set-pieces and it's generally enjoyable, too. It's not great, though, and it just sort of feels half baked. 5/10",Brightburn
22,ThomasDrufke,What If?,6,2 June 2019,"I think Hollywood has realized that a Superman movie only goes so far. You have to maintain the heart and soul of the story of an alien in a world that doesn't accept an outsider, while also shaping the story around a character who is essentially flawless. Brightburn takes the Superman mythos (whether the filmmakers want to admit it or not) and makes the hard left turn with Clark Kent's origin into horror territory. Brandon Breyer (because every comic character has to have alliteration) decides to use his supernatural abilities for evil, as he torments and murders people in his small town of Brightburn. While it certainly has its entertaining qualities, it fails to capture the horror of the third act because you never really grow to love Brandon as a normal kid anyway. If the first act chose to focus more on the human side of Brandon it could have easily made his turn more devastating and truly horrifying. Instead, it feels more like a low budget 'what if' story that doesn't give us the true payoff of what that question poses.6.2/10",Brightburn

When his parents begin to suspect he's got an evil side, their lives are at risk. The dad takes him hunting and takes a shot at his head, only to have the bullet bounce of his head. From then on, Brandon is a killing machine. There are several gory scenes, with the best being a guy's jaw falling off after a car crash.

24,Cineanalyst,The Horror of Superboy,5,4 October 2019,"There's definitely a deluge of superhero movies nowadays; moreover, that deluge is flooded with inversions and repetitions. ""Brightburn"" is blatantly a twist on Superman's origin story. An alien baby in a spaceship crash lands on Earth, he's adopted by an otherwise-childless farming couple, there's the red cape, and the boy displays similar powers to those of the man of steel. On top of this, there's the conflation of this supernatural genre with that of another, the supernatural horror movie. I recently reviewed ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015), for one, and it does likewise by reworking themes from Mary Shelley's Gothic horror novel ""Frankenstein,"" along with other shocker elements, including a (scarlet) witch. But, this has been done several times before, too. Tim Burton's ""Batman Returns"" (1992) borrows from Gaston Leroux's ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" as well as featuring a Moses-like narrative for the Penguin similar to that of the Superboy here (child turning against his adopted homeland with godly powers, like Moses against Egypt). Perhaps, even more relevant to the apparent marketing and tacked-on franchise-building of ""Brightburn"" is M. Night Shyamalan's superhero trilogy--especially the specifically horror-genre-based second installment.""Brightburn"" is also strikingly similar to Amazon Prime's streaming series ""The Boys,"" which is based in comics dating back to George W. Bush's administration. That show's superhero team is basically a parodic inversion of DC's Justice League. In the afterward scenes during the credits of ""Brightburn,"" a similar thing seems to be being pitched. In addition to the Superman in this movie, the conspiracy-theorist host reports on a ""witch woman"" whose modus operandi resembles that of Wonder Woman, an Aquaman type, and there are pictures on screen of an alien-looking creature (presumably a variation on the Martian Manhunter), as well as of the Crimson Bolt from the same director, James Gunn's ""Super"" (2010) (given that character's lack of superpowers, he could potentially be their Batman), and there's a question mark, too, which I guess could indicate the Flash or Green Lantern to round out the league.I'm not a fan of this sort of repetition: ""Super"" following on the heels of ""Kick-Ass"" (2010), ""Brightburn"" on that of ""The Boys,"" half the MCU movies imitating the tone of Gunn's own ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014), and DCEU movies increasingly looking like MCU ones. (We also get another riff on Hans Zimmer's horns from ""Inception"" (2010) here.) Sure, some of them work in part, as does ""Brightburn,"" but isn't there more potential variety for the emerging superhero movie genre? Perhaps, those ending clips were a joke, though, or maybe any franchise considerations go the way of ""Hellboy"" trilogies and reboots. As a stand-alone picture, ""Brightburn"" is novel in its twist on Superboy, and it's committed to its dark, slasher-movie style. Although probably of limited appeal, it can be a treat for comic-book and superhero-movie aficionados.",Brightburn

But with a twist. What if superman became a villain instead. The plot follows a crash space pod that lands in a farm. Tori (Elizabeth Banks) and Kyle (David Denman) have been trying for a baby. Until, they come across a baby in a pod. They name him Brandon (Jackson A. Dunn) and a decade later. They think he is a little strange as he is growing up. He begins writing symbols everywhere. Starts noticing he can not get hurt. He begins having mood swings. Then, the body count starts rising with the same symbol nearby.The plot is like that origin villain superhero story. A boy that is becoming anti social. And a psychopath as he wears a creepy looking mask. And begins attacking people.The film may not be as scary. It does deliver a creepy and thrilling direction. It may have some cringing moments with blood and gore. It does not hold back with editing the gory scenes.The direction for a small horror film did well in marketing this film like a Superman kind of story. A couple living out in a farm. A space craft crashing down in the farm. And they adopt the baby as their own. The boy learning he is special and has a hidden purpose. The film is thrilling, bloody, and fun to see an interesting spin with this concept.Elizabeth Banks, David Denman, and Jackson A. Dunn all did great with their characters. Jackson A. Dunn does play a creepy kid really well.Overall, Brightburn is a good horror thriller kind of film. It may not be scary. It does have thrills, bloody deaths, and moved at a brisk pace with the direction. There was not one dull moment.

32,eddie_baggins,A waste of a great premise,4,27 August 2019,"There is no denying that Brightburn's premise is one to get excited about, clearly appealing to those in the know such as well-liked filmmaker and Guardians of the Galaxy mastermind James Gunn who backed this film in from the get-go, but sadly director David Yarovesky's film is nothing more than a disappointment outside of a few neat scenes and half-cooked ideas, that never create the film Brightburn could've been had the stars aligned.Doing a lot with a small budget in regards to set-pieces, Brightburn has some fantastic individual scenes that will appeal to gore hounds in particular as Yarovesky doesn't shy away from the dark and blood-filled nature of his supervillain film done the way of the horror genre but with an abhorrently obvious lack of character development and equal amounts dim-witted character motivations and reactions, it's hard to get invested in a film that appears to have forgotten all the other important features outside of its winning premise.As the much hyped trailer suggested, Brightburn offers a nice alternative to a marketplace jam-packed with generic superheros that may have their flaws but mostly do the good deeds required of them to save the planet and its citizens, as in this film we follow Jackson A. Dunn's evil child from another planet Brandon Breyer's who utilises his otherworldly powers for bad rather than good as his two supportive but concerned parents Kyle and Tori ignorantly ignore the fact their adopted little troublemaker is perhaps not the ideal son.Unfortunately for the film, Brandon is a bit of a wet-blanket of a central figure, we are supposed to hate him, that much is clear but there's no real explanation for why Brandon has decided to become a vicious murderer and it makes viewing his increasingly bloodthirsty incidents a curiously uninvolving affair, even if some sequences such as Brandon's visit to a late night diner or his uncle's house have their moments that appear too be from a much more thrilling and engaging affair.As his parents, Elizabeth Banks and David Denman get a rather short straw as well. Both Tori and Kyle are likeable enough but there reactions to Brandon's frequent and ramped up actions of defiance and strength are quite bizarre and it won't be too long into the film where you'll start questioning if they are in fact blind to the bleeding obvious as Banks and Denman get stuck with some of the film's most awkward and eye-rolling dialogue and moments.For Brightburn to have truly enacted upon its promising concept and moments of engagement its characters needed far more love and care, with no thoughts one way or the other about any of our protagonists fate or with Brandon's quickly established quiet boy turned mass murderer setting the film up to fail, this is a film that stood very little chance of achieving its goals, showcased in a set of end credit scenes that are far better than much of what had come before it.Final Say -A wickedly inventive set-up and some ingeniously constructed blood soaked moments aren't enough to save this cold and heartless disappointment from mediocrity, with Brightburn burning out not long after the opening credits have rolled.2 glass shards out of 5",Brightburn
33,leonblackwood,Could have been better! 4/10,4,23 January 2020,"Review:
I was looking forward to watching this movie after I heard that it was a dark interpretation of Superman, but by the end of the film, I couldn't help thinking ""Was That It?"". I had high hopes once I saw the mysterious ship falling from the sky at the beginning, but it just turned out to be an everyday horror film, about a psycho going on a killing spree. The naive parents, Tori (Elizabeth Banks) and Kyle Breyer (David Denman) should have known something fishy was going on when Brandon (Jackson A. Dunn) fell from the sky in a spaceship, but they decided to play happy families until he realised that he had superhero powers. The director had the chance to make something special with the promising concept, but he took his foot off the gas and went with an average mystical/horror film. As we don't get to see how Brandon gained his magical powers, we are stuck with watching a town getting ripped to pieces, without much explanation about why he turned to the dark side. Anyway, in 2006, a spaceship crash-lands in Brightburn, Kansas on a farm owned by Tori and Kyle, who have been having difficulties conceiving a child. Inside the ship is an infant child which the couple adopt and name Brandon. They hide the spaceship in their barn's cellar to hide the truth from him. Years later, the ship begins transmitting an alien message, drawing Brandon to it. He sleepwalks to the barn and tries to open the locked cellar, chanting the craft's message, but Tori intervenes and takes him back to the house. The next day as he attempts to mow the lawn, Brandon has difficulty starting the mower and inadvertently launches it hundreds of feet. He approaches the lawnmower, curious about his newfound strength, and stops the motorised blade with his hand. Nearing puberty, Brandon is an extremely high achiever at his school, which other students tease him about but a girl named Caitlyn defends him. While celebrating Brandon's 12th birthday at a diner where Caitlyn's mother, Erica, is the waitress, his uncle Noah and aunt Merilee give him a hunting rifle, which Kyle refuses to let Brandon have. Brandon causes a scene, so Kyle and Tori leave with him. Kyle suspects something is wrong with Brandon and finds him absentmindedly chewing and mangling his fork at breakfast. During a trust fall exercise at school, Brandon falls towards Caitlyn but she does not catch him, accusing him of being a creep. When she is forced to help him up, Brandon crushes her hand in retaliation. He is suspended and required to meet with his aunt Merilee, the school counsellor, but Erica demands that Brandon be arrested. That night at home, Brandon is drawn to the ship again and he breaks the lock on the cellar door. Tori interrupts him as he levitates above the open cellar, chanting the ship's message, and he falls and cuts himself on the spaceship, the first time he has ever been injured. Tori reveals the truth about his arrival on Earth and Brandon angrily leaves, finally understanding the ship's message: ""Take the world"". In his rage, Brandon visits Caitlyn with flowers, who tells him that her mother has forbidden her from talking to him. Wearing a red mask and cape, Brandon stalks Erica while she is closing the diner and murders her. Police investigate the scene, finding a symbol looking like two BS back-to-back drawn on a window, and Erica is nowhere to be found. The following day at school, Brandon is meeting with Merilee, who informs him that she is required to report his progress to the police, but he threatens her to not do so. That night, Brandon stalks Merilee through her house until she goes to bed. Noah arrives home from the bar with Kyle and friends to find a masked Brandon hiding in the closet and threatens to tell his parents, prompting Brandon to lash out. Terrified, Noah tries to escape in his truck, but Brandon lifts and crashes the vehicle, killing Noah. Brandon returns home shirtless, telling his parents that other students tore his shirt while playing soccer late after school, but refuses to give it to Tori. Merilee calls Kyle and Tori and they rush to the hospital to learn from a grieving Merilee that Brandon had gone to her house, contradicting Brandon's story about playing soccer. The next morning, Tori and Kyle inform Brandon of Noah's death, but Brandon has no reaction, which alarms Tori and angers Kyle. When Kyle accuses Brandon and grabs him, Brandon violently shoves him. Kyle finds Brandon's blood-stained shirt and shows it to Tori, but she refuses to believe Brandon killed Noah. Kyle plans a hunting trip as an attempt to kill Brandon. While Brandon is examining deer tracks, Kyle shoots him but the bullet simply bounces off his head. Brandon kills Kyle with his heat vision. Tori finds Brandon's notebook with disturbing drawings of his murders and his message to ""take the world"", which brings her to the realisation that Kyle was right about Brandon. She attempts to call Kyle, but Brandon answers the phone and informs her that Kyle is gone. Brandon returns home and destroys the house as Tori calls the police, but Brandon brutally murders the sheriff and his deputy. Will Tori escape from the evil Brandon, who has fully converted to the dark side! I was pretty disappointed with the outcome because it's impossible for any human to touch Brandon unless they use the ship, so basically, there was no one to challenge him. The director left it open for a sequel, but after the poor takings at the box office, I can't see anyone getting over-excited about the return of Brandon. On the plus side, Jackson A. Dunn did play the evil role convincingly but I can't see where they can go with this character. Anyway, it's another one-watch for me because I can't see any reason to watch it again. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by David Yarovesky, who also brought you the Hive in 2014, which was unheard of. As this is his first major release, he didn't do a bad job with the low budget, but I personally think that plot ran dry. There aren't any rumours about a sequel, even though it was left wide open at the end, so it might be the last time we see Brandon causing mayhem.Budget: $6million

34,TheMovieDiorama,Brightburn is one caped guardian that does not burn brightly.,5,21 June 2019,"This was always going to be divisive. Blending the common ""Superman"" archetype with a refreshing horror spin. Exploring the eternal question of ""what if a superhero turned bad?"". The answer is, unfortunately, not Brightburn. Whilst it does dabble into its original concept, there were too many Gunn's in this pitch-black saloon shooting blindly at each other. A couple adopt a boy who crash lands in his spaceship near their farm, only for him to accept his intended murderous purpose years later.Nature versus nurture. Determining whether human behaviour is factored by the environment or parental upbringing. That, should've been, the central premise to this unique and often harrowing story. And occasionally, in times of emotional turmoil, it illustrates the argument. Whether it is Banks (who was excellent in this!) and Denman arguing over the fate of their extraterrestrial son, or Banks sobbing to save her life (bad move...).Frustratingly though, the story veers down a different a route. A more simplistic, nihilistic and monotonous road that never lives up to its full potential. James Gunn, as of late with the Twitter non-story, is becoming a household name for imaginative plots. However, instead of writing the screenplay himself, he hired brother Gunn and cousin Gunn. Both of which are not well versed in screenwriting, which clearly showed here. The unnecessary forced comedy failing to crack any smiles. Exploring themes of bullying and remorse yet never utilising them to affect the character. Metaphorically representing emotional changes when undergoing puberty, but rather focusing on abnegation.The Gunn's set up these contemporary strands of excellence, only to predictably fly straight down the obvious middle path. A certain plot point, involving a glowing red message from the glowing red spaceship, instantly relinquished any means of thematic purpose. That, for me, was the biggest letdown. For such a unique premise, it could've done so much more with the genre. Literally picking it up with its superhuman strength and flipping it repeatedly until it became something new entirely.Atleast Yarovesky delivered on gore and the ominous horror elements. Inventively using a range of traditional super powers, from searing heat vision to super speed, to murder townsfolk. These scenes, and fortunately there were several, was when the film truly entertained. Embracing the terrorising aesthetic to create suspense-driven carnage. The third act was a true testament of this. A shame about the rushed and emotionless ending though, which hindered the staying power of the film's dread. Oh, and for such a low budget I was impressed with the technical elements. Dallatore's cinematography was often stunning, particularly when surrounded by red strobing lights. And Elsen's editing, minus the unusual abrupt transition after one sudden killing, flowed effortlessly.Just infuriating that the direction the story took was too dull for its own good. Neither fully encapsulating me with its proposed entertaining concept or boring me with its outlandish horror. Much like the film, my opinion lies straight down the middle.",Brightburn

37,southdavid,Alienation,5,1 July 2019,"""Brightburn"" has a simple but engaging premise, what if the classic Superman mythology was flipped, so that rather than being a hero, the child with unimaginable powers is becoming a monster. Unfortunately, an engaging premise is about all that ""Brightburn"" has going for it.Loving farm-owning couple Tori (Elizabeth Banks) and Kyle (David Denham) feel their prayers have been answered when a small alien craft crash lands in their woods and delivers them a small child, whom they secretly adopt. A decade later ""Brandon"" (Jackson Dunne) is already struggling to fit in at school when one night, his ship - hidden in the barn - awakens and begins to communicate with Brandon, activating his powers and opening up his alien side.There is stuff to admire in ""Brightburn"" don't get me wrong, the performances are good across the board, as are the visual effects, particularly the gory results of Brandon's actions. I just feel that the whole story, after the premise, is undercooked. I kept wanting the plot to find some way to surprise me or give me something beyond ""Evil Superman"" which I understood from the synopsis before I even saw it, but it never did. It plods through its short runtime, without ever offering any debate as to what the motivations for the character might be, there's never any possibility of redemption offered, or even that much excusing his behaviour. Brandon occasionally declares that he doesn't want to get in trouble, but why... what are they going to do, what can anybody do to stop him really.This also fed into another issue I had, Brandon stalks his prey like a villain in a Horror movie would but why does he bother? He doesn't need to surprise people, you can't fight back, can't hurt him, and can't arrest him so why even bother unless it's to make the audience jump a bit.Though technically fine, and with decent performances, I felt like ""Brightburn"" hasn't got the story to back up the premise and was a bit of a waste of time.",Brightburn

A fresh sci fi horror thriller nasty that chilled me pretty much through the whole, and the gifted young actor playing the child from hell, who's from another world, left one lasting 'creep me out' impression on me. He's superb throughout, and doesn't lack at any moment. Some points, he's s really hard to take. The other performances are really strong, rock solid, and I really liked Bank's one, as the endearing, supporting mother, of our little terror, coming to realize, more and more, what good work this actress is capable of. The violence in Brightburn is quite brutal shock type, a lot of blood spraying, and it rides a style of nastiness in many instances. There are truly a lot of uncomfortable moments in this movie, I won't, it's style of nastiness is admired. We really wanna know more about little Brandon's origin, another admirable trait about the film. What I really liked, was the close tied, Mother-son relationship, and I so much so, didn't want it to be severed. That was the tragic, sad thing about the movie, but as we know with these pure evil scalywags, leopards don't change their spots.. The movie has the perfect measure of suspense, shocks, and quite a bit of overindulgent gore. The movie does have some quite cruel scenes, but it must be commended for being a tight, suspenseful, horror shocker, the whole way through, the crescendoing chiller music score, making it that more nasty. A not nice so ending. Additional facts, concerning Brandon, are not really warranted, pre closing credits, throwing the movie into stupidity, against what went before. All is forgiven.",Brightburn

Twelve years later, Brandon's behavior and strength changes when he discovers his alien secret hidden from him. This isn't bad, but I think it could've been a little better. It's obviously a dark version of ""Superman"" with a decent cast, gruesome make-up effects & an eerie score. Give this one a try if you're into sci-fi or horror.",Brightburn
40,paul-allaer,The anti-Superman is among us!,6,5 June 2019,"""Brightburn"" (2019 release; 90 min.) brings the story of Brendon Breyer. As the movie opens, a young couple in Brightburn, Kansas, is trying to conceive a baby, but are disrupted when what appears to be a meteoroid falls out of the sky (we later learn it is a spaceship of some sort). We then see footage of a little boy who is adored by the same couple. At that point, we go ""10 Years Later"", and the boy is approaching his 12th birthday. One day, when he is trying to star the lawnmower, he accidentally hurls it hundreds of yards away. And soon he discovers other supernatural powers... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: I admit I knew very little about the movie or its plot, and frankly probably wouldn't have seen it, but it was part of my MoviePass ""use it or lose it"" subscription, so I took a flyer and went to see it. The parallels with Superman are too uncanny to be accidental. With one major difference of course: while Superman does all he can to save the world from evil-doers, our Brendon wants to take the world and inflict some pain. It is never explained why that is. It just is. The producers decided to spend their (by Hollywood standards meager) budget on special effects, rather than on big name stars, and indeed, other than Elizabeth Banks, giving a fine performance as the boy's mom), this is a cast of non-names. I was at times impressed with the specials effects. Still, there are holes the size of Manhattan in the script (example: the story line involving Brendon's class mate Caitlyn vanishes into thin air, never to be heard from again). But in the end, I was entertained more than I could've hoped for, and that's always a good sign.""Brightburn"" opened wide recently, and the Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended so-so (about 10 people). If you are a fan of Superman, this movie might be worth a peek, Of course I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Brightburn
41,subxerogravity,A horror story in which Superman is the monster,6,24 May 2019,"It's like an Elseworld story writer by comic book icon, Frank Miller. Somehow they got away with telling Superman's Story: A married couple who own a farm in Kansas are tryin to have a baby so desperately that they think it's a god sent when one comes in a rocket ship from space. Now, in the DC Extended universe this situation lead to a lackluster film, but in the hands of James Gunn who directed Guadians of the Galaxy vol one and two for the marvel cinematic universe, it becomes a unique horror experiment similar to his film Slither.
It's disturbing, like the Omen disturbing, and they made this disturbance fun to watch. Like all other adopted kids he gets a little touchy when discovering the truth about himself. Adding in the superpowers only makes his lashing out far more scary.
It seems goofy at times but the goofy stuff only helps make the situation more frightening. You'll laugh but at the same time you'll be like ""that was messed up""

42,jtindahouse,"A decent effort, but falls short of its potential",7,26 June 2019,"I really like the concept behind 'Brightburn' - what if 'Superman' came to Earth, but with intentions of evil instead of good? That sounds like a much more fun movie to me than the actual 'Superman' movies we get every few years. What surprised me most about this movie was how seriously it took itself. It wasn't there to muck around. In fact in the whole movie there was only one moment that made me lightly chuckle, and even then I had to ask myself whether or not that line was intended to be funny. Even some of the darkest movies being released today usually utilise humour to at least a small degree. It didn't take away from the movie in my opinion. It was just unique and worth noting.It wasn't just a lack of humour making the film dark either. There is some extreme gore intended to really offset the audience. I'm not sure if it's because the movie centred around a child that I was so taken off guard by how extreme the imagery they were willing to show us was, but I really was taken aback. It was probably the strongest thing the movie had going for it. No character felt safe, and it truly felt like anything could happen. I love that in a film.The costume given to the child didn't do a lot for me. I thought it could have been designed better to have more of an unsettling effect. Also the casting of the child wasn't ideal. He wasn't bad, he just never blew me away at any stage. I had a good time with 'Brightburn' but can't help thinking I might have had a great time with a few tweaks here and there. A sequel could certainly go to some interesting places.",Brightburn

Jackson A. Dunn who plays Brandon, the 12 year old evil superman, has you creeped out, he has incredible acting ability at his young age. Elizabeth Banks is also great has Brandon's adopted mother, she ha a stubbornness that is believable, no mother wants to believe that there child is doing evil things. Effects are great, so are some great horror jump scares, and violent kills that will enough to make you cringe.

For some reason I kept comparing it to ""Hereditary"" in my mind. I think perhaps it wanted to be as cold and vicious as that movie but the producers didn't have the guts to go there.Also the main actor may have been miscast. He's not a kid you'd look at and think, he's weird, or he could be up to something, or he could have special powers.Still, I just really appreciated this movie. I am undecided about whether I should give it a seven or eight, so I'll split the different and give it 7.5.",Brightburn
45,Stevieboy666,"Great film, sadly cut in the UK",8,12 January 2020,"Brandon is not your typical 12 year old boy. His parents, unable to conceive themselves, adopted him as a baby when he mysteriously landed in some sort of alien craft on their farm. He possess extraordinary super powers, woe betide anybody who gets in his way of global domination!
Brandon (very well played by Jackson A.Dunn) is one very creepy kid and rapidly transforms into a kind of anti-superhero, unleashing death and destruction. No explanation is really given to who he really is but I liked the simplistic plot. I found it to be one of those movies where you can just sit back and enjoy without taxing the grey matter too much. Everything about it was good. Sadly here in Britain the film was cut by 17 seconds of gore and violence in order to be granted a 15 certificate instead of an 18. That really grates me, it means that the release that I watched is incomplete. Apart from that I was very impressed.",Brightburn
46,dfranzen70,Lack of follow-through.,6,6 October 2019,"Brightburn isn't a terrible good movie, although it does feature some well-staged action scenes. It's about a strange boy 'adopted' by a couple trying to have a baby. Of course, as anyone would know by looking at the trailers or even just guessing a few minutes in, this is no ordinary boy, 'born' on the same night that an apparent meteor strikes the small town of Brightburn, Kansas, USA. Fast forward to the kid's 12th birthday party, and he's beginning to really show signs of otherness, which adults chalk up to puberty and growing pains and the like. But Mom and Dad know differently, and although they've long warned young Brandon to stay out of the locked-tight trapdoor in their barn...well, I think we all know that all of us, especially Brandon, will find out what's behind that door, and it ain't gonna be a good thing. It's certainly not a good thing when people die grisly deaths, and somehow they each have a connection to Brandon. Coincidence? One issue I had with this movie was that the plot doesn't really explore in any depth the ramifications of Brandon's finding out his origins, other than to wow us with some amazing effects. Another issue is that none of the cast (even Elizabeth Banks, as the always-supportive mom) doesn't acquit itself very well. The adult actors show a lack of range, for the most part, and the kid playing poor Brandon is just kind of dull - a problem not helped by the scattershot plot. Some of these characters, by the way, make some astoundingly dumb decisions, and I don't mean in the horror-movie sense. Sometimes horror-movie characters will do something stupid, but you can chalk it up to their being terrified, in a panic, etc. But here, you'll see people doing things that just don't make sense, and it hurts the film.",Brightburn
47,stevendbeard,Bizarro Superman,8,27 May 2019,"I saw ""Brightburn"", starring Elizabeth Banks-The Happytime Murders, Power Rangers_2017; David Denman-Logan Lucky, Power Rangers_2017; Matt Jones-Mom_tv, Breaking Bad_tv and Jackson A. Dunn-Avengers:Endgame, Shameless_tv.
This is a sort of Bizarro take on the Superman mythology. What if an alien baby crash landed on Earth, was found and raised by a nice rural couple on a farm, but did not turn out to be such a goody goody Boy Scout? It's produced by James Gunn, who wrote the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, so it's going to be interesting. Elizabeth and David are the farmers that find Jackson. They adopt him and raise him to the best of their abilities but something goes wrong. Jackson just doesn't want to be good. It starts with little things but soon escalates. Matt plays an uncle to Jackson. FYI: This is an ""R"" movie so it's not for the little kiddies-I saw people with small ones in tow and they should not have brought them. There is some gory and bloody violence and language, even bordering on horror. Oh yeah, Brightburn is the name of the town-aka, like Smallville. Near the end, there is a cameo from the Marvel universe that does a news cast that takes a jab at some famous super heroes from DC.
It's rated ""R"" for horror violence, bloody images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 31 minutes.
I enjoyed the different look at the famous origin story and I would buy this on Blu_Ray.",Brightburn

Not quite perfect, but they did a great job with this premise and made the new Brightburn character someone to look out for in the future. Hopefully we see more of this character as well as others they set up at the end of it. Not exactly scary as much as it is unsettling and disturbing at times, but there were a couple of moments when I was getting a bit freaked out, and that's hard to do with movies these days.

51,CubsandCulture,Exposes the Superhero genre for the fascistic fantasy it is...,10,4 June 2019,"Ultimately this film does not quite stick the landing. Too much of its critique of the superhero genre is done by implication and it is not forceful enough to drive home its central point that really Superman would be a monster. I think the problem ultimately rests in the film having Brandon's turn be caused by his parents. Not only is bad parenting a pat explanation but it dulls the underlying notion that anyone would get drunk on power.With that being said, the film is very effective. It is creepy. It moves at a nice clip. The kid actor who plays Brandon nails the role. Best of all, it does a remarkable job of re-purposing Superman imagery and twisting it into horror. The script is quite tight with capturing the basic plotpoints-twisted, perverted-from a Superman origin story. I just wish an early classroom scene that explains the plot too directly was re-written or cut.This reminded me of the graphic novel the Watchmen in how it turned the superhero genre inside out. They both make the same point. Superheros are the ""Great Men"" of fascism. They are really monsters.",Brightburn

When a mysterious aircraft crashes near their land, they find a young baby on board it and decide to raise him as their own. All appears to be well until their child reaches 12 years old when the parents start to notice their child behaving out of character and this behaviour soon starts to become increasingly erratic and unpredictable....Is this supposed to be a homage to Superman? Another backstory or a prequel? Having read the trivia section I didn't really get any answers (although it does at least acknowledge the film as being a twisted version of Superman). Perhaps this is supposed to be a darker and more grown up alternative to the classic superhero character whom we have all grown up with over the years, but for me this rendition/offering doesn't quite reach the dizzying heights of brilliance...For a start there are some things that we see here that either aren't explained or don't really make much sense; the craft that Brandon crash-lands to Earth in is stored under the barn and glows bright red through the floor boards - if the family didn't want him to see it then wouldn't it have made more sense to try and obscure it from view - fill the gaps in the floorboards or cover the aircraft so it wasn't glowing quite so obviously. Brandon suddenly starts hearing the voices when he's 12 years old and then starts to become this powerful alter-ego, but why did this come about when he's 12 years old? If he's superhuman then it could have happened at any age (logically it would make more sense for his dangerous persona to come to life at an earlier age). Also we never learn where Brandon came from - although let's face it it was probably Krypton on the face of everything that's presented here.Still in the film's defence it is well-directed, the acting is good and I have to admit that there are some pretty tense and creepy scenes and these do sort of compensate for the first half of the film which does feel a bit slow at times. It also looks like Brightburn could be setting itself up as a franchise as the door has clearly been left open for a sequel.All in all it's pretty entertaining stuff, but ultimately a little hollow at its core.",Brightburn

It's killing for the evil pleasure of killing.It's got a 9 (from me), but for evil reasons, among them the deranged and twistedly superb acting by Jackson A.

57,kirbylee70-599-526179,BEGINNINGS OF A BAD GUY,8,28 August 2019,"What if Superman came to Earth and decided to be evil instead of good? That's the basis for an origin story named BRIGHTBURN that's out now on disc. A combination of superhero and horror film that works well is rare if completely unheard of but writers Brian and Mark Gunn and director David Yarovesky have pulled it off.Tori (Elizabeth Banks) and Kyle (David Denman) Breyer are a couple living in Brightburn, Kansas, having trouble conceiving who truly want a child of their own. One night their prayers are answered, just not how you would think. They are blessed with a boy they name Brandon. Raising him over the years Brandon (Jackson Dunn) has just reached puberty and while most children change at that age, Brandon changes far more than the average pre-teen.At night while sleeping Brandon is drawn to the barn and a locked cellar there. He doesn't get in but that doesn't stop his parents discussing if he found what was there or not. If you haven't seen the trailers then stop reading, spoiler alert. It seems that Brandon is not of this Earth. His parents found him in a small spacecraft and raised him as their own, thus the comparisons to Superman. But with the exception of powers they pretty much stop there.Without telling his parents Brandon begins to notice the changes in his body. Not the normal thing that all teens go through but an increase in strength and invulnerability. This is coupled with those normal teen urges and it isn't long before Brandon has found his way into the bedroom window of the girl he's attracted to. When she rebuts his advances and then allows him to fall at school, he breaks her hand.As if that weren't enough Brandon has more outburst like this. The more he has the deadlier they become. It reaches the point where even his father is unsure of what to do. Through it all Tori continues to profess her love for her son and turns a blind eye to what's going on. Eventually though even she will have to admit that things are not right.The movie works on so many levels that it would be sad if people only thought of this as either a superhero movie or a horror film. It combines elements of both but at the same time is a story about a young boy turning into an adult. Granted the effects that has on him are far different than most but what if long ago you could do damage to that girl or boy who spurned you? Most of us would still not do damage. But what if you were inherently evil?It is questions like these that transform this movie into something completely new and different. And while only 90 minutes long the film's pacing is fantastic. It provides a few moments to spur your interest near the beginning but the truly horrific moments are seen until we have an idea of what's taking place. Honestly 90 minutes is a perfect amount of time for this movie. Too often directors choose to lengthen the stories they tell with padding that drags a movie down. Not so here as the film provides enough background without being saddled with those extra scenes.For superhero fans this is something we haven't seen before. Not so much an origin story of the hero but one for the villain. It makes you wonder if a sequel would find another child like Brandon only with the benefits as opposed to the negative aspects. For horror fans get ready for some amazing gore effects. One in particular will bring back memories of the film ZOMBIE involving and eye. Another is, well, jaw dropping. You'll get that when you watch.There isn't a bad performance here and that helps things tremendously. While Banks and Denman are solid here it is the performance of Dunn that could make or break a film like this. Thankfully he does a wonderful job bringing the outcast pre-teen to life as well as the villain we feel a sort of sympathy for later on. Not bad for someone so young.I didn't see this in the theater but at home. I wish I'd gone now to see it there now. I can imagine the scenes and sequences that would have elicited screams, groans and moments when some would have possibly gotten ill. But maybe audiences aren't quite that shocked any longer.

59,kluseba,Family ties can blur and erase the truth,7,10 June 2019,"Someone I used to know was once invited to a family supper. He had attended, enjoyed and been looking forward to such occasions numerous times in the past but that particular supper was a whole different thing. A distant family member, who had been described as a shady person with dangerous tendencies who had been considered the family's black sheep and hadn't been in touch with the family for many years, was unexpectedly there as well. Everybody acted like nothing had ever happened but the person I knew just couldn't do that and was accused of spoiling everybody's fun that night. That family supper was a huge blow to his already struggling relationship with that family. I believe this person shouldn't look back in regret and can be proud of his integrity even though that event had regrettable negative short-term consequences and is an anecdote of a challenging time. Why do I mention that anecdote? This is to prove that family ties can blur and erase the truth. This is exactly what Brightburn is about.The movie tells the story of a young couple who desperately wants to have children but it just doesn't work out. One night, an unidentified flying object lands in the forest behind the couple's farm. Inside the capsule, they find a baby boy and raise him as their own child. Twelve years later, a mysterious force from the unidentified flying object hidden under the barn awakes the dark side of the son who starts acting erratically. The parents refuse to accept the truth and believe their son is sleepwalking when he is about to find the capsule that once brought him to Earth or blame the brutal death of their chickens on a wolf when they were actually killed by their son. The son's actions get worse every single day when he breaks into the house of a potential love interest and even breaks her hand when she calls him a pervert in front of other students. The parents slowly start accepting that something is wrong with their adopted son but the mounting pressure pushes the teenager to use supernatural force to commit more and more outrageous crimes to protect his mysterious identity. When the parents finally decide to take action, it's already too late to stop an irreversible series of tragedies.Brightburn convinces with a constantly growing intensity leading to a rather unusual ending. The story offers food for thought and makes us question our blind dedication to our families. The film features some quite grisly scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat.On the other side, the plot is obviously very ridiculous. Even if we accept that this is a science-fiction horror movie, the lead characters make so many questionable and at times obviously illogical choices that it's hard to empathize with them at all. The film is also rarely scary and can rather be described as a science-fiction thriller than a genuine horror movie. Another flaw is that the film never offers any explanation regarding the lead antagonist's origins. There is perhaps room for a sequel or even a prequel to offer more insights into the story.In the end, Brightburn is a movie that will please to those who are looking for a superhero movie with a sinister twist. The film is entertaining from start to finish and gets more intense as it progresses. The story is however forgettable. On a closing note, family values are obviously as important to me as to the next guy. However, family ties should never blur or erase the truth. If a woman writes on a dating portal that family is her life, I already know she isn't my kind because I want to date a woman and not an entire family and I know this sentiment is shared by several friends of mine.",Brightburn

In Brightburn we have a Superboy, (never called that of course) Brandon (Jackson A. Dunn) who is raised in Brightburn Kansas by adoptive parents who found his spacecraft. All is going well until Brandon's twelfth birthday, suddenly he starts developing strange powers and if anyone annoys him they suffer.A truly dark tale, a dialogue seems to take place within Brandon's mind, at times it is almost as if he is possessed the way he shakes in bed and levitates. Later he appears to be an incarnation of the more malign magneto as he hovers in the air and reigns destruction upon his foes (both real and imagined). A slight comic touch is his mask, it might be that of an anteater's snout or a fly's proboscis, maybe callhim Aardvarkboy. Some really horrifying scenes as he throws people around and literally dismembers them. There are a few flaws, in one scene a character, Caitlyn (Emmie Hunter) witnesses something extraordinary but then disappears from the narrative, not mentioned again while police search for her mother.

What is essentially Superman told through the prism of a horror film is a potent idea but the execution is wholly misguided here. What if Superman was not the paragon of American virtue & law & order that we have come to know & love but actually a being from another planet here to conquer us since his DNA says he must. Starring Elizabeth Banks (who was in Gunn's Slither) is the childless mother who gets the child of all children & for the most part his rearing goes off like a hitch but when he hits puberty things start to go awry. Almost as an act of petulance, this Superman cypher starts to act out, being a genuine pervy creep (he stalks a girl from school in her room) then to an out & out killer taking out people when he hears the word 'no.' Banks, being the most patient of mothers, stands by her son through thick & thin (even when the audience has lost any empathy for her at this point) & all concerned suffer by that decision. Even simple shock cuts (one involving oatmeal after a person is killed) are handled badly, diffusing any tension the film is trying to gin up. The only thing that may save the film for some (as I remarked to my viewing partner) is if they view it as an extended metaphor for the Trump presidency where a guilded scion is never given the proper respect due to him only to grow up & take his latent wrath against the world at large but this may be too much for the casual viewer to take in.",Brightburn
63,ulicknormanowen,Brandon and Damien,6,29 February 2020,"LOTS OF SPOILERSIt can be called a black ""ET "" ,a black ""Superman"" ,but the first movie that comes to my mind is ""the omen"" .(1976)Damien was a fostered child ,,born of a jackal ,so is Brandon .Brando came out of the sky ""we had been praying for so long to get a child and we eventually were heard .""Both were cute babies ,pampered and spoilt ,even though they came from milieus which were worlds apart (a diplomat and a farmer)Both began their career by doing away with people who thwarted their ominous plans (the nanny, then the mother for Damien;the girl's mom ,the uncle for Brandon).Both were helped by an external evil power (the Devil for Damien; some ""let the force be with you"" outer space thing for Brandon)Compare the endings : the White House is wide open for Damien who turns back and almost gives the audience a wink ;He is set to conquer the world .
Nobody blames him for what happened to his dad (who tried to kill him ,just like Brandon's bearded father did).We see a deadpan Brandon nibble at a cookie ;he ,too , is set to gain the world (his drawings tell it so), all the forces of outer space evil on his side.And ,last but not least , both have a sign :the number of the beast for Damien, the double B for Brandon Breyer.All in all,this is an above-average horror movie ;if they had refrained from bloody special effects , it could have been a really effective horror movie (in ""the omen"" they were kept to economical levels).Best line:

64,dworldeater,"Great, a breath of fresh air",8,3 September 2019,"If you are like me and are tired of all of these corny PG 13 goodie two shoes superhero movies, then Brightburn is for you. With an origin story similar to Superman, except this story takes a dark twist. Don't get me wrong, some of those superhero movies are very good. But for every good comic book movie, there are a whole lot of bad ones that are completely stale and generic. So, this one is very much an anti superhero story and it was done really well with good acting, story and character development and nice visuals. The violence is very extreme and will please the horror crowd for sure. The boy who is the cause of chaos, Brandon reminds me more of a young Damien Thorn from The Omen sequel or the orphan girl from the more recent Case 39 then General Zod. It would be interesting to see a sequel where Brandon is all grown up, but for now I am very happy with this and recommend this if you share similar dark tastes in film.",Brightburn
65,s3276169,Bad superman.....,8,25 June 2019,"""What if "" movies with a dark twist tend to offer a more mature, sophisticated take on otherwise rather pedestrian material. I've always found the notion of a superman belongs more in the category of darkly Nietzsche, with a eugenics, elitist twist.Brightburn plays nicely into this proposition. A superbeing whose complete superiority to the rest of humanity leads to an inevitable Darkly Darwinian conclusion. A lesser class of species faced with one of a higher order.The result is a film that rather cleverly subverts the comfortable, folksie, vibe found in the original Superman tale and takes it to a very, very dark and disturbing place. Its a well formed tale too, that only really feels a little rushed, as it moves towards its climax.That said, for me there's a hell of a lot more to like here, than not. This is very fresh horror film that takes a well worn genre and actually manages to do something reasonably innovative with it. 8/10 from me.",Brightburn
66,peterp-450-298716,I thought this anti-superhero film was just fabulous.,9,8 August 2019,"Take.. The.. World.
Take the world.Superhero-movie-haters unite. Run to a nearby movie theater to see this movie. Because ""Brightburn"" is the ultimate anti-superhero-film of all time. The moment I realized which direction it was going, I cursed myself because after seeing ""Avengers: Endgame"" I'd decided to have a little sabbatical. I was going to avoid movies with characters in tightly fitting latex suits and superhuman powers. But as it became clear that it wasn't what I expected, my enthusiasm grew all the more. My enthusiasm for films such as ""Deadpool"" and ""Ant-Man"" (because of a touch of whimsy and the originality) was effortlessly overtaken by this highly original anti-superhero film. And if one also mixes the superhero genre (of which they are continuously producing sequels and prequels) with my all-time favorite genre horror, it simply can't go wrong. I am indeed enthusiastic, yes. Extremely enthusiastic!It all starts as a sort of Superman parody or reboot (another favorite Hollywood term these days). Here too, we meet a young couple who have been trying to have a child for years. Even spicy lingerie doesn't do wonders because farmer Kyle Bryer (David Denman) (and yes, the location is again a big farm) is rather clumsy, which means that his watch always gets stuck in his wife's hair. BANG! Before they realize it, some object out of space crashes nearby. Right in their back yard. And as if it's the most normal thing, Tori (Elizabeth Banks) finds an innocent, sweet little guy in this comet or spacecraft. They adopt him instantly and call him Brandon (Jackson A. Dunn). All peace and light, you think. Until the boy realizes that something is wrong. Especially when he tries to start the lawnmower and suddenly the thing ends up at the neighbors. A few meadows further.With the well-known figure Superman, the parents didn't waste any time and told young Superman to keep his growing powers under control and only use it to help humans. In the 70s this fact was acceptable. But after the trillionth superhero movie, that concept really starts to sound boring. And that's where ""Brightburn"" starts to deviate substantially. As soon as it seems as if puberty hits Brandon, and no it's not about hair growth and other side-effects, and he wanders around the farm at night looking for something that seems to call him, it becomes clear that a constructive parent-child conversation is not really useful. When Brandon feels disadvantaged, it's best to stay away from him. The consequences of a tantrum can be disastrous. You could end up flying into a closet or have a crushed hand as a result. So they are stuck with a teenage son with issues who has superpowers. A ""Dennis the Menace"" with an attitude. You don't have to be smart to know what's going to happen next.Let's talk about the horror part. For those who are only used to super-hero films, it will be a shock. For a seasoned horror fanatic, it's all just ordinary. It's not terrifying or too bloody. There are some excellent gore effects in it, though. I personally found it simply exciting at certain moments. Exciting as in how the story will continue and end. And they even tried to tackle that part in an original and quirky way. The majority of blockbusters always have such a predictable outcome. In a western, the bad guys always eat dust in the end. A romcom has a happy ending in most cases. And even superheroes on the verge of despair will eventually prevail (such as The Avengers, for example). If you expect this to happen here as well, you're absolutely wrong. But there's one thing I'm sure of. The marketing department of Marvel already smells money. I bet they are planning a sequel already with The Avengers trying to beat the unstoppable Brandon.About the acting, I can be brief and concise. Simply excellent. Especially the mother and son bonding was worked out and portrayed in a proper way. The desperation and motherly love that Elizabeth Banks radiates is simply wonderful to see. And even though Brandon seems incomparably innocent at times, the moment his evil ego pops up, he can conjure up a frightening and impressive facial expression. It's just a shame he didn't focus his anger on the annoying class bully as well.""Brightburn"" definitely will end up in my top list this year. The only downside was the duration. Far too short of course. But otherwise, this superhero parody, peppered with SF and horror elements, is simply sublime. The fact this film has a go-against-the-rules attitude and the idea of a superhero who doesn't care about humanity is a pleasant and refreshing change compared to the commercial one-size-fits-all releases nowadays. Just something as simple as Brandon's costume. Has anyone ever wondered who actually made the Spiderman suit? Or did Peter Park have a Sewing and knitting diploma? Brandon uses a piece of woolen textile and a bedspread as equipment. Ingenious anyway. As brilliant as the film itself. I keep repeating it. It is hoped that it will stay with this unique film and that they won't come up with a miserable number of sequels.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",Brightburn
67,aidanratesmovies,"Flawed, but original and enjoyable anti-superman like film",9,2 July 2019,"Deeply sinister, incredibly violent, and mindlessly entertaining, Brightburn takes every risk in all the right ways. The acting is done surprisingly well, and though it may seem like a small work at times, the film explodes with tension and intensity. It may seem to take itself a little too seriously at times, and at times provides certain unnecessary moments, but the film is undeniably entertaining and a heck of a interesting journey that is certainly unique and provides an experience you will never forget.

68,questl-18592,Blandburn,5,27 August 2019,"Brightburn is a twist on the classic Superman story. An alien ship crash lands in some heartland farm to be discovered by a couple wishing they could have a child. The twist is that instead of becoming the symbol of truth, justice and the American way he turns into a sadistic brat.It's a fun idea, one that's been explored multiple times in other media and to a lesser degree in movies like Hancock. Unfortunately in the case of Brightburn, the concept may be interesting but the execution is so blasé.The visuals are striking. The acting is ok. But the lead boy is so underwhelming, unsympathetic and unlikeable that there's no real connection to him. The mother, Elizabeth Banks, is trying but doesn't manage to hit it home either leaving the story to progress with no real concern for the stakes these characters are dealing with.By the end, it's not offensively bad nor is it outrageously good in any particular sense and instead it just artfully rides that line of incredible mediocrity that makes it great as background noise on the tv but rarely warrants full attention.",Brightburn
69,truemythmedia,A Superhero Slasher,5,20 August 2019,"For what it's worth, I really enjoyed my time in ""Brightburn"", though I can't say it's a particularly smart or well-done movie. It has a problem with settling on a tone, the acting is pretty spotty, there are dozens of small plot holes and a couple glaring ones, most of the characters are stupider than those in most slasher films, and nobody in the movie is remarkably likeable overall... but, there are a lot of fun horror-esque sequences with far more bloody violence than I anticipated, and some of those sequences were an absolute blast. In a world that is polluted by an overabundance of superhero films, I'm glad this one at least tried to do something a little different, and I'm also glad that it didn't shy away from the horror.",Brightburn

72,Reviews_of_the_Dead,A Dark Super Hero Film,9,6 June 2019,"This was a film I was quite intrigued to check out. The concept of a superhero that is evil is one that I'm down for, especially since this character seems to be very similar to Superman. The synopsis is what if a child from another world crash-landed on Earth, but instead of becoming a hero to mankind proved to be something far more sinister?We start this film off seeing books that belong to a married couple. The couple are Tori (Elizabeth Banks) and Kyle Breyer (David Denman). They are struggling to get pregnant. They experience something like an earthquake and then see that they now have a child. We are given video as he grows up and it shifts 10 years into the future. Their son is Brandon (Jackson A. Dunn).In school we see that he is quite smart as she answers questions from his teachers. Some boys mock him, but we see that Caitlyn (Emmie Hunter) has a crush on him. His parents take him out for dinner for his birthday and his aunt and uncle are there, Noah (Matt Jones) and Merliee McNichol (Meredith Hagner). Brandon is given a gun by Noah and his dad doesn't want him to have it. This causes a standoff and that the boy might have some supernatural abilities.At night, something draws Brandon to the barn. Under a trapdoor is a glowing red light. Through some conversations, Brandon has never been cut, bruised or even gets sick. He starting to realize that he has some other superhuman abilities. When he finally decides what the hidden item is calling for him to do, he realizes that he is special and that no one will stand in his way.Since I don't like spoiling films, especially new ones I want to ensure that I didn't go into too much with the story. To be honest though, there isn't a lot to the story, but it works for me. This film really did just take the origin story of Superman and how he came to Earth, but instead of him assimilating to his loving parents, Brandon decides that he is superior.Something that the film actually reveals though is that Tori and Kyle were pretty wild in their youth. I like this subtle little hint that they might be in over their heads. Even more than that though, Tori pretty much all but says that she would never abandoned him and would always stand by his side. Her parents weren't there for her, so she wants to be there for him.To go back to it though, Brandon is such an interesting character. He is bullied and really doesn't fit in. The problem though is that he bullies don't really understand who they are messing with. I was actually talking to my roommate about this film and he brought up the point, if you had the strength and any of the abilities that Brandon or Superman for that matter had, wouldn't you be more likely to be power-hungry like he is. This is really something that hit me and I have to say, I think so. I'm a pretty nice guy and tend to do the right thing, but much like Ben Parker, with great power, comes great responsibility, despite how cliché that is.This film is paced very well in my opinion as well. I think the film is very subtle in introducing some background information, but we aren't force-fed it. On top of that it moves through at a good pace. The film is 90 minutes long, so that definitely helps here as well. Seeing the darkening of Brandon as the film goes on and people cross him I think really helps that as well. It isn't necessarily a sudden change, but it does escalate. The ending was right in line where I wanted it to go and something I am definitely down for.To move next to the acting, which I think is really good. Banks has desperation about her since she really wants a child. She wants to give what her parents didn't for her and going even farther, she will do whatever to protect her son. I saw a bit of my mother in her as well. Tori isn't necessarily equipped to handle a child like this, but then again, who really is? Denman is a really good compliment to her. I like that he is ready to face the facts of what their child could really be when she isn't. They play off each other well. Now if you've read any review of mine when it comes to children, it can be hit or miss. I think Dunn is great in his role. He is devoid of emotion, but if you are superhuman like he is, I could see that being the case. He isn't human so he wouldn't necessarily have human emotions. I would say that the rest of the cast rounded out for what was needed in my opinion.On to the effects of the film, I was definitely surprised. This film is much more violent than I expected and bloodier as well. There were some effects that were brutal and even made me cringe. I heard a critique that they cut away a bit early, but I actually like that. It gave me enough while still allowing my imagination to fill in the blanks, which is great. There is quite a bit of CGI, which I'm not the biggest fan of, but I think it looks fine here. The film is also shot very well.The final thing to cover would be the soundtrack of the film. To be honest it really didn't stand out for the most part. I think they do some good things with the sound design, like the voice that is calling out to Brandon. I thought that was pretty creepy. They also do well with having other sounds, especially if they use electricity to mess up when Brandon is around. I like that aspect. I do have to say, the song at the end of the film and to start the credits I love called Bad Guy. I actually added it to my Spotify I enjoyed it that much.Now with that said, I came in thinking I would enjoy this film, but I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. I think that the concept of the film is really terrifying and I like the idea of taking a superhero and making him evil. The idea behind it is definitely plausible with someone as powerful as Brandon. I think the acting is good in bringing this to life. The film is paced well, I think it builds tension and the ending was really good. The effects were more brutal and I loved it. The soundtrack during the film didn't necessarily stand out, but it fit for what was needed. The sound design was pretty solid for sure. Overall I'd say this is a really good film and would recommend checking this out, especially if you like super hero films.",Brightburn
73,robertemerald,Perfect horror,10,18 December 2019,"It is exactly because we love our superhero movies so much that Brightburn works so well as horror. It is a classic idea for a movie, really thinking outside the box, the sort of idea that once it's out there everyone wonders why it has never been done before. After all it's not such a leap from superhero bad guys, an origin story about one of them rather than a hero. Credit where credit is due. The filmmakers behind Brightburn did think of it and deserve 10 out of 10 credit. Quite aside from the novel idea, Brightburn is still a high tension, spooky-as-hell and technically brilliant piece of filmmaking. Everything works, the framing, the escalation, the actors, the lines filled with menace, the pain of the parents struggling to comprehend and adapt, not to mention a child's simplistic and utterly selfish understanding of power. If you have ever witnessed (or remember) a 7 year old's tantrum you'll know what I mean, just add a superpower to that and you've just invented a new genre of horror.

Comic Books With One Sided ArcsSummary:Brightburn is a movie that the trailers have given much information, but there are some things that I appreciate the movie attempting to do to spruce up the Horror genre. First off is the acting! While not Oscar Worthy material or the most groundbreaking steps in acting, I give the actors props for working with the limited material. Banks in particular manages to breathe some drama into the very linear characters, while Jackson Dunn is getting a nice start at playing creepy with his presentation and delivery of lines. They sort of sell the film, alongside the extras who can act terrified at a whim's pace. Yet, the high selling points are the fact of a new twist and fast pace to provide the modernized entertainment the world loves these days. Brightburn does not take long to begin getting into the creepy aspects, quickly evolving the plot into this dark, comic book like adventure that tries to be thrilling and suspenseful. As such, the movie moves at a decent pace and before you know it, you'll be nearing the end. Thus, short attention spans should be pleased with this movie. Fortunately, there should be plenty of creepy moments, primarily due to two components: Creepy looks from the kid and Setting of isolation. The latter in particular sort of robs you of your safety, the open land and woods making a setting where so many things can happen from so many angles. That component is the most terrifying, while the rest go with the dark comic theme that provides the entertainment value. All of this is put into a story that is simplistic, but ties all the chaos together into a nice package.
Yet, the movie has some areas that while entertaining are not the most ground breaking in terms of storytelling. For one thing, the movie is very simplistic, doing little to build upon its characters or even suspense that would have been satisfying to see in the story department. When it does start trying to build up some of the aspects, we get stuck with a lackluster story components that do-little explanation outside of some momentary dialogue to explain his ""origins"". Outside of that, it is just a simple gruesome tale that while fitting for the genre, soon becomes just a public display of power going wrong and dragging out some torturous finishes. Brightburn seems to relish in the dark dealings of the genre more than the story. For the fan that loves this, the film is perfect, but for those looking for a little more, this tale is going to not be the crown jewel as thanks to the trailers and the concept, you can probably guess what the ending will be. And when the full extent is unleashed there is little excitement in regards to just watching things unfold, so don't get too excited about an epic finale.
So what's the verdict? Brightburn gets points for putting a new face, or in this case mask, on the genre. It's that comic component that sort of sells this film, providing the entertaining, destructive force of the dark instead of developing the story. Thus, despite the predictability, if you are looking for that ambiguous tale that merely focuses on the gimmicks this category of film's thrives in... you've got your popcorn munching visit planned. However, if you are hoping for something more to your tale, looking for that story that holds both creeps and purpose than hold out for something else. Thus, this movie is more recommended for home viewing rather than theater in my opinion.My scores are:
Horror/Sci-Fi: 6.5
Movie Overall: 5.0",Brightburn

77,Easygoer10,Pitiful,4,1 January 2020,"Would someone please tell me the studio paid for the rights who ""Superman""? The beginning us almost identical with a few minor differences. However thete are far more similarities than differences. For example, both Brandon and Superman (a) are aluens; (b) look completely human; (c) are exceptionally smart; (d) are infinitely stronger physically than other people; (e) are adopted. That is from only the first 20 minutes if the film. This plot is woefully weak. His father completely embarrassed him at his birthday party by telling him very loudly he is still a little boy in front of friends and other people. Next, his parents go home and think they behaved properly (when they hadn't), and start to talk about sex. Then a day or 2 later, his father tells him he is a young man. This is the opposite of what he said at his birthday party. My point is all of the people that wrote this story, the screenplay and the script did a really bad job. I figured this out after only 20 minutes. Thete us no way it will turn out to be a decent film. My guess is he will be an advance scout for another species. If I'm wrong, so be it. Regardless, the cast, director and the rest of the crew are woeful. The only reason I am watching it is out if boredom. There is no way I would pay 1 cent to rent this.

78,lemon_magic,"Solid, but not at all enjoyable",5,13 April 2020,"For a movie about an evil superhero, this movie seemed kind of glum and low on energy and excitement. And for a horror movie, too.There is plenty of professional polish on display, and it looks as if some money was spent on it, but the overall effect, for me, was just kind of...meh.And the screenplay seemed thin, too. There was no real complexity to the characters, and no real thought given to how the little boy's ""power set"" comes off on screen...or t why he THIS set of abilities and not some other (for instance, why the kid can influence electronics and power stations and make light bulbs explode, which Superman never could.)I get that the film makers wanted the monster-movie feel, where jump cuts and blurred motion effects make the ""creature"" more frightening and not giving the game away by showing too much of him, too soon. I just don't think the approach worked here.The acting is...OK. I think the young man who plays Brandon might get some of the blame for the films from some reviewers, but my filter is that if any actor under the age of 16 is cast, and they aren't obvious prodigies, then any failure on screen is either the fault of the casting agency (asking them to do things they can't do yet) or the director (for not helping the kid understand how to do what is needed).So...meh.

(R)In the small Kansas town of Brightburn, a married couple (Banks, Denham) having trouble conceiving get their prayers answered when a spaceship crashes near their house, carrying an infant child that, of course, possesses a whole host of superpowers. Unfortunately, the kid is less young Clark Kent, more young Michael Myers, and around the time puberty hits, watch out! Nifty premise unburdened by overreaching ambition or extravagance, trimmed of its fat into a lean, mean machine. A few more surprises would have been appreciated, and logic need not apply here, but the film overcomes its inherent absurdity by blending its grisly superhero-slasher components with considerable humor (mostly pitch black in nature); Banks does more with the fraught-but-loyal mother role than demanded by genre standards, and the chilling vacancy of Dunn's stare serves the nature of evil well. Only the most hardened of viewers will be able to watch a scene set inside a diner without violently squirming. Co-produced by James Gunn, and written by his brothers, Mark and Brian. The credits seem to set up a potential crossover/extended universe (Rainn Wilson's character from ""Super"" can be spotted in a photograph), but it's unclear what that may entitle, or if it's just a tongue-in-cheek joke.77/100",Brightburn

They both narcissists, sociopaths and believe they can do anything they want because they are the most powerful and superior beings. The movie has a good idea, but totally squanders it. The main character's struggle or conflict is never clear, his actions are never justified, he just comes out as plain evil and that's it, no depth or anything. The movie also suffers from horror cliches like the jump scares but there are few that are actually effective. The few special effects that are on display are finely done.

Their son Brandon, a rather quiet and studious boy, was approaching the on-set of puberty and that sulky teenager phase, no surprises here then.Well, before you knew it, us the audience were jumping this way and that, covering our eyes and hiding behind jackets. The tension here built and built, very little was explained or needed to be, the boy was menacing and Tori Beyer, played by Elizabeth Banks was brilliant, everyone needs a tiger of a mother like this.This movie was quirky, inventive unpredictable and within its genre came up with the goods. A thoroughly good night out was had by all.PS, I did learn one thing, if you find a baby in the woods, don't keep it, hand it in to social services so it becomes their problem and not your's........lol",Brightburn

87,gedikreverdi,"It's a brutal, graphic and gory anti-hero movie",7,31 January 2021,"Brandon Breyer fell to the earth in a space ship and the couple adopted him because they couldn't have their own child. The kid grew up and has become a young guy and the girl he has a crush on mocked him and he crushed her crush's hand. Her mom wanted them to lock him up and Brandon killed her in her workplace diner and she hid in the refrigerator and Brandon destroyed the door and the scene when a shard from the lamp stuck in her eye and he hid her body by the space ship that their parents hid in the barn of their farm. The school counselor aunt told him she'd tell the police about him not being remorseful about the incident. And he showed up at their house and had his uncle have an accident because he told he'd tell to his parents about him breaking into their house. His jaw came off and the scene was extremely gory. His father took him away for the weekend and both went hunting and the father wanted to shoot her in the head in the forest because he knew he's the killer. The bullet just didn't work and he burn his father's head with laser coming out of his eyes. Back home he float in the air and destroyed the house while his mother hid and called the police. He crushed the sheriff by the entrance and the other officer. Then his mom went to the space show because it's the only think that could hurt him and took a piece from it to stab him and before she stabbed he noticed and took her above the clouds and threw her back. A plane was coming at that moment and later on he was said to be the sole survivor of the plane that crashed in their farmhouse. He made everything look like an accident including death of his parents and he painted his emblem on the plane wreck with blood as well. It might have had a more elaborate story but still it was a very fun film to watch. I liked his emblem, his costume including his snow mask-like mask and his bright red eyes with very gory killings which make the movie worth seeing.",Brightburn
88,muamba_eats_toast,Enjoyable twist on the classic superhero genre,7,10 June 2019,Nice to see something not following the usual formula in regards to superhero films. Written very well and left me craving more would love a 2nd movie following on from this. Yes it's low budget and at times you can tell with some of the special effects and it's by no means perfect.

Suspense behind his unlimited power is not revealed during the movie and not even at the end, so one can will have to watch another sequel. One time watch is sufficient to such slow and dumb movie.
Acting by Elizabeth Banks (mother) is good. Jackson Dunn (boy) has a plain and emotionless face makes a kind of impression to his role. David Denman well acted surprised father. Means acting side is well but story is weak. So think once before watch this title.",Brightburn

93,rockman182,Brightburn (2019),6,25 May 2019,"So, its like Superman gone wrong. I think the trailer for this really was a standout because of its portrayal of a ""special"" boy with powers and his adopted parents. We soon start to see that this boy is actually terrorizing people with his superpowers instead of using it to help people. I like that the film is a different take on the ever popular superhero genre. There are things I like about this film but also parts that did not work for me.The film is about an alien boy who crashes into a farm in the hands of a couple who have been trying to conceive for quite some time. Overtime the boy, initially seeming like a normal but awkward kid, becomes a psychotic and a purely evil being that goes on a murdering rampage. His parent's start to realize the abnormalities of their son and must come to terms with the horrors that their son is causing. The film is offered by the cousins of James Gunn, of Guardians of the Galaxy fame.I liked the concept of a superhero gone terribly wrong. The creative costume of Brandon Breyer and the true nature of evil was a very interesting thought. Side note, I really liked the use of the score in this film. It is at times a hopeful score, almost making it seem like Brandon is a good and misunderstood boy despite him being evil incarnate. I didn't like the stupidity of the parents, mainly Elizabeth Banks' character who wasn't written very well. If you don't like violent horror films this isn't for you, its a very R-Rated feature.Its brutal and grotesque and dark. I can appreciate that but didn't like much of the resolution of this film. The concept is great but I do feel like it needed to and could have been better. Still, I'll applaud the fact that this is an original feature despite being influenced by the superhero genre. Parts of it work but just felt like this looked more promising than what was presented.6/10",Brightburn
94,RforFilm,"It's a bird, it's a plane...he's tearing through a house. Brightburn is the dark superhero story we never knew we wanted",7,30 May 2019,"There's a saying that comic book heroes are the modern equivalent to Greek gods, and I believe it. They are stories about humans with cosmic powers (or at least with a better advantage) who try and do good with the common people and stop forces of evil. What makes them fascinating that in another timeline, they could have gone bad and have become a threat to humanity. This isn't exactly the first time this has been suggested as comic books have talked about that fine line superheroes walks and how close they are to going to the other side.One such story is an alternate take on Superman called Red Son, where instead of being raised in Kansas in America, he's raised in the Soviet Union as a national symbol for their country. It was a phenomenal exploration on what could have been if the Earth had been in a different position when the son of Krypton came. That not only changes the story and tone, but that almost turns the series from an adventure into a thriller. Though we'll never know what Superman would be like as evil, we do come close to an idea in the superhero/horror, Brightburn.Local farmers Tori (played by Elizabeth Banks) and Kyle Breyer (played by David Denman) are trying to conceive a child when they hear a crash. Inside the small ship, they find a child they decide to raise as their own. The child grows into Brandon (played by Jackson A. Dunn), a bright twelve year-old who seems to enjoy his life and parents. He goes to school, sketches, has crushes, and seems to be like any other boy in his class. As his birthday approaches, he starts to hear voices that encourages him to test his seemingly invulnerable body. He realizes he's not like other kids.Though his parents see that his personality is changing and they even see pictures of the human body under his bed, they dismiss it as upcoming puberty and curiosity into girls. But as Brandon seems to sleepwalk more and shows no remorse over things he does, his father starts to suspect a dark side in his son. Animals and even humans start to get killed off and the parents look into Brandon and how his powers (flight, speed, laser eyes, etc...) are showing just how dangerous he can be. Can his mother still love him when her child is capable of destroying cities?What makes Brightburn a good movie is it's willingness to have some fun with it's idea. Yes, it's a horror, but I would count this as a coming of age story. Because of this, this gives a chance for young actor Jackson A. Dunn to really shine with his two different personalities on screen; one of a young naiveté searching for his place and another of a dark demon. Think if young Damian from The Omen had a voice. It's effective in being scary and sympathetic.Another way to describe the story is something similar to a Stephen King book. It has a similar premise of a ordinary character dealing with a supernatural phenomenon, and yet tries to understand it, despite not being the smartest one. This is where Elizabeth Banks and David Denman stand as good examples of screen parents that are well written. There have their flaws, like the father being hard and the mom being highly protective, but this is the nature of a lot of people, especially those from the Midwest. You want to see them figure out their son even if you think they could have done things different.Brightburn is a good, entertaining turn on superhero movies. Good, but not great. I can't image what great things you can do with this. If I had any qualms with it, then I wished it would have taken a few more unpredictable turns for the child rather then going dark too quickly. It's definitely for those want a spooky good time and maybe even a good drama to go with it. It's a movie that builds something dangerous and ends with something that could become even deadlier. If this movie gets a sequel I hope it follows up on the child's story and the consequence of his actions.I'll give this seven broken lawnmowers out of ten. Would I count this as terrifying? Not in my eye, but I can see those that are easy to scare getting a jump. Brightburn does count as a good starter for those that want to watch more horror movies, but want something lighter. Check it out and be nice to your neighbor...you never know if they have super speed.",Brightburn

However, instead of becoming the savior of Earth, what if he turns into someone far more treacherous.Brightburn is a brilliant film. Director David Yarovesky & writers Mark Gunn & Brian Gunn have turned the typical superhero movie, right on its head. Brightburn is a very dark tale about what if, Superman turned out to be evil instead of good. This film is a horror movie disguised as a superhero/anti-hero movie. There are a lot of extremely gory scenes that might make you close your eyes. Just be warned. This film is not for the faint of heart. It succeeds at what it sets out to do. Start looking at the whole alien superhero myth, not with just adoration but a little bit of skepticism as well. Elizabeth Banks is spectacular as Tori Breyer. David Denman is great as Kyle Breyer. Jackson A. Dunn is the star of the show, as Brandon Breyer. Matt Jones & Meredith Hagner are awesome as Noah McNichol & Merilee McNichol. Emmie Hunter & Becky Wahlstrom are fantastic as Caitlyn & Erica, respectively. Brightburn is worth a watch for a different take on the superhero genre. Now, I'll be looking forward to more horror/superhero hybrid movies. However, give this a miss, if you hate gratuitous violence. Go, be terrified.",Brightburn

In Brightburn the whole Bizarro concept appears to have been borrowed and tweaked without any acknowledgements to anyone at DC.So yeah check: 1 Childless farming couple. 2 Rural small town location. 3 Alien baby crash-lands undetected on Earth on couple's farm. 4 Couple adopts baby and hides spaceship. 5 Kid grows up , develops and becomes very much aware of his super powers, after receiving some guidance from his home planet. 6 Kid kills a lot of people, violently. 7 The End with a nod to a possible set of sequels..It all pans out very predictably, which is a bit of a shame as producer James Gunn, brought a lot of unpredictability to Guardians of the Galaxy (especially Chapter 1) as director, which made them so entertaining. This, on the other hand, just seems to be ticking boxes (albeit well-produced ones). And really, Brendan faces no challenges.

The gore and kills were excellent but they were few and far between.
The characters make some of the worst decisions that make all of the usual horror tropes look intelligent by comparison.
It takes a while to get going then is very stop/start.
If they had built up to our lead character becoming the villain then he owned it from there it would've been great. Instead it builds slowly to him doing something then switches back him being normal as if nobody knows what he is. I found myself bored until the very end scene.",Brightburn

The film really should begin after the ""Ten years later"". I think his gradual change should have been fleshed out a little by giving the story about an extra 20 to 30 minutes and makes his change very subtle. I just though the scene were David Denman tries to get rid of him during the hunting trip was a bit too soon for his character. I think more should have happened before he reach that decision.But overall, the kill scenes were wonderful and well done. The acting was very good.

104,bob-the-movie-man,This little horror is a minor classic.,9,12 June 2019,"I normally dislike jump scares in movies. They are a sign of a desperate horror script that has nowhere else to go. Brightburn is different. It starts with a few jumps - both auditory and visual - that serve no real purpose in the story. It's the director (David Yarovesky) giving the horror equivalent of a ""nudge, nudge"". It says ""Buckle up, it's going to be a bumpy ride""! And the warning is well deserved. It's been a while since I've seen so many women (and not a few men) cowering into their partners.Childless couple Martha and Jonathan Kent... no, sorry, wrong film... Tori and Kyle Breyer (Elizabeth Banks and David Denman) are living in Brightburn Kansas when an unearthly child is delivered to them - - out of the blue, as it were. Brandon (Jackson A. Dunn) grows up as a weedy but highly intelligent 12 year old. But an alien call wakes Brandon into puberty in a wholly unusual way, and life in the normally quiet town of Brightburn is about to get a lot more concerning for the Sheriff's department.The similarities with a certain DC superhero backstory are stark and playfully whittled into an unfamiliar form. Even down to a flash of red cape as young Brandon rises from his bed taking his sheet with him. It's a riff on a ""what if"": what if the Man of Steel grew up not to be a mild-mannered reporter, but turned to the dark side instead?But this is rather simplistic. The movie is outrageously predictable.... until it pulls your comfort rug suddenly from under your feet. Virtually nothing you expect to happen actually happens. Glory be! It's a Hollywood film without a Hollywood film arc!With a CV that includes ""Pitch Perfect 2"", ""Pitch Perfect 3"" and ""The Happytime Murders"" , Elizabeth Banks holds a special role of honour on my blog by being involved with movies that have consistently made my ""Turkeys of the Year"" list. So her involvement in this, was not a good sign. But how wrong I was. Banks is actually very effective here as the desperate adoptive mother of the little monster: ""You will ALWAYS be my baby boy"" she coos, even when all seems hopeless. Equally good is David Denman as Brandon's 'father'.The film takes its time to introduce them both as a genuinely loving and caring farming couple, and the pair come across so naturally that you can comfortably get to believe the ""normal"" before the ""abnormal"" arrives.Jackson A. Dunn plays young Brandon: if you recognise him, he played the young 12-year old Scott Lang in ""Avengers: Endgame"". Here he is gloriously creepy as the supernatural child: both terrifying and utterly normal from scene to scene.The film effectively builds tension, through the use of well chosen music (by Tim Williams, who's previously mostly done orchestration and conducting for a wide range of recent hit movies). That tension needs to be released.... and it is with some effective horror that hits 11 on the ketchup scale. There were apparently two short scenes cut by the BBFC to get the UK15 certificate, but it still feels that the producers (literally) got away with murder to get that certificate approved. If you are of the nervous/squeamish variety, this is probably a film worth you giving a miss.Director David ""Yarvo"" Yarovesky has previously worked with producer James Gunn on ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", but this should be his breakout movie.It's budget was a mere $7 million. Yep, you heard that right. That's over 28 times cheaper than the bloated blah-fest irrelevance that was ""Dark Phoenix"".""Brightburn"" is a movie that I foresee will divide audiences but then build a reputation as a classic of the genre. It has the creepiness of an ""Omen""; the jump scares of an ""Alien""; the darkness of a ""Midnight Special""; and the unpredictability of a ""Cloverfield"". It's not quite perfection: for me, its story stretches credibility in some places (that real action wasn't taken by the legal/social car services earlier!). But it still deserves to be a big hit. I think it will be.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the interweb or Facebook. Thanks).",Brightburn

106,silvermistvio,Superman in evil version. 😂,8,21 June 2019,"Brightburn is a complete different superhero film I've ever seen. Mostly, it's because it's not a good superhero. I mean it's an evil superhero. We all have seen that a superhero arrived to the earth and becomes a hero on earth by means of their superb abilities. Because they are different from us, they can do what we could only imagine. Hence, they have became superheroes.When you watch those kinds of superheroes films, have you ever wondered that one of them might be evil? Well, I have. At that time, it was just my imagination. But now, they made it real. This is a film of a superhero film but it's kind of evil superhero. Moreover, it's not even an adult. It's just a kid.Not all superpowered people are good. Some might be bad, very bad. I kind of love that concept. I always wanted to see this kind of unusual films. But never had a chance. When I saw this film is coming out, I was looking forward to it. So, when it comes out, I watched it immediately.The plot seems to be simple, no twists, and the screenplay is a little bit weird. But the film really turned into a great one because of the great performances of actors and addresses and all. Brightburn really gives a total different taste. So, I have completely enjoyed it.The film says it's horror and Sci-fi. For sci-fi, it's still okay. But as for horror, I don't see why and how this film makes into horror genre. There's no frightening and/or something like that about it except for a scene where that woman pull the broken glass out of her eye. It's kind of frightening but I feel like the rest is fine.Even though it's a great film and I've totally enjoyed it, there's something I don't like. It's the fact that Brandon killed his adopted mother and father. Their kindnesses on him is so big. They have brought him up. I'd say it's the greatest kindness of all. There are two kinds of parents. One is the ones who give birth to you and the ones who feast you. Both are great. But I think the kindness of the parents who feast you and brought you up is the greatest of all. Whatever you do, you can't just ignore their kindness. So, Brandon shouldn't killed him no matter what, even they want to kill him because they have feasted him since he's a child. They even own his life. Hence, I don't like that fact.Except for that little fact, the rest is okay. The original score is so perfect and also I feel like the end credit song is kind of harmony to the film. Because everything's perfect and thus, it's very good to enjoy. I don't know about the others, I really love this film and I've totally enjoyed every second of it.",Brightburn
107,kjproulx,A Solid Spin on a Familiar Tale,8,26 May 2019,"I'll be honest right off the bat in saying that I'm not a fan of movies that feel like blatant rip-offs to classic stories, without doing anything new in the process. While I found myself admittedly sort of angry at the idea of taking the Superman origin story and turning it into a horror film, I was cautiously optimistic, due to the fact that there can be potential there in the right hands. When hearing that director James Gunn would be backing this film (known as Brightburn) as its producer, I was sold and needed to eventually give this one a watch. Happily, this movie embraces the fact that the story it's telling is stale and ends up being a really enjoyable movie.After numerous unsuccessful attempts at giving birth, a couple is given the choice to adopt when an alien spacecraft hits Earth, containing a young child. Naming him Brandon and having him grow up and have a normal life on a farm, what nobody knows, including Brandon himself, is that he possesses otherworldly abilities. From having powers to having two parents and living on a farm in Kansas, this movie does not shy away from the fact that it's simply telling the Superman story; However, what if the kid with the powers never once thought about using these powers for good?That is the pitch that I'm sure the filmmakers gave to the studio because there's no other way to sell this movie to a broad audience. Personally, this concept seemed odd in theory but ultimately worked for me as a finished film. With some solid jump scares and a well-shot environment, Brightburn is a very effective horror film, an even more effective thriller, and a slightly entertaining action film at times as well. This is a well-made movie from start to finish and I can't find many things to complain about, but the fact that it really is the Superman story beat for beat, it does feel a little unoriginal.Known for directing one other feature film, along with a few shorts and editing gigs, David Yarovesky is a name that I will look for in the future, especially in the horror genre. While I don't think his skills are necessarily limited to horror, he has proven here that he is a director to keep an eye on. I had honestly never heard of him prior to seeing this film, but he deserves quite a lot of recognition for this one.In the end, Brightburn probably won't be remembered by many as one of the great horror films, but I'd be lying if I didn't say that I had a blast watching it. From beginning to end, I was hooked on the familiar elements, remained engaged by the performances and horror elements, and ended up being overly satisfied with how certain things turned out in the end. Filled with gore while telling a classic Superman story, this movie won't be for those who don't like graphic content, but I can absolutely recommend it to those who do. Brightburn is a very, very solid movie.",Brightburn
108,kuarinofu,Predictable but still interesting b-movie horror,6,26 August 2019,"Brightburn was a good watch. I think I made the movie a little less interesting and original for me cause I've seen it after I binge-watched The Boys.The weird thing about this film is that, while it was supposed to be original, it came out to be quite predictable. Other than the predictability, it was mostly well done. For me, it was only lacking actual Brightburn development. The kid was a good actor, and I think he could handle it. I mean, the whole point of making him a kid was that his transformation would've been projected through growing up and trying to understand himself and the world around him. For me, they didn't capitalize on that.Overall, the film had good (and a little generic and cliche) horror elements, nice gore and blood utilization, good music and ok special effects. As I've said, would've worked better with more focus on BB himself and not the parents, and if they would've provided more scale to it.",Brightburn
109,Neptune165,You sure your not from the DC UNIVERSE?,4,10 August 2019,"Avoid it at all cost. ""two parents grateful to have a child but slowly realizing it was a big mistake"". The Villian was pure evil. No redeeming the boy at all. In other word ""what if superman became evil when he knew he have power?"" The brightburn sign is similar to Bluetooth sign. I think his motivation is quite clear, he was sent there to take over the earth. It was pretty obvious that his ship was communicating to him that his was sent there for a specific reason, but the crash landing delayed that message. Meanwhile his parents raised him to be good but his ""programming"" eventually took over. Unfortunately I don't think that at any point they could have hid the fact that he was an alien cause the whole hook was evil superman. This is by far the worst horror Movie that I've ever seen, I saw it today & I wasn't impressed. the 'rushed' feeling. I mostly felt that when the kid would do something terrible, then they would cut to the parents going to bed. I was like, ""Aren't you going to even TALK to your kid about what just happened???"" The other rushed part was that he was a good kid for 12 years, then all of a sudden the ship awakens (somehow / for no reason) and turns him evil instantly. What is the story behind the ship (not that I care, but the ship is possessed or something)..A few complaints about the film: it felt rushed. I wanted far more character development...he went from being normal to frightening way too fast, and sometimes a few of the scenes didn't make a lot of sense. For example, in order to get to the uncle, he stalks the wife, his aunt, but then doesn't really do anything, he's just discovered in the closet. That small portion felt anticlimactic, and made me feel they had something in mind, and didn't know how to make it work? I'm not sure. They also could've had a few more reveals of the boy actually doing the things...instead of just having the thing happened without showing him doing it. I know that was probably a budget thing...more effects requires more money...but I felt that could've been better. I'm SUPER GLAD they did NOT end it the way it looked like it might end. That twist was good. BUT...but...I wish they'd not given the credits sequences from the news, because that kind of ruins the chance for the story to continue. I suppose it still could, but they'd have to work around that.",Brightburn

Brightburn has the task of making a coherent storyline and it does to a certain level. The film is at its best when it shrugs off conventional storytelling, and that is Gunns influence shining through. I'm happy with the film as it is and I hope it will gather a cult following to keep this film alive. The ending was interesting and leaves this in an interesting place for more films.

112,Darkside-Reviewer,"""Take the world!""",7,6 October 2020,"The idea of a supervillain movie is nothing new typically these kinds of movies are origin stories of already well established supervillains from comic books or movies. Brightburn however goes in a bit of a different direction instead of creating a new supervillain with a crazy personality or yet another story about a good guy turned bad due to their tragic past that has left them cold and bitter Brightburn attempts something a little different.Brightburns story is essentially the same as Supermans origin story. An asteroid carrying a pod space craft crashes in the small Kansis town of Brightburn. A man and a woman unable to have children find a young baby boy inside the pod ship and decide to adopt him as their own son naming him Brandon. They raise him in a happy home treating him as they would their own child teaching him good values and raising him as best they can but on his twelfth birthday he his awoken in the night by a strange voice beckoning him to the barn where the craft that brought him to earth is locked away that night something evil awakens within him. Brandon's behaviour begins to change from a sweet young boy into a manipulative and violent young boy who is willing to hurt anyone who gets in his way even those closest to him.Brightburn is essentially a horror movie version of the Superman TV series Smallville the only difference is instead of it being a story about a young superhero discoving his powers and helping those around him. This story is about a young boy discoving his powers and using them to hurt people, get his own way and essentially become an evil superman. Brandon's powers are almost identical to Supermans he has super strength, heat vision and is impervious to bullets and man made weapons and just like Superman the only thing that can harm him is metal from his own planet much like Superman and kryptonite.Brightburn is meant to be a horror movie that shows us what it would be like if a powerful Superhero like Superman was evil now when I first heard the idea I initially thought of a character like Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers but with superpowers a Slasher movie supervillain if you will. The movie does have a couple of cool and gory death scenes in it but so much more could of been done with this idea a supervillain who is pure evil with no morals destroying the world and killing people in new and inventive ways would of made for an awesome horror movie. Brightburn is still a good movie it has an interesting storyline, great special effects, blood and gore, and great acting throughout it's definitely worth watching it's just a little underwhelming for such an ambitious horror movie.",Brightburn

114,msbreviews,Rating: B,7,21 August 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Brightburn is one of those few movies throughout the year that can grab everyone's attention solely due to its premise. In a world where the superhero genre is oversaturated with almost a comic-book-based film each month, the Gunn family delivers an unique concept that I don't think it was ever explored this way. ""What if Superman was evil?"" is an idea that can be developed through so many different ways, depending on the director and screenwriters' approach. David Yarovesky clearly drew inspiration from Zack Snyder's version (Man of Steel), and that's where the movie is best: in exploring the vast and interesting possibilities that a screenplay like this can pursue.Usually, when someone writes something along the lines of ""it felt like two movies"", it's not a good sign. Brightburn is a dark, mysterious and suspenseful film during the first half, but then it pretty much transforms itself into a horror-slasher flick, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I firmly believe that no audience member (and I would even dare write critics as well) will leave the theater completely satisfied or entirely disappointed. If you expected the Gunn family to delve deep into Superman's mythology and explore some twisty paths, they do rely on classic scenes to show how it all could have been if ""Clark Kent"" wasn't a nice boy.If you were expecting a movie closer to the horror genre, the last half of the film offers some good sequences. However, that's when the movie loses what made me go watch it in the first place. It's a very short film and it ends in a way that leaves me wanting more. The big problem here is that it's likely not going to get a sequel, and it could have easily added extra 20-30 minutes to deliver a more fulfilled story.Production-wise, having in mind its low budget, it looks remarkably great. Some good moments of gorgeous cinematography, and beautiful wide shots. The jump scare sequences of the second half aren't nearly as effective as they could be, but at least the editing throughout the entire runtime is seamless. With a few more creative and entertaining scenes, Brightburn could have been a lot more menacing and scarier. I only remembered it was R-rated once the first bloody and quite violent moment occurs, and these specific moments are definitely eye-opening, gruesome and horrifying, even though it gets too over-the-top a couple of times.Elizabeth Banks (Tori Breyer) delivers a notable performance, as well as David Denman (Kyle Breyer). Their characters have a compelling backstory, and they actually have a well-developed script. They don't make dumb or irrational decisions, like the generic horror characters that we all recognize. Jackson A. Dunn (Brandon) is pretty good as the evil Superman, even if his performance ends up being too monotonous for me. Looking at the overall feedback from both critics and audience, this seems to be part of those rare films each year which I enjoy a bit more than most people.All in all, Brightburn doesn't take off powerfully like Superman, but it's still able to fly for a bit. With good performances, remarkable production design, and an adequate use of its R-rating, the Gunn family delivers an incredibly captivating concept which is explored through an interesting yet unfulfilling screenplay. The second half turns the movie into a pure slasher flick, which might positively affect some viewers, but for me it took away what was really entertaining. The ending is just a taste of what the film could have been and it's disappointing that it doesn't explore its fantastic idea more in-depth, but the final feeling about the movie isn't too bad either.",Brightburn

A creature full of sinister intent; The exact opposite of what Superman Stands for! Brightburn is a revelation in terms of concept but unfortunately the final outcome couldn't deliver it a justified end result. A Bleaker direction left a unsatisfying taste in the end.The film is about an other worldly creature raised by loving and caring parents. Supportive and overly defensive about the Child as they were having much difficulties having one by themselves! One day this kid finds about his abilities and Contrary to what Superman aka Clark Kent did with his power; Brendan Breyer decided to do the exact opposite. Meanwhile arising an Important but relevant question, what if a super alien being turns bad and goes sideways. What if he decides to become what people don't generally expect? An interesting take without any doubt.Regarding technicalities, it delivers. Even under a constraint budget allocation; it never seemed cheap nor felt ordinary by any scale. The right amount of detailings has been carefully dedicated when it comes to Character designing and Gory parts.
It shines whenever there is a hint of action; whether Violence, Gore or Profanity it surely takes its game up in those particular moments. On the other aspects, the same cannot be said. Despite some memorable performances, I felt the characters lacking dimensionality. A bit of Backstory & Context could have helped.The inconsistencies in the screenplay craft is disheartening. I guess the makers have been confused about the right treatment that would be fitting for the movie. As in many scenes a more lighter, more generic approach could easily be noticed. That essentially brought down the Vibe, atmospheric suspense. But as I said earlier; this movie showcases its true mertis when it goes darker. The niche horror elements aren't really scary per se but eventually helped building up the tense moments. A movie about an evil entity, must be given a more unconventional route. And whenever it decided so, it has shown its hidden potential.In short, it's a reversion of Super Hero concept, that is intriguing enough for you to give it a chance and The premise itself indeed overpowers any shortcomings from the film's actual presentation. A pleasure viewing nevertheless.",Brightburn

119,MrDHWong,A twisted deconstruction of superhero origin stories that both surprises and horrifies,7,23 May 2019,"Brightburn is a superhero horror film co-produced by James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy) and directed by David Yarovesky. Starring Elizabeth Banks, David Denman, and Jackson A. Dunn, it is a twisted deconstruction of superhero origin stories that both surprises and horrifies.In the town of Brightburn, Kansas, married couple Kyle (David Denman) and Tori Breyer (Elizabeth Banks) are having trouble conceiving a child when a meteor crashes near their house. Upon investigation, the couple discover a baby inside and the two of them decide to adopt him and name him Brandon. Twelve years later, Brandon (Jackson A. Dunn) is going through puberty, when he realises that he has superhuman powers after the meteor containing him speaks to him telepathically with sinister intent. Now aware of his destiny, Brandon decides to use his powers to bring his own dark sense of justice to those around him.As a familiar take on the genre, Brightburn delivers an interesting look at the idea of an ""evil Superman"" while also working as an effective horror film in its own right. The film could also be considered a metaphor for the birth of a psychopath, growing up in a world where being different makes them feel like their own method of handling it is to hurt others. This is similar to the found footage film Chronicle, where the main characters have superpowers but decide to use them for their own selfish reasons. The acting is great all round, especially from newcomer Jackson A. Dunn as Brandon, who pulls off the frightening weird kid trope perfectly. However, the one major problem this film has is its short length, clocking in at just 90 minutes. Unfortunately this is hardly enough time to truly take in all of the creepy atmosphere to allow it to sink in as well as it should. It's a shame that this film will likely be brushed aside for other films of this type but hopefully it will gain the cult following it deserves in the future. With that said, this is certainly worth a look for anyone wishing to take a break from the conventional superhero movie.I rate it 7/10",Brightburn

No time is really invested into characters, so you don't really feel anything for them. The concept, while fascinating, is never fully explored. The actors all do their best though and are solid throughout. The film is also surprisingly gore-filled and there were some genuinely queasy moments. Everything just chugs along at a breakneck pace and it plays out as you'd expect. There was an opportunity to take a lot of chances with this story, but it decides to settle for being a mildly entertaining flick.",Brightburn
122,CANpatbuck3664,Enjoyable and Intriguing Despite Some Issues,8,7 June 2019,"As a movie, Brightburn is built around a strong premise, what if Superman wasn't the perfect child of 2 farmers? What if he had gone the other way? But the real heart of Brightburn is the Breyer family dynamic. Its not just about Brandon discovering these powers and then seeking vengeance, its about how his parents did his best to care for him, raise him right and even try to understand when his true nature was revealed. Some people may see this as focusing on the less exciting part but this was the part of the movie that worked the best for me. Tori and Kyle are easy to like and understand as characters. You can identify with them trying to explain away what their son is truly doing or looking for reason when there isn't one. They feel like two real people caught in this fantastical story and despite Tori being just a little slow on the uptake (if you're asking who I identified with more, it was Kyle), I appreciated the screenwriters not making them so naive that it was unbelievable. There are several times in the movie when I would start to roll my eyes but then one of them would subvert my expectations by having a better grip on the situation, or there would be a solid joke that would make me chuckle. Kyle wants to fix the situation but he understands that Brandon may be beyond help while Tori still sees the silly and innocent little ""kid"" she found in the field as opposed to Brandon has turned into. It helped me stay on the movies side even when the movie threatened to derail with some questionable choices.Getting back to the central ideas in Brightburn, this is a horror movie with superhero drama as an appetizer. This idea has a ton of potential and I was excited to see where they would take it. The horror stuff in Brightburn is a little hit or miss. There were scenes that worked well for me (the climax in the Breyer house is appropriately creepy and has some real emotional moments or even Kyle's nightmare in the middle) but there were other scenes that fell flat (the diner scene goes on too long and is too predictable). The creative team did their job but this movie was too reliant on jump scares and it was sometimes too easy to guess what they were going to do next in those scary moments (evil character reveals themselves, a noise to distract the victim, moment of peace and then BAM!). I think they could have pushed the pedal down a little farther but the movie does also provide the level of creepiness you want from this kind of material.Despite Brandon being at the centre of the plot, the strongest performances come from Elizabeth Banks and David Denman as Brandon's well meaning parents, Tori and Kyle Breyer. Banks is especially wonderful, she's such an underrated talent and I was blown away by the work she did in this. Denman is no slouch either, he's the right mix of stern yet there's a fear and softness that comes through his performance despite him being a big, intimidating guy. But Elizabeth and David have some palpable chemistry (in more of a you buy them as a couple as opposed to passionate lust) as parents and they help sell the Breyer family as real people. They really helped prop up this movie when it got more ridiculous. On the other hand, I didn't really like Jackson A. Dunn as Brandon, he's good at looking creepy but his performance didn't feature much emotion of any kind. He was just too wooden, I don't know if he was directed to be that way or that was his choice however. I thought Emmie Hunter, Matt Jones and Meredith Hagner all did good work in their small roles.Brightburn does a lot right when it comes to the characters and plot but unlike Brandon, it can't just fly away from its problems. The largest being that while Brandon is identified as ""gifted"" from testing, his plans are pretty dumb. He's constantly implicating himself by leaving his mark at the crime scene or he can't think of a plausible story to disguise his actions at point of the movie. If Brandon was your typical kid who somehow got superpowers one fateful day (e.g. Peter Parker with the radioactive spider), I wouldn't care enough to point that out but he's supposed to be smart along with having these abilities and I couldn't believe how incompetent he was. The next thing is there isn't a clear reason that his switch flips from good to evil, sure something called to him but when the movie drops us in the present day, he seems normal enough (a little introverted and shy but that can be overcome). But he discovers something hidden on the property and he becomes a creepy sadist all of a sudden. Now, I've seen sillier explanations in other movies so that creative decision didn't ruin Brightburn but there could have been some more thought put into that.Brightburn has some sizable issues but there was enough here to carry me through the rough patches. David Denman and especially Elizabeth Banks carry this movie with their performances, the character motivations are fairly believable and more insightful (which is something a lot of movies can't do even remotely), there are nice moments of familial bonding that feel real and I thought the movie did a decent job of capitalizing on its premise. I do understand why audiences are divided on it however, I think this could be a polarizing film for people. But I liked it enough that I was happy I saw this with a friend at the theatre and I'd give Brightburn a 7.5/10 rounding up to an 8/10. I don't think it has to be seen on the big screen but I wouldn't hesitate to catch this on your preferred streaming service.",Brightburn

But, if Clark strives to 'protect' the world, Brandon should all just 'take' the world!As a synthesis: 6.4 of 10 on IMDb? Clearly underrated! In my humble opinion, it's rather 7 of 10 knowing that Jackson A. Dunn flawlessly interprets this enigmatic character.",Brightburn
133,PyroSikTh,"Great Idea, Questionable Execution",5,26 June 2019,"Brightburn is basically the story of 'what if Superman was evil?' Otherwise known as the story of Ultraman from Earth-3. In fact the similarities are so close it's amazing the movie got made in the first place. A couple living on a farm are trying and failing to have a baby, when a meteor crashes in a nearby field. Inside they find a baby, and they decide to raise it as their own. Once the child hits puberty, things start to take a dark turn as he exhibits sociopathic behaviour. Cue slasher flick where we follow a twelve year old brutally murdering people in his small town.And that last sentence is where the movie kind of lost me. Beyond the concept of an evil Superman, there's nothing to this movie that hasn't been done a million times before in other horror movies. Rather than ploughing the concept for some deeper and more interesting themes, it ditches any subtext it might have had to embark on a gore-soaked killing spree. Attempting to spin a popular superhero trope into a horror movie is a stroke of genius, but I question whether it had to be a generic, cheap horror movie.There's loads of untapped potential here, from exploring puberty in Brandon's descent into murder, as he struggles to deal with the changes he's going through and what to do about them, or twisting the superhero trope into an anti-heroic one, where he sees everything he does as good and necessary. Instead the switch is sudden and without warning, and every action he takes is purely out of self interest and anger. There's no transition at all, showing how it's all affecting him. He just goes from a perfect, likeable kid, to a complete sociopath in a single night. And there's no moral ambiguity here either. He's just a bad kid doing bad things for selfish reasons. Rather than taking the concept and exploring what it could mean, it felt more like they wanted to make a generic slasher flick about a child-murderer and fit the concept around that. Evil Superman was ultimately just fluff to make it seem different, when really it wasn't at all.Tied to this is my single biggest complaint of the movie; jump scares. Not just any jump scares, but disappointing jump scares. I don't like jump scares at the best of times, but I can appreciate them when they're used sparingly and to accentuate something actually scary. But in Brightburn there is absolutely no subtlety to the horror. Every jump scare is painfully telegraphed minutes before it happens, and every single time it's a let down; there's nothing scary about it, it's just a sudden loud noise that makes you jump out of the pure disparity in volume. That's it. That's as scary as it gets. For instance Brandon is frantically trying to get into the barn's cellar, chanting something creepy, and we follow his mother as she slowly creeps up on him, in completely silence. When she touches him to snap him out BAM massive noise in the soundtrack to make everyone jump. To what? Brandon stands up and turns around in shock. That's literally it. Yes, I rolled my eyes then and there. Another example is when he's hounding a guy in a car, but the camera keeps looking out the right-hand window. There's nothing in the window at all, but because so much attention is being paid to it, you know Brandon is going to smash into it accompanied by a sudden loud noise. Guess what happens a couple of minutes later? Uh huh.The other thing that got me was gratuity of the gore. I don't mind gore at all. I find a sick enjoyment in the Saw franchise, but it has to have a purpose. In Brightburn it means nothing, and it's given way more focus and attention than is necessary. One guy gets near decapitated at the jaw by a steering wheel. Like, how? That just wouldn't happen. And they really linger on this guy struggling to breathe afterwards as well. If this was to show Brandon's curiosity in the inner working of a ""lesser lifeform"" - fine, but we barely see Brandon's reaction because we spend too much time watching this guy spluttering, in close-up. Then there's the shard of glass in the eyeball, which is drawn out by watching her slowly pull it out in excruciating pain, or the laser-eyes through someone's skull, which also takes ages just to make sure we savoured every ounce of suffering. It was just gratuitous for gratuity's sake. And there's no build-up to it either. The eyeball is one of the first things we see after a broken wrist, maybe about halfway through the film, and it's debatably the worst of the lot.Brightburn fundamentally failed as a good horror movie. It felt cheap and unnecessary, like it was trying to squeeze horror out of something that didn't have much. If it had taken a slower approach, really leaned into Brandon's descent into madness, used the gore a little more wisely, and cut way back on the jump-scares, this could've been really good. There's some good ideas and a lot of potential, but they seemed to lose all imagination after they came up with the pitch and just slotted it into a generic slasher movie. I give Brightburn a mediocre 5/10.",Brightburn
134,sweidman-28016,Creative Anti-Superman Movie,6,29 May 2019,"Brightburn Review:Brightburn poses the question: What if a child from another world crash-landed on Earth, but instead of becoming a hero to mankind, he proved to be something far more sinister? In easier terms, what if a teenage Superman turned evil rather than doing good. I wasn't sure how this movie would turn out. The concept really interested me but I just wasn't sure if it would turn out fine. I was actually surprised by this movie. After the mixed reviews this was better than I expected. So the plot is very self explanatory. It's a gory anti-Superman. I was surprised by how gory this was. There was one scene in particular, I think it's in the trailer, but I felt the pain the character felt. It was disgusting and I loved it. I really like gore when done well. So back to the story. I watched a review suggesting that it would be just a little more interesting if we didn't know right from the beginning that this kid, Brandon Breyer, was an alien until later on. I do agree with that and I think it would be cool to do, but it's fine the way it is. The scene where we find out he crashed from space is literally in the first minute of the movie. Since it's only 90 minutes long I did feel like almost the whole runtime was rushed. By 10 minutes the conflict starts arising right away. I feel it would've benefited if it had about 15 more minutes to slow down and possibly add a few more interesting scenes. Now since we've seen the whole Superman thing it's kind of predictable what going to happen to Brandon, and I wish it just wasn't Superman powers and something a little more. The best part of the story had to be the conflict Brandon's parents, Tori and Kyle, are going through. They've been trying their best all these years to contain him and hope for the best and all of this is happening at once. There are moments when they're like ""My son couldn't have done that"" but I feel like it's a little more understandable in this one rather than in some other movies. The two are in shock of what is all happening at once. Elizabeth Banks and David Denman have the best performances in the movie. They're just two scared, confused parents who weren't expecting this sinister form to come reveal itself. I thought Jackson A. Dunn was fine as Brandon. He felt a little wooden at times and I can understand that as a child actor. And it takes a lot of work to play a character like that at a young age. He did do a good job at being creepy I guess. Going of the creepiness, the gore once again was pretty good but what surprised me the most was the visual effects. So the visual effects weren't anything mind blowing but for a low budget movie I was surprised. I was thinking this might be about $20M or more but it's only $7M which is surprising. So I'd say that's pretty good for a low budget movie. The cinematography was also pretty good in some spots. It just shows that you don't need a big budget to make a movie look good. For my problems I guess I would say it felt really rushed, somewhat predictable, and there was just something that felt off to me. I'm not exactly sure what it was but something felt off. For scariness I didn't think it was all that scary. Really no horror movie has actually scared me. There was some jump scares, which I really don't think jump scares are good scares. They feel cheap and I think scares should be used through images and tone. Those create actual anxiety rather than a jump followed by a sort of laugh at yourself. Also there was a fake jump scare where it was actually something ""scary"" and I hate those because they aren't necessary. That's my thoughts for the horror part. Some might find this nerve wracking but I guess not me. Overall I think this was a fine movie. It helped that the Gunn family was apart of this and they're involved with superhero movies. I would recommend this to superhero fans who are looking for something new and different.My Grade: B-",Brightburn
135,funtasticfour,Been waiting a lifetime for this twist on Superman!,8,28 October 2019,A great idea and cast. Effects were choppy but the make-up effects were great. I'm hoping for a sequel or series of these movies. A prequel or anything to tell more about this kids origin.,Brightburn
136,ethanbresnett,A waste of an intriguing concept,4,7 March 2020,"This film was just a big bunch of nothing. There was so much potential for Brightburn to become a chilling psychological thriller about a tortured boy coming to terms with the power he holds. Instead it ended up feeling like a cheap horror flick relying on jump scares.The story was largely non-existent which was such a shame. I'm not saying I needed a full on explanation as to why Brandon has powers, where he came from etc, sometimes the mystery in these things adds to the story. What was lacking however was any meaningful reason as to why Brandon went from farm boy to a psychopath with a god complex. He sneaked into that girl's room and from there escalated to hand breaking, murder and then mass murder in the space of a few days. None of it felt very authentic or character driven. The plot seemed to be an excuse to set up some gory set pieces.What was really disappointing about this film was it's reliance on jump scares to establish Brandon as troubled and aggressive. There was so much scope to focus more on his character and show a slow corruption of his psyche, perhaps adopting a Dr Manhattan ish view of humanity where they were just beneath him. It just seems that there were so many different ways that they could have gone, and instead they opted to give no character development or explanation of Brandon's internal monologue.Aside from the troubled plot, the film felt awfully bitty. There wasn't a lot of cohesion and flow with the opening two thirds of the movie. It seems like somebody dropped a load of story board plaques and picked them up and shot them in a random order. There was a sense that they were itching to get to the final set piece (which admittedly did have some good visuals), and dispensed with the formality of producing a good film up to that point.The one saving grace was Elizabeth Banks who managed to inject some class into a lacklustre superhero horror flick. Not one to be remembered unfortunately.",Brightburn

139,nikola17,it's Bad Blood movie version of Superman,8,29 May 2019,"A Deeply disturbing, gory film intelligently made About time to have stand alone dark horror superhero movie that is nothing related to Marvel with Disney because if this was in marvel with Disney in you don't wanna piss of this kid who is like superman version of evil kind that is he is boy of steel, he has powers, and can shoot Red lasers like what superman does. he uses his powers to kill anyone that's why he wanted to destroy marvel and said i don't want this to be marvel movie. this is great film that is something different which is great at least with disappointment Venom at least this kid got nuts then to Tom Hardy in Venom. this is how Venom should have been dark, violent, scary and villain that's how i wanted but this movie has balls of steel this kid got balls of steel doesn't care if this is a R RATED Strong violent rest of kids they can turn on Nickelodeon or Disney channel, but this kid turns on hard R RATED. this is one of enjoyable horror superhero film then topet sematary (2019) or film Jordan Peele US, he wishes this was his movie well thank god he doesn't own this movie. for people which is curious about this movie it's like short of mixed evil horror of superman witch story is well written to know what would superman would look like if he was evil, like very like of superman but with a sinister horror style, story follows Tori Breyer (Elizabeth Banks) wife to Kyle Breyer (David Denman) they are living in the farm couple living in Brightburn, Kansas. The two are trying to have a child, but have failed to conceive due to infertility issues. One night, a spaceship falls from the sky near their farm with a baby boy inside. Upon finding him, the couple decide to adopt him as their own, naming him Brandon (Jackson A. Dunn) now the kid is not annoying he is not pain in butt or anything like that he is a smart kid who gets bullied and a girl who cares about him as well. yeah i would say that's very touchable but he is still evil kid who has powers all that but maybe he is too young not very mature to be controlling himself but he is evil sinister, but movie keeps all its mystery some people call it a young alien boy who lands on earth and realizes he has superpowers; soon using them to terrorize the surrounding town. Alien boy a evil sinister dark evil version of superman who has superhuman strength and can shoot red lasers from his eyes. I thought thisfilm had a lot great moments as well like mum and dad spending time with son and celebrated his birthday, dad toke him to hunting. after all this moves really forward film, it never was a slow pacing at all it's fast forward Slaright ahead and it's very watchable film, i guess this would be my list of superhero movies and it's about time that someone has balls of steel to make this into a R RATED film. Not like Venom with tom hardy AKA tom Softy wanted a PG-13 Venom wanted to be a anti-hero venom should been this movie style it's villain character type of thing but no Venom is related to Spiderman franchise. But this is nothing related to anything this isn't based on any comic books. this is very creative superhero stand alone movie like Chronicle (2012) that teenage superhero film or like kick ass or Hancock or Unbreakable or Robocop or super those superhero movies but it's a stand alone because it's aren't based on anything. It's great to have a random superhero we never seen at all or based in any comic book. this director who hasn't made any movies expect for The Hive (2014) he is more producer and does editing for movies but this is his second film he did that was hit was this film. I am sick burned and tried of superhero movies I am tried really tried but this reason I put money in this movie, is because it's worth of giving a try something different I never saw or seen before its popular what people know like avengers that's huge hit budget and everyone knows it, but brightburn the people know it but not known very
Common like avengers. but instead of becoming a hero like always there are but this to mankind, he proved to be something far more sinister evil, mystery that doesn't tell where he is from or we don't know why he does those things because he is evil okay but just why it gives a lot of questions but theirs no punching holes in film at all. this is highly recommended give this a shot it's so worth watching the film is very opposite to superman story but expect brightburn is different and kid is evil with superman powers that's what's difference now this isn't related to Marvel or DC. we thought superman was evil but everyone is wrong this movie proofs that villain really evil superman version.",Brightburn

It's a scary thought as a parent to think how would you handle or contain it. Jeez, it's hard enough to keep kids and teens in line, but this is FRIGHTENING to even ponder. And that weird, yet simple mask he made, just was CREEPY!! :O I don't know why reviewers ask why is he like that??? Because some kids are EVIL, that whole nature vs nurture is BS. You can look through history and see that even very young kids can just be pure evil, it's like they don't have a soul and are void of empathy. It doesn't matter if they were raised by kind people and taught right from wrong. It's a mystery that hasn't been solved by any shrinks still. Supposedly Jeffrey Dalhmer's parents were nice and raised him well and he turned into a psycho cannibalizing monster.

Good actors, great special effects and an interesting concept.The only problem is that there is no story. NONE! It's all about violence and gore. If they focused on the story instead of wasting so much time on the murders and gore, it could have been so much better. Do yourself a favor and SKIP this one! It didn't cost me anything, I was streaming it so I didn't even have to waste time on waiting for the commercial to be over but I still feel cheated! I watch so many bad movies but I usually just role my eyes and move on. This one really pissed me off! What a waste of talent, money, energy, concept and time (my time)!Still want to watch this movie? Let me save you some time: a childless couple find a baby in a spaceship in the wood. Skip 10-12 years later, the child finds out he has super powers and starts murdering everyone in the most gory disgusting way. The end. Now go do something fun or at least useful.Oh and btw, a question to the poor people who watched this movie: if he never bled in his life then he must have had some sort of superpowers all along. How stupid is he? Why did it take him 12 years to figure it out? There's
no explanation to anything. That supposed seizure did what exactly? Gave him a language lesson? Increased his superpowers? Made him into a psychopath? Is that really all the explanation we get? He was sort of normal for 12 years, then he had a seizure that turned him into a murderous psychopath?

Despite this, and other glaring faults (lazy plot exposition through unnecessary dialogue), it's a taut, effective run through horror and superhero tropes, with some creepily effective scenes and a good performance from Jackson Dunn as the boy at the heart of it all. Also struggling to get out of this is a decent reflection on the hard work and fear of adoption (I write as an adoptive parent), but it's never quite fleshed out enough.

145,stevenrotherforth,What if Superman grew up to be a ****!,7,8 March 2020,"BrightburnWhat if Superman turned out to be a complete arse?
That's the premise of this surprisingly entertaining movie.
No, this is no masterpiece but it does deliver what it intends and at 1hr 30mins it is a film that doesn't outstay its welcome.Tori and Kyle Brenner are desperately trying for a baby with no success.
A gift seems to have been sent from above when a small spaceship crash lands in the woods containing a bundle of joy.
Similar to the arrival of Superman but as the child (Brandon played by Jackson A Dunn) reaches his tenth birthday he begins to change and develop some nasty traits.
He becomes super but not so super for us.Elizabeth Banks plays a good part as Tori, Brandon's mother as does David Denman as Kyle his father.
That said it is Jackson A Dunn who steals the show as the creepy Super-child.'Brightburn' delivers with the action and the frights and CGI looks decent for a movie with a modest budget of only six million dollars.
I happened to catch this movie on Sky TV.
The UHD presentation was crisp. Sadly no HDR but the image quality of this film is grain free and rather slick.
A Dolby Atmos mix would have been nice but the Dolby Digital 5.1 mix was very impressive.
LFE is thunderous. All action scenes have a deep satisfying rumble with surround sound effects attacking the listener from all angles.
I up-mixed the 5.1 track with DTS Neural X and this gave an excellent Atmos like presentation.
I would love to see this movie again on 4K Blu-ray to hear the object based audio.

This one rules them all. I don't want to start with the problems though, let's talk about the positive side. First of all, the GORE! Gotta love good gore. There's not a lot of it, but when it is - it's impressive, some quality practical effects mixed with cgi. Next little thing I noticed that I really liked was the subtle, well-placed comedy moments, I could swear it was a touch of James Gunn right there. The cinematography, the score, acting & characters were pretty much definitely above average & enjoyable to watch.The main problems I had with ""Brightburn"" included, for one, pacing. The first 40 or so minutes were nice, going up and up, exciting and all, definitely an 8/10 at that point, but then it started using too much cliche horror tropes, not enough action for the climax & Bad Guy by Billie Eilish as the credits song. That last part is alright though. To put it simply, ""Brightburn"" got more generic towards the end. Maybe I wanted a little more story as well? Not sure. I know one thing - If they get more budget for the sequel, let them come, I'll be there to see it.One little thought I had during the movie which doesn't affect the rating is that the name of it is kinda lame, based on what meaning it has in the movies universe. I suppose it counts as a spoiler, so you'll have to go and see the movie yourself.Overall an enjoyable experience & a bit irritating, because there's parts of it that could've been a lot better.

Without spoiling any plot details, it's essentially a Superman origin story reversed and with horror running through its veins. Produced by James Gunn (Guardians Of The Galaxy, Slither) and written by his cousins Brian and Mark Gunn, it's certainly got a bit of the Gunn stamp on it stylistically although I think the creeper parts of the tension building scenes are mainly thanks to some excellent framing and good direction by David Yarovesky (The Hive, Korn's 'Hater' video). There are some really cool bloody moments including one with an eyeball and a shard of glass that really made me queasy! I think the most engaging part is Elisabeth Banks' and David Denman's great performances as the child's parents Tori and Kyle. They're really convincing and I completely invested into them as a couple who are going through this traumatising experience. The horror very much plays with the demonic child subgenre from movies such as The Omen, which really taps into that fear of childbirth and children in general. However, Brightburn is a bit predictable in its narrative and scares and relies on horror cliches a bit too much (people irrationally walking into dark rooms alone, jump scares coming when expect them etc.) but is still quite entertaining and had moments of wince inducing gore.

157,movieman6-413-929510,A horror version of the Superman origin story.,6,22 May 2019,"Brightburn is a new horror film directed by David Yarovesky, the director of The Hive.In the film, Brandon Breyer (Jackson A. Dunn) teaches that there is something special about him compared to other children. His adoptive parents deny that something is wrong with him and his mother tells him that he is just special.
Despite the support of his parents, Brandon decides to find out independently what is the matter with him. In this way he discovers that he has special powers, but he only chooses not to use his powers for good purposes.With this film they have made a horror superhero movie in a creative way. With the popularity of superhero movies these days, it is nice to see a movie again, that manages to portray the well-known story in its own way. This movie comes across as an origin story about Superman, but what if Superman would be bad instead of good. Brandon can come across as the fictional character Bizarro. Bizarro is a kind of the opposite of Superman. Bizarro has the same super powers as Superman, but seems to be less intelligent than Superman.
Because it will probably take a while before a new Superman movie comes out, thanks to this movie, super hero fans get the chance to see a new kind of Superman movie.With the horror aspect of this film, they also know how to create various horrific and somewhat scary scenes and moments. For Superhelden fans this may take some getting used to, but if they are also familiar with the horror genre they can enjoy both genres in this film.The acting is also done well in the film.

You know, maybe Bruce Wayne wasn't that crazy after all when he said that. Because after seeing ""Brightburn,"" the man had a point.Directed by David Yarovesky, ""Brightburn"" is a film I was super excited about. The idea of a child (alien?) crash landing to Earth, finding out he has Superman-esque powers, and using them for evil instead of for good is such a unique concept, and it's something that really hasn't been done before. So as soon as I saw the trailer for this movie, I was hooked. You see, my friends and I hang out every Friday, drink copious amounts of alcohol, smoke pack upon pack of American Spirits (the yellow pack, of course), and then spend the rest of the night arguing with each other over the most idiotic things, but I blew them off this Friday to go watch this movie. And while seeing this movie wasn't necessarily worth ruining my friendships over, I can't say I regret my decision.""Brightburn"" was an effective science-fiction horror film. As I mentioned, the concept is endlessly intriguing. If someone found out overnight that they had that much power, it would be hard for them to remain the same good person they always were, and it's interesting to watch our ""hero,"" Brandon Breyer, try to grapple with this. One minute he's playing hide and seek, and the next he's finding out that he can fly. And when the horror hits, it hits hard. There are surprisingly gory kills in this film, one in particular so brutal that I was cringing in my seat. ""Brightburn"" is a slick looking movie for sure, with great action and suspense, and good acting all around from every character, the little girl Brandon has a crush on especially. With all that said though, it's crystal clear that the film would've greatly benefited from a longer runtime.Brandon's motivations to be evil are not well explained, which makes the film to feel rushed. It seems that once the spaceship calls out to him, it causes a switch to be flipped in his brain, simultaneously granting him his powers while compelling him to be evil. And that's fine, but it doesn't make for a very interesting character. Instead of a deconstruction of this Superman character, ""Brightburn"" turns into a slasher film. And that's not necessarily a bad thing because it does kind of subvert our expectations when it comes to what we should expect in a superhero origin story, but if this movie was slower paced and more of a dramatic character study than a horror film, it would've worked so much better. Yes, everyone likes fast-paced films, but it's not a bad thing to give your characters and the story that's being built room to breathe either. If ""Brightburn"" was even 30 minutes longer, us as an audience would've had more time to connect with the characters, making Brandon's descent into madness that much more engaging.There's a lot to like about ""Brightburn."" The concept is great, the horror elements work well, and the violence is disturbing, which makes for a scary film. But, the pacing is so quick, the events so rushed, that it, unfortunately, breaks immersion and cheapens the experience.6/10",Brightburn

173,harrylosborne,Forced horror and frail fantasy,5,16 May 2021,"Painting itself as an anti-Superman story with the gore and scares ramped up, ""Brightburn"" is an intriguing concept at heart, but fails to live up to more than my basal expectations. Considering the idea, they do fairly little with it, and this movie stumbles towards being only forgettable.From the word go, it's all a bit predictable. Nothing ever grabs you, and even the violence is short-lived and too reliant on gore to please many. Not only this, but when the potential for some real escalation does present itself (right at the end), it ends to a mismatch of boring news stories and a Billie Eilish song.The whole thing is just a bit of a damp squib. What could have been better? Frankly, I didn't really care at all about any of the characters: I thought the antagonist was aimless, the parents a mix of overly understanding and blindly stupid, and the rest of the cast as bland as can be.Couple this all with some meagre attempts at fights (all pointless given the power gulf), stalling and some really forced horror elements, there isn't much to keep your attention. ""Brightburn"" is probably one to miss.",Brightburn
174,kevinxirau,Bloody superhero inversion.,5,4 September 2019,"What if Superman as a kid turned bad? The answer came in ""Brightburn"", a superhero horror flick produced by James Gunn. The strange fixation of an evil Superman or at least a darker one, while interesting in of itself, kind of got tedious with the oversaturation of media that play around with this idea lately. Nevertheless, the premise of this film did catch my attention, though I waited for it to be in the rental store rather than watch it in the theater.The film stars Elizabeth Banks and she does a good job playing the adopted mother of Brandon, the alien child with incredible power and a sinister nature lurking beneath. As someone who raised this child, I understand her reluctance to accept that her ""son"", when he reaches a certain age, changes for the worst. The film does decently creating creepy imagery with good lighting (and lack there of) during the horror scenes. This kid's expressions, blank stares, and raggedy costume alone wave red flags. The body count throughout the film is unexpectedly low, but it does feature gore that, rather surprisingly, made my stomach a little queasy and this is coming from a guy who's seen the gore fest that is John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". That being said, I didn't feel an overwhelming sense of fear from ""Brightburn"". In a lot of ways, this is pretty standard fare for the genre from simplistic side characters I felt little attachment to, who will predictably bite the dust (or the steering wheel in one case), and I pretty much guessed how it would end long before seeing it. The film attempts to make Brandon seem sympathetic at times and he could've been with a rewrite (therefore making his turn to the dark side more impactful), but ultimately what drives him into murder is an external force and he doesn't go through much of an internal struggle of what he should do with his power.All in all, ""Brightburn"" is a unique spin on the superhero story, but beyond that it's nothing groundbreaking. The humorous mid-credit scene leaves an opening for a possible expansion of the universe this is set in. That said, this is a film with few thrills to offer to go along with its concept that could've been more.",Brightburn

A pretty mismarketed movie I think.

out! The total absense of empathy, and compassion, no remorse, no human feeling at all make this one Terrifying superbeing!

Because this is one of the most innovative, original and well done movie stories that I have seen in a long time. Great work guys!That's not to say I loved everything about this movie. I didn't. Firstly, some of the CGI was a bit iffy, but I can live with that. Secondly, there were a couple of gory scenes that I could well have done without. I know that's a matter of personal preference and that some people love that sort of thing, but I am not one of them. I don't think gore was necessary in this film anyway. Some movies have to fall back on showing copious amounts of blood and grisly deaths or injuries as a means of hiding their lame plots, lack of tension or other failings. Brightburn did not need to do that. It was already suspenseful, and creepy without it. Full marks to whoever dreamed up this plot and whoever wrote the script and to the director. The acting is good and young Jackson A Dunn does a great job in conveying innocence and fragility and, later in the movie, menace and malice. The other actors are good too and the scenery is beautiful.I notice that this movie has not has as good reception as the producers might like. I can't understand why. It is a really good movie.

What was really lackluster to me was the script. Sometimes the dialogue was down right cheesy. The actor who played the father also wasn't very good, so those 2 things combined, he really stuck out like a sore thumb. Elizabeth Banks did the best she could with what she was given, but her character was dumb at times. Like, there is literally a scene where the kid pushes the dad and he flies backwards into some cabinets. Obviously, the kid is way stronger than he should be, and literally like 5 min later is all like ""How could you think he would kill someone, how would he be capable""...like geez lady...did you not see what he did to your husband? You know he isnt of this earth, you know he's been acting strange, you saw him levitate the other day, and you just saw the force of which he pushed your husband....why are you in denial? There's also a scene earlier in the film where they find his ""porn"" stash....its just pictures from lingerie catalogues...until they start finding pictures of guts and other human anatomy...and their reaction is to give him ""the talk"". Like, you dont want to talk someone about how its strange that he has those pictures with the so called dirty pictures. Theres little things like sprinkled in the movie that seemingly get forgotten about. I think the one good thing about the writing, is that I genuinely wasnt expecting the film to end that way.

182,AdrenalinDragon,Great concepts that burned into Cliched Horror,5,1 July 2019,"A concept of a kid with Superman-like powers turning into a big bad villain sounded intriguing to me. Unfortunately, Brightburn just didn't live up to its potential. It was mostly a Jump-Scare Horror cliched ride that was very by the numbers and not doing anything all that interesting with the actual characters. The kid is never really explained why he is evil-per-se from the very beginning and he just scares people for no good reason at all. A lack of character development and reason to care about anything just made the whole thing feel shallow and hollow. You can guess how most of the movie will play out correctly and it's not unpredictable at all.It's a shame because there are a small handful of bright spots in Brightburn. Some of the shots are nicely done and the acting for the most part is pretty good especially from the kid himself. The action itself isn't too bad in the small amounts of screen time it gets, but again it gets bogged down because it tries to be a Cliched Horror movie at the same time instead of being something fresh and intriguing. There's gore for sure, but who cares if the actual execution is not all that good? It doesn't go anywhere exciting with its concept and you just end up saying ""That's it?"" after watching it.

This really has less to do with the cast, story, and filmmaking, and a lot more to do with the budget and the runtime.
I know, it sounds silly, but for a movie that claims to be ""if Superman was evil"", it should've been a lot more epic. We don't get to see a lot of action and crazy visual effects, mostly because the film was only cost $6 million and while the story was solid, we never got to see the true origin story of Brandon's heritage, the planet he lived on, or his purpose for his powers and how evil he was. I mean, the ending kinda set it up for a sequel so it's possible we could see that happening, but from the looks of the reviews and other movies released this week, I kinda doubt it.

What if Clark Kent was a violent kid? He would be hurting everyone and with his strength and powers he would make a big mess. There's a little bit more to it here, but it's basically it, and I don't want to spoil what happens too much.
That's the premise, now to the technical part. I loved the photography, and the special effects were the kind that serve the story and blend well to make something unreal look real. Excellent visuals.
Creepy designs, great atmosphere, solid acting from everyone, the kid, the parents and the secondary characters were very believable in their roles. I didn't agree with all of their actions, but they're totally understandable under the circumstances.
Complaints about the pace being rushed come (in my opinion) from people too used these days to go and watch two hours and feeling that less than that doesn't worth their money. First, I prefer quality than quantity and second, I honestly would have loved half hour more, I enjoyed every minute, but I don't think it's rushed at all and it's definitely not missing anything. It's perfect like this.
For the ending I would have liked seeing more happening afterwards at a global scale, but it's just how the writers and director decided to tell the story and I'm OK with that.
I don't see this as a horror movie, it's more a ""superhero movie"" about a villain. If it scares you, well you could get scared with whatever you want. There are creepy moments and some good gore here, so I see how they classify it as horror.

194,RhapsodyReviews,Great Concept.,6,7 October 2019,"Review:
'Brightburn' is an American superhero-horror film directed by David Yarovesky. This movie was a pleasant surprise. I wouldn't go and call this a horror movie, it's more of a thriller. I can't be scared watching a movie that is just Superman if he was a bad guy, and that's what this movie was going for. It knew what it was and what story it wanted to tell and pulled it off really well.
The story is about a couple - played by Elizabeth Banks and David Denman - in the town of Brightburn, Kansas who have been trying to conceive a baby for a long time. They feel like their prayers were answered when one night a ship comes crashing down in the woods of their backyard with a baby boy inside. As he grows older, he starts to find things out about himself. Thing he can do that not an ordinary 12-year old boy can do. One night he starts to see and hears things that make him drawn to where his ship crash landed twelve years prior and he is shown what he is meant for. Bringing down the world.
I really enjoy watching Elizabeth Banks play these types of characters. She has been more known for her comedic roles, but she is great in a horror or thriller movie. I can only think of two other movies she played in where I liked her character this much and they're horror film. (The Uninvited and Slither) David Denman was also great in this movie. The two had real chemistry on screen and brought the right emotions when they were needed. I honestly felt like I was watching a mom and dad on screen. In my mind you don't have to be the best actor to be in a horror, acting scared as hard as say acting sad or angry or even being funny. That being said, everybody in this film brought it and you really believe that they are in danger. Last but not least, Jackson A. Dunn - who plays Brandon - is great in this movie. He is a creepy kid in this, and he is actually scary at times.
Now, obviously this isn't the most original story. As I mentioned before this is basically is Superman turned out to be evil, but it was entertaining. There is one thing that really got under my skin and it may just be me, but IU feel it's worth mentioning. In the whole first act of the movie we see how great this family dynamic is and Brandon is a smart and well-mannered kid. When the second act comes around and he switches his attitude so quickly you don't buy into it. I mean, he shows some sass to his parents sure, every child does that. Then something happens at his school and you just have to call . They tried to explain away with his ship telling him what he is meant for and just triggering something in his head. That helps a bit, but nurture must come in a little. I don't believe that he wouldn't have at least a little remorse for what he is doing.
Overall, if you like a good suspenseful movie, or just want to see what Superman would be like if he was a bad guy this movie will do. I found it to be entertaining and it also has a good runtime of 1h30m.

196,MinistryofDoom,"You'll be shocked, disgusted, and scared and you will enjoy it the entire time",9,29 June 2019,"If you're a fan of superhero lore, you've no doubt thought to yourself at least once, ""What if Superman could do whatever he wants with the power he wields?"" without repercussions, without being held to task, or burdened by the responsibility to save mankind from itself? What if you could end a life just because you can, and what variables in a super-being's life would lead them down the path towards heroism....or villainy? These are the questions that Brightburn answers. It is by no means a family-friendly super hero film, along the lines of The Avengers or Guardians of The Galaxy (which Brightburn's Producer James Gunn also directed).This film, in its brilliance, shows the darker side of super heroes. They are flawed, judgmental, sensitive, emotional misunderstood beings in the world of Brightburn, but also possess powers beyond the limits of human comprehension and therefore are able to act upon their emotional responses in ways in which humans can only imagine.Brightburn's lead is a 12 year-old boy named Brandon Breyer who fell from the sky one dark night, and was picked up by a couple in Kansas who had problems conceiving children. They adopted him as their own and kept his origin a secret from the world, and from Brandon himself. As he goes through childhood, he develops strange powers and learns of how he arrived. These powers, combined with confusion and angst at being deceived culminate in the rise of one of the greatest threats of humanity the world will have ever known.The film was very well written and acted. It contains some of the most disturbing and shocking film imagery that I have seen in recent memory. There are plenty of jump scares, certainly many scenes that will make you cringe in disgust, and yet you will be on the edge of your seat in anticipation the entire time. Overall, it was a great experience. This is a story that I would like to see James Gunn and his partners further explore.",Brightburn

Take what exists and invert it and see what comes out! That is it! Just do that. Take trope/parable/narrative A. Multiply it with -1 and make it. That is the gimmick. It might be even more lazy and disingenuous than trying to reboot a concept as you have to put in NO added originality.The most irritating thing of course is that this inverse superman concept isn't even new by itself. the Superman continuum, with does not shine in high culture or the arts itself frequently ""explored"" this concept in various ways. There have been a myriad of evil Kryptonians, Superman clones, alter ego's and parallel appearances.This movie simply takes the inverse premises and makes an empty gore movie.

203,phoenixinvictus,A colossal cliché of an evil Superman,2,26 June 2019,"The whole film is one colossal cliché and barely has a plot or a storyline development. There is a reason why Superman's adoptive parents are farmers from Kansas and not accountants from Philadelphia or lawyers from New York. It's because farmers have very precise moral compasses and strong values, something that this movie seems to ignore. I cringed (literally) when I watched the father and son have ""the talk"" by trying to teach him a responsible attitude toward sexuality by saying that ""it's okay to give in to urges"". I cringed even more when I saw him in the girl's bedroom. Now, I don't know if the writers of this movie have children but no good parent would ever say something so brainless as to say that ""it's okay to give in to urges"". It's giving children the wrong lessons and giving him a green light to do what he wants and turn him into a criminal. And for the record ""it's okay to have urges"" but ""one needs to learn to control them"". We know nothing of Brandon's past or even his motivations either than he is cruel, heartless, and downright despicable. Brandon goes to the dark side almost out of the blue like somebody switched a button in his mind to turn him from good to evil. There is no character development either than the ""aliens are making him do it"" and it appeared that Brandon seemed to have a stable loving childhood with parents who care about him. The adoptive father spends the whole movie confused and terrified of his son, than rather than trying to reason with him he grabs his gun, takes the boy into the woods and shoots his son in the back of the head like he were some diseased dog. Again what kind of nut shoots his own kid in the back of the head (even if he is evil and has superpowers)? There's not much to grab on to, as the movie declines from bad to worse to completely awful. The excessive gore and carnage is unhinged. Sometimes I thought that I was watching a horror movie with demonic possession. The boy is only evil for the sake of being evil and lacks originality.

204,elenaphysics,interesting but..,7,27 June 2019,"I saw this movie because I was excited about the story. The rise of a super villain.
It was somehow the idea behind Batman Vs Superman. What if Superman turns bad.
And in this movie it did. I consider it in the Thriller genre. Not too much adventure but it is not gory. It is ok I guess. It is watchable.
But the problem is that it could be so much better.
For example when he kills his 'father' you can see that he felt sad about it and betrayed. He did not intend to harm him but his own father tried to kill him. And his 'mother' tried to kill him. That is why she got what she deserved.
Instead of trying to help him they betrayed him.
So it ends abrubtly, his is now unleashed and I heard rumours about sequel.. Please just don't. This is a one time movie. It does not deserve a sequel. Had you used the original idea to produce something worth watching ,then go ahead make as many sequels as you like.

Good!It was just a good horror flick with a novel take on things. That is all. And that is why I give it an eight.Cheers.",Brightburn

I wouldn´t be surprised if Sony and the movie producers will have a lawsuit on their hands pretty soon by Warner Brothers.
Everybody knows the beginning of this story and then it starts doing wreckage here and there (Jason Vorhees meets Superman/Man of Steel) but the movie is really bad and predictable, like a low budget horror movie.

The boy can emits red beams of lights like superman. He murders his uncle,couple of people,and at last his own family when he finds out that they were planning to get rid of him. The locked door that the boy was drawn too earlier turns out to be the gate to the place where he was first found as a little kid and got picked up by his now parents.

Elizabeth Banks and David Denman did an amazing job and have great chemistry together. There is a bunch of gore in this film that is incredibly brutal and works very well for what the film is going for. It makes your entire body cringe in a good way. The tone remains consistent throughout the film. The score for the film is really good also which surprised me. This film also knows how to build tension. It builds and builds and builds until it pays off most of the time. The concept for this film is one of the most interesting I have ever heard of. The Superman origin story but instead he turns evil instead of good. That what makes this movie so disappointing. Unfortunately, the film doesn't do anything beyond the concept. It's incredibly basic to the point where it can feel dull at times. Another problem is that you never seem to connect with the child actor. He does an okay job acting but you can't connect with him. His only motivation is to destroy the world because his spaceship told him to. My main problem is that the last 25 minutes of the film is so dumb. Everything about it is just awful. The visual effects are terrible and it decides to end the film with Billie Eilish's Bad Guy. Why end a film this dark and gritty with a pop song. The film then decides to show news montages of the Kid's destruction. It made my score from 7.5 drop to 5.5. Overall, Brightburn has an amazing concept with great acting but does a bad job at execution with a terrible ending. I give Brightburn a 5.5/10.",Brightburn

Directed by David Yarovesky. Written by Brian Gunn and Mark Gunn
Evil Superman. That is the movie. It is encoded in its DNA. It is riffing on concepts commonly associated with the character of Superman. It's a good idea. I mean when humans get immense power, it tends to corrupt them. Why wouldn't something similar happen to Superman? He can do anything. Why would he help people? Selfishness is something every human has.But then again this isn't just evil Superman. It's an evil kid movie. Every single thing about it is an evil kid movie. It's got a shiny coat now by making it evil Superman but it is still an evil kid movie. It has all the ingredients of this. It follows that formula and adds not much to it other than the superman stuff in there.I like the idea. It has worlds of potential. I don't think these writers utilized the possibility of what this character could do. I do have to say though that the character isn't really evil superman. This character is possessed by the aliens in the spaceship. His personality drastically changes one day. The movie tries to make you think it might just be puberty but it's not. It's possession along with the evil child stuff.You've seen all of this before. Beat for beat. You can call it before it happens and that's just disappointing. It is honestly quite lazy. They put effort into the monster and the kills. That's it. That is the positive though. Those kills are really pretty brutal. The makeup work is fantastic. There is one scene with an unhinged jaw that is particularly gruesome and grotesque. It was quite nicely done.The gore effects are really good but sadly between the superman elements and the gore, there isn't much else here. If you want to see an evil superman type character, might I suggest The Boys on Amazon Prime. It will happily satisfy this craving. This is worth a watch for a slightly above average evil kid movie. I give this film a C.",Brightburn
231,untilnow99,Don't Piss Off the Quiet Kid,7,19 May 2019,"READ NO FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T YET SEEN THIS MOVIE. SPOILERS.The list of Cardinal Rules broken by the players in this tale of horror are too many to count. But I'm going to have a whack at most of them. ***These people should have watched Ryan Higa's ""How to Survive A Horror Movie."" (See it on YouTube.)***First of all: You don't go out into the woods and pick up some stray baby from an alien spacecraft, keep the kid, and think things are going to be sweet and rosy.Second: You don't stash the spacecraft out in the barn and think things are going to be A-okay.Third: When your quiet little sweetheart of a kid crushes his classmate's hand into pulp, you don't brush it off as childhood shenanigans.Fourth: When you find blood and guts photos secreted amongst your pubescent 12-year-old male kid's trash stash, you don't brush it off as saying maybe he's just boning up (har, har) for his bio class or whatever.This movie made me think of Stephen King. Kind of his genre of thing.What I liked most about the movie was the cast. The Dad, played by David Denman, is awesome in his role. Elizabeth Banks is okay. The kid with the laser eyes is highly watchable and believeable.I had a bit of a hard time seeing Banks as a Kansas housewife, stuck out on a farm, denim overalls and all. What were they farming, anyway? A dozen chickens? And since when are there wolves in Kansas? There haven't been wolves in Kansas since they were ""extirpated"" (euphemism for completely wiped out) in the early 1900s. (I know, I looked it up.)Okay. So many plot holes and trite goings on. But there are some GOTCHA! moments when you may leap up in surprise, too. There's definitely some nasty gory stomach-churning bits for those of you who enjoy that type of stuff. I'm gonna have a hard time wiping that guy in his truck scene out of my mind any time soon.I gave this movie 7 stars. Watching David Denman is what made this a fun movie for me.",Brightburn
232,Dannyboi94,"A great premise, but should have been longer.",6,24 May 2019,"Brightburn is a very interesting new horror movie, which has a fantastic premise. The idea of having an evil Superman type of character, leaves open for an intriguing take on the superhero genre. Because make no mistake, this movie is clearly mimicking the earlier years of Superman.The 3 leads in the movie are fantastic, with Elizabeth Banks and David Denman portraying very believable parents. But the stand out is the young actor playing Brandon - Jackson A. Dunn. This kid can be so creepy and spooky that I see him standing next to other creepy kids in the horror genre.The movie also has some incredibly gruesome deaths, some of which have brilliant prosthetic effects, one in particular will have viewers staring on with their jaw on the floor. The cinematography and direction is all very well done, as is the creepy atmosphere.However this movie has a ton of flaws, one major being that it is very rushed. Usually a 90 minute horror film is the perfect length, but here, this film would have been much better if it had been longer. This would have allowed the story to develop our characters more. The kid turns evil very quick into the movie, I would have preferred if they had spent time to slowly turn him evil, that by the end of it all, you are completely terrified of him. This didn't really happen.But Brightburn is a good new horror movie, that leaves it open for potential sequels, or even a new superhero franchise, that is much darker, gritter and gruesome than the ones out now.6.5/10",Brightburn

235,mitchell5954,An Unofficial Superman Elseworlds Movie,8,7 June 2019,"Brightburn is essentially a Superman else worlds story where Clark/Superman became a psycho as a kid, believing himself over humanity, killed lots of people, and completely abused his powers to try to take over the world. The main characters are basically young Clark, Martha, and Johnathon Kent without being called those names because of copyright. The beginning is essentially the basic Superman origin with a spaceship carrying a baby crash on a farm and two farmers adopt him as their son. Then, on his twelfth birthday, his spaceship calls out to him, seemingly shaping his personality to its will. Then it becomes a slasher film if young Superman were the killer. A very entertaining slasher film.Critics have been rather split on this film. Many think the film should have been longer, delving more into the main boy's psyche. Sure, I would have liked to see more conflict in the main boy, and have more of a tragic angle like in Chronicle, but with what we got I found it a pretty good horror flick. It has atmosphere, tension, eeriness, a cool costume, and some good kills. If you're a gore hound you'll get some great bits in this film. All of the performances were great. The family dynamic really worked, and is really the driving factor of the movie. The effects are great for how little a budget the movie had at seven million. The special effects looked as good as Shazam, which came out earlier this year and had over a hundred million dollar budget.The film still has an element of tragedy to, but's not delved into much, which is one issue I have. You have the main boy starting out very nice and normal, but after the ship activates becomes more and crazier. The ship is basically controlling him and molding him to its will. This isn't a concept never seen in Superman stories before. The series Smallville did something similar with the relationship between Clark and Jor-El in the early seasons.I would have liked to have gotten more background on the spaceship and the world it came from. Why did the boy's real parents send him there? What was his home world like? Who were his real parents? That's the only real complaint I have with the film, outside of a bit more development for the kid.While stories of Superman going bad are not uncommon in comics, and neither are horror stories, this film is refreshing in terms of movies. With the crazy amount of comic book movies we've gotten in the past two decades alone we've never really had a superhero film that's a straight up horror movie. The closest is Chronicle and the Batman vs. Dracula animated film. This is the first one that's a full-on slasher film, which was cool to see.Overall, while Brightburn isn't really amazing or innovative, it's still a fun horror movie with great effects, kills, performances, and family drama done right.

It has to at least be interesting, right? And fun? Maybe that was the problem. I shouldn't have gone in with high hopesAlthough to be fair, Gunn only produced this. It looks like someone in his family wrote it and someone else directed it. Result: It didn't really have the Gunn Magic.The worst thing about this movie is that it has such a great premise but it does nothing with it. SO much potential. But it was written like an average, middle of the road horror movie. By that I mean that characters, who were written pretty shallowly did dumb things and reacted in unrealistic ways and there was an over reliance on jump scares There wasn't anything creative or interesting about it.I don't even have the enthusiasm to go through this in depth and criticize it.

The movie plays well also I think, some nice cinematography and the events unfolds in an entertaining manner. The special effects were absolutely passable also.I also think this movie has some more to it then just being an horror movie. It kind of takes up the moral question of ""with great power comes great responsibility"" (which I know is a Spider-Man quote). It's also a little bit about what it can be like to be a parent to a child that's giving you a real hard time, even if you give your child all that he/she needs, love, guidance and all the usual material things a child suppose to have, and the child still behaves in a way that makes your life miserable.All these elements, plus that the movie was entertaining and well acted and well shot, made it a good movie to me.

This just feels like an old smallville episode with red kryptonite and an R rating... or a bizarro comic.

249,ajzeg,This movie was entertaining but overall I don't think it was as good as the premise should've allowed it to be.,7,1 December 2019,"Before I get into the review, I just want to get a couple things out of the way. First of all, James Gunn did not direct this movie. However, he did produce it and the film was written by two of his brothers. Second of all, this is a movie that asks the question, ""What if Superman used his powers for evil instead of good?"" This idea has been done many times before, like in Batman v Superman, Injustice, Megamind and more. However, this is a horror movie starring a young superpowered child. Think something along the lines of The Omen or The Shining but with a superhero theme. That's a great idea, but I don't think it was fleshed out very well. The movie is way too short. It's only 90 minutes long and I feel like it rushed through a lot of important details that would've made the film stronger if they had been developed and established better. It really needed to be 2 hours. As it is right now, the movie feels kind of empty and underwhelming. However, it does have some very creative and nasty kills, it has good effects, it is well-acted and it is well-shot. All the pieces of a potentially great movie are there, they just didn't quite fit together. I'd love to see a sequel that expands the world of the film and improves on the ideas of the story. This movie is worth a watch if you're curious, but I didn't think it was great. That is kind of inexcusable for a movie with a premise this creative.",Brightburn
250,Inda_Rebel,Like a pilot episode,5,27 May 2020,"Seemed like a pilot episode for a new superhero series. I think that is how this should have been developed.This would have allowed more chance for the audience to build a connection to the characters through more situations and build character development.As a film, it feels like they have sacrificed that emotional connection by having those situations to develop the characters in place of too many violent situations, over-elaborating on this part of the main character's personality, which is at the expense of the storytelling which then feels rushed.The background of the main character hasn't been explained or explored within the film.I would watch a sequel, or better yet a TV series to develop this further. On its own, it feels like a pilot episode of a TV series, and therefore doesn't feel complete.",Brightburn
251,alexscott-35299,A nice change,7,28 May 2021,"Brightburn answers the age old question of what if superman wasn't the hero. This sci-fi horror really is terrific with its ideas. Although it doesn't sound like the most original idea, brightburn really is a breath of fresh air to the genre and I really enjoyed it. The movie is just an easy watch, it's not too long and doesn't dwell on the back story or explaining of why the kid is on earth or anything like that, it just gets on with the story and I really appreciate it for that. The performances in this really are brilliant aswell, Elizabeth Banks is amazing in her role and truly puts in a great performance here, Jackson Dunn is also great as the main antagonist, he's not really been in many films so I was pleasantly surprised with how good he was in this role. The kills are brutal and really through me off when they turned out so gory and graphic as I was just expecting generic boring superhero kills. James Gunn really has done it again with his interesting directing and captivating plots. The cinematography is amazing too in this film and really is great to watch. The only thing that lets this movie down for me is that it could have been way bigger scale. Yes I like that it isn't too over the top with its plot but I just think it lacks that something that would take it to the next level, some of the scares are boring and predictable and I just think this film would have worked better not being a horror and just being a thriller style supervillain film. I would definitely like to see more like this in the future and would 100% be tuning in if there is a sequel. A refreshing film, give me more!",Brightburn
252,GavWaskett,Brightburn or Lex Luther couldn't have planned this better!,7,12 September 2020,"So, this was produced by James Gunn and written by Brian Gunn and Mark Gunn. I really wish that I was there at that family dinner that decided upon the direction of this movie. I can imagine the scene...James ""So what you are saying is that we take one of the most classic superhero origin stories, the story of Superman and his childhood with Martha and Jonathan Kent - we take this story and we...""Brian ""yep that's right, we take that story, that beloved tale....""Mark switched on the TV and Casper Van Dien is on screen as Johnny Rico shouting ""Kill them, Kill them all!""Mark"" And here you have our inspiration brother for this adaptation, so what do you think?""Soooo, yep what we have here is the Superman origin story if Clark Kent was an absolute psycho name Brandon Breyer.

And everything is all hunky dory until Brandon turns 12.The first thing that goes wrong is Brandon's crush (Caitlyn), rejects him after he has been very creepy and, well you just don't treat your crushes that way and certainly not their parents. Well, I suppose you do if you are an alien creature whose true character is showing through. And from then on, things are just plain wrong!I will freely admit that I am not great with blood and gore, my parents early wish for me to be a doctor soon were destroyed by my being freaked out at the sight of blood as a child. But, this, this is just wrong! Glass shards in eyeballs, a jaw that will not stay on and splayed chests are just a few of the delights on show here. Oh, and heat vision can really screw up normal vision as well!Elizabeth Banks is superb as Tori Kent/Breyer and her descent into terror from her own child is played with a lot of heart as is David Denman's Jonathan/Kyle who understandably realises that he has to do something about this himself. And Superpsycho himself Jackson A. Dunn is fantastically creepy and disturbing and maintains a stillness about him that just oozes trouble.This is one completely screwed up film and made me want to go and watch Christopher Reeve as Superman just to make sure that all was right with the world. But it is very well done and superbly acted and brings a fresh take on an origin story.

What if Superman became evil is what I would sum up Brightburn in a nutshell. And it does have an interesting concept, it's just poorly executed. This is produced by James Gunn, the same man who gave us two Guardians of the Galaxy. And what I think is that James Gunn had this interesting concept for this character and all the pieces were there. But instead of coming up with an intellectual script, the script writers took the pieces, threw it into the trash, and turned it into a generic horror film. It's as if almost everyone took a different approach, and decided to turn this concept to what if Superman was evil? to What if Jason Vorhees or Michael Meyers had superpowers? But even Jackson A. Dunn who plays Brandon Beyer has zero character development and is annoying from start to finish. There's no character development anywhere. No questions as too where he came from? Who are his parents? How'd he get his superpowers? There's no explanation. They just turn him into a psychopath and he starts killing innocent people who didn't deserve to die just because he didn't get his way. And to me that feels lazy and the entire movie feels half baked. So in the end, while it does have an interesting concept, it just left me disappointed, cause they had so much material they could've worked with, but they took the easy way out.",Brightburn

It's a mixture of Superman and Chronicle (great movie BTW)
What absurdity, you say? Well, for example, a couple just adopting a child from space, thinking everything's gonna be a-okay, and just stashing away his spaceship in a barn. Amazingly, everything does seem fine for 12 whole years, but then things go real bad, real quick.",Brightburn

Young Brandon turns out to be a bright child with super powers and the burning intention to destroy whoever tries to cross his path, and in very gory ways. This movie is very watchable, and Jackson A. Dunn who plays Brandon is a revelation. Dunn starts off looking ordinary and harmless, and then progressively stuns you with his acting capabilities.

Little Brendon grows up to be everything they wanted until he hits puberty and, ding dong, his baser urges kick in. Unfortunately for those around him, so do superpowers.Gory, visually appealing, sometimes tense, the film is basically little Orphan Esther on steroids, or The Boys' Homelander growing up. The main flaw is the script. The 90 minute run time drags a bit, never managing to ramp up enough familial drama, nor make sense of Brendon's quick turn to Dark Seid. Perhaps the young actor is not equipped to make sense of the conflict here, but even the older actors (besides Banks) struggle to whip up any sort of chemistry (familial love or otherwise) with him. They're not even interesting enough characters to wish death on, or feel rotten when Brendon starts blasting glass into eyes or dropping trucks on the motorway. One unlucky character's biggest flaw is suggesting Brendon should go to jail for breaking her daughter's hand into pieces. It's neither tragic, nor satisfying when she gets mutilated one scene later.All in all, maybe a fun Friday night flick but by no means an essential entry.",Brightburn
259,Martinito_08183,"Great concept, but it was executed very poorly.",3,21 September 2019,"Another huge disappointment of 2019. It had potential with it's concept: a Superman origins, but instead of Superman becoming a hero - he becomes a villain. Great idea, but it's poorly executed in many ways and what we got is a passable jump scare movie.There were so many things and choices that the writers did, which were very questionable and there were things that I thought were missing from the movie. For an example, which is the most important thing - there wasn't any development to the relationship between the main character and his parents. Did he ever loved his mother, father, uncle and aunt? Did he ever care about them at all? Was he always a sociopath? He didn't express any emotion towards nothing and everyone in the entire movie and it's very hard to relate to the main character or everything that is happening.Elizabeth Banks was great and her character was the only one that i cared in the entire movie and was the most believable, while the acting from everyone is not bad, but very weak and the rest of the characters were OK; it had some gore, which was fun to watch; for the most part it had very good cinematography, great sound and some of the editing is good, but everything else was very average.It could have been great, but it did not deliver it's full potential of the concept.",Brightburn
260,robinsonaustin-07490,Average Superman But Evil Story,5,27 May 2019,"Brightburn. In a subversion of the typical Superman story, Brandon Breyer isn't here to be the Earths' protector. You get the same basic Superman-style origin story: a farm couple try desperately to have a child but are unable to, that is until a spaceship crash lands to Earth and they adopt the little ""bundle of joy as their own."" In short, take Superman, but strip him of any of his good qualities and keep his alien nature in the forefront.For the most part, it was an average movie. It did deliver on some of the possibilities of an evil Superman such as Brandon doing the absolute worst imaginable with his powers, but the only issue is that there is never that sense that Brandon was conflicted about who he should be. Quite the opposite. His actions start off as more morally questionable, but there isn't an instance where he genuinely makes the effort to be ""good."" Everything that you can expect to happen in a movie where it's a darker parody of the Superman story happens and it isn't surprising.Elizabeth Banks and David Denman play Mr. and Mrs. Tori and Kyle Breyer, and for the most part, they do a good job. They successfully make you feel for the parents in how they went from once being a couple desperate to want a child to getting their wish but at a great price, and that the fallout of what their adoptive son is truly like is something they at first try to blow off as mere coincidences but eventually the scope of their dilemma became too much to bear. It is a minimalistic cast. Aside from the main cast, you also have the uncle Noah, his wife who was also a counselor, and Caitlyn, a young girl that Brandon harbors feelings for. They are less developed the one being more unlikable and one note being Noah whose lines nearly consist of one long stream of profanities.Overall, I can't really say that you should watch it. If you want the whole Evil Superman story, you can read comic books like Irredeemable or DC's Halloween short comic where Superman actually is depicted as evil from the get-go. There are many other works that play the evil Superman arguably better than the film, and oftentimes with less run time.",Brightburn

262,seige-hound,"Both a Satirical Superhero Story, and a Parable on Parenting",8,28 May 2019,"At its face, Brightburn is a satirical horror spin on the Superman story, an alien child being raised by humans and becoming a hero, or in this case, a horrific villain. But I think digging deeper, Brightburn tries to be more than that.Brandon Beyer is portrayed at the beginning of the film as a really bright young kid, top 0.1% of his grade level in the state, being heaped praise by his teachers and family, while his peers tease him as a know-it-all. But then, his parents find a troubling stache underneath his bedroom mattress, consisting of some normal jerk-off material, but also some gruesome images of gore and human anatomy. His adopted dad, not quite knowing how to address this, attempts to give Brandon the 'talk', but Brandon seems to misinterpret what Dad said, and sneaks off one night to appear at a female classmate's room, which begins the destructive cycle.Personally, I see Brightburn as a sort of commentary on certain controversial topics such as toxic masculinity, sexuality and violence, and how some young men are basically taught from birth to see themselves as special, which they interpret as them being 'superior'. Brandon says as much, saying to his aunt, the school counsellor, that he realized he was 'special' and better than everyone else. Technically, this is true within the context of the film, as Brandon is a supernatural being with immense power, but what else gives insecure boys with superiority complexes power like a gun in a school full of children?In my opinion, Brandon is symbolic of a particular crisis that affects the world, and in particular the United States, at this current moment in history, the young man angry at the world and wanting to take revenge. In fact, near the climax of the film, his adopted dad attempts to kill Brandon with a rifle during a hunting trip. In this case, Brandon's Dad represents the 'Good guy with a gun' which is a concept thrown around by some political pundits to defend gun ownership and possession against gun control. Brightburn makes an explicitly political statement here by saying ""Guns aren't going to stop this problem.""So what went wrong here? What really distinguishes Brandon Bryer from Clark Kent? My answer is parenting. A lot of emphasis is placed on Clark Kent's parents in the Superman mythos. They're the ones that guided him, disciplined him and gave Clark the moral compass he needed to eventually take the mantle of the Man of Steel. Compare that to Brightburn's parents. His mother coddles Brandon constantly, and doesn't recognise the signs of her son's descent until it was far too late. Brandon's Dad also didn't do well to Brandon, and when it was obvious the path Brandon would lead, he instead opted to disown, and later attempt to kill Brandon. Brandon's parents failed where Clark's parents succeeded, and because of that, Brandon became an evil, self-obsessed supervillain instead of the hero he was capable of being if he made different choices.My one complaint of the film is that it was too short, falling just under 90 minutes. I think it needed at least another half an hour or so to further develop these themes. I hope there's an extended cut for them to release later, because I think this film could've been a masterpiece of satirical horror if it was given just a little more room to breathe and grow.",Brightburn
263,pazu7,Great premise. Mediocre execution.,4,18 June 2019,"Had high hopes. The concept was promising: 'What if Kal-L was a sociopath?' But the potential of the premise was hijacked by bland character development and hackneyed jump scares. That's really sad too, because the idea was such fertile ground. When I think of the things they could have done, the ideas they could have explored,... it's actually depressing that this was the end result. It's hard to believe the same people who came up with the idea also wrote the script. The idea is fresh and clever. The result is the opposite. They wasted a lot of time on superfluous tension building tricks and ominous build ups and musical swells; time they should have spent developing the characters, giving us a surrogate to sympathize with. Not blaming the actors. They didn't have much of a script to work with. The story never really moves past the premise. That is to say, it never becomes anything more than the premise. Not awful.

What if he shared nothing in common with humans beyond appearance? What if he never ""matured"" in the sense that humans did at all?

274,azeemnavarro,Wasted potential,4,24 August 2019,"An evil Superman is nothing new. Since the late '50s we have Bizarro, in the '60s we got Ultraman, Marvel copied DC and they did they own version; there are countless histories about Superman not being a boyscout, we have Red Son, Injustice, some JLA numbers and a lot of other Elseworlds stuff. But for some reason, the bad version of Superman hasn't really been exploited on the big screen, I can only think about Superman III as an example. So, naturaly, when this was announced I was hyped about the project, more if you consider that the Gunn's were behind it. But after watching it, I can say this was a big disappointment.
And I just can blame that on the writing. The movie is unfortunately very surface level, nothing is very developed, not even the main character.
You're telling me that this guy never realized he had superpowers? I mean, he's not that bright being that case. We don't really get much backstory with the relation with him and his parents, he even did show emotions before the events of the movie? Because all the characters say how weird the boy is, and you can really tell that neither his dad or his uncle and aunt really loved him.
So the guy becomes evil because his ship activated? Why it was activated? It took it more than a decade to do so, so it doesn't make that much sense. There are some instances where the boy says he doesn't want to be evil, but that contradicts the movie rules, because we assume he's hypnotized by the ship and that he may be a psycho since the beginning, so the sense of him becoming good at the end are not really there. And I don't want to throw hate at the kid, he did a decent job with what he was given..
Someone that actually wasn't good, is Elizabeth Banks. Her character is the most unbelievable, the writing for her sucks, her motivation is what? That she wants a son even if he's a killer? Ugh, sorry but I hated her in the whole thing. Contrary, the father was actually more believable, though he was a kind of douche, he actually tried to solve the problem, it obviously doesn't end good.
And talking about things not ending good for he characters...as expected from a James Gunn movie, there's some gore, and oh boy the kill scenes here are very enjoyable, they actually had some b*lls given the fact that this was very low budget and that it could fail on the box office.
Actually the budget of this film was quite surprising, made with only 12 million, this movie looks like it is at least triple of quadruple it's real budget. The look of the movie is very polished, it looks really great.
Unfortunately, the limitations shows because the boy just destroys his town. He wants to take over the world in the most inefficient way, the biggest thing we get is a plane crash and some very goofy scenes in the credits.
But hey, at least they tried, and that's something I recognize, James Gunn continues to take risks making some original projects, but man, he should write and direct hes own things, you know?",Brightburn

I do agree with some of the reviews saying it was too short and how there was no lead up to when the kid became evil. However I disagree with people saying it wasn't gory enough. Did we watch the same thing? One death in particular was unlike anything I've seen recently (you'll know which one). I liked the direction of this and with an all around better story this genre combining can be really effective.Spoiler

282,fastpuppy,A lot of potential but misses the mark,5,28 June 2019,"I want to like this more... the concept was right, the actors were good, but for some reason the whole thing just falls flat.There are several possible reasons. Not enough time is spent developing the backstory so Brandon is always a weird kid and you really don't have any empathy any of the characters. It may be because it seems like it it trying to play to too many different genres when and therefore seems a little disjointed. In particular the scene with the glass in the eye was totally unnecessary and seemed to be there for the gross out factor alone when something a lot more subtle would have been far more effective.I can't help but compare this film to something like Chronicle (2012) which was far superior in the execution of similar subject matter.",Brightburn
283,rustonreviews,Take the world.,8,22 June 2019,"In this James Gunn produced horror/sci-fi mashup, we are pitched an intriguing premise: what if Superman crash landed on Earth, but wasn't here to save us? One night, in Brightburn, Kansas, a spaceship violently crashes in the woods nearby the Breyer residence. Unharmed within the damaged spacecraft is a baby boy, who is then secretly adopted by aspiring parents Tori (Banks) and Kyle (Denman) Breyer. Twelve years blissfully pass by and Brandon (Dunn) is none the wiser to his unexplainable origins. When he learns of his unnatural abilities (super strength and invulnerability), he develops a darker, crueller persona. As Brandon's darker urges begin to warp his once mild mannered mind, he crafts a makeshift costume and gives into his temptations for destruction and murder. Bodies gradually begin to pile up and suspicions soon arise, forcing Tori to face the potentially damning truth that the son she loved so deeply isn't who she believed him to be.Brightburn is a wildly enjoyable film. Clocking in at a short and sweet 90 minutes, it's a briskly paced piece of work that continues to build an unnerving sense of dread throughout. Dunn delivers a darkly emotionless portrayal of Brandon Breyer, and both Banks and Denman do a great job of depicting the steady decline of trust between them as Brandon descends further down the path of wickedness. Horror fans certainly won't feel short-changed here, as the film packs its fair share of gory, brutal moments. The jump scares are also well executed and thankfully there isn't an overabundance of them either. Brandon's makeshift mask and cape look effectively sinister, matching his emotionless soul perfectly. Michael Dallatorre's cinematography is sharp and at times gruesomely striking, and the films chaotically violent third act is absolutely excellent. Brightburn is destined to become a cult classic amongst horror/comic book fans. It's an enjoyable, gleefully gory B-movie that leaves things open for a potential sequel, and when it's at its very best, Brightburn truly soars.",Brightburn

And for once the movie lived up to its hype. The movie is obviously based on the Superman origin story. But what if the child turned out to be evil rather than good? It is very well paced, as the child begins to realise his origins, and a nice blend of Horror and science fiction. In fact I'm surprised no-one has done this before. The acting is top notch, my only criticism would be that some of the horror moments were a little gratuitous and unnecessary, more of a gore moment, that really added nothing to the story.

I honestly really enjoyed the performances from Elizabeth Banks, David Denman, Jackson A. Dunn, Matt Jones, and Meredith Hagner, who all felt very real & invested in their roles.
The 'Elseworlds' premise is spot on, there isn't a moment of this movie that you don't think about Superman, & for a shoe-string budget, the effects seem consistently well done.
Unfortunately at 90 mins, it did seem very short in a year of massive super hero films- Endgame (180mins) Aquaman (140 mins) Captain Marvel/Hellboy (120 mins).

303,timetopooptoday,This was just so bad,1,17 August 2019,"I can't believe this received any good reviews. I completely regret buying this movie. And, it was so ridiculously slow-moving and absent of any subplot which only made it appear even more slow than it actually was.This was similar to Superman, except it just wasn't a good version. The ONLY interesting part is the flash during the credits where it gives a new spin on crop circles. This film is advertised as a horror / thriller / alien movie but it's not remotely scary or exciting, interesting, compelling or any of the aspects of a movie that holds one's interest well or makes it worth watching. I also had difficulty staying interested and paying attention which is very rare for me. I kept wanting to fast forward. Even bad stories can be done in a way that makes it interesting and this was just...bad.FIRST THOUGH, WHO IN GOD'S NAME DID THE WARDROBE, HAIR & SET DESIGN? The clothing style for males is C. 1985. The style for females is C. 2005. The decor and furniture is C. 1975. Vehicles appear to be of the early 80's. Tech is ""current"" because a sheriff refers to ""responding to texts"" and you see some iPhones, however bubble screen televisions, upright video game consoles and the entire atmosphere looks to be a combo if the mid 1970's to the early 1980's, save for the high end talking security system belonging to one of the counseling staff at the school. It is the WEIRDEST mix I've ever seen in my entire life. You spend the first half of the movie trying to play ""Guess That Decade"" until the current cell phone makes an appearance.The ENTIRE MOVIE is one --> argument --> to --> the --> next between the parents. What do they fight about, you ask? The kid has bad behavior, hurts people and animals in deranged ways and the parents continuously argue about this however nothing --> ever --> gets --> done. Eventually the kid makes a stupid creepy mask and does even more deranged things just as the trailer depicts. Yet, nothing. Ever. Gets. Accomplished.In the end, you see some news clips and hear a song that lets you make a determination in your own mind about the ending because LIKE MOST FILMS THAT HAVE NO PLOT AND GENERALLY SUCK, THE ENDING IS SUBJECTIVE.

Wrong film! I was totally shocked. This is a true horror film along the lines of Carrie ( remember what happens when she got peed off?) but possessed by something out of Cloverfiled.

312,ChristianLeFeuvre,"Terrific acting, terrific direction, such a good movie",10,12 February 2021,"Brightburn is a really good horror starring Elizabeth Banks, David Denman and Jackson A. Dunn.
It tells the story of a young alien boy that crash lands on a farm and the couple that run the farm who, not being able to have children of their own, raise the kid as their own, but as the boy gets older he begins to display powers that, although at first seem fascinating they quickly turn to evil.
If you think the premise sounds familiar, think - 'Superman' meets 'Chronicle'.
Basically this movie is saying, what if everything in the Superman comic happened, but instead of becoming a force for good and justice, the child uses his powers for evil and killing people.
This is actually a good idea, and mostly pays off in a really well-paced horror film. It's pretty bloody too, I was impressed with some of the kills.
What made this film work for me was the performances. The two performances by the parents played by Elizabeth Banks and David Denman were terrific. They have excellent chemistry together and I believed the relationship. There was so much they gave to the roles and especially Elizabeth Banks, who plays this woman who desperately wants to be a mother and have a child, but can't have one of her own, and gets this opportunity. You can feel the desperation and struggle of everything she does.
Some movies have portrayed parents, especially the mother, as being oblivious to how terrible their child is, but with this film certain things are presented to Elizabeth Banks' character, and instead of being annoyed that she doesn't want to accept them I actually felt for her, because the film does such a good job of setting up how she and her husband are so grateful to be parents because they were given this chance, so once it becomes apparent that problems are happening, the breakdown of the family is what worked so well, and played so well by the actors.
I do have some niggles but we'll come to those in a moment.
I have to mention Jackson A. Dunn, who plays the boy Brandon. Such a brilliant performance, his dead-pan delivery of some of the lines and how he keeps his face looking so emotionless is incredible.
The niggles I have are only really minor ones that most film-viewers wouldn't even notice, or mind.
One of them is that the film opens with the spaceship crash landing, so it sets up straight away that the boy is an alien. I think it would have been better to let that discovery build to a mid-film twist, but instead, they just let us know straight away 'this child's an alien', so it kind of takes away any mystery.
Also, you don't really know what the child's motivation is. There are times in the movie where he expresses that he wants to be good, but you don't get to see him attempting to be good. There are many scenes where he does horrific things, but you don't see a struggle within him between good and evil, it seems that one day he wakes up, there's something in the barn, and all of a sudden he's 'called' to be evil, they don't really show a 'reason'.
That's it really for my niggles.
Overall this is an enjoyable horror film, and it is definitely a horror, the killing scenes are pretty gory.
The direction, cinematography and special effects are all excellent, and there are some outstanding acting performances.
I really liked this film.",Brightburn
313,SHB_73,What if Superman was evil?,2,26 May 2019,While this movie has nothing to do with DC comics character it plays like an alternate Superman universe. The story is the same as a baby from another planet lands on earth and is found by a couple who adopts him but unlike Clark Kent this child uses his powers for evil. The star of this movie Jackson Dunne who plays 12 year old Brandon Breyer does such a good job in his performance he basically gives you the creeps just when he stares at someone.

I was hoping for something new and fresh in an area flooded with do-gooders and the upright. Thankfully this movie delivers on this and more. The premise of this film is not one we have seen before in the ""superhero"" genre. What would the world do if a super-powered life form came to Earth and realized that we were all just insects to it? It starts out very ""Clark Kent"" like with the couple who have no children happening upon a child falling from the heavens. The parents see this as a blessing. As if the universe heard their cries for a child and answered them. Soon though, this Smallville scene takes a turn towards absolute terror. This ""child"" isn't what he seems to be. He isn't a boy, or a human. He's something altogether different. I was very pleased at the difference in the normal storytelling we see from Hollywood.

Anyone with half a brain or who has seen really any genre films can see everything in this coming from miles away. The real problem is there's nothing redeeming here and the filmmakers literally have nothing to say and mostly waste screentime with premises that should have been better. The more I write about this movie the less I like it. There are certainly cool intense moments that add up to nothing. There's little to no character development for any character and Banks is about the only one who has a good performance. Mostly this feels miscast. Also the plot revolves around suspense that makes no sense and has no consequences due to the main character's abilities. Visually interesting and well shot, but nothing really amazing. Some of the gore is pretty graphic. Sound is good, but a little straightforward considering the subject matter. Rife with lame jump scares. This is a C/B movie that definitely made use of 7 million dollars but ultimately it's not good. It's more shallow drivel with no payoff.",Brightburn
321,paulmcuomo,"A good idea, but a little bit of a miss in some areas",6,20 June 2019,"Here comes a film that, for all intents and purposes, was born in a weird kind of way. After James Gunn was fired from Marvel's franchises, he and his brothers teamed up to write an anti-superhero movie, with a very sellable one sentence premise: ""What if Superman was evil?""Pros first: the acting, especially from the three main leads was fairly good, and they did what they needed to do, with both Elizabeth Banks and David Denman acting like a couple that are grateful for the chance to become parents, and in the wake of all this carnage going on have sod all clue what to do and how to deal with it, and Jackson A. Dunn is a very good child actor on screen, and for what this role is, he's terrifying when he becomes active in the latter part of the movie whilst still looking like a kid.
The kills, and the gore elements are also surprisingly extreme (in a good way). The film does make very good use of the superpowers for very violent, gory kills, and in particularly, the death of Erika in the diner as seen in the trailer, and which is by far the film's standout sequence, is well shot and makes great use of sound effects and music for effect, and the aftermath of it is sickening - in fact, the whole movie is very well directed, and has a delicious, dark tone to it.However, there are some issues with the story, and the fact that the movie is, deep down, too short. The story is watching this kid become an absolute monster, but there are three aspects to this that don't let it fulfil potential:
1) Some of the things Brandon does in the movie are truly reprehensible, but they are things that would've had more impact if the character was a little older and had a lot more understanding of - like 16 years old.
2) He escalates to a level of Psychopathy that only people like Ted Bundy can reach with a lot of the things he says, and no-one bats an eye - only taking a second to tell him that he's being weird and then going on with their day, and not going ""HOLY S**T THIS BOY CRAZY!"".
3) The biggest thing about this movie that detracts from the premise is that Brandon is called to be evil by the ship that dropped him off on Earth, as it starts repeating the phrase ""Take the world"", and he's called to this immediately, with no struggle or debate. I understand why this was done, as having him turn bad due to bullying is cliché, and this movie doesn't engage in that at all to be honest, but Brandon is turning evil without much prompting does remove a lot of options for storytelling and does make it a bit of a gorefest - not that I'm complaining, but it's a missed opportunity.Overall, I do think the movie had some good principles, but I think with a bit more time spent on it in pre-production, it could've been the game changing movie it was intended to be. I do rate it though.",Brightburn
322,toonyjakes,Wouldn't recommend or hate on it. Its just kind of exists.,5,28 July 2019,"Brightburn is a dope concept for a movie, and as you can guess, exactly what you think happens, happens. Yes, there is some intensity and unpredictability, but about half way through and you can understand how it will end.Plot- Super simple and super powered. This movie goes beyond starting right away by straight up zipping through the story. At first I was like ""okay cool, lets kick it off right away,"" but about 30 minutes in and I was thinking ""chill out, slow down, show more depth."" The film never reaches a science fiction twist- it just gives you an alien superman to turn victims into mashed potatoes.Writing- Passable enough to not lie in the b-movie range. It's just utterly simple, nothing to walk away with. There's not much justification or backstory at all, just people reacting to things. The most explanation we get is halfway through the runtime, and you'll still ask ""Why'd you keep a damn spaceship in your barn and why did it just up and decide to turn on after 13 years?""Characters/Acting- Characters go no further than a 3 word title. Infertile mother, farmer dad, superhero kid, family friends. There's no complexion to them, aside the antagonist superkid who can be pretty freaky with his acting. The rest is just people being scared. The acting is good, sure, but this movie doesn't give itself enough time for pathos.Quality- The music is decent, nothing beyond standard horror. The film is well shot, and the horror is pretty disgusting and brutal when it occurs. I didn't like how they threw in that Billie Eilish song 'bad guy' at the end... it just made me laugh out loud. Ruined the tone of it and seemed like a perfect trendy opportunity.Overall I could explain this movie in about two sentences if someone were to ask, maybe even one. It doesn't reach any grand finale and ends up being so much smaller than it could have been.

Here in the movie, not so much.Instead of having a kid with superpowers like Superman, this kid acts like a possessed kid. And it's not fun. Because it turns the whole movie into a boring horror movie. Every cliche from horror movies is present here. And I only wanted to watch it because of the idea of Superman succumbing to the cruelty of humans.As it is, the character development is lacking. The kid is totally evil, no redeeming qualities, no conflict, he just starts murdering everyone when he hits puberty.",Brightburn

I was convinced it came from a actual comic book. Having been a child in the 60's I was a huge comic book fan. Punk comic books always had comics like this back then. To my surprise Brightburn did not come from a comic book at all.Through the almost the whole movie, I kept thinking Brandon Breyer would snap out of it and turn good. I would love to see a part two to Brightburn where he fights a good superhero or just continues on his evil rampage.This is the perfect movie for all of us that are sick of having all these repetitive comic book superheroes movies being shoved down our throats.

I like Jacson A. Dunn, perfect casting for multiple personality act. I could see the mean soul when his time comes.Now what I mind is the costume, yet he is not super evil-man for one dedicated costume one day, but director should come up with better idea, not has to be made-up mask and cape.

328,SamALMan,Just a regular horror movie!,2,1 January 2020,"The movie main character (the little boy) had an origin of huge resemblance to a very known fictional superhero (superman). Brandon Breyer played by the child actor Jackson A. Dunn have cold looks and reactions in most of his scenes to reflect the sinister vibe we must get from this child and in opposite to what we know about the fictional superhero mentioned above. I already knew what the story is about from the trailer and I just wanted to know how they would deal or manage such threat. I felt after watching this movie that there were lot of things do not add up!.. The movie had a great potential to offer an idea of a threat and reasonable solutions.. but the movie presented for the majority of its time the threat and very little on what would be the reasonable solutions and reasons (the reason that was given in the movie on why the child went rogue is very simple!!).. So it became not more than a generic horror movie with the mild jump scares, the unusual bad luck, and the unnecessary oblivion. The concept idea presented in the trailer was horrifying enough and did not need the creepy child scenes. The ending was not shocking at all as the movie showed us that the child is a psychopath with superpowers.. how a human would face a super powered psychopath?",Brightburn

Okay. I've seen a lot of reviewers complaining that there was no reason for the kid's acts of violence and destruction but that's not what I saw. I saw a twelve year old who discovered he was invincible, had a hell of a temper and clearly had more fun being bad than good. There were basic reasons for him killing everyone he did and once he started he couldn't stop.
I really enjoyed this take on the anti-hero. The production was good, the acting was good and the effects were good. Nothing to really complain about. I gave it an 8 because a film has to blow me away to get more but this was solid and I would watch a sequel. Also the closing credit music by Billie Eilish was great.",Brightburn

Honestly there's not even really a fly, like it's just this kid that gets in trouble in school a couple times and then starts acting weird around his parents and turns out to be evil.

It could have been much worse (or better, I suppose) of it was more genuinely scary, rather than gross.3. The precredits scene was just... off tone. It was hilarious.

334,Daviteo,Spoiler-filled review of a movie that misses its super-mark,6,29 December 2019,"There are a handful of movies each year that I root for to do well. This was one of them. I had wanted to see this ""dark Superman"" tale from the moment I saw the trailer. A kid Clark Kent's powers but who uses it for evil? Sign me up. I was wrong.Let's hit the positives first:-Jackson Dunn as our super-powered main character delivers a fantstic performance.
Elizabeth Banks and David Denman struggle admirably with what they have to work with. Both are solid actors, and I've liked following both their careers.The premise of the movie, while not original, is fun. If done better, a sequel could be warranted.The problems:The filmmakers bit off more than they could handle, trying to pull something larger out of their six-million-dollar budget. The practical effects work well, but the CGI doesn't.The director absolutely needs to learn to direct actors better. Horror movies only work if we believe in the characters, believe they're real people. The parents in this film don't act like real folks. I wish the filmmakers spent as much time making the performances seem real as they did with the special effects makeup and prosthetics.The director also needs to pace future movies better. This felt like a film missing 20 minutes in the first half. It'd be like if in Jurassic Park Alan Grant and company left their seketon digs to go to Isla Nublar, landed in their helicopters, and were immediately attacked by a T-Rex. Brightburn rushes to the ""fun stuff"" without taking its time to build up to that.The film would have been much more powerful if the choice to choose the dark side rested on Brandon alone. Instead, he was possessed by ""voice of his people"" or whatnot, an exorsist-like ""possession from an outside force"" that made his turn to evil land flat. It would have been so much more impactful if he were a sociopath from the get go and we got to see what a boy with no heart would do if he had unlimited power.In short, it's sad to see a movie you'd hoped would do well falters, but that's the fate of Brightburn. I hope that if they decide to make a sequel, the filmmakers have the guts to make it bite harder and to let the actors act like real people instead of ""movie characters.""",Brightburn
335,pzct,Unique Concept,7,25 April 2020,"Very Interesting! This movie is kind of slow but this movie, like the Banana splits, is unique. Brightburn is pretty much the concept of ""If Superman was actually Evil""
I'm actually happy they didn't misuse the kid, saying he just goes around the town and causes destruction for no reason(Even though he does that at the end of the Movie). He attacks those who hurts him, or the one he cares for. His parents get worried about what he's becoming, and just like Superman, there is a weakness. This is an amazing film. I hope they make a carefully, thought out sequel.",Brightburn
336,philneil,'Antithesis Superman' - Is this a joke?,4,5 July 2019,"This movie is played and marketed as a straight-up horror but comes off more of a parody - and a bad one at that.

What would you do? How would a comic book universe do with evil super-beings. I'd actual like to see a sequel, or even a series. Their are hints at that possibility, but who knows how Hollywood works these days. This movie did a lot with a little.The production value was fairly good, on a $6 million production budget. Which by today's standards is dirt cheap. I don't think they spent much marketing the film, because I don't remember seeing a trailer for it when it was released. The first time I even heard about the movie was from a YouTube channel, which mentioned it.I enjoyed it, but this isn't a kids movie. There was enough graphic violence that it made me wince a couple of times. There's not a lot of CGI in this one, but the effects were pretty good.

This follows the same template does not make the assumption that an all powerful being is all good and that is what makes this thing so intriguing and also so frustrating. Well the idea in cinema terms is quite original it has been used on numerous occasions in comics book stories - the most successful being the MiracleMan story the return of kid MiracleMan. So with a wealth of previous storylines that would not be that familiar to the majority the cinema going audience, it is disappointing that the film is so relatively mainstream and predictable. Still enjoyable and with some quite striking, and gory, set pieces. It is frustrating, in that I know it could have been so much better particularly seeing that James Gunn was in The Producers seat, and clearly had involvement in the rolling new stories that play in the closing credits. maybe they are plans to create a whole extended universe from this in which case I look forward to what they come up with.",Brightburn

It took me a second viewing of this film to realize that everything we needed to know was stated about 5 minutes in. Brandon is at school in science class and the teacher is doing a lesson comparing bees to wasps. When she says they look the same but asks the students to explain the difference, Brandon says "" One species, the Polistes sulcifer, is what's called a brood parasite, they've lost the ability to make nests, so they use brute force to make other wasp species to raise their young."" In a movie this short, the viewer has to realize that almost every piece of info is important, just like this seemingly irrelevant snippet from a classroom. Basically, this one sentence sums up what Brandon is: he looks like a bee, but is actually a wasp, specifically a brood parasite wasp, one whose people tricked the bees into raising. Kyle comes to this realization too late, when he says to Tori ""He may look like us. But... He's not like us! He's some *THING* We found in the forest!"" Brandon may look like a human and may have been raised by humans, but his one purpose is ""Take the world."" Its a ""nature vs. nurture"" argument.",Brightburn

359,sagniknath,A decent subversion of the Man of Steel trope that nevertheless could have played out much better,6,24 May 2019,"Yeah it's no secret that this film was intended to be a pastiche of Man of Steel to the point of copying the same font style for the trailer complete with the same shots of the young NOT Clark Kent exploring his Kansas home.I had expected the movie to be more of a dark comedy because I think that would have worked better for the tone they were going for in trying to parody Zack Snyder's ridiculously serious take on Superman as if the superhero were a Christ substitute who has come to save Mankind and is burdened with a great mission.But no, they instead make it a straight faced horror movie with the worn out cliche of characters dying one after another from the menace. What made the plot somewhat frustrating for me is that they really don't give NOT Clark Kent enough motivation to actually turn evil and wreak havoc on the townsfolk. They conveniently put in a plot device to account for his sudden character change , since the first 5-10 minutes of the film showed him to be a pretty ordinary twelve year old. They don't even introduce a cruel school bully or maybe an abusive uncle/aunt character to coerce him into turning to the dark side. Thus, none of the deaths in this movie really seem that much earned even from the killer's point of view.Ultimately, with the premise they went for and the fact that this film is rated R , they could have accomplished so much more. Yes there were some interesting gory visuals but my appetite was really not satisfied with it. I guess I was suckered into seeing it on hearing that James Gunn was attached to the film. But turns out, he is just the producer. The writers also have the surname Gunn but they really don't inherit James Gunn's talent in writing a good screenplay, so bad for them.",Brightburn

364,CinematicGarbage,Impressive!,3,28 May 2019,"Brightburn was known to be a movie that was about a boy who was the EVIL, DARK version of Superman with the same origin and powers. It is the directorial debut of David Yarovesky. It's about a kid named Brandon Breyer with a Superman origin and raised by a couple in a farm and then when he grew up, he turned into something far more SINISTER. One surprising thing was James Gunn brought 2 members of his family to write the script while he's producing the movie. Unfortunately, it was banned in my country but I had found an easy way to watch it in a free website. How lucky I was!The performances are okay, with Elizabeth Banks being Tori Breyer and David Denman as Kyle Breyer but I think the most impressive performance given here is Jackson A. Dunn being Brandon Breyer, the evil version of Superman. His role was actually one of the roles that are too mature for child actors like Kirsten Dunst being Claudia from Interview with A Vampire (1994), Linda Blair being Regan MacNeil from The Exorcist (1973), the cast of the Losers' Club from IT (1990) (2017). However, Dunn could handle it and he was really good with being Brandon. He had this dark personality and character. Superman was good and Brandon was like ""Now I'm gonna kill you all!"". He didn't even give anyone a chance to survive, except for one but the others, they all die. I won't spoil it.The special effects made the movie looked really expensive but it was only $7 million and that means the movie was cheap and I was really impressed with the whole thing they did with just $7 million. They had good cinematography as well. It looked different from Slasher Films but when you watch it , you could feel that it was a Slasher Film. After killing someone, Brandon would be like ""Hey I killed this guy, let's add him into my kill count list to never forget about what I had done. I can draw his dead face as well!"" and he did if you saw in the trailer. Many things made this movie really enjoyable and entertaining.The problem with the movie was the time, how long the movie was, 91 minutes which was really short. They could have add longer so that there would be more about Brandon like Kyle and Tori could've find out about Brandon's identity or the purpose that Brandon had to fly here when he was a baby on a spaceship. It coul be more that just ""take the world"".The ending was the most impressive of all things I liked about Brightburn. It was like many other horror movies where the bad guy wins. The kill counts are innummerable and the bad guy lived happily ever after. Horror movies suck when they have happy endings.This is not a bad movie. We had a new genre thanks to this, a horror superhero movie. I exclude R-Rated superhero movies like Watchmen or Blade because they are just bloody, not scary. I just hope they could lengthen the movie if they wanted it to be better but then it got mixed from Rotten Tomatoes being 56%, 46% in Metacritic and 6.6 in IMDb. Nevertheless, Brightburn is quite good to me!",Brightburn

370,deandsouza15892,Wasted potential,4,25 May 2019,"This film pitched a very simple question - 'What if Superman was evil?'. After watching it, I feel like this was a marketing ploy used to sell the script and bring audiences to the door. Honestly, if you take the Superman aspect out of it, this is really just your generic low-budget horror flick. The gist of it is a kid wants to be evil one day and just goes ahead killing people. That's really it.This is one of those rare stories,that I feel could really benefit from an additional 30 minutes. The fact that the runtime is limited to 90 minutes, results in a lot of rushed scenes, which are consequenced by my biggest complaint, the editing. It feels like they shot all the scenes individually,but had no idea how to transition, so they stitched them together. You're just bouncing from scene-to-scene-to-scene and it's incredibly jarring. There are several moments when I thought, yes, this is interesting,but please slow down so I can marinate in it. Nope,next scene.There are,however, a few redeeming aspects. The actors do a really good job, and I really wish they had more time to sell us on the material. The gore,is actually quite good; there are some really brutal, bloody moments that I enjoyed. And finally, the creative decision to add Billie Eillish' 'bad guy' was genius.Overall,I don't really know what you're looking for in this story. If it's a dark Superman twist, you won't get it. If it's horror, it's mediocre. As a slasher gore film, not bad at all. I'd classify this as wasted potential.",Brightburn

Nobody gives a rat's behind about the parents struggling to come to grips with the fact that they're son might be a bad person. You have the evil kid....you have chosen to take the path of ""horror movie film""....combine the two and give me a crazy killer kid that's trying to take over the world.
But nope....once again another Hollywood director fails to deliver us fans anything other than a standard run-of-the-mill completely uninspired rehash of previous similar films.
The lack of imagination in Hollywood these past few years is really disappointing....and if you need proof... look no further than this bland, vanilla, mediocre offering....

374,applegrrls,Cruel & Poorly Written,1,14 May 2019,"Movie is so poorly written & directed that it's confusing. Many reviews are saying it's nature vs. nurture, but that conclusion only adds to the confusion. If it's nature, why is he so obsessed with his parents not knowing when he LITERALLY never shows any loving emotion towards them. If it's nurture, why attempt to portray parents so down on the farm ""Martha Kent"" nurturing & loving. In one instance, the child will seem almost possessed to behave a certain way, the next, he does something vile & No one talks him through his actions the way you would any child in guiding them through choices of right & wrong. It leaves you so frustrated by poor character development as to be distracted. And this flix plods on a pace to notice it's hollowness. At no point is the central characters motivations clear, which leaves one with a film that's pointlessly cruel. I would LITERALLY say Bizarro Superman is so much better developed to the point that I truly think anyone raving about this movie got paid for their 10 star review.

Brightburn did remind me of a lot of movies rolled into one, it's more a horror/thriller than a superhero movie.The acting is good, not great, but there is enough here to make it all believable. The unraveling and pace of the movie is also good and the plot plays out well; not rushed and not too slow.The main character has the potential to become an iconic evil villain/anti hero in the world of cinema if the sequels are done right. The look and feel of his homemade outfit is on the money, think Michael Myers, Freddie, Jason etc.Elizabeth Banks plays her part as mother well, often torn between love and confusion as she tries to keep her family together.
The rest of the supporting cast all give honest performances too.If they expand the Brightburn universe; maybe introduce a good hero to fight him etc, we could be in for a decent run of movies.
The end scene is epic and the parts cut between the end credits sets up the sequel nicely.The editing, cinematography, musical score and visual effects are all solid. Overall, Brightburn is a brave concept which did just enough to infiltrate the mind of this movie buff.",Brightburn

382,abhijith-alpha,a superhero origin- parenting horror story,7,5 November 2019,"BRIGHTBURN (2019): A REVIEWDirector: David Yarovesky
Screenplay: Brian Gunn, Mark Gunn
Starring: Jackson A. Dunn, Elizabeth Banks, David DenmanBrightburn is a well-made little movie about what would have happened if Superman, instead of being grateful to the planet and his parents for taking him in, started to go wrong after discovering his powers. This movie is a nice little antidote to the barrage of superhero movies, sequels and reboots of decades-old movie properties that we have been getting.The movie starts out like a parenting horror movie, as the (possibly) infertile Breyers (Banks and Denman) receive a gift from the skies crash-landing in their neighbourhood, and the kid growing up in montages is shown to be quite a delight. Smart, skinny and going through the horrible school experience that is somehow a rite of passage in America, he discovers his powers by accident and starts to test it around, unfortunately at the same time he is buffeted with a bevy of unkindness and unpleasant behaviour. I expected the movie to go in an adolescent superhero fantasy up to a point, but the screenplay goes quickly to a dark turn, as Brendan (Jackson Dunn), starts lashing out at threats, real and imagined.The atmosphere changes into horror very quickly, and the creepy scenes where Brendan is hunting his prey have been wonderfully shot, supplemented by great music, and the great performance of Dunn. He manages to infuse Brendan, in spite of the bloody havoc he is wreaking, which we can see in full glory thanks to the R rating, with a possible humanity and innocence. Which is unnerving in retrospect. How much would one allow a monster to get away with, if only he/she looked like us and was cute?Elizabeth Banks and David Denman play the bewildered and increasingly outflanked parents as they grapple with what their beautiful boy is becoming. The rest of the characters are represented as the typical Midwest Americans, salt-of-the-earth people, that one sees portrayed in many Hollywood movies for their innocence, optimism and work ethic and good-natured dumbassery. Unfortunately, with not much time spent on fleshing out their characters, they lack depth, and come off as seriously inept and one-dimensional. When making a horror movie, it is important that your side characters are more human than cardboard cutouts; otherwise the viewer wouldn't empathize with them, or care for their survival in the face of onslaught from the protagonist. There are missed opportunities with the father and the possible girlfriend, which would have elevated what is a good movie, into a great one. For now, we are left only to wonder what could have been.RATINGDirection 7

Found the special affects avg but the fright moments good.
Ending is wide opening for a 2nd though not sure how you'd go with it other than for the boy to destroy city after city with no equal around it would be rather pointless.
All and all a good off cut from the superhero genre",Brightburn
387,spotboyfilms,A great concept poorly executed,1,6 June 2019,"The logline of this movie is perfect 'what if Superman was evil,' and any decent team should have easily done a basically good job making a film about that. 'Brightburn' is not that film.
The directing is weak, the casting for the kid is poor (Is he related to one of the Gunn's? Nepotism sucks). When your entire movie hinges on a villainous character, he should be charismatic and/or scary, this character is not scary or charismatic. His motivations are undefined, he is under developed. The movie is full of poorly executed horror movie tropes. The effects look like they belong on a TV movie. Why is the bad guy bad? How does the sheriff trace it all back to him? I was so frustrated watching this film. The concept has so much potential. I was hoping that Hollywood had done a great thing developing an original idea. But alas, this movie doesn't deliver. I hope another group develops this concept and executes it better.",Brightburn
388,ethantoy,Brightburn- Honest Review,7,24 August 2019,"Brightburn, is genuinely fan-service film for those who are interested in more dark, sinister superhero flicks; the idea of creating a character you are supposed to root for, becomes a character you have no hopes of fleeing away from. Brightburn was definitely one of those surprises. Throughout the film, I felt that this movie played very well on the strings of how terrifying a super could be should they ever decide humanity's fate. It's a violent, and gruesome film at best- and it pulls no punches. It's something we hardly see in any type of superhero film (Logan, Deadpool, Punisher... etc) and this film does its job of disturbing you. I would say it's worth the watch at least once; would I recommend watching it on occasions? Of course. It's not a boring film at all, in fact, it's a lot of fun. Regardless, I think the only nitpick is that it loses its touch throughout the movie- meaning the story reeks of terrible writing. However, the execution does its job well. Go check it out!",Brightburn
389,mossow92,What if Superman was evil?,7,8 July 2019,"Being born and raised a diehard Superman fan, this trailer piqued my interest. It's a worn premise: What if Superman was evil instead of good? The answered has intrigued storytellers, comic writers, and moviegoers for years. And I feel that this movie answers it well. The best part of the film is that it doesn't shy away from the gruesome violence and gore that would ensue when one with these powers decided to use them for evil. Each member of the main family plays their role well, their internal conflict over the happenings constantly evident on their faces. Also, a great job of setting up an ending you expect and then delivering a shocking finale. Wouldn't mind seeing more into this alternate universe.",Brightburn
390,Kumarh02,Bad Superman 3 but as a kid,8,19 June 2019,"I didn't expect much after seeing the low rating but enjoyed it nonetheless. I thought the ending was predictable....but was it...? James Gunn has opened up the possibility to explore prequels, sequels and even expand this movie to give us a deeper understanding of the characters and their backstory. If you let your imagination run, this really could be the next big series. Let's hope the Gunns can build on the barebones offered here and take us to another dimension in the 'superhero' genre. Give it a go and look to the future with excitement.",Brightburn
391,TankerToad,Good idea spoiled.,4,28 December 2019,"Add 45 minutes, deepen your characters, and the stuff in the credits looked more interesting!Movie felt like halfway production they got told to wrap it up by tomorrow.

392,gallae,Was what I expected - but has issues with characterisation and violence.,6,24 May 2019,"I saw the teaser to this on local TV and immediately guessed what the plot might be, and I was right. However, I read heaps of Superman comics as a child in the 60s, and have been reading superhero (along with undergrounds and other types of comics) ever since. The basic scenario is exactly the classic Superman one - arrival on earth and being raised by a childless couple as their own. The are homages all through the film along these lines, like the fact that the in character has an alliterative name, use of blanket into cape, and so on.But this is NOT Superman's origin story as such. Rather it's someone a lot like him (imagine the Eradicator brainwashing him when he was a teen), and more realistic in how a teen would react , upon discovering that they had super powers. When I saw the film in the cinema, it was obvious it was going to be a horror film by the trailers before it: HOUSE OF CONJURING and the CHUCKY reboot! I have a couple of issues with the film however.The first is that the audience is given very little reason to care about the main characters. We know almost nothing about Mum and Dad, and Brandon remains much of a cipher throughout the film. Yes, he's 12 years old but we don' see much about his hopes or dreams or aspirations. There's no degree of vulnerability in him, which would have made seeing him turn from a average kid to a super powered killer, shocking. There are a number of opportunities missed because of the lack of character development, and it shows. I had meningitis when 2 years old, and suffered from epilepsy for a dozen years when young, so when the parents keep saying that he's ""special"" or ""different"" I found it rather grating. Going out on a tangent here but considering the portrayal we get, Brandon could have been ""on the spectrum"", which would explain the lack of certain responses, but that's never established in the film.The other major issue is the excessive use of violence. I have an eye injury phobia, and it was all I could do to stay in the cinema when a MAJOR EYE INJURY happens to one of the victims. Likewise the second major killing is equally gratuitous. We could have had it happen off-screen (and then have a flashback when Brandon's asked about it) and moved on to other moments of prolonged terror. The credit scenes are a cute way of adding story, but on the whole they show the character to be a major nuisance rather than a major threat.There will be at least one sequel to this - if box office does OK - I'm sure, but I don't know if I want to see one.",Brightburn

And what it is - it is an anti-superhero movie. A very dark one, but not like ""The Crow"" where we had all this darkness surrounded with so much character and story development - here we have a bad super-hero and that's really it. They copy the Superman concept - a child lands on the Earth, but not in Kansas, it's been raised, realizes he is almost invulnerable (got a weakness after all), gets mad to the world and goes to take it over and destroys the humanity. He discovers his true self, when his spaceship calls him in his dreams (the ship is berried in their barn. And that's it. Really. What we miss from Superman is sooo much:1) Where this child comes from
2) Why this child flew his own world
3) Who are the parents
4) How he found the Earth
5) Is there an opposing force? He is soo super that nothing can stops him. After all he could get hurt from his own spaceship, but still - who will fight this new bad superman and how?
6) Any emotional development, we saw he gets in love, but what after that?Also there is a scene, where his mother breaks a shard from his spaceship with bare hands!! Excuse me - this is supposed to be alien technology, much more unbreakable, than our own. And how exactly did that happened?It had the pottential to be something good, but it is not. Still - it is nice to watch. Not scary at all, just dark, so it is not a horror movie at all.Check it out, if you have nothing else on the plate for the evening.",Brightburn

409,sophaljonesy,A surprise superhero horror gem!,9,26 May 2019,"Brightburn is a horror twist on superhero, and actually delivers. There is enough tension, horror, and drama to keep the story going. There is hardly a dull moment, and not one scene seems a waste of time. What elevates the story above generic horror is the acting performances. The best would go to Jackson A. Dunn, who plays Brandon Breyer, the superpowered villain boy. His performance is surprisingly nuanced, and despite not having much of a backstory. His behavior is believable, and we genuinely believe that he does not understand the results of his action. Elizabeth Banks, who plays his adopted mother, is also great, since we genuinely sympathize with her and understand why she is so protective of her son. David Denman is Banks' foil, and delivers a brilliant performance too. As Dunn's Brandon Breyer uses his powers for evil, Denman and Banks as parents have to deal with it. Their family dynamics make the story much more superior to generic horror. Besides the acting, the superhero action has a gritty feel to it and makes for great, impactful death scenes. There is even enough gore to deliver maximal shock value and a great post credit scene. I wonder if there is a sequel because I really look forward to seeing Brandon Breyer develop from a teen to a grown man.

In an era of superhero-blockbusters, where we more or less get the same formulaic action-movie hollywood has peddled since the eighties, only now with long johns, it is refreshing with gems like Brightburn.
All too few writers and directors in this genre, in my opinion,really understands what the defining characteristic of this genre is: the awe-inspiring wonderment in the discovery and exploration of god-like supernatural powers.
And, here to boot, an idea of what kind of a psyche might go with such powers.
The story is unsentimental,tight and extremely effective. The effects are kept to a brutal minimum with no flashy crap.
This is brilliant filmmaking.",Brightburn
427,goodriddance_92,Amazing concept falls short,6,24 June 2019,"This film has so much promise, it just lacks a special kind of substance. I had rather high hopes for it but it just lacked a killer blow. Maybe they're saving something bigger for a sequel. The biggest moments they saved as a sizzle reel during the credits? I guess they ran out of budget or something. The horror elements were cool, the kid was actually pretty decent. Just wanted more.",Brightburn
428,bland-kevin67,Great Trailer Not Enough Substance,5,28 May 2019,"After seeing this trailer on YouTube for so many months I was looking forward towards a high quality super villain movie that would turn the genre upside down. Instead it was more of a Nightmare on Elm street junior edition. The director chose to make it a jump out and shock you movie with too much gore and not enough Substance to make you either love or hate any of the characters.
SPOILER ALERT!!
A young superboy with no reason to hate anyone suddenly becomes a killer because he doesn't want anyone to tell his parents how naughty he is.
He kills for the most juvenile reasons and the victims are all basically asking for it. Your nephew blasts you with his eyes and you decide to drive away from your home leaving your family for no reason at all.
He also seems to be much smarter than his earth years but kills for no good reason like a brat on the playground.
This could have been a great anti hero movie with a bit of depth and cunning but instead it's just a gore fest like a Jason or Childsplay movie. I'm hoping the sequel will deal with the development of the lead character and some logic to the whole plot. I would have made him more deceptively evil and show his powers in more of a grandiose manner. The heights of rage are softened down too easily with tenderness. After being rag dolled across the room by a twelve year old the dad decides to take him in the woods for a mercy kill thinking he will just die.
Just missing a bit more meat in the stew for my taste. I still love the trailer better than the movie.",Brightburn
429,dircpitt,A delusion,4,1 December 2019,"Happy intuition for a variant on the theme of the anti-hero in a horror key with some striking findings. Too bad then that the script is lost on the final. The protagonist sows deaths everywhere but tries to maintain anonymity (what is the use of being invincible?). Yet his stated goal is to dominate the world: should he do it secretly? The spaceship is referred to as a sort of cryptonite (in the presence of which the boy does not feel ill but he can cut himself (boh?). The ship arrives intact on earth without any damage, then a quiet earth lady tears off a piece as if it were a sheet metal. Honestly we do not understand all these tricks except in function of a sequel. But it would have been enough in this film to make it invincible, something could always have been invented in a hypothetical sequel. A terrible story of those who have a happy intuition that however cannot develop or complete. Finally, the character of the boy: I imagine that the intentions were to describe him as an immature personality who cannot manage his own power and eventually turns to evil rather than good. But here the boy looks like a schizophrenic with a double personality. A delusion.",Brightburn

The acting was good, but the story was very predictable. I was able to tell what was going to happen for just about every scene. The horror and suspense elements of the movie could have been better. The gore was average at best, but nothing compared to some of the best horror movies in history (Texas Chainsaw, Saw, Halloween, etc). I also liked the mid credit scenes, which is what I wish the movie would've focused on more (terrorizing the world).This is an average movie at best, so keep your expectations low.",Brightburn

It's everything you could ask for in a horror movie with a climax the likes of which you've not seen before. It's everything those lame film versions of Stephen King novels aspired too but failed miserably.
You know where it's going, certainly, but not how it's going to get there and it delivers surprises in spades.
It's gory and it's graphic and it is a fabulous shockfest.
The soundtrack deserves a special credit as it provides a perfect atmosphere to what's unfolding on the screen.

Sort of a standard creepy horror-ish story, reminiscent, as the PR says, of the original Superman plot. There are differences and twists though. Nothing award winning, but all in all something to occupy 90 minutes of free time.But what I absolutely can not take is a Director who doesn't know how to properly light the sets. To me, films that are just too damn dark are not moody, or setting an ambience, they are JUST TOO DARK as in not lit well. Be it from either incompetence or lack of money for entire intricate sets, it really turns me off to the plot immediately.

Unfortunately I only marginally liked the movie.The biggest issue is it is no different than any horror movie involving a mysterious child. The only difference is its a bad version of superman instead of a demon or alien or murderer . What makes the movie ok is most of the actors and the attempt at putting a cool spin on a superhero origin. It would have been difficult to not have certain cliches in this movie, but a better effort in character development would have been appreciated.I would say 6.5 out of 10.

I also notice all these people complaining they like the trailer and not the movie why build unrealistic expectations for everything you watch you're taking all the surprise out of the film.Imagine if every book you read you read the cliff notes about all the best or crucial parts what would be the point of reading the entire story and what wouldn't that make all the other parts that make the story seem boring.

453,KillerRomance,What if Superman was Evil?... Different almost has a supernatural element,10,2 February 2020,"A reinvented account to superhero horror based on one of my favourites which is Superman. Set in Brightburn in Kansas, a barren couple found a baby in a spaceship outside their Farmhouse. As Ten years passed, the nice boy named Brandon, exhibits personality alter and showed lack of remorse when he is hearing otherworldly voices from the spaceship at the barn to ""take the world"".
Things took an unexpected turn.
Better than I expected when they take a superman original plot and twisted it in asking us on what if Superman was Evil?
This movie feels like a horror movie than a superhero one because it leans towards creepy atmosphere and suspense. Even supernatural like in approach. The special effects are excellent and the kills are even better than Pet Semetary and Child's Play remake that came out at the same year of 2019. Is Brightburn shocking? In a way it is are, it is no Hostel or that sicko Serbian thingy but Brightburn is more decent and entertaining, in terms of creative kills, the movie makers went for It. heard people whining about no character development or why is there no good inside Brandon who is the character that is the antihero? I felt for the characters and cared about them, Banks and Denham are believable and had chemistry, certainly likable people. There is enough character development for this movie than another rerun of Christopher Reeve shenanigans of finding a crystal and speaking to his parents in blocks of ice. As for the personality, it altered like a flick of the switch so no good in this boy left to express in his genes from another planet.
The viewer does not have to be spoon-fed on the details but can create their own addition to this story.
The plot is well paced, no dull moments with great acting, good subtle music score as well.
Any negative points to the movie? I have a couple. I wish it was ten more minutes longer because I didn't want it to end and I wished I seen it on the big screen back in June 2019. What a fun ride. I will watch it again.",Brightburn
454,reagansteyn,Could've been so much more!,6,7 June 2019,"I just feel like this movie was rushed. Not just the film itself but the planning and story line. It definitely could've had more depth in the story.Let's start with the obvious stuff first. I'm not sure if this was intentional but it's basically Superman gone rogue. Very similar powers and even how the kid came into existence is almost identical to Superman. I won't give too much away but fans of Superman may cringe a little throughout this film.In saying that, I actually think it's such a great concept but it failed to deliver. The story is slow and probably could've been over in a hour at the most. It just needed more. More action, perhaps more of a background as he's growing up, more about where he's from and how he got here, more battles and fight scenes. Everything is over in the blink of an eye.Speaking of battle scenes, well they're hardly battles. He pretty much does what he wants to do and that's it. It's pretty gruesome too in some scenes. One in particular involving an eyeball and shattered glass had me squirming in my seat.There has to be a sequel though. That can't be all there is to this story. There's so much that's left unexplained. Where is he from? Who was telling him to ""take the world""? How will he be stopped? What will he do next?I'm hoping that this was kinda like an introduction film hence the 6/10 rating. It can't be all over just like that. Watch it and you'll see what I mean.",Brightburn

456,embracing_silence,Refreshing take on superhero genre,8,6 December 2019,"I've never been very interested in superhero movies for some reason, and I initially had no plans to watch this one, thinking it would be another origin story with dark moments. This movie is purely a horror movie, not just a cash-grab. I'm sure if the creators want, they can expand the universe (which I would be interested in seeing), but it isn't the same story we've seen over and over again.What I enjoyed was seeing what could happen if a superhuman had no good intentions, and there wouldn't be another superhero to swoop in and save the day. The buildup was good and it fell into place.I saw someone on imdb said the movie wasn't gory; this movie isn't a splatter-fest, but the few gore moments that are in it are intense. This is not a movie to show young kids.",Brightburn

462,Koma-Mo,Sad that this didn't go all the way with the horror.,6,29 August 2019,"Having a great concept, this presents something that can serve up a good and satisfying horror movie. Many comic book fans want to see a full on R rated film about a ""Superman"" like character who turns evil. There is something missing in this film that prevents me from fully enjoying this experience and I think this all has to do that the film didn't go full on out with this premise. Yes, there are scenes that did what I wanted to see, but personally, it wasn't enough. There were plenty of things that the film could have done, but it felt that the director played it safe. Once you see some scenes that were able to bring the horror to the movie, I thought this is where the film stood strong. Not only did I enjoy watching these horrifically brutal moments , some of them had me cringing and squirming in my seat. However, I do have to say that the execution and how some of these scenes ended was abrupt and didn't leave my jaws dropping in any sort of way. As those parts of the film did a good job of bringing what I wanted to see in this type of movie, I am a little sad that and do wish that the film would have provided more scenes like that.I didn't mind that there were subplots that weren't fully answered as it is something you can think about and connect the dots easily. However, one thing that would have benefited this film was to show more scenes with Brandon. We know he is menacing based on the premise, but the film didn't do a good job of making the character interesting. If the film was able to make him more sympathetic and allowing us to connect with him more, then I feel that we will not only feel sorry for him, but will start to fear him a bit more as we see that he is unstable. Right off the bat, the film addresses who he is and there is no change with him. Because of that, I feel that this made the film's overall story weaker than it should have been. Also, having more of a horror element added to it would have satisfied me even more. I do like that the film wanted to focus on the dramatic elements involving the family, but at the same time, the director didn't do a good job of blending these two together, making parts of the film drag a bit which leads to a huge decrease of brutality that we could have seen.The performances were mostly good and I really did like Elizabeth Banks and David Denman who really gave nice performances as the parents, who had the most depth out of everyone in the film. Jackson A. Dunn did do a decent job, but because his character didn't have a lot of personality, I didn't really care for the character and that he felt more like a generic bad guy with super powers. He had one look to him and he kept that same look throughout the film, as if the director wanted us to fear his expressionless mannerisms. He really needed more personality and allowing us to see who he is would have made him a more conflicting character.I am slightly disappointed and yet a little satisfied with the overall results. I truly wanted the director to go full throttle and give us a hardcore scary superhero movie. There was simply not enough of gore and horror elements that would have satisfied people. It is worth watching just to see some of the deaths, but other than that, it's nothing special.",Brightburn

466,cmills-98693,"Good, but could have been exceptional.",6,18 July 2019,"Brightburn is a fantastic premise.The 180 flip on the classic Superman tale is a great idea and has been done in comic books but never on the big screen.
The idea is a brilliant one, and at points Brightburn shows some real quality. The practical effects and the attack scenes are brilliant and the central trio of Jackson Dunn, Elizabeth Banks and David Denman work really well together.
However with only a 90 minute runtime you really are left wishing for a little more, not enough for a sequel by any stretch, you just feel that there was so much potential left out of Brightburn, you're more annoyed about what's not in it and what they didn't do with a fantastic character set.My main grievance is the ending.
To be clear, I LOVE movies where the bad guy wins (The Cabin In The Woods is one of my all time favourites) but this ending was a little flat.
Both parents died basically the same way: trying to kill Brandon and failing, only to then die themselves and the scene where the mother finds Brandon's book of the sketches of him destroying the earth or killing everyone don't hold up to the ending we see, which is just him being a bit of a dick to people. He collapses a building yeah, but then sets a couple of forest fires and burns some crops? A long way from the earth melting lasers or the mountain of dead bodies he would float atop? I just felt that ending could have had far more punch.
Also, just as a niggle, the cop in it is dumb as hell, he finds a clearly hand drawn symbol at the scene of a supposed car accident and that doesn't set any alarms off?Overall, Brightburn is a good movie to test the waters in terms of evil supers, and it has some fantastic suspenseful scenes, but you do leave thinking if numerous things that could have been added or used that never really grew or were explained at all.",Brightburn

468,raven-sirius,It wasn't that bad,5,24 September 2019,Predictable? Yes. Dark? Yes. Spooky? At times. Acting? Yes. Should Billy Eylish sue for the way they mixed out the end credits? For every penny the production company has. It does not matter if authority to use her track was approved. The way it was treated was a travesty of sound engineering. Even bad radio jocks don't mix from track to track with an audible clunk in between. It's unfortunate that the way the end credits are treated are an example of the effort put into the film. If they appeared at the beginning I would have walked out.But the movie itself was okay.,Brightburn

470,rjfromtoronto,Not Clark Kent but Snark Bent,4,21 January 2021,"Didn't plan on watching this but it came up on Starz Cinema on a boring Rona Thurs in January 2021, I guess at this point in the lockdown I will watch just about anything, so I decided to let it play and wasn't sure until I saw Elizabeth Banks appear and paid attention a bit more. What a waste of time,could have been something with more of everything that it lacked, no plot, no background, no build up, just dad mentioning to his 12 yr old son on a hunting trip he will soon be interested in girls, and a bit of a birds and bee's moment that had a bit of creep in it when the boy surprises the girl with the laptop serenade. then it goes off the rails and makes no sense with all the payback and silencing he does. It's not hard to imagine what happens in Brightburn 2 which I feel is inferred because the only characters that are coming out the other end are the kid and the young girl when It's all over. The violence and gore was a bit much and unnecessary, didn't really connect to any of the other characters to care what happened except the waitress/mother if at all. The Superman reference at the end is spooky and evil, you already realized he was not going to be stopped and I guess the next installment (?) will deal with his Achilles heel ie: spacecraft metal as his kryptonite.

471,brosseauphilippe,"Brightburn's concept and narrative promise is quite quirky and interesting, suitable to excite any comic book fan.",6,26 July 2021,"It even seems astonishing that no one has thought of it before. Basically, the film produced by James Gunn sets out to show what would happen if a little boy with a Superman-like trajectory chooses not to do good in the discovery of his powers, but rather evil. The premise is clearly promising and clever, but unfortunately the great science fiction film mixed with horror is not in the game. Indeed, the film is quite pleasant and entertaining but it remains too much on the surface compared to such a subject to fully convince. We are entitled to a well-made, rhytmic and sometimes fun little B movie, but not the long awaited variation on the myth of the superhero preferring evil.The scenario does not sufficiently explore the possibilities of his golden idea. Everything is moving too fast, from the appearance of the young boy's powers to his switch to the dark side. All lack of development and the film often confuses rhythm and haste. Obviously, screenwriters and director have chosen to bet everything on action and horror in the second part to the detriment of psychology and a more dense and deepened mythology. The actors are not all good (except the parents) and we feel that the budget may be a little tight for a story of such magnitude. As an exemple, the film starts very quickly and does not talk about the origin of the boy just as it ends in a dark (this is a good point because different) but abrupt. Looks like the producers were guaranteed to give the movie a sequel, as the end credits show. A particularly intelligent and appetizing generic but which makes you want to see more. A bit as if we had removed the final package which dazzles. All this is therefore frustrating in addition to seeing such untapped potential.That aside, we must admit that Brightburn remains entertaining enough and well done to convince. There are even quite a few scenes that hint at what it could have been with a bigger budget and another team at the helm. We appreciate the context of this small town and this isolated farm as in Superman and also the way in which this child of evil is represented. The special effects are effective and discreet but what remains the most succesful remains the horrific side. Not that the film scares or startles but it reserves us original and enjoyable killings. There are some very sickening gore scenes of the best effect. In itself, in this little B movie, there is frustrating but also good which allows to have a good time. 6/10.",Brightburn

We have other super powered persons gone bad movies/series (Chronicle, Split, Glass, The Boys, etc), usually in the sci-fi, action, or drama genres, that delve into ""why"" the person turned villainous. Brightburn, however, gives us a straight up horror movie that's basically what if 12 year old Superman had the mental stability of The Good Son (or Mikey or The Children of the Corn or *insert sociopathic child movie here*)? And they don't pull any punches with the gore either.And what I really appreciate about the script is that the character, Brandon, does come from a loving home and while he does experience some peer bullying, it's not excessive or violent. He really has no reason to lash out other than simply discovering his powers and deciding that he is superior. There is no trigger, there is no ""bad day"", there is no explanation of ""evil"". Much like Damien in the Omen films, Brandon just accepts that he is different, having abilities that others don't have.

That sounds pretty amazing.After watching Brightburn, I was more than pleasantly surprised. I really didn't know what type of movie this would be considering it's a pretty original idea. Turns out, this film very much delved into the horror genre with some pretty frightening scenes and a decent amount of gore.I thought the acting was amazing. It's really hard for me to imagine just how characters would react in a situation like this; however, I think everyone did a spot on job. Jackson A. Dunn did an exceptional job playing the creepy, emotionless Brandon Breyer. This was the first more serious role I've seen Matt Jones in and I was shocked at just how well his acting was.I really can't say much without giving away the plot, but if you're a horror fan... I definitely suggest adding this one to your list. It's a whole new genre of horror in my opinion that I really wouldn't mind seeing more of.I've heard rumors that Gunn may be expanding this into a whole universe of evil superheroes and I really hope to see such a universe created.

499,aequanimis,The Darker and More Boring Superman,5,12 July 2020,"Brightburn is basically a retelling of Superman's origins, except with a twist. A mysterious baby boy (Brandon) arrives on Earth via a flying object and turns out to have superpowers, to the amazement and horror of his loved ones. However, the difference between Superman and Brandon is that Brandon will come to use his powers for less benevolent reasons and become more like Superman's antithesis.What I liked about this movie was that it chose to tell this tale about a superhuman boy who descends into violent rampages any time he wants to or feels like he needs to without resorting to a miraculous solution that would either A. kill the boy or B. turn the boy into a ""good"" guy. The movie ends with the outcome that everyone dreaded, the one that leaves the film's world bleaker and more hopeless, the one where the bad guy gets away. It was a refreshing experience.
I also liked how disgusting and disturbing the gore was, but also how well distributed it was throughout the film. It occured just often enough to be jarring, shocking, and grotesque each time I saw it on-screen. The guy with the broken jaw in the car accident is definitely something that will stick with you.
A lot of people seem not to appreciate the pacing of the film, but personally, it wasn't a big problem for me. I think that the boy's transformation from pure to wicked was indeed rushed, but each scene felt like it happened when it was supposed to.What I didn't like about the movie is how much Brandon's adoptive mother, Tori, coddles her son. When Brandon crushes (literally, crushes EVERY bone) in his classmate Caitlin's hand, he faces no punishment besides some counseling. In fact, she cannot even offer a sincere apology to Caitlin's mother, Erica, except for a cold ""Sorry for your daughter."" and is taken aback by Erica's albeit brash criticisms of her son, even though Caitlin's hand had been COMPLETELY SHATTERED. When their chickens abruptly end up brutally slaughtered, Tori cannot fathom the idea that Brandon may have, in some way, been involved, despite his behavior getting weirder by the second. When she finds out Brandon's lie about playing soccer with his buds on the night her sister's husband was KILLED, she stops her husband from even yelling at Brandon. This incessant coddling is what indirectly leads to the deaths of many people who did not deserve to die and only one person who absolutely did deserve to die --- herself. It is so very hard to relate to Tori or to even feel sympathy for her because of this, which makes her struggles throughout the film and her well-deserved death even more anticlimactic than they already were.Additionally, Brandon's switch from a happy, normal boy to a raging psychopath is only ever explained by some larger ""purpose"" or message the ship sends, which is to ""take the world"". He has no struggle embracing this larger purpose, no struggle with morality, no struggle with his love for his adoptive parents. He's only vaguely surprised when he discovers he has superpowers. It strikes me as an oddly one-dimensional approach to a character that I wanted to be more complex and wished I would've liked more. Watching Brandon is like watching some spoiled kid throw murderous tantrums for no reason other than because the ship he came in told him to and he apparently has no will of his own. Or because his mother raised him to always get what he wants.This movie is, unfortunately, a very forgettable watch, with only the special effects keeping me from forgetting it the night I watched it. The acting was decent (except for Brandon's actor, who only had two emotions: brooding and apathetic), but the characters are all-around unlikable and unrelatable. It's an above-average movie that'll only kind of spice up your movie night.
If I could, I would rate this a 5.5/10. Slightly better than average, but not by much.",Brightburn

There is not a single character that is developed, so there is absolutely no one we care about. He kills all these people, but who cares? I don't know any of them so their death is utterly meaningless to me.
About 15 minutes into the movie it was already clear, that the movie had written itself into a corner with nowhere to escape.
The worst part was the one-dimensional protagonist, who discovers"" his inner evil after some noises appear from the hidden spaceship he came in. And from then on, he is just evil. He is a twelve year old boy and out of a sudden starts murdering people and never feels any remorse, never has any doubts, never asks any questions why this happens? Huh, well then. If you don't care about your film, I won't either.
The parents should have taken action in terms of openly talking to their child, instead of equivocating all the time.
No one in this film feels human, and the film has zero heart. All it tries is to strive off showing gore. And it lacks a lot of subtlety. Could have made this into an actually worthwhile film.

It's an interesting concept and I'd really like to see more of these kinds of movies since they are unique in story and characters. Unfortunately, brightburn really isn't that great and there are quite a lot of problems with it. The parents in this movie are great, and they were acted very well, also easily the best part of the film. The movie also gets going fairly quickly, only about 10 minutes in and you can already somewhat tell what's going on. That's mainly what I have to say in terms of what I enjoyed about it. A lot of characters are rushingly introduced towards the second half and lead to unusual scenes which aren't quite relevant to the story at all. Many of the weirder and dumber scenes don't even get explained at all, a lot of them making no sense. The story is pretty much not even there, they try to set it up earlier in the movie but then it kinda goes away not long afterwards. It feels like the story is done within the first 30 minutes or so and you're just watching the aftermath. CGI is atrocious in just about every scene it's used for, which is a lot of them. Prosthetics are insanely unrealistic and don't even work realistically when certain people are shot or bleeding. The movie also feels very repetitive in being that they're doing the same things pretty much over and over again, with only 1 or 2 creative scenes towards the end. In the first half, there wasn't quite much swearing or anything that would be rated R, but in the second half characters seem to have been non-stop swearing and everything begun to get really rated R.",Brightburn

The movie was not bad, but I really expected more. At the begining I wasn't very exited but my expectations started to build as I saw more of the trailers and noticed who was involved in this movie. It offers a fresh approach on the alien theme, giving it a more relatable perspective (making it seem as part of us and not just a monster with the intention of scaring us) and, as I've heard, giving a twist to the Superman plot. I liked the idea, but I think it wasn't executed quite well. First of all, I didn't make a good connection with the characters as to matter whatever happened to them, yes, they try to connect with us through the idea of the ""parents"" not being able to have a baby and then receiving it, but it wasn't really that explored. Also, Brandon, I think there is a big issue with him, he just suddenly seems to be a different person, one moment he is a little scary boy bullied at school, the next one he is already the manipulator monster we see till the end of the movie, they try to justify this with that ship thing talking to him (kind of weird it waited twelve years to start giving him messages) but it doesn't make sense this can just turn him into wanting to ""take the world"" in some nights compared to the whole life his parents had been trying to teach him good morals (it can be seen during the movie they were actually good parents). At the end, he was completely unbeatable, there wasn't a single moment I was shocked or worried of what was going to happen, I knew he wouldn't get hurt or in danger since he is completely immune to anything and he was too intelligent to even be harmed for his only weakness. I also knew anybody was going to die, this child had no feelings apparently (except for hate) so nothing could stop him from killing anything getting in his way.

Maybe a new universe with anti heroes could come out of this? The bad guy winning for once. An evil Superman is very thrilling. Especially if it's made in a more ""realistic"" way. Give it a big budget, a great cast and a talented director/writer and you got gold.

532,CronenbergsMonster,Should Have Been So Much Better,5,26 April 2020,"I felt compelled to review this film because I was so utterly disappointed by it. Despite the really cool idea of a super villain origin story, Brightburn squanders every bit of its compelling premise. This could have been such a fascinating film - basically showing us how a Superman origin story could have so easily gone awry if Kal-El had simply decided to use his powers for his own selfish gain. Instead what we get is basically a by-the-book slasher film with super powers thrown in. There are some cool, gory practical effects, and the acting is decent, but everything else falls flat. There isn't any real depth to any of the characters. You don't care about anyone, including the protagonist, so it just feels like there are no stakes. I just really hope that someone sees this movie, realizes it's potential, and makes something deserving of its cool premise.",Brightburn
533,malthenielsen,Drawn out and repetitive,4,29 June 2020,"The concept ""evil Superman"" was promising, But the screen writers seems to have run out of ideas very fast. It lacked an an opponent, somebody who could credibly challenge the evil buy. When you realized, fairly fast, that he was unstoppable, there was no tension in it. He needed to have a weak point, a kryptonite, so there could be at least a little bit of exitement if anybody managed to use that to get him. Other holes was; his backstory was too shallow. We learned too little about where he came from and who he was. The boy's personality was boring, we learned not much about how he felt about all of this. And there was no real fight. Superhero-movies live from the grand battles with cars flying around and stuff. It's boring to watch him kill policement and waitresses. They should have added say a special government agent in a suit that gave him powers that was looking for him. Anything, just to have a real fight.Way to much time was used for the kill scenes. They were so drawn out and long, and it made no sense why he was sneaking around in the shadows forever before moving in. He had nothing to worry about, he could just walk in and whack everybody.Some plot lines were simply dropped. The fat kid that teased him did not get killed, even if he was the only one sort of deserving it. We did not hear what happened to his ""girlfriend"", and they spent some scenes building up that he was super intelligent, but he really did not act very intelligent. He was behaving like somebody acting on whims, with no planning and forethought. It was not explained why he picked that mask he picked.The movie was like 20 minites of a movie stretched out and the same things repeated to make it last an entire movie. The most interesting thing was the small clips during the titles at end end.",Brightburn
534,lukehasenfus,What we need in the theaters!!!,9,24 May 2019,"Wow this is the perfect evil Superman movie we need. I saw that with a budget of 7 million, this movie worked with a small one and seemed to kick it off perfectly!! I absolutely loved this film and it had all of my friends jumping and excited throughout it all. I really enjoyed that they went the R route on this, I believe that it is more realistic when it comes to this kind of stuff, people coming from other planets and basically tearing crap up. This was such a great film and they need to make more of it, the blood was a perfect amount- not too little-not too much.

535,mwpowelllde,Not exactly the anti-Man-of-Steel but pretty close,7,14 May 2019,"Good mix of horror elements with anti-hero undertones, I thought. If you have followed Elizabeth Banks movies at all, you know that she is generally type-cast in nearly-successfully, but fundamentally-flawed supporting, sometimes leading ladies. This movie was no different. She desperately tried to do the right thing throughout the movie, but much to her chagrin, and in the worst possible way in the end, their twisted, bent, demon spawn alien of a child just would not listen to reason. It got creepy pretty quickly, but it was pretty much dark by about halfway through the film. The moment when the kid gets seriously twisted, like the bits to that point weren't bad enough, was a bit of a stretch. All that ""superior"" intellect, but apparently his inherited genetics did not include much in the way of emotional intelligence; without saying too much, you'll get it when you see it. Which at that point through pretty much the close of the film any displays of his abilities were just horror plot devices for the intended effect. Would it merge into the DCEU at all? Who knows. It might be interesting for Clark Kent to learn that an evil counter agent did actually arrive. But I do not think that was the goal at all. There were definitely true horror moments in the film in which practical effects were the focus of the scenes through and through; usually as a consequence of the boy exercising his abilities in one manner or another for maximum effect. Worth a watch.",Brightburn

539,LoganJEcclesLoganSmash,A reimagination of Super-Man you diddnt know you needed,7,2 September 2019,"I am shocked by how many bad reviews this masterpiece has on here!
The story, the filming, and the acting is outstanding. I love the idea of what if Super-Man was in the horror/suspenseful thriller instead of superhero/action. The comparison between the two stories is so good but it's still just different enough not to be dismissed as a bad rip off. A married couple on a farm finds a baby in a spaceship. Baby grows up and has superpowers. Now, this is where it gets different, the child develops psychopath type tendencies. Collecting pictures of organs, stalking, obsessing over guns, and excessive knowledge of animals.This cast guys is so good and so right for this story. Elizabeth Banks and David Denman are a sweet convincing couple and bring the emotion and realities of if this happened. Elizabeths take on how a mother would respond to her child being a psychopathic killer is so raw and realistic. Throughout the movie, she reacts as if she knows but doesn't want to accept it and of course that's how a mother would react, mother knows Best but mother also protects. David Denmans take on a protective husband and suspicious father is so unique in storytelling. I mean of course he's going to let his sterile wife keep the baby from the woods but that's not his baby he don't know where that thing came from, but it makes his wife happy. Last but not least Jackson A. Dunn is bound to rise in stardom after his stellar performance.Also, I usually don't like spoiling but watch the credits please cause it sets up a possible sequel and universe. Micheal Rooker pops up mid-credits as like a crazy youtube theorist guy. He starts going off about superpower being sightings and how they are out there killing people and terrorizing the world. It even shows a line up of potential super-powered horror villains for possible movies.",Brightburn

543,bwasman-30723,It's OK,7,23 August 2019,"Brightburn takes an interesting (albeit not new) concept and makes it a slasher, which is pretty cool. It does several things pretty well - the music, atmosphere, and tension in some scenes are excellent, including some pretty sweet shots of Brandon being evil and ominously floating. These shine over the generic horror movie shots of light on, no bad guy, light off, light back on, bad guy. If you've seen a lot of horror movies or even just the classic slashers you can see these coming from a mile away and you can tell where Brandon is gonna pop up. This predictability kind of kills some of the tension in the stalking scenes. But the part leading up to the finale is very tense, as are some scenes of the barn, etc.
The actors are good, especially the kid who plays Brandon, but my god are the characters stupid. In just about every situation they do the opposite of what a rational human would do, and it can be awfully frustrating at times.
The biggest issue here is that it's rushed. Others have mentioned this and it's absolutely true - the editing can be TERRIBLE and some necessary parts are cut short or not built upon. This would have benefitted from an extra half hour to build, say, the investigation, brandon's costume making (all of a sudden he has a mask), and definitely add more kills. There are just not enough, but what's there is certainly impressive and can actually be pretty disturbing (like the part with the jaw).
Similarly, there are times when the movie isn't sure what it wants to be. Does it want to be a slow, tension building atmospheric movie? Or does it want to be a gory slasher? Both can be done - just look at Mandy (2018) - but if Brightburn were to be the former, it would need to be longer and more uncomfortable. It's got the cinematography for this and the brutality to keep you watching, but it's too short. If it were to be the latter, it would need more kills instead of the frequent dialogue heavy scenes or parts where just nothing really happens, and it would need to take itself way less seriously.
Also, it's bleak and dark. And it does a GREAT job filling the audience with despair. There's no happy ending, evil wins, and at times it may seem unnecessarily punishing (which I don't have a problem with).
Overall it's conceptually and visually there and gripping enough to keep you watching for the most part, but it's nowhere near a masterpiece. It'll keep you more or less entertained for 90 minutes though, and sometimes, that's all you want in a horror movie (but one that takes itself this seriously could use a little bit more).",Brightburn
544,sheepfood,Actually not bad,7,25 January 2020,"Someone reviewed that : ""... instead of exploring why and what makes someone a hero or an evildoer, that was completely overridden... ""Well, he or she was wrong. The movie did show what flipped the switch in Brandon in the end. And that is the betrayer of his mother. (This is the spoiler in the movie. And an important one)This movie is interesting enough for me. There are times which i felt frustration thinking that the plot is stupid, but it actually did make a lot of sense upon. It's just whether or not you can accept the plot put in front of you. Not everything got to be ""beautiful"" or have a ""happy ending"". The path this movie take is very daring and dark, unsuspecting viewers may not be able to take it.What I also like about this movie is that it's very very thought provoking. Making me think about family's bonding, particularly about the love of a mother. I admit there are multiple times I thought how stupid the mother(Tori) is, that she had seen Brendon levitated and knows that her son is something not natural(and potentially evil). Yet, there is the denial of a loving parent. Beautifully acted out by Elizabeth Banks. The father, Kyle, although wasn't the main element here in the movie, did the job well. Loving, in a fatherly way, and not as deep as a mother's. He is what most of us would be in reality.There are still more potential for this movie, that's why I've given it an OK score of 7/10. We do know Brandon still got some love in him so maybe his state of mind or ""struggle"" could have been portrayed more here. But, still a worthy show for me.",Brightburn
545,stoneps,For those who say it is only a movie of a kid with superpowers that kills people..,9,23 June 2019,"I find this movie very interesting. It put a lot of emphasis on the horror and the ""jump scare"" side of it though I have to admit which is not deep enough for the topic/discussion but you have to show people the consequences.
There are always people who judge the film by the effect (ooh it is just a stupid horror/it is not even that scary.. blah) and they are unwilling to look at the bigger picture; it is simply trying to tell a different possibility and I'm glad it drew those people's attention.
They should see the fact that this movie uses the character to reflect the defect of the American society. Brandon is a lot of hard work himself with all the aggression (and the calling from the stupid spaceship) but it also tells a story of how the society can't cope with abnormalities like him (smart, different, and insecure). People like him get bullied. They (those stupid mediocre) call him freak, weirdo, and no one will even take any sort of effort to understand the boy. And it is supposed to be okay these day..

Pretty much an alternate reality of ""Superman/kid"" who chooses to cross the threshold into a void of Evil! This film shows the potential that this genre of movie is capable of with an ""R"" rating; no lines that can't be crossed, no mommy's screaming at studios for being too violent or dark for their sheltered children, and no rotten CGI or overdone Marvel cliche action scenes.
This film was beautifully disturbing and for the most part, unpredictable!
At the beginning of this film I had the thought that I might be bored: but as it progessed, I realized I was watching Art! The film never treats the audience like their stupid and the special effects were so realistic. A very simple story of a boy discovering his powers and entering the abyss. It leaves the perfect amount of mystery, not spoon-feeding me all the way through on every little detail
There were some flaws but none really worth mentioning.
THIS tone/rating is what I wanted for ""Venom"", What ""Suicide Squad"" should have been and What a lot of super hero/Villain should be. Hopefully WB gets wise, and gives their ""Joker"" origin film The same freedoms.

It's a genre that doesn't get much attention, but should. It's science-horror.What made this storyline so plausible was the way that the film slid the premise so snugly into the skin of the creation story for Superman. It wasn't so close that it was plagiary. It was more like hearing a new song and having it remind you of an old tune that you knew long ago.I hope that this the first of a franchise. I am filled with speculation about the story-arc for Brandon Breyer but I don't want to air it here.In a year when a movie that I adored, ""Avengers - Infinity War,"" was released I have to reluctantly say that I think that THIS is the sharpest, hippest, coolest super-power movie of the year.",Brightburn

The concept was great, but it played on the ""Evil Superman"" vibe quite heavily.My only complaints were that after Brandon finds out he has superpowers and the ship that brought him to Earth starts chanting in the Alien language (which was really creepy and unsettling by the way) and begins to control him, he doesn't seem to be bothered by it. He just kind of goes along with doing what the ship tells him to do to murder anyone who stands in his way. At the beginning of the movie it seems like he truly loves his parents and is a good person with a good moral background. I would have loved to have seen him instead try to fight the darkness inside himself. Ask his parents for help in trying to overcome these dark urges instead of giving straight into them.That being my only complaint, everything else was solid. The acting was really well done, especially Elizabeth Banks. Even newcomer Jackson A. Dunn as Brandon/Brightburn really honestly gave me the creeps and pulled off a fine performance.

Both times, I caught myself with my hands over my mouth and shocked at a few parts. But instead of focusing on the characters and the storyline, I'm going to tell you what kept me clinging to the seat before me just as much. The Music!I swear, if the Brown Note was playing on this soundtrack by Timothy Williams,I would not be surprised. I remained haunted, tensed the entire time, even after leaving!

Is that what really appeals to the masses? No wonder why I'm not much of a people person. Boring...But Brightburn goes off the trail in the most satisfying way. A country couple who haven't been able to conceive get what they assume is a gift when something crashes on their property and they find a small boy inside. But this ain't no Superman come to save the world. Just as the boy gets puberty age, the remnants of the arrival vessel calls to him from the barn, where it's been since they found it. It keeps emitting one alien phrase over and over again, which is eventually translated to be ""Take the world"".As oddballl child Brandon Breyer begins to act out, it quickly moves from a smarty tone to violence against school mates and adults. When he realizes and accepts his origins, his immediate reaction is not how to help mankind, but arrogance and disdain for the world. He proudly professes his superiority and quickly and brutally destroys anyone who stands in his way. He appears to be indestructible, aside from being able to be harmed by the substance his ship was created from, so bullets bounce right off of his head.The acting is very good as well. I've always liked Elizabeth Banks for her appearances is Scrubs and especially Modern Family, but she plays the protective mother role very well. The kid they got to play Brandon naturally exudes arrogance and he's the kind of kid you would probably dislike right away, even before he begins terrorizing the town.Thankfully, this is another of the rare films that does not go for the heartwarming ending. The parents end up dead, and during the credits we see Brandon going on a spree of destruction. I hope this opens it up for a sequel.

567,eeluksw,Brightburn Burns Out,3,16 October 2019,"The core idea of Brightburn is excellent; a perfect, if obvious, inversion of the current superhero canon that so desperately needs shaking up. Brightburn has the rare ability to change the course of its genre, pushing it to new heights. However the film's potential is all that it has going for it, and it's impressive how little time it takes for the film to fall into safe, unimaginative rhythms. It was already going to be unimpeachable in the box office. Why not try something crazy? Why, when the mere mention of the film's log line is enough to excite an audience, rest on your laurels? Why refuse to take advantage of an opportunity to surprise, confuse, or challenge said audience? Everyone already knows what's going to happen. The difference between remembering it years from now and forgetting it next month is all in how these events are framed.Ironically, the very same exciting log line is a simultaneous red flag, as ""Superman but bad"" doesn't exactly inspire the most confidence in the end result, at least not from me. In practice, just call it a major whiff. Every plot device is transparent, set up and then knocked over in only a few minutes, all for the sake of narrative expediency. It's just not satisfying at all. There was a chance for the film to zero in on Brandon and draw a parallel between puberty and him discovering his power. If you just take all the scenes from the first half of the film, stretch them out, and then rearrange them in a less linear order, then you could have a pretty decent story. As it stands, it shucks character development, ignores logic, and goes for emotion where there is none for the audience to tap into.Everything about the writing screams ""We must make this movie before anyone else does,"" and by the gods, they went and done it.

It's just a crippled movie with some naively written story. Do yourself a favor a never make a part 2 of this movie.,Brightburn
569,atomiccomandant,Entirely unoriginal,2,16 September 2019,"First off i knew this movie would be repetitive predictable trash, and i was not wrong. This was marketed as a new and innovative take on superheroes. It was just a stupid angry child with superpowers. They could have done much better since they were already ripping off the premise of several dozen comic books. I would have given this movie 1 star but the fact that he got away was nice. Also Elizabeth Banks was killed in this so that's the one good thing to come from all of this.",Brightburn
570,jashaw-58240,Sociopathic kid with super powers throws a temper tantrum.,6,29 May 2019,"Ever wondered what Kal El would have been like without the stern backhand of Johnathan Kent, or Martha Kent's apple pies to warm his heart? Me either. Yet Brightburn poses an interesting question, even if wasn't asked: what would a psychopathic superboy be like in a world with no rules?To answer that question, Brightburn gives us a retelling of the superman mythos with a few ""killer kid"" tropes thrown in for good measure. Superboy Bandon is the typical monster in the making, unattached and quiet spoken, who at 12 years old is completely oblivious of his loving parents and supportive family. Its not long before he discovers he has super powers, can't be hurt, and that nothing can stand in his way. Rather than embrace this revelation with an air of responsibility, he throws an hour long temper tantrum that, while gory and fun to watch, is ultimately shallow.
Honestly, the super powers are wasted and unnecessary. Brandon would be just as stereotypically evil with a gun or knife. What surprised me most about the movie was the kids' focus; his family. I was expecting a town siege type of film, with superbrat mowing down helpless townspeople, destroying buildings, etc. That is not what happens in this film. Brandon basically takes all his super powered teen angst out on his family, who are very likeable, great portrayals of good people stuck in a terrifying situation. This is not a movie where you root for the bad guy, I was hoping his family would figure out a way to take him out every second of the way, Brandon has no redeeming qualities.
Brightburn offers a curious glimpse into the dark side of superdom, though I wasn't sure if Brandon was evil because he wasn't human, or because he had extra x and y chromosomes. The movie doesn't do a great job of giving you the why, just that it is what it is.",Brightburn
571,eacmacro-01305,Left something to be desired...,7,15 January 2021,"For all those that feel there was nothing left, consider this: Brandon DID have a form of kryptonite, however small. The drawback here is that there wasn't enough room to allow an earthling to act upon it, outside of the mother. How predictable, though, was her attempt to stab him? I mean come on, she held that ship-shard up there for ages! 😄
For all the senseless people that died, I feel the ending should've at least made him get fatally wounded. All that ending did was make it appear that Brandon was just going to wreak havoc, and take everything.",Brightburn

The only person that made the right call was the officer lady that came to the house. Futhermore I found Elizabeth Banks's clothing terrible.

I wanted to give it a fair shot as the story sounded cool, and the creators and production staff tends to put out mostly good quality work.The mom and dad thing is incredibly corny but I was able to push past that. The awkward kid thing is a bit much but I let it go. The story grew more interesting and I was starting to enjoy it despite the corny family dynamic and the excessive awkwardness of life as a kid. In general, the acting and the script the actors were working with were just not very good.The action came on fast, and the movie was never slow and boring. However more time could have spent wrapping things up more completely and putting some context around most of what happened regarding almost everything. Instead, it was just the kid being evil, the parents and everyone else being entirely vulnerable to and helpless against anything and everything the evil kid did, and absolutely no one was tasked with putting any effort into trying to figure things out what was going on or find a way to put a stop to it all.Bam! Everyone is dead and a plane crashes.Like I started off writing here, I began wanting to like this movie.

It had a few moments where I thought, ""wow, this Is actually pretty good."" Then it reverts to mediocre.The acting and writing was fair, but I feel it was just kinda lacking in originality. Way overboard on the blood and gore. Not really sure why the filmmakers thought more gore would make a better film.. it honestly detracted.The costuming was great!! The mask that the little boy makes as his antihero mask is awesome and creepy!! Well done design team.All in all, brightburn was a disappointment. I think it would have been better if they made it more as a antihero origin story, but instead it is a play by play of Superman, except for bad .. really really bad..",Brightburn

582,talizen,Sometimes I wish this is a DC movie,7,26 May 2019,"I was actually impressed than I thought about Brightburn. I do sometimes wish that this is a DC Comics movie but set on a different Earth in the Multiverse but a much more evil sinister type than the Crime Syndicate, an evil mirrored version of the Justice League from Earth 3. For the movie, the storyline was simple like Superman's origin, a baby from another world crash landed on Earth and raised on a farm in the state of Kansas just like Smallville. However things went got interesting and twisted when Brandon discovers his true self, accepts who he really is and then takes out anyone who are a threat to him. Its a bit cliche when it comes to the mother always defending the son who doesn't always believe that something is truly wrong until the end. The jumpscares were a little dull and predicting as well when Brandon does super speed to kill anyone. Overall, for a twisted horror take on a superhero genre I like it, I enjoyed the movie and thought it was very good.",Brightburn
583,malcolmwrites,Save your money and your time....,1,4 June 2019,"If you're like me, you can't resist a good superhero or quality, high-concept horror story. This is neither. It is, instead, a repetitively pieced together series of cliched wanna-be horror moments sprinkled with about three minutes of gratuitous torture porn and a dead-eyed flying murderer.Every scene is exactly the same: things look normal, something upsets the kid, the kid's glowing red eyes appear ominously in the dark and/or rainy background, the person he's stalking turns around to see...nothing...and then the kid indulges in some pointlessly violent act of murder. I'm serious about this. Every scene follows the exact...same...pattern. (Each scene would have been fine on its own as the first five minutes of a different, more well-developed movie. But this effort just never moves past the idea of an introductory scene and, therefore, never develops any kind of plot or story arc.)The boy's origins aren't explained. His motives aren't explained. His parents' obliviousness isn't explained. His powers aren't explained. Unlike its infinitely superior origin films such as Superman and Chronicle, there is no narrative story arc to this movie. There are no romantic interests, no friendships, no plot twists, no charm, no inspiration, and no point.The Brightburn pitch seems to have gone something like this: Pitch-person: ""Okay, so this baby crash lands on a farm just like in Superman only this kid is a sadistic, unempathetic sociopath who kills everyone he meets at the slightest provocation."" Producer: ""Sounds intriguing! Then what?"" Pitch-person (looking at his watch and darting toward the door): ""Oh, shoot. I have to go floss my cat's toes. But don't worry, I'm sure we'll figure out the plot as we go!""I saw this movie with my wife and our two teenage boys. We all love the kind of movie we thought this was going to be. We all left the theatre, compared notes, and we all emphatically agreed that we should have walked out after the first five minutes. The upshot: This is not the movie you think it's going to be, and, as a fan of either the superhero or horror genre, you deserve much, much better.",Brightburn

587,samwillpearce,Exactly what you'd expect from evil superman,5,14 June 2019,"""What if Superman chose to use his powers for evil instead of good?"" It's a concept so simple it's surprising it hasn't been picked up by filmmakers before now-and it's an extremely fascinating concept at that. But, sadly, instead of being anything meaningful, Brightburn opts to be a surprisingly unoriginal horror flick that barely explores its potentially engrossing concept.I was honestly super excited to see this movie. I figured it would be very centered on the internal good vs. evil conflict within Brandon (aka Brightburn aka evil Superman), and focus on some really interesting nature vs. nurture themes. Sadly, audiences were treated to neither; Brandon begins the film as a good (albeit weird) kid, and then overnight becomes evil. That's it. No internal conflict. No interesting character development. One minute he's good, and the next he's bad. The movie also establishes several other plot points that could have improved the movie, but infuriatingly have no payoff by the end; for example the implication that there may be an impending invasion by Brandon's people upon Earth, or his disturbing relationship with his classmate Caitlyn, or Brandon's apparent supergenius status. The filmmakers could have taken dozens of routes to make this movie something unique, but it ends up being strangely paint-by-numbers-and utterly devoid of meaning on top of that.However, sometimes an unoriginal feeling movie can be saved by solid acting, characters, and dialogue-yet Brightburn has none of the above. The acting is far from terrible, but it's not overly compelling either, though this may have more to do with the flat and archetypal characters than the actors' abilities. Most disappointing is Brandon's character; as I mentioned before, he really seems to have no concrete motivation for anything, and he's not even a very hateable villain, as it feels like most of his actions aren't really his fault. The mother and father have potential to be interesting characters, but they ultimately feel like exactly what you expect from parents in ""creepy kid"" horror movies: the father is mean, overly-emotional, and suspicious of his evil child from the beginning, while the mother blindly believes in the goodness of her child (until it's too late). The audience really wants to feel for these characters, but we simply can't bring ourselves to.I know, however, that you don't really go to a horror movie for characters and compelling conflict, you usually go for the scares-yet Brightburn isn't even all that scary. Many of the scare tactics are nothing new-flickering lights, creepy whistling, kids drawing creepy stuff, the killer moving inhumanly fast, etc.- and anyone who has watched basically any horror movie before will probably be left thinking, ""I feel like I've seen this before."" And, honestly, you probably have.The movie isn't all bad, though. It's memorably atmospheric and gory; there are a few pretty creative kills due to the superpowered killer. There are some genuinely bone chilling moments, notably the opening scene involving home footage of baby Brandon, which is so effective and scary because you know he will be murdering people by the time the movie's over. And, most hauntingly, Brandon's killer mask coupled with his red eyes are freaking TERRIFYING; the production team was reportedly going for a potentially iconic slasher mask that will be in your nightmares for weeks, and in my opinion they definitely succeeded.Ultimately, however, it feels like this movie is pretty standard horror fare, and chock-full of wasted potential. If they make a Brightburn sequel which examines some more interesting themes and ideas (and is a lot scarier), this movie would be much more enjoyable and it would feel justified. But for now, as a standalone movie and a horror movie, it falls pretty darn flat.",Brightburn

590,FreedomWatchTower,BB: Son of not so Darkness (a Short Review),4,3 February 2020,"When I first heard of its premise I thought it was intriguing, especially in the Age Of Comic book Movies. A couple of months later I saw the Trailer for the first time on a Big Screen, I was visiting a Cinema.First I thought it was some Marvel stuff, which was the intent, and then it seemed like those lame pseudo horror Conjuring/Insidious JumpScare festivals... In short I thought, nice idea but bad execution.Roughly 6 months later I bought it on Blu Raz and was really underwhelmed by what I just witnessed. I read a lot of people say that the film is too short, I agree in theory, but the main problem is the script itself.
The Film only hints at all the lore we became numb to (origins stories) but instead of capitalising on it it rushes through everything and even leaving out one main important thing: exposition, more time with all the main characters and even more mysterious mumbo jumbo (which we see like 2 times only, I'm not saying explain everything, but give us just more).I could go on and on but I'll keep it short, besides Violence and uncreative l'âme boring shots, the film doesnt take enough risks to justify its existence, in the end its just like the worst kind of Slasher (watch Friday the 13th Part III instead). To be more precise, the film feels like some Slasher fan boys tryd to make an anti hero film for YouTube, which would have been dope if it actually was the case, but the problem is that it is not the case, it is a Film which cost lots of dough (not enough for what it aimed for).If you want to watch an anti hero Film just watch Watchmen in its Ultimate Cut, Logan or even better Chronicle (which is exactly what this picture aimed for but failed).",Brightburn

I'll be honest, not a film I'd watch again. But worth a watch regardless.Spoiler part: finding a non-westernised, non-feelgood ending kind of redeemed the film for me. There was a point with the mother where I rolled my eyes; it would have been too easy. The closing credit footage was interesting.

599,ImBoredSoIReviewMovies,Wasted Potential,5,14 June 2019,"A superhero movie but for bad guys in itself is a premise surely worthy of praise of itself. Brightburn has the very essence of a good movie from the get go. It's original, it's unique, and has a chance to be powerful,but this movie for me fails to live up to the expectations. Don't get me wrong it is a good movie and hits all the marks, but it falls short of being excellent. For one, the script makes no sense and the flow just feels forced. An example is how they chose to write the main character. When he develops his super powers and starts killing people we don't know how much he changed. Did he love his parents? How much did his childhood affect him? The story was so rushed that it felt hard for me to sympathise and relate to the main character that when when he inevitably transforms into a monster it had virtually no impact on me.Another thing worth complaining about is how stupid the main character is. When he starts his killing spree so to speak he leaves this symbol as a sign that he was there, but the impact of that is lost when his actions don't make the slightest sense. If he wanted everyone to know he was killing them, why go through the trouble of killing them via horror movie style? Was there a reason for that? If there was then its very poorly explained why. Also that's another thing, the horror aspect was so cliche that I rolled my eyes everytime the camera looked at something and when the characters looked away and back again he was already near them. If the horror was better delivered and explained perhaps I would enjoy this movie more,then again I'm sure nothing could have saved the clunky script either.To its credit though I think the film was shot properly. It wasn't bad or bland or anything but it wasn't great either, they just didn't really seem to elevate it to me. The actors did a great job with the material they were given, and the over all theme of the movie can be felt throughout, but to me it still failed to deliver on its supposedly great premise.

Those two factors alone make it a must watch movie for the modern audience but the actor who played the kid absolutely nailed the role. Lets be fair most child actors are nauseating (war of the worlds, the day the earth stood still etc) but this chap is superb as the villain without remorse. I've seen lots of reviews on here marking this film down for lacking backstory of how he turned evil. In my opinion this is to completely misunderstand the premise. An omnipotent being (superman, man of steel, call him what you will) without empathy or feeling was guaranteed to be as we see him evil. He is superior. Good or evil doesn't really come into it.

And the plot is just uninteresting, it keeps crawling ahead with great predictability, there's nothing to really surprise us as long as we are aware of the premise of the movie; this may have worked as a genesis story for a well-known and interesting character, but as the first entry to the series it falls flat and I can't even figure out who the main character is, since we're seeing multiple first person perspectives but none sticks.Acting is pretty good, with the exception of the kid who is never believable as either of his personalities, but it is squandered by the story and the lack of cohesion in perspective.Just read the plot synopsis instead if you're curious, the movie brings little else except gratuitous gore.",Brightburn

619,Nitro85,"Deep character development, creative new story.... nah, just kidding",4,6 February 2020,"My expectations were pretty high, but i got dissapointed horribly. Theres so much you could do with this story, but nothing of interest was actually done.
Three major things were missing to make this movie watchable and good.
First: An antagonist
Second: Chracter development
Third: A backstoryThe backstory can easily be explained in one sentence, alien baby lands on earth, gets older, hears voices presumably from his alien race that come out of his ship, than turns evil for no good reason whatsoever. Where does he come from? Why does he got superpowers? Whats his reason to turn evil? Nothing is explained and not even hints on whats going on.The character development is so flat and dumb, it almost hurts. So he finds out about his superpowers and hears a voice that tells him to take earth and thats it, he turns evil cause... reasons. No struggeling with his human upbringing and his conscience, nothing. He just decides to be evil now and kill everybody, thats so flat and uninspired. The movie shows definately that he has some kind of human feelings, he feels bad and insecure cause he gets bullied, he falls in love with a girl and even tries to be some kind of romantic. But than he just starts killing people and doesnt have any problems with that at all. His character develops from a kid that struggles a bit with growing up and managing difficult situations, like first signs of puberty, to a dull and stupid robot without any feelings that just wants to kill everybody cause they're weaker. Thats really flat and stupid and not a single percent what anybody should have expected of that movie.And last but not least, the antagonist is missing. Yeah i know, thats a point where oppinions split, cause maybe in the sequel we will see something like an antagonist, maybe a second alien kid, maybe the military finds out about the spaceship thats made of a material that could hurt/kill him (His personal Kryptonite, sounds familiar somehow?). Im not a movie director, but that could have been solved with a 5 second scene, his spaceship was blinking red when telling him to take earth and turn evil, to show evilness they turned the ships lights red, cause red = evil. How about showing a 5 second scene at the end with a spaceship that lays around somewhere blinking blue? Cause blue = good.
That would leave viewers interested and would indicate an antagonist will show up in the second movie.Now, the end is just stupid, they show him starting to destroy the city, we all have imagined what would happen if superman got bad, answer is simple, he destroys everything and moves on to the next planet or he makes humans his slaves, end of the story... conclusion: boooooring....
No antagonist, no reason to continue the story, thats my oppinion.
Every good superhero has a villian antagonist, or they wouldnt be needed and just be normal people working in the tax office and having superpowers they dont use cause they dont need them. How exciting would that be???
So why does that bad superhuman boy doesnt have an antagonist? Cause i explained above how the story would end and that leaves no tension whatsoever for a sequel and what would happen in it. No tension = no reason to watch the sequel, its that easy. No cliffhanger = no interest.Could really have been a good movie, but its just flat and the story is written badly and uninspired, no creativity at all.
Acting was solid and the special effects were halfway decent, so no complains about that. But for the lack of creativity just 4/10",Brightburn

624,tyrexden,Surprised by the mediocre ratings (minor spoilers),10,13 August 2019,"I thought this film was absolutely terrific. Excellent cast, with excellent performances.... And the leads all had compelling conflicts. For a sci-fi movie, i felt the characterizations and motivations were excellent. You could 'believe' why this person was acting this way or doing this... Their reactions were based on reality., even though the story was 'out of this world'.I honestly thought this film would have universal appeal. I'm guessing perhaps people were disappointed that we don't actually see the kid take over the world (except sort of in the end credits). But heck, this is a 6 million dollar movie... I felt the production value was great. But you're not going to have enough money to show the destruction of the planet, and this wasn't that story, anyway... This was the story of the kid and his family, and the initial discovery of his powers. There's plenty to show of the apocalypse in the teased sequels.People say this is a one-time see, but i disagree there too. Lots of little foreshadowing and depictions and set elements and shots that won't have context until you know what eventually happens.This movie made some money, and it deserved to, but it definitely under-performed. I don't think it was marketed very well, but it would be difficult to market this particular storyline. What makes it great are the emotions, but you can't really portray human emotion and motivation in a movie trailer.I loved the interaction of the mom and kid, but my favorite part of the film was the dad taking the kid hunting (the 2nd time). It was such an ominous sequence of scenes with the music and the staging... really well done. The father / son relationship was really intriguing because the dad was willing to see through the kid's bs while the mother was not. If they do followup to this flick you'll have a lotta folks who missed the boat on this one, going back to check it out. I hope they do.",Brightburn

627,matdog321,"Don't go in expecting ""Superman as Horror,"" think more ""Orphan With Super Powers""",7,25 May 2019,"I just got home from the movie, and I decided to write a review based solely on how satisfied I found myself with the movie. It rarely happens that I am pleased with a slasher-type horror: pacing can be off, characters can be unlikable, and the kills are off-screen or boring. I think Brightburn hit the mark on all 3 of these things. They even have infamous tropes from horror movie cliches, but it works because of this unique spin on them.I say that this movie is more like Orphan because while it is heavily focused on the ""What If"" situation of Superman becoming bad, it follows the familiar formula of a psychological thriller with a killer kid. Having said that, that is not necessarily a bad thing when you add superpowers to the mix, instead, you walk away with something fresh and fun. I'm not even the biggest fan of superhero films, the horror aspect was what got me to buy a ticket, and I have to say even the origin of Brandon Breyers was impressive.I have always been a fan of Elizabeth Banks, but I think she is especially likable in this film as the mother who doesn't want to believe that her son is actually evil. You feel that she is clinging onto anything to believe her son still has good in him and feel for her character. The father is also empathetic but I didn't think he stood out as much as Banks. The kid playing Brandon was also just okay, but I have to say the way they shot him staring at people from far away was very effective and creepy.Overall, I was very pleased with this film because I treated it like a low budget slasher flick, I didn't watch any of the commercials so I didn't really know what I was getting into besides the basic plot premise, and I wasn't let down. And I am so glad they take advantage of the R rating, I missed a good amount of gore being sprinkled throughout Hollywood horror. I would say don't expect anything game changing, this is simply a unique spin on a by-th- numbers killer kid thriller.",Brightburn
628,pwbeatty,Good Idea that isn't explored properly.,6,15 August 2020,"Brightburn is directed by David Yarovesky produced by James Gunn and is an unofficial ""Superman origin story"" but with a horror twist. In a small Kansas farm-town, wife and husband Tori and Kyle Breyer (played by Elizabeth Banks and David Denman) are trying to have a kid, when a small spacecraft crash lands near them carrying a baby. As the child, named Brandon (played by Jackson A. Dunn) grows up he soon realizes where he came from, and as his powers grow so does Brandons thirst for revenge takes over in this unofficial else-world story that while delivering on what the trailer promises, doesn't do much to expand on either the superhero or the horror genre.Firstly, I really enjoyed the concept this film presents in an evil Superman, and with an ""R"" rating, they make some good use of the Superman tropes you've seen, but with the realistic violence and gore that would actually happen if a boy with lasers coming from his eyes could do to someone. The gore and violence doesn't bombard the film, but does leave some pretty horrific imagery that is sure to satisfy the horror fans.Also the acting from all of the main characters was very good, I believed the actor playing Brandon and he really was able to naturally turn to just an evil remorseless kid that ALSO has these superpowers really well for me.Where the film kind of plateaus for me is after they've introduced the story and you get into the horror beats, it all seems very repetitive. The setups to the scares are used so often that they lost all suspense for me. For a film that has such a unique concept, you would expect them to really play with that idea but it feels more like they just wanted to tell a pretty simple by the books horror story, and decided ""hey, superheros are hot, lets plug one in"" but just used all the work from Superman to build their own Superhero. Shoot, even the marketing uses the same exact font style as 'Man of Steel'.Overall if you saw the trailers for 'Brightburn' and liked what you saw, you are going to have a great time in the theaters watching this, for me it was a little bit of a letdown just because of the direction both the horror genre and the superhero genre are evolving, this seems to be a by the numbers film.",Brightburn

637,kaydentullett,"Brightburn - Predictable, impudent characters, but has an interesting story",6,4 October 2019,"Already judging by the current ratings, I wasn't expecting much from Brightburn, and I guess I was right not to. Bluntly, the characters in this film are what you can expect from the typical white characters of a horror movie (not a racial attack, just a common tradition when it comes to such characters). The mother in this film is irresponsible and constantly in denial, so if you're afflicted by such personalities, you're going to have a hard time watching; something I had to unfortunately endure with many others who rates this a 6.The additional characters are bearable to tag along with. However, concerning acting, I wouldn't say these actors and actresses would do too well in a large scale action adventure. Maybe I'm jumping to conclusions, maybe I'm right but just haven't fallen into the tacky net of having to watch these actors fail.The ending, which I will not spoil - I thought was compelling. It was predictable, like much of the sequences of this film, but it was exactly the ending I would expect in credit to the circumstances that lead up to it during the extent of this lengthy and arguable film.

If it was well written then it would definitely be a blockbuster franchise in Hollywood without any doubt. The scenes might look dragged or boring but the little writing works here & there especially action scenes & brutal kills are the intresting part here. I love the ending tbh. I didn't expect it could end like that. But yeah, I can see why the makers had done that. I really wanted to people support even though the movie is average. Cause I can where they're going.

The couple should have adopted a kid instead they take in a alien from outer space. The dad sees what he can do, yet he decides he's going to shoot him in the head. What kind of plot is that.

Save your money and just go watch something name-brand, I promise literally any iteration of Superman is better than this.I really wanted to like this movie. It was off to a quick start, but sadly. That isn't always a good thing. There are seemingly no segway between scenes in the opening act, all the scenes just seem random and pieced together. I'm not sure if there were scenes that got cut or what, but there's practically no depth. The lack of depth extends from the scenes to the characters. I don't ever see the motive behind his anger. He's just a psychopath kid that wants to kill anyone that tells him no ""yawn"". This movie is incredibly boring and for a 7 million dollar budget, it really should not be this way.For a movie that sells itself as ""if Superman wasn't a good guy"" there's also literally no buildup to the kid being normal to figuring out his abilities. He puts his hand in a lawnmower and next thing you know he's using his laser vision to slice through doors. I guess invulnerability and laser vision go hand in hand? I'm not saying he's kryptonian, but I can't imagine these are the kinda things one would pick up overnight, the kid didn't exactly sell himself as a genius.His parents act completely clueless halfway through the movie. Talking about him when he's literally in the next room (guess he doesn't have super hearing, how convenient). Still pretending he's a child when they've seen the things he can do.It's like they wrote this movie to suit a bad plot and not minds or hearts.

James Gunn, acclaimed director of The Guardians of The Galaxy films is announced to direct a reboot of Suicide Squad, after Disney (foolishly) fires him over decade-old tweets he rebuked and apologized for numerously. Many DC fans were unsure what to make of the news - a bizarre blend of happy knowing he already showed aptitude catapulting complete-unknown characters to Hollywood-stardom and thus should have no trouble given already-iconic villains of Batman-lore, and anxious not wanting the often-goofy MCU humor/tone to pervade the more-adult & happily-darker DCU. Those fears were extinguished the second I saw the Brightburn trailer instantly working its way to the top of my must-sees for 2019, and CLC being invited to see the film early before its release to the general public this Memorial Day - thanks Sony! Doing the unconscionable: taking the symbol of hope, epitomization of truth/justice/American way - and making him a serial killer in a dark hard-R-hitting horror film, James Gunn's visionary horror-take on Superman weaves a masterful subversion of everything we previously knew with a child-bullying/outcast narrative, pitch-black tone, small town Kansas feel, brutal scares with stylistic slasher flair, and twisted coming-of-age thematics.The subversion of Superman lore and ultra-dark tone. I cannot describe how ballsy, yet absolutely brilliant it is to show a different trajectory of the Man of Steel's pop culture-ubiquitous backstory. James Gunn is clearly the mastermind here, being a happily-testified superhero fanatic who obviously did his homework and studied every fiber of the first-ever superhero's being and adapatations. Everything on Superman's beginnings checklist is crossed off, and even feels classically-light and hopeful both in tone and piano-airy scoring early on - with sweet sentimental found-footage vignettes juxtaposing sugary family postcard pictures before the escalation of something sinister begins to take shape. Weaving in Easter Eggs from comics and past films like Superman 1978, Returns, and Snyder's 2013 MOS any mega-fan will instantly spot and absolutely adore seeing them reimagined in such clever subversive ways - complete with perfect locational settings in an intimate small-town Kansas feel and even twisting of the shape of the iconic S into a BB - it looks and reads just like a Superman movie until things take the darkest turn you could possibly imagine.The brutal scares with slasher/stylistic flair. This is what skyrockets the film into masterpiece territory. As the film escalates in old-fashioned, Hitchcock-ian suspense building thoroughly refreshing amidst all the stale tenth-sequel crackers the genre throws at us, the horror sequences get wilder too. Boasting some of the most downright-sadistic and humanity-deprived scares I've ever seen in a horror film, Brightburn fully capitalizes on its immense potential to be the ultimate slasher movie with an unstoppable, God-like slasher - complete with fear-evoking mask and theatrical costume. My favorites being the diner/steel safe twist, plane crash, laser eyes, and ending sky-drop, it is absolutely sensational how Gunn flips these iconic Superman sequences straight out the film history books into their antimatter forms - with the same being responsible for them going fro savior protecting those involved to the one responsible for their demise. Gunn comes up with a few inventive stylistically-impressive sequences of his own too - like the laptop music cycling, eye-shard (my word that was hard to stomach), car-lifting and jaw-breaking (again, my word that was dark), and ending naysayer-dissection ironically opposing the film's opening Biology class sequence. It even works in some psychological torment too, like the incredibly demonic dream vision towards the film's end. Atmospherically chilling.The twisted coming-of-age thematics with a child-bullying/outcast narrative. Amidst all this stomach-churning horror is dazzling emotional and psychological levity by way of the childhood-themes it chooses to tackle. Spurring this U-turn in trajectory previously prophesized to Jesus-savior but now Devil-like is a reflection on the impacts of bullying on children already prone to outcast-ish or misfit upbringings. Brandon starts out as a seemingly-perfectly normal 12-year old kid: going to school, respecting his elders, having crushes, and being a normal active member of the community. Despite the locked-up remnants of his ship from Krypton seemingly calling out to him for its negative conquest-ic ambitions, he is equally steered to evil by the trauma he faces - including the ultra-traumatizing revelation we knew all along but that pushes him over the edge breaking his psyche: that his whole life was a lie, a fabricated ruse to make him think he's human for the selfish desires of his parents. The hard-right the story takes wherein he realizes he's special and superior but fits it into a preconceived perception of reality that people are bad and deserve to die is simply genius screenwriting and a branched possibility of how young-Supes might take that reality-distorting of news I hadn't even considered or thought of as a mega-fan - hats off to Gunn and the crew for existentially dissertating to this level.The pacing, length, cinematography, and cast. Brightburn's pacing is just as swift and nimble as the faster-than-a-speeding-bullet subject it takes on, with a tour-de-force story told skillfully in an unbelievable 1 hour 30 min runtime. Showcasing yet again that films with even this massive a subject and lore can be handled artfully without turning into 3-hour overkills with the right surgical team behind the camera, Gunn's work deserves notice by Hollywood. The cinematography is also of note - with imaginative shot constructions and stylistic flair in (often-tilting) motifs we're presented with effectively-chilling color gratings. The cast is also perfect from Jackson A. Dunn's show-stealing dark-tripped child-Supes giving one of the most serial-killer-looking, ruthless, and duality-doubling portrayals I've seen in many-a-child actor performance, all the way to his loving parents caringly infused with life by David Denman of The Office fame and the sublime Elizabeth Banks of Hunger Games/Raimi Spider-Man/Emmy-nom'd 30 Rock you have to feel immensely sorry for being put in that difficult a parental situation wrestling with the idea your child you love so much could also be a monster lying to your face while wreaking sadistic villainy behind your back. Finally, that post-credits I'm all out of superlatives to praise teasing the potential of a possible twisted-Justice League shared universe just like (and potentially led by) Brandon?! SIGN. ME. UP.The only (inconsequential) gripes and nits I have to pick are I wish Brandon's mask was a little better, and the bully-escalation was slightly more pronounced. While his ensemble is mostly great-looking as a whole and I agree with the mask concept being a clear reference/homage to slasher flicks and highlighting his demonic glowing red eyes, his mask looks a little too much like Scarecrow's from Nolan's Batman Begins (which wasn't great to begin with in contrast to the legendary trilogy as one of BB's only conceivable flaws that at least had fear gas to spruce up) and could've been far better designed. Also, while the psycho-deterioration of bullying was definitely there and the idea sensical being something many criminals and wrongdoers cite as a major obstruction in their healthy development, it could have been more elaborated upon and nuanced to push him over the edge faster and more cleanly.Overall, Brightburn is an avant-garde masterwork possibly creating a new genre and now holding the spot of my pick for Top Film of 2019 (so far). A visionary horror-take on Superman, James Gunn weaves a masterful subversion of the icon of Hope's lore doing the unconscionable: making him an Angel of Death, with a child-bullying/outcast narrative, hard-R tone, authentic small-town Kansas feel with intimate scaling, brutal scares with stylistic slasher flair, inventive cinematography & shot construction/composition, and twisted coming-of-age thematics for a tour-de-force antithesis of Superman movies and everything we thought the (now-stale-getting) superhero genre can be.

671,mattmaemic,"Close, but no cigar",7,13 June 2020,"As a longtime fan of the Man of Steel, no one was more hype for this movie. The trailers basically said ""what if Clark Kent was bullied and didn't have the patience of a saint?""
A long running notion in the cultural sphere that's critically misinformed is that Superman is indestructible, only stops bank robbers with tommy guns that have no hope of hurting him and can die from spying Kryptonite from three galaxies away. Anyone who has ever even glanced at a graphic novel, or other Superman media, will know this isn't true, but this movie was a chance to overcome those ideas.
It didn't.
If anything, it leant into them.
Yet, it wasn't a bad time.
Brandon is a kid who puts together a costume, identity and logo offscreen, and seemingly from simply being told he wasn't allowed to keep an air rifle he was gifted. Simple motivation, but horrifically flawed.
The focus of this movie was on the perversion of iconic Superman panels, but it does this remarkably well.
As others have said, it all happens at an insane pace. It'd benefit greatly from a few explanation scenes, scenes of Brandon processing information about himself or others, or a proper epilogue.",Brightburn

However, the plot was the same thing over and over again. Several signs from this little boy that he's very strange and dangerous. Then something happens and you think the movie will get better from there. Nope. After that change in momentum it plateaus again into a disappointing loop of this strange little boy doing terrible things to the people around him.

683,sara_shaw,Dark and Dangerous and the Critics Whiffed,7,29 May 2019,"""Brightburn"" is an old-school pre-Guardians troma-ish style James Gunn horror movie (although he didn't direct this one). Think ""Slither"" and ""Super"" but pitch-darker and coal-eyed and slightly, mysteriously inaccessible. There's very much an indie feel here, and as such, a very efficient use of resources: excellent production value on a blumhouse level budget, smart and visceral direction that doesn't forsake the character interaction, timely use of extreme gore in the right places to maximize the supervillain threat-level, filmic and gloomy late 70's John Carpenter style cinemtography, and a solid screenplay that deftly toes the line between a super-slasher horror and pointed social commentary.Recommended for horror fans who like good old-fashioned hard-R gore, but also someone who's more inclined to indie horror, but might take a flyer on a more mainstream offering. If you come into this one with an open mind, not expecting it to be anything in particular, I think you will come away pleasantly surprised by the level of craft on display.",Brightburn

Very nice effects and use of dark cinematography shadows and light. This is not a feel good movie and best to enjoy when knowing as little as possible about the storyline. The one thing that could have been better was the ending (scene about the future).",Brightburn
685,darksketcher,Superman meets Dragonball Z,8,31 December 2019,"So after reading some critical comments about this movie I wanted to give this movie some justice. Yes, it's basically a story ""what if Superman was bad instead of good"" but wait a minute; that's already been done with Zod (if you're a fan of Superman, you would understand that reference otherwise just see Man of Steel). This story is more like ""what if someone from Planet Krypton sent a child to take over earth?"" much like Goku in Dragonball Z (Goku, a saiyan, was sent to earth to take it over. The ship Goku landed in was transmitting a message to him, telling him his mission) much like in this movie. Which I enjoyed about this movie. It was more about the mission than duty or morals; unlike Superman. Now with the cons: the lead actress's acting was stale and very unbelievable. Her dialogues were more leading to the thoughts of delusion rather than common sense; especially after seeing her alien son fling her husband into the wall where as the husband's acting was on point and made a lot of sense. There was no happy ending which was a nice change of pace. But the movie did feel rushed a bit but it made sense and perfect screen time. The story was told effectively, it made sense why things turn out the way they did, and I'm glad they didn't waste time explaining or having the child discover his powers.",Brightburn
686,bradleysteele98,SUPERMAN GONE WRONG,8,26 June 2019,"Brightburn is totally unique, unexpected and scary! Children... in horror films are terrifying. What I loved about this film is that a lot of it was unexpected compared to your usual horror film that will have a happy ending in some way or another. This one.... not so much.

I did not like the reaction of Uncle Noah when he was...""pushed around"", it seemed totally unrealistic to me. I also did not like how the father reached his conclusions about their child.

one thing that disappointed me is that this isn't a deconstructed story about the character of Brandon (Superman), I mean it is about a character but there isn't a big story, it's just another slasher movie, I mean at first they did start it well and they told a small story that they could have made it a lot bigger and a lot better. but they didn't really give a good motive to the Superman-like character.So in conclusion, if you are looking for a fun gory and very creepy adventure then you should watch this movie!

""What if Superman, but evil?"" is a stock plot of multiple comics. The film, bears more than a little resemblance to the comic series ""Irredeemable"" with the main difference that the evil Superman analogue in ""Brightburn"" breaks bad during his youth in Kansas.As horror movies go this film, is pretty good exploration of the horror inherent of someone with Superman's powers but without his moral compass. However, I do wish the movie spent more time with setting up the characters turn to evil rather than blaming it on puberty. Also kind of wish that there were more comic book movie tropes used in the film. How cool would it have been to see a scary spin on the ""designing the costume scene"" or ""picking a name"" scene that appears in most comic book movies. The closest the movie comes is in a scene that plays during the credits which definitely made me interested in any potential sequels.",Brightburn

710,udjbgs,I liked it,9,27 August 2019,First off it's a horror film. I generally rate a good horror film over 6. The idea has been in all of our heads what it would be like to have superman's power. This movie is a parody of superman. Only he's not Clark Kent. I would focus completely on the horror side of this movie if you want to love it.

712,DrVankman,The biggest disappointment of last 30 years,1,3 September 2019,"The movie was made for DC fans, although it can upset them more. It has a broken plot, no exposure, no disclosure of heroes. Evil Superman. Does everyone remember the development of Clark Kent? So here we have a crash course. Details and formalities all omitted. For waht? If everyone read and (or) watched Superman, then this will not surprise you.
The plot seems torn, as if large pieces were cut out during installation. A young man is faced with the usual problems of adolescents. The film makes a bias on humiliation and ridicule by peers, misunderstanding on the part of parents. The situation is really sad and you understand how this can end. All expectations were only for one moment, but the prerequisites must be presented. A guy's awareness of his abilities comes suddenly, although I wonder how he could not reveal anything in himself until he was 12 years old. The intrigue begins to slowly arise. You are annoyed by a teenager, but it's interesting to see his actions.
Horror attack. At the beginning of the film, the horror atmosphere was still vaguely reminiscent of itself, but over time it was replaced by screamers and clichés: mirror reflections, an escalation of fear, music, a game with lighting. The adult rating spurred excitement, allowing you to at least somehow not get bored. The more surrounding characters, the more tragic for them the approximation of the final promises, and he, by the way, alludes to a sequel.
In fact, the idea is good, but the creators did not pay attention to the background and atmosphere. It is evident that they were impatient to go to the action. There is no explanation why the little boy started his Massacre. No, well, that is, for me personally the explanation in kind - ""she called me a bad word"" or ""the voices in my head told me to make it"" seems to me a little absurd. After all, there are a lot of interesting moments how it could be beaten (Red kryptonite, or the wrong education of a little boy), and even if he fell into the ""Red Union"" it would be much more harmonious than this whole with ""I'm special, so I will take over the world"". If I didn't know the whole story of Marvel, I would have thought that Director purposely leaked such an ""amazing"" idea to the detriment of DC. But alas, oh, probably every director or producer has his own mistakes. Of course, this is not a full-fledged movie of superheroics and probably should be considered as a horror film, although there were only a couple of scary moments for the entire film. In general, I don't want to name this film and generally want to forget about it, like a nightmare...
However, there is a bit of logic and approximation to reality here. Imagine a person, who will gain abilities. Will he be on guard to do good? Not. He will live for his pleasure, transgress the law and hang the label of the villain. And the 12-year-old fool in this period is even more likely to do things. So this is a kind of answer to the question: what if...?
Of course, if you are a fan of DC comics and in particular the character ""Superman"" I don't advise you to watch it, you will spend your time and most importantly you will not get any emotions at all from watching, most likely just disappointment. And horror fans feel free to pass by, because there is nothing scary in this film.",Brightburn

735,piperjake,Massive potential but poorly executed,5,3 July 2020,"Conceived as a 'what if?' type of movie, David Yarovesky's Brightburn tells the tale of, effectively, anti-Superman. In fact, the similarities between the two stories are so conspicuous and on the nose that I'm convinced DC are getting a percentage cut of this film. Alas, there are a few differences.Brightburn acts as more of a horror movie than anything else, and unfortunately plays along with all the tropes - empty swings in the breeze, rocking chairs, faces appearing in washing lines, false or delayed jumpscares, a secret room that no one can go in or 'bad things will happen' - I could go on. It's such a shame, because what a great premise for a horror film? Massive potential, and yet it reduces itself to a disposable jumpscare horror flick.Aside from the jumpscare-a-minute, Jackson A. Dunn is good in the role of Brendan Breyer. A bad child actor can really ruin a great film, however he is good in the disinterested teenager role, and suitably creepy when he needs to be.The cinematography is one thing that is close to faultless in the film, and it's obvious that some serious thought has been put into it. Smart one-shots create a real sense of tension in scenes where other directors might have gone for some quick cuts. I also love the fact that we seldom see Brightburn close up, and he is often very far away from the camera and high up in the air - for me, this heightened the sense of paranoia attached to his appearance as well as making the villain out to be a true deity-like supernatural figure.The main problem I have with the film is that it moves far too quickly. We all know the kid is going to be evil, but I would have liked to see this transformation played out. I couldn't believe the film had finished when the credits rolled - I had to pause to check how long I'd watched and it'd only been about 1 hour and 20 minutes. Scenes with tension were done well, the only problem being that every other scene is a tension scene, reducing the impact of the previous one each time. These scenes could have been filled with character development with Brendan, exploring more as he begins to question his purpose.The film could have done with being a good half hour longer, with more emphasis on the transformation and reasoning for Brendan's switch to 'the dark side'. From the film I watched, his initial instinct to go bad was because...he didn't get a gun for his birthday? Or because he's going through puberty? Or because his class crush doesn't like him back? Unfortunately, these are real factors from the film...It gets slightly more interesting towards the end, but ultimately it is irredeemable by this point. And the choice of Bad Guy by Billie Eilish as credits music? You can tell James Gunn is involved. I am a huge fan of Billie Eilish, but even I groaned.A great idea for a film with kilograms of potential, that falls flat on its own premise.Disposable horror film.",Brightburn

742,aka_tourette,"A good idea wasted on bad pacing, bad cinematography and just bad writing altogether",1,22 June 2019,"I think they don't know how to make movies anymore. They appear to not understand the fundamentals of telling a story. You can see it everywhere, from GOT to Star Wars The Farce Force. The premises don't match the conclusion. The causality is forced. Everything feels unnatural, incomplete and altogether unsatisfying. The characters are superficially developed, the story is rushed, the relation between the characters lacks justification. Sometimes you feel these people in Hollywood have completely lost contact with reality.
I give you one simple example. Boy visits aunty in the middle of the night, says some strange things and aunty sends his back home on foot, through the darkness, in Hill Billy's land sank in pitch black darkness. HOW ABOUT GIVING HIM A RIDE HOME?! HOW ABOUT INVITING HIM IN TO HAVE A TALK, INSTEAD OF KIPPING HIM AT THE DOOR LIKE A BLOODY HOBO?!
Now, about the physical quality of the product. I know they make all these movies on digital. I know the FED destroyed the dollar and there are no more resources to make anything decent. But, goddamn, these flicks look bad. Everything is washed up. There's no contrast. There are no shadows. The image has no depth. Doesn't matter! Fill everything with some kick ass CGI and we're done. Compensate the lack of development in the story with one action sequence after another, spiced up by some gory details and sell it to the popcorn and Coca Cola vegan diet public. They swallow everything.
I give this movie 1 star just because is so clumsy made. Probably is not 1. Probably is a 4 but really it doesn't deserve any concessions made.
And, yes. They had to put some propaganda in it. There's some anti-gun small talk in there, which makes completely no sense, as the father and the son are seen later going together hunting (meaning they were very well accustomed with guns) and at the end they even introduced an Alex Jones caricature accompanying the destruction of the world, which looked so bad, I feel sorry for the actor, which is a known one, and which, in these times, apparently can get only these kind of miserable gigs.",Brightburn

751,ildudeentertainment,"Nothing New, but a Fun Concept",8,28 July 2019,"In the age of superheroes dominating the mainstream media, it was only a matter of time before we got a proper deconstruction of the genre and ""Brightburn"" (2019) seeks to do just that. The movie gives the classic Superman origin story a dark horror-filled twist and let's audience members really get to see just how scary super-powered beings could be. As a far of both genres, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It had a great cast, an interesting script, and really accomplishes its goals.
To start things off, I feel like it's necessary to address that dark take's on superheroes aren't anything that new to the fandom. DC and Marvel have been exploring their multiverses for decades each one possessing all sorts of interesting worlds and dark stories. What makes Brightburn so unique is that it brought this kind of story to the big screen for mainstream audiences to get a taste and does so incredibly well. While the movie clearly pulls from Superman mythos, it doesn't follow the Kent's or Kal-El but instead The Breyer's farm and their adopted son Brandon (who interestingly enough has an alliteration to his name much like Clark Kent of whom he's based upon). The Breyer's find the child in a crashed spaceship many years ago and begin raising him in Brightburn, Kansas as if he was their own. Things seemingly have been normal for the household until Brandon is summoned to his old ship that had been sealed away in the basement of their barn. From there on out the horror begins to kick in as he comes to terms with his origins and realizes he can have whatever he wants.
Like many modern horror movies, this one does have a pretty heavy alliance on gore, and while I would normally take issue with that I did find it worked decently well in this movie. Brandon is shown to be a cold cut psychopath that not only enjoys killing but really toying with his enemies. I found that the horror during these moments to be the best, as you know there's no way the characters can escape his wrath but you can see the fear in their eyes. The actors do an excellent job of carrying the scenes on their own and making each scene believable and eerie. Elizabeth Banks and David Denman both do a very good job leading the story, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Prior to seeing this movie, I had only seen the two actors in comedic roles, the genre switch was definitely a welcome and pleasant surprise that allowed them to show off their acting chops. The chemistry between the two actors felt genuine and you could really see each character's motives and drives throughout the duration of the movie.
Overall Brightburn isn't anything entirely new, but that doesn't mean it's bad or doesn't deserve to be shown. As I said before, I really enjoyed this both as a horror movie and a ""superhero"" movie. It had great suspense, a nice plot, and enjoy acting. I do find that the pacing was a tad off, and at times I found myself feeling as though the movie was dragging on or wasting time getting to the action but when it came, it came through big time. A little less gore wouldn't have hurt the movie either, but I do think it shows you just how brutal Superman could be had he not been a beacon of hope but instead an enforcer of fear. If it's still in theaters near you, be sure to check it out, if not rent it as soon as you can. I would rate this movie a strong 7.5/10 as it's super!",Brightburn

Suffice to say, it has a genuinely uncomfortable premise, uncompromising execution and a bone jarringly acted by Elizabeth Banks. Jackson A. Dunn is exceptional as the quiet creepy Brandon Bayer; an alien baby with similar origin to the Man of Steel with a twist.At once heartbreaking and terrifying this could be the definitive latter day horror movie monster- if it wasn't just that little bit too close to Jeeper Creepers. But, when you have a winning combination of elegance and disgust in a verbose, super-powered villain, i cant help to compare these two.David Denman totally sucks as Kyle Breyer ; and you can almost see all the cast acting their little socks off so as not to let the side down. So good, in fact, that I'm struggling to find one bad thing to say about it.I can think of no greater compliment for a truly adult horror movie.

It's rather slow paced at times, but I don't really mind that. It adds depth in my opinion, and even though I feel this should've been a TV-show where we would really get to know the characters and watch them develop better than we do in this movie, I still feel that twisting of Brandon's mind became more and more evident. When he uttered the line ""Take the world"" I felt that this is truly the nightmare version of the Superman concept and I hope we will get to see more of it. The downside of the movie is that it is too short for the pacing, since we don't really get to know the characters much at all.

It's simple a Superhero movie made different.It angers me that i wasted time on this garbage and expecting something because I've seen good reviews.Worst Movie, Go watch The Boys on Amazon if you want a (evil) Superhero content that has substance.",Brightburn
763,GeekGirlPower,So-So What-If Tale...,6,28 May 2019,"*** spoilers ahead ***I walked into this movie knowing what to expect, which was basically a reimagining of the classic Superman tale. The story idea is superb. The acting is first-rate. The tension and drama were excellent. So what destroys this film for me? If I had super powers and knew I could do all the things he can, would I really care if my aunt ratted on me to the police? I'm sorry, but this 12 year old just came across as a brat to me. I get that he feels he no longer belongs to his family or this world, but he was an ass and a creepy stalker to the only person who was on his side. I'm like ""Dude, she likes you and you blew it by crushing her hand! You jerk!"" and then he kills the girl's mother for calling him a monster, which he is, because anyone who is raised right will know that you don't go around hurting people, even those who accuse you of heinous things. His parents were nice people and very much on the good natured, emotional side, so it doesn't make sense that there wasn't more of a conflict of his good versus evil nature. Even Damian from The Omen said something about ""Why me?!!!"" but this kid is just a soulless creature, like a chihuahua that turns crazy in the final years of his or her life.Okay, so he kills the mom of his love interest for calling him a monster. He kills his aunt who is his guidance counselor and said she was just doing her job by telling the police all that she knows (not like he should care, since he likes drawing his BB symbols all over the place), he kills his uncle, the nice guy who bought him a rifle for his birthday and just wanted to do right by taking him home, he kills his dad for wanting to help him temper his anger by taking him camping, he kills the sherriffs for being threats (like they can really do anything?), and he kills his mom for trying to stab him.At this point, my jaw dropped, because the ending really bugged me. The kid kills his parents, so how could anyone who reviewed this movie expect a sequel? Why would we want to see any more of this killing nonsense? Would he be an anti-hero and fight other bad guys? Or would he fight good guys and lose because, like Superman, he can be tricked because he's kind of dumb? If DC made Superman in Man of Steel a depressed soul who helps people, shouldn't this Brightburn guy be a jovial soul who smiles a lot while killing people? (that was a joke)The clips at the end just revealed what this film is all about: tongue-in-cheek humor. It's a one-off. I can't see any more sequels of this drivel. It certainly satisfies the reimagining idea as a one-off kind of film.",Brightburn
764,TheGrippin,"It is fun, but only once",6,19 April 2020,"This is not the greatest horror movie of all time, but it's core idea is simply ingenious and refreshing. To see a child let lose of his teenage feelings and rage while having the powers of Superman is an awesome idea. The movie itself suffers from the ususal horror cliches unfortunately. Characters lie to each other for no apparent reason, and deny the signs which seal their own fates eventually as usual in movies like this. The ending is also a cliche, the villain survives and keeps tormenting people offscreen. The acting was average, maybe except for the father, who was the only one trying to make things right in this movie, so he was great. The scene where he wanted to end ""his son"" was really powerful. For us, the viewers it was obvious what would happen, but not for him. The whole scene was brave and awesome. The visual effects were good, I loved every scene where the kid was floating with glowing red eyes. The way the kid killed the Sheriff and smashed his own house were brutal, as you would expect from such superpower.In general, I think the movie is an average horror movie. It has some great ideas and scenes, but in the end it is not so special, filled with cliches and jumpscares. Not a great movie, but it is enjoyable once.",Brightburn
765,adventure7,I can take it or leave it...,5,16 May 2019,"It refreshing spin to the superhero genre, but not that refreshing i guess... It was meidocre at best. The performances of the father and the guy from Breaking Bad i found really good, the other actors were ok (there is a lot of crying without tears type of acting).
The cinematography was fine and nothing special. Some sequences were handheld and were edited and directed in a way film student would. There were barely any interesting shots.
The effects at times weren't the best, but all around it was believable.
The film wasn't scary too. Just panning or cut shot in which something apears in front of the charecter and when she/he looks away and looks back there's nothing there... there weren't that many jumpscares which is a plus i guess.
At times it was violent and i think the gore factor added to the movie and i didn't expect that at all.
There were a lot of cheesy and stupid momments in which the characters explain things to the audience, because the writers think we're stupid, but you can see some things a mile away, although i would have to say it wasn't that predictable as i thought it would be.
We're introduced to this black fat kid who bullies the main charecter and you expect they would do something with him, but they forgot he existed in the second half so his inclusion in the movie was pointless.
It was dissapointing movie, but i'll not try to stop you from watching, you may like it. I just found it boring at times and not that interesting. For a concept like that you would expect a little bit more but i look at the movie and see missed opportunity.",Brightburn

""What if superman was a bad person?"" It kind of reminds me of Injustice, but instead of Superman being grown, he's a kid. He basically has the same powers as superman, such as flight, invulnerability, super speed, strength, and the like. But instead of telling this story in a more mainstream super-hero movie like way, it is telling it like a thriller/horror film, which I found interesting. The problems I have with it are the fact that the runtime is a bit short, the kid's motivations are unclear (well, it's kind of explained, but it is very quick), and, in my opinion, the third act isn't as strong as the first two. But, overall, it is a refreshing, well made horror/thriller with some surprisingly good acting and writing. I would definitely recommend seeing it at least once.",Brightburn

I'm a bit morbid and I hate the good guys always winning - it's predictable, it's boring and it's old. There's no guessing involved. So Brightburn gave me what I wanted...An anti-hero.
It could be the first 10 years of Superman's life but reversed. He doesn't help. He kills, he maims and he terrorizes.
The film follows this simple plot with a couple of jump scares, a few great gore effects that have been missing from larger budget 'horror' movies in the last few years and that's about it. No thinking required. Just fun.
The acting is passable by all but the main character, sticks out. I found him genuinely creepy.

Superman's parents told him he was different and worked hard on him so that's he wouldn't use his powers for evil , but In this movie we see the consequences of not telling Brandon he's different.

780,ryan-88982,Not your average superhero movie,7,12 September 2019,"Brightburn really takes some risks, and I think that many of them pay off.
Good:
The boy that the movie is centered around is a really intriguing character. He makes you feel bad for him for about 30 minutes and then you realize what's actually going on. The parents are probably the best characters in the movie; they just seem very real. The story is really cool and the ending is great.
Bad:
You can tell that this movie isn't a super high budget film. The effects and the acting take away a lot for me. They make the film seem a little childish. The story moves way too fast, they could have easily squeezed at least 30 more minutes into the movie.Overall, I think this movie is worth a watch.

Also the acting was not the best but you can't do much with a script like that.However I really liked some things at the very beginning and end of the movie (the sinister undertones of the beginning, as well as the discovered corpse at the end and the POV of the mother looking into her son's eyes while being high up in the air was great).

Most of the issues I have read was that it was too gory...SERIOUSLY that's your problem?! Another was the character development and I disagree!

790,johnmk79,"A missed opportunity, bloody & flawed",5,27 October 2019,"Although this is a fantastic idea, the writing is pretty flawed, it smacks of a great idea formulated over a few years but then written over a lunchtime! It lacks real depth, its very superficial, far too gory and is rushed throughout. The 1hr 30min run time is not enough to fully tell what should be a complex, conflicted story. When given the choice of extra lens flare or extra runtime for storytelling, Director Yarovesky obviously went with the Snyderesque SPX. The main issue with the movie is it never explores Brandon's struggle with his change and basically says ""ok you're bad now, do bad stuff"". The film lacks any empathy as Brandon's feelings for his family, especially his mother would not have simply been wiped away. Here is a specific moment when a woman's opinion would've been appreciated in the writing process. Brandon should have been a conflicted alien who veered to darkness rather than the evil robot reboot we were given. While each scene has been created really well there is nothing holding each set piece together and whenever there are doubts as to what the movie is, any gaps are filled with plenty of gore to cover it up. While personally I don't have a problem with violence & gore, it should be there for good reason & herein lies the real problem in that there is no reason for Brandon to do what he's doing & no reason for the level of violence & horror we see.",Brightburn
791,pjonline66,Brightburn - The Reel Truth,6,8 March 2020,Brightburn asks the intriguing question - 'what if Superman actually turned out to be evil with desires akin to that of Damien from The Omen?' As a big fan of superhero movies I absolutely love this concept and was excited to see where they would take it. The opening of the film explicitly references Superman with a baby boy crashing to earth being raised by a farming couple. As he grows up he progressively begins to realise he is different from the others but instead of using his powers for good this film takes a dark turn as he begins to use his powers for evil deeds. His motives for turning evil are not entirely clear and the second half of the film feels more like a slasher horror movie as a result. Some of the set pieces where our villain stalks his victims effectively build tension but the pay off at the end is unsatisfying as the rationale behind these acts of atrocity are tenuous at best. With a larger budget and a more expansive storyline this film could have been a real classic as the concept is cleverly differentiated from other superhero movies but unfortunately I was left thinking about what this film 'could' have been. We only really see the impact of his evil turn on his parents but I believe it would have been far more interesting to see the impact on his friends at school or flash forward to show how he has integrated into society as an adult. Definitely worth a watch for fans of Marvel/DC and at only 90mins long this is a refreshingly succinct story that has enough interesting moments to pass the time on a lazy Sunday afternoon but it's not the cult classic this strong concept deserves,Brightburn
792,theteacher3121-228-31111,90 minutes of fun,7,12 August 2019,I hadn't high expectations for this but i was pleasantly surprised! It was 90 enjoyful minutes and most of all the film went to some new directions! I am curious to see the sequel!,Brightburn
793,askrapitsalex,Refreshing concept that ALMOST shines,6,29 May 2019,"Whenever you think of a ""superhero"", you would always classify that character as an individual with gifted, unique powers and must take responsibility on benefiting humanity whether good or bad. But...what happens if that said person didn't wanted to protect the world and instead uses his/her abilities for evil and destruction? That rhetorical question sums a brilliant concept for a superhero horror film.Keep in mind, there have been superhero movies with horror elements used. Yet, they are mostly used to establish atmosphere and action would be thrown in to let audiences who's the good or bad guy. The ""Blade"" movies are a prime example. Then, there are superhero movies that were dark on unintentional levels, such as DC's Man of Steel and Batman v. Superman.Speaking of ""Superman"", the whole set-up for this movie is like watching a horror parody of ""Superman"" except it IS intentional.A young alien boy (Jackson A. Dunn) who is raised on Earth discovers he has superpowers and begins using them to cause mayhem.With an interesting concept and James Gunn producing it, you would come in and expect something grand and an interesting study into the main character's psyche and motivation. ...Almost. The key word is ""almost"".Before I get down to the negatives, there are some positives worth mentioning about this movie.The acting is the most genuine element throughout this picture. Elizabeth Banks carries a believable performance as the titular character's loving mother who goes through a struggling arc whether to continue or end her relationship with her son. Jackson A. Dunn is surprisingly not bad. While pretending to play innocent wouldn't convince anybody, you will feel a sense of fright every time he either flies, use heat vision, super-speed, super-strength and murders anyone in his path. He is a living embodiment of scary more than an actual character. The other performances are passable, especially with Matt Jones.As a horror movie, there are nicely executed components that will keep horror movie buffs satisfied: jump scares, built-up music and tension, and death/gore scenes. With having a low-budget, the movie contains a fair amount of practical and CGI effects.However, the main issue I have with the movie is what I mentioned earlier: an interesting study into the main character's psyche and motivation. While Brightburn imposes as a threat, there isn't much more about him what the concept has promised. He seems fine for the first third of the movie. But, during the rest of the film, he acts confused, emotionless when lying easily get frustrated when committing these acts. He doesn't even justify on his actions; he does what the script says so. I understand that's the point being presented as a superhero horror movie. Yet, the story still acts vague on his motivation. Once in a while, we get hints his native alien race, like his own symbol and language. But, none of that answers HOW and WHY is he doing this. Even the movie ends on an awkward note. It would've been stronger if we had more time to know the character more.Overall, Brightburn is a superhero-horror movie with an interesting premise, solid acting and decent scares. Nonetheless, the movie provides less more than it promises. If you are a fan of Jame Gunn or yearning for a dark superhero movie that isn't Man of Steel...you'll like fine. Admittedly, despite its unintentional dark nature, Man of Steel AT LEAST provided me with enough entertainment value and a character who justify his actions.** 1/2 out of ****",Brightburn

832,ngwetzel,"Watch ""The Good Son"" instead",4,23 August 2019,"I'm pretty sure that I have never actually bothered to write a review on imdb before, but this one felt warranted.This is by no means the worst horror movie I have ever seen, but it is most definitely lacking some major qualities to make it a worthwhile film. The acting is largely passable, bordering on decent, except for the child, who is wooden throughout. As others have said, the pacing is off, lacking any interesting exposition and instead jumping from scene to scene until conclusion.There is virtually no character development of any kind. The general premise seems to be that if you are familiar with Superman, and who isn't, there is no need to explain anything further or develop any characters. Consequently, we don't care when any particular character dies, nor does there appear to be any progression for any character. It essentially feels as though a flip is switched and suddenly the nice child is evil Superman.I mention ""The Good Son"" in the review title because I believe that it shows the type of tension and progression that this movie was going for, but does not achieve. Again, this film is not awful, but it does fail to draw you in and make you care about any of the characters.The special effects are not amazing, but they are acceptable. I am not certain why others have called them cheap. I don't remember any effects that took me out of the movie.I have to echo others who have called this movie wasted potential. I have decided to not write reviews of far worse movies, but this one was disconcerting in that it felt as though it could have been a great film that just never managed to find its footing. I'm actually hoping that there is a director's cut with an additional 30 minutes of character development.",Brightburn

836,celestine1307,Dull and Generic,4,19 May 2019,"Whether you like Zack Snyder's controversial, grittier take on Superman in ""Man Of Steel"" or felt that it was a complete butchery of the character, I assure you that whatever was done in this film makes what Snyder did look great. ""Brightburn"" tells a 'what if' tale about an evil Superman, or in this case, Superboy. It is a horror take on the classic mythos with Superman now being a 12-year-old boy who turns out to be evil.On paper, that sounds amazing. A deconstruction of the iconic character that has actually worked surprisingly well in it's original medium- the comics. Furthermore, it is produced by James Gunn and written by his brothers, Brian and Mark. With Gunn being so closely attached to this project, how could it possibly fail? After all this is James Gunn we are talking about, the man who is responsible for bringing the d-list ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" to the big screen. Gunn's 2010 film, ""Super"" was also a deconstruction of the superhero genre by itself and ""Slither"" was an excellent homage to old school horror films. Looking back at his past filmography, ""Brightburn"" seems to be a sure fire culmination of them all. Unfortunately, this is not directed nor written by him.As mentioned, the script was written by his brothers, who previously worked on ""Journey 2"", the one with The Rock. Director David Yarovesky who has done nothing really notable, other than a music video for ""Guardians of the Galaxy 2"" and some horror feature no one's heard before, helms this. Boy, does it really show. For a film that aims to subvert the superhero genre or the mythos, it does nothing new. Instead, the end product is bleak and dire that even out matches the dark DC Snyder-verse, in that area. However, it is also bland and dull.For some reason, this film has no comedic elements or even fun at all. Although I appreciate it being in full horror territory, the lack of James Gunn's signature tongue in cheek tone is infuriating. It's as if ""Brightburn"" tries so hard to make fun of and criticize ""Man of Steel"" but becomes the worse version of it. There are so many elements that Yarovesky and his writers directly lift from ""Man of Steel"". Heck, even the score sounds similar to Hans Zimmer's epic. However, all these elements felt watered down and it is not way as glorious as it's predecessor.""Brightburn"" feels unusually cheap and I don't mean as a low budget film only. The script is weak and the narrative feels incomplete. Scenes felt like they have not enough shot coverage or footage available. The entire film feels too rushed as a whole. I can't believe that I missed the slower pace of ""Man of Steel"". There are also weird character decisions that don't make any sense and only seemed to be made for moving on the plot.Despite the acting being mostly competent, I could not care less about the characters. There is zero character development whatsoever, especially for the evil kid and weirdly enough, there is also no mythology fleshed out at all which leaves a ton of unanswered questions by the end. Additionally, ""Brightburn"" suffers from most of the same pitfalls of being formulaic and generic as any other modern day horror film. There is an over-reliance on jump scares and cut away from as much from the gore as possible.Overall, it is really maddening how the film never reached a bit of it's creative potential. What we have got is a bare minimum of a movie that is so subpar to even call it a deconstruction of anything. It should have been over the top, satirical or at least scary. It's funny as an over the top character, played by one of James Gunn's commonly worked with actors, showed up when the credits rolled, leaving you to realise this should have been the tone of the film.For a better deconstruction of the genre, audiences might want to watch Josh Trank's ""Chronicle"" instead. Despite my hatred of found footage, I appreciate what Trank was trying to do and it is a proper way to look at the genre differently. Or audiences can just go and watch ""Man of Steel"" again as flawed as it maybe; Snyder did fleshed out a unique perspective of the character. This on the other hand, is I quote from another reviewer, a cheap one-night-stand that takes all your money and leaves you unsatisfied.",Brightburn
837,stevencullen,Very Disappointing,5,1 September 2019,This could have been such a promising idea and one that I was excited about when I heard about it. However it seems that it was rushed and I got the feeling that there was no real effort to include any real writing or meat to the bones of the story.Best way I could explain what it's like an hour and a half trailer of all the bits they want you to see without anything in between. Scenes seem to jump quickly from one to another and the boys progression makes massive leaps from scene to scene. One second he's a normal boy and the next he's shooting lazers from his eyes and mastered the art of flying.It's a shame that this idea landed with who it did because it turned out to be nothing but an average attempt at jump scares mixed with super powers.Very disappointing.,Brightburn

At its core, the message is, ""what if Superman came to Earth but decided to destroy it instead of save it?"" As a fan of comic book and horror movies, I was intrigued to watch this, especially as it was produced by James Gunn.Ultimately, I enjoyed this movie. It was uncomfortable at times, given the fact we are watching a 12 yr old child terrorise people (in some really gnarly ways!) but that discomfort only served to ramp up the tension further, and I found myself at times genuinely made uncomfortable by some of the gruesome actions that are carried out. The film can be cheesy in places especially as it uses all of the standard horror cliches (flickering lights, jump scares, misdirection, stupid decisions made by key characters and mysteriously-murdered livestock)The film doesnt serve much as a character study, although I'm not sure anyone was expecting that really. Elizabeth Banks' mother figure unfortunately doesn't really knock the ball out of the park in terms of making smart decisions (for instance, why didn't they take him to see a specialist at the first sign of trouble?)The script and special effects were iffy at times but ultimately carried the film through and there were no real issues with pacing, although I did feel that the movie jumped in too quickly to establish that this child is evil - I prefer a slow-burning horror but that is just my personal preference.I was also pleased with the ending that was chosen. As the ending approached it was clear there were only two real options for how to conclude, and I was pleased that they chose the less-conventional conclusion, leading to a satisfying credit scene led by Billie Eilish hit ""Bad Guy"".Overall, this film was cheesy and entertaining, and I found myself pleasantly surprised, and satisfied with the movie as a whole.",Brightburn
846,hberry-51959,Left me feeling akwardly disgusted,1,20 October 2019,"Why all this violence? Why not focus on creating a better plot instead ?The boy is just plain disgusting.I get it. He is supposed to be a killer machine not a human. It totally makes sense, but it ruins the story as well.As a alian killer machine he is the quivalent of a human a psychopath. Therefore feels no remorse.
I am pretty sure if a psychopath would have his powers he would do exact those things the boy does in the movie.
A lot of reviews are complaining he dose not have any remorse or he kills for no reason. I disagree. It is all explained in the movie. It makes sense therefore.
One possitive aspect at least.The thought of something looking human but not being human is scary. Even scarier if it looks like a child and turns out to be plain evel.Nevertheless, the whole story is kind of useless. A (almost) invulnerable superhero who wants to kill humanity.
He cou erase humanity within a short time. This is his mission which he finally understands.
Why on earth is he wasting his time with his family once he understood his mission and abilities?
With these powers he would be completly fine on his own.The boy has no weakness excpet the material of what his ship is made of.
There is no character in this movie which can hold up to his power. He is so superficial to humans that it bored me to death.
The end is therefore predictable.Nice people are getting slaughtered without driving the plot any further. What person leaves this film and claps his hands?The film made me literally shake my head in disbelieve why someone would feel the urge to write such ***.They thought turning around Superman's story and make him evil and adding a lot of unnecessary and cruel scenes, would make a good movie. But that is the sad truth about Hollywood. Instead on focusing on good story plots, they tailor their stories to what they believe people would like to see.The formula behind this movie seems to be like this:
1. People are getting bored of superhero movies?
Well let's make an anti-superhero and recycle the superman story around this anti-superhero character.2. There are already plenty of bloody movies out there and showing blood is not enough to land a box office hit?
Well, let's go further. Let's show a lot of extra cruel scenes of innocent people dying and suffering. So people want realise how the movies lack of substance...That is all.

Can it control the powers?This movie also asks moral questions about the power of parenting and the influence our past heritage has on us....

857,borgiesblog,Brightburn Fails To Ignite,6,10 April 2020,"WARNING: This review contains BIG FAT SPOILERS for Brightburn (2019)This has to be one of the most disappointing films I have seen a long while. (And I watched Doom: Annihilation last week)Listen, I'm a sucker for a Superman flick. He was my favourite hero as a kid. I wore out my VHS copy rewinding the original Reeve movie. (I wore out something else too watching Helen Slater's Supergirl but that's another matter).Poor Character ArcsI am still unsure as to what the arcs of the main characters were supposed to be. It seems like it was written by multiple writers, meddled with by the studio or pulled in too many different editorial directions by dithering producers.Characters don't seem to have any describable or obvious theme, to start with.For example:What is the theme or lesson that the mother needs to learn through the movie? To stop being so desperate/clingy/cliche/hysterical/over-protective...I guess? I suppose she learns something like that at the end but honestly it's really not developed anywhere near enough to become believable and thus you end up not particularly caring when she's dropped from the moon.The kid wants to not be treated like a child. To have power. We see that in the bullying sequences (more on that below.) But the parents don't ever start treating him like an adult. There's no pay-off and Brandon doesn't learn anything. He doesn't see any errors in his ways. It's all so unsatisfying.(Oh and the father just seems to want his drunken snooker buddy back.)The biggest reason this all feels so hollow, apart from the lack of character development, is really that this whole movie is just a sequence of set pieces strung together by the flimsy bare minimum of a narrative. Storylines are set up yet fail to pay off before the end of the film.EVERYONE DISAPPEARSThe movie straight up forgets what it has set up.For example:Brandon is seen to be bullied by the black kid during the school sequences in Act 1. We see him being verbally teased and then physically assaulted. Usually this is designed to elicit sympathy from the audience. (For the 'bad guy' to get his comeuppance in the end.) The bully character completely disappears by Act 3. That storyline is literally just dropped and not addressed again. You would have thought that kid would have been his first victim he goes after when he unleashes his Give-No-Fs attitude on the world.Similarly, in Act 1 the movie is setting up themes of Id Vs. Super-Ego. I.e. he is going through puberty and he really wants the girl he's taken a liking to (Caitlyn), who suddenly made the mistake of showing him attention in class one day after he was getting bullied. His dad says no and Brandon seems to accept that maybe it's wrong to just take what he wants. He still shows up at her house though and stalks her in her bedroom. He says something along the lines 'he is special and she will know it soon' etc. He then takes out the girl's mother who tries to stop them being together, presumably so the path is clear for him to take her for his Queen, which is where this sub-plot seems to be going. Nope. This character also completely disappears from the movie by Act 3! The movie doesn't even bother to address how she responds to her mother going missing and being a 12 y/o left on her own and orphaned, despite the time the movie invests in her during the set-up.And eff knows what the hell was going on with the harvesting organs that seemed to be taking place. I can only assume the implication is that he is dissecting things to understand how they work (i.e. the mutilated chickens and Erica's body at the end). I'd like to think this is intentionally left unexplained so as not to spoon-feed the audience but honestly given the incompetence displayed throughout this film I feel that would be giving these filmmakers far too much credit!Wasted PotentialSuch as the Wasp vs Bee metaphor set-up at the beginning, which was actually rather interesting. It's the one piece of substance and depth the film has to offer. So Brandon explains that the difference between wasps and bees is that wasps are predators that have lost the ability to make hives so now trick bees into raising their young (god knows how true that is, I've never heard that before, but lol OK, film.) This is obviously supposed to have thematic resemblance to whoever sent Brandon to earth, thus a predator alien species tricking stoopid humans into raising their young which will eventually turn on them and destroy them...because...REASONS!It's an interesting idea that is not sufficiently expanded on. For example, in the 1st Act, the status-quo set-ups show Brandon is a happy healthy normal boy going about his life. Then there is an EXTERNAL activation of brainwashing that occurs when his alien ship begins to talk to him in a strange language he cannot understand and no-one else can hear.Whilst this is an interesting perversion of the Superman origin tale and a great twist on the same scenes we saw on Smallville (almost 20 years ago now guys! WTF!), the 2nd Act then starts to retcon its own fudging origin by trying to imply that the anti-social aspects of Brandon's character were actually always there to begin with and were simply amplified by this external source and/or the bullying taking place. This is likely designed to try and raise a Nature vs Nurture conflict but ultimately this just serves to muddy the waters and confuse the audience rather than spark any debate. The work hasn't been put in sufficiently through Act 1. It hasn't been effectively shown to the audience. At best it is undercooked and at worse, sheer laziness. It feels like they got bored in the writer's room and just filmed an early draft.Final ThoughtsStructural and thematic analysis aside, the movie is just vacuous and unambitious. It's framed as a horror movie and doesn't reinvent the wheel. It delivers some decent gore and a few traditional haunted house kind-of spooks and is content with that. (But seriously, why is Brandon always showing up behind the characters he's targeting in shadows and outside windows before he kills them?? He might be trying to scare them but they don't actually see any of this so what is the point exactly? It just makes the audience aware they are watching a film rather than investing in the story. Why doesn't he just get on with it and kill them? It ruins the verisimilitude of the narrative.)I don't normally say this but I think this movie should have been 30 minutes longer. The pacing is too rushed. There is no time to develop character and action sequences need to breathe. What little there is of the transformation arc in Brandon happens far too quickly and his status-quo scenes are not long enough to fully convince us of his change, especially when the catalyst for doing so is not sufficiently conveyed.So yes, like I said, this was super disappointing for me. I really wanted to like it but alas it let me down. On a side note, this movie was apparently produced by James Gunn, as the trailers kept trying to remind us. Well, it's certainly not one of his finest films. In fact, you could say it is not as super as his super film Super (2010).Which was super!",Brightburn
858,philjweight,Sub-par Reverse Superman Nonsense,3,4 April 2020,"I had high hopes of this film. Sadly it turned to be three things:1. A clunkily over-obvious attempt to do an ""anti-Superman"" story, a sort of ""If Kal-el had behavioural problems"" mirror image plot. 2.It clearly owed a great deal to the far superior ""Midnight Special"", yet lacked any of the subtlety, mystery and cohesive plot of that movie.3. It was handicapped throughout by frankly risible plot development - the ""Let's keep this mystery alien baby rescued from a spaceship like he's sent from God to solve our fertility crisis and raise it just like it's a normal kid"" nonsense, the ""He's obviously doing evil things, we've already seen it and suffered it, but we'll still tell him we love him and behave like he's just a misunderstood child"" nonsense, the repetitive and witless ""Why on earth would you wander around in the dark while spooked, hearing strange noises and generally scared out of your wits?"" cliche.Performance-wise, yes, Elizabeth banks puts in a solid day's work. Everyone else is just a cipher, and Jackson Dunn displays all the menace of a hungry poodle. Character development is non-existent, dialogue is perfunctory, and the reliance on the tired old tropes of slasher/haunted house/woman-in-peril movies was annoying.This was a fairly good concept and a promising opportunity laid flat and uninteresting by lazy and below-standard movie making. It was neither gripping, scary, intriguing or so innovatory as to be forgiven making no sense.A turkey.",Brightburn

It doesnt remind me of superman in an evil costume. It reminds me of a something like a teen superhero michael meyers. I felt throughout that it was all about puberty and not that brightburn is a villain. Every teen goes against the world and parents. He was even more hurt by his school friends and girlfriend and that makes for some hate and hurting like every teen normally would but he has superpowers.
I like the acting and gore. The scenery and concept are far out of my likeness.. they represent something like smallville - the series of superman, in terms of scenery and the concept is an antisuperman but they fail that and instead make a puberty and bad parenting movie.",Brightburn

869,jt_ktwn1,Bad bad movie but still entertaining enough,3,27 November 2019,"I watch movies to be entertained and fortunately this movie had just enough to fill that void. The movie itself leaves audiences like myself asking questions and why weren't the 100 some odd people who worked on this not be able to use common sense and add it in. Kind of like the arm-chair quarterback when watching a football game.
Things change quickly and all of a sudden with no logic behind it. He's a fun loving and sweet 12 year old one second and then just because he hears voices from his spaceship he goes serial killer. They provide NO explanation as to why the sounds from his spaceship waited until he was 12; almost 13 and no history or background what so ever about the alien race that bore this killer. How did they pick earth and of all the trillions of planets, how did he end up on earth? The movie skips through everything; basically goes from we want a baby, crash, we find baby, baby grows, hears voices and then becomes a serial killer. Why not provide some background as to what type of alien race he is or at minimum what the strange gurgling voice is coming from within the spaceship? The movie makes no sense at all and leaves more questions and frustrations than anything else. Watch it if you like to Superboy go on a big tantrum without knowing anything about him, but avoid if you want to enjoy a story along with the action and gore.",Brightburn
870,derousseshane,Such wasted potential,6,10 October 2019,It is so frustrating how much potential the film could've had. If it were done correctly it EASILY could've been made into a few films. Just feel aggravated after it was over.,Brightburn
871,keithm815,Could've Burned a Bit Brighter,7,7 January 2020,"I can honestly say that the premise of ""what if Superman was bad"" was a decent choice in marketing and trailers for this film, BUT...during the film, we were made all too aware of plot holes bigger than the holes Brandon (Jackson Dunn) leaves in his parent's two-story farm house. I kept waiting on more of his origin/backstory, which is purposely eerily similar to that of Superman himself except our boy Brandon takes a serious turn for the worst. So we see that his hidden space ship begins to act as some kind of beacon in summoning Brandon to its power and we even hear some of the otherworldly communications of ""Take the world"" being whispered and telepathically communicated to Brandon, but the bigger question was WHY and WHO? WHY was he being told to take the world and cause death and destruction and WHO was telling him to do so? Also, is he the only one of his 'kind' or are there others as equally dangerous and destructive as him? Did hitting puberty turn this kid into a psychotic murdering fiend from outer space? The film opens your head to even more questions as it progresses which you will not ever get the answers to. If the writers had maybe added about 20-30 minutes to the film to explain this just a bit more, it would have definitely added to the 7 star rating I gave this film (because we LOVE a good backstory, don't we?). The most frustrating thing is that these parents were so slow on the uptake of putting 2 and 2 together to come up with 4 in the fact that their son was psychotic for what seemed like no reason. He went from celebrating his birthday with his parents and aunt and uncle to obliterating them (-except his Aunt Merilee-she is the only person in his 'family' to survive his carnage so maybe she will be back in a sequel? Who knows?) these people who raised and loved this kid for 12 years and he destroys each with no remorse? It doesn't make sense, especially since the writers did everything to avoid taking us inside his head and his thought process and showing us not just what/who was 'guiding' his actions but 'WHY'. Cinematically, the film has some great moments, unforgettable visuals and over-the-top gore scenes that The plot of this is vaguely reminiscent of the ""Cloverfield"" plot--everything goes from normal to massive alien invasion and attack and we were never really shown/told why or where these beings came from. We are left hanging on the plot of this movie and storyline but once the credits role, we still aren't sure why. David Denman (dad) and Jackson Dunn give awesome performances and with Dunn, you could almost believe that he isn't even acting as he flips the script and changes his emotions from scene to scene and he delivers in every scene. Elizabeth Banks did a decent job but was far from believable as a Kansas mother and housewife on a farm. From a suspense standpoint this movie will definitely not disappoint as it delivers tension and a sense of foreboding that is unescapable, but if you come into this seeking a lot of neatly tied up endings in pretty shiny ribbons and bows, you came to the wrong party. Definitely worth watch to draw your own conclusions.",Brightburn

886,danplussuzie,There's half a story here,3,3 July 2019,"The one line pitch of this film contains so much promise: what if a kid with superpowers (like superman) landed on the planet but ended up being evil instead of good?There's so much potential in that premise but very little of it is actually realised in this film. So the plot is essentially a reverse superman. A couple who are struggling to have children find an alien baby on their farm and raise it as their own child. The kid grows up and shows signs of super strength, speed, flight, laser eyes, etc but is unfortunately pure evil and only wants to kill people take over the world.But that's it. That's all that happens. There's no real emotional conflict. The kid doesn't at any point wrestle with the morality of it. He actually wants to be evil. Why? We never find out. Just because.The parents come the closest to providing any kind of conflict, with the dad starting to realise something is up but there was never enough of a father/son bond built up during the film to make this interesting. The bond with Elizabeth Banks as his mother is slightly more fleshed out but she flips from refusing to believe her child could be capable of doing evil to suddenly just accepting it in an instant. She sees some drawings he did and, click, that's it.Instead of taking forever building up to the kid just killing every other character we're introduced to, they could have spent some time developing these relationships. How about this for an alternative plot:A childless couple find an alien baby on their farm. They raise him as their own.
As the child grows up, he starts to exhibit the powers. The parents realise they need to channel those powers for good. They try to make him into a superhero. But as puberty sets in, it becomes harder for them/him to keep doing the right thing. A superhero with mood swings! The plot is then essentially the parents and the good side of the kid trying to fight the darker urges of the grumpy hormonal side of the kid. You can still have him giving in and going full evil if your main aim is to subvert the genre. But at least this way there'd have been some conflict along the way. We could have gone on an emotional journey during the film.Instead all we get to do is just watch a bunch of stuff happening for no reason. Just because.But then, maybe that's all life is...",Brightburn

The effects are the only other good thing about this movie, especially considering the low budget.But the acting is horrible (except for the kid), and emotional scenes are almost laughable, both due to the terrible script. There is no suspense and there are no scares, only some gore, which is not enough to make the experience memorable.And the worst is the pacing. Sometimes we follow a character discovering a dark place for a long time, then days pass by in seconds - this is another reason why the emotional content is silly. Simply there is no time for the characters and relationships to evolve meaningfully.

Because this isn't a bad Superman - it's just a bad movie.Here's the entire plot: A mindless orgy of hyperviolence and grisly murder by an alien child with superpowers. That's it. You now know the entire movie.There is no backstory, no explanation for the child's homicidal mania. He's just a crazy superpowered murder-machine. The director has no need for story. Instead, he's content to maximize blood & gore - taking great pleasure in depicting each murder with excessive detail. Amplified sounds of crushing bones, bodies suddenly blasted to pieces, close up shots of glass chunks jamming into eyeballs, death-ray vision blowing holes in people's heads.My advice is to skip this movie entirely and instead watch the terrific 1956 film ""The Bad Seed."" It's also about a murderous child, but is told skillfully and persuasively - and was nominated for 4 Academy Awards. You might also check out Episode 73 of ""The Twilight Zone"" (1961). Titled ""It's a Good Life,"" it is a compelling glimpse into the mind of an impulsive 6-year-old child with deadly superpowers. It stars Billy Mumy as the awful child, and Cloris Leachman & John Larch as his very frightened parents.

894,drsworm,Essentially a Superman gone bad origin story.,7,2 June 2019,"As mentioned above, it's essentially a ""what if"" version of Superman. From a different planet, super strength, red laser beams from his eyes, etc. It's definitely a slow burn in the first 1/3 of the movie with some establishing scenes, but not revealing too much. Aka building suspense. However, it becomes clear what he's capable of and the remainder of his rampages are relatively predictable once the evil surfaces. Some classic Gunn gore thrown in there for the shock factor. Pretty clever for the most part and certainly cringeworthy. It's part super villain movie, part horror flick, blending the two together with moderate success. Unfortunately, it doesn't really master either of the two, just sort of hangs out in the middle. Acting is solid throughout and the dialogue rarely comes across as corny. It felt authentic considering their circumstances. The ending was quite a cliffhanger leaving plenty of room for a sequel starring other super villains along with him. Nice moment of humor with Rooker making an appearance as the doomsday broadcaster. Almost forgot to mention there were some clever choices with the camera angles and a variety of shots mixed in to make it a bit more interesting and visually unique.

The downside to the quality acting (yes, I just said that) was that it made the cheesy, typical slasher movie jokes and set-ups all the more groan-worthy and out-of-place.
It felt like the actors were trying to make an actual movie while someone else (the director?) was trying to make a b-horror flick.

920,kartikv-40888,Very likable (if you check your expectations),8,2 June 2021,"I found this movie very likable ... it was suspenseful, thrilling, with likable characters, and overall, a good watch. It deserves at least one watch.Before I give you the meat of my review, I do want to state the perspective from which I am writing this review.Considering that horror movies, in some form, have been around for more than 100 years, I feel it is unfair to demand a completely original story, which reviewers of such movies often do. The other fundamental flaw I find in reviews is the expectation for this movie to live up to some other movie / remake / prequel / sequel. Finally, there are those who love to find and list all the laws of science or historic facts that the movie did not conform to. That is not watching a movie with an open mind. That is watching a movie with a microscope in hand.If you are someone with a microscope in hand or rigid expectations for it to live up to some other movie you want to compare it to ... forget it, skip this one. However, if you've got some free time and wanna kick back and be entertained with (what I consider to be) a pretty well done movie, keep reading ...The characters were quite likable ... every single one of them was, although I must mention I thought Elizabeth Banks was awesome ... she has a lot of emotional depth / range and it shows in such movies. The kid did a decent job and he was a good fit for the movie because of his strange-ish looks (my opinion).There is plenty of suspense throughout ... if not regarding the final outcome ... then certainly about what is going to happen next ... or at least how it will happen :) Quite a few scenes caused that tenseness in my torso, and some were outright shocking (in a good way).Of course, this movie takes inspiration from others - The Omen, and Orphan, to name the two that I can think of. But again, I state that fact not for the sake of comparison, but because I was able to appreciate a new take on an old story. All the three are great in their own ways, and I am always open to seeing an old story done in a novel or more high-tech way.So, again, if you can keep your expectations in check, you can expect to have an entertaining and enjoyable 90 minutes. And, personally, what I want, at the end of the day, is just that ... to be entertained. To go through a movie without checking the time. To like the characters I'm seeing on screen.

Not going in the plot here except an alien is brought up by two people soewhere in the Dust Belt.

Also, the love parents have for their only child does not simply go away if they learn he's a bad seed. The dad is ready to take him to the woods to kill him right away and the mother is not even trying to turn the kid through motherly love, it's straight for the knife.A perfect example of a mother's real love in somewhat similar situation is Rosemary's Baby where Rosemary accepts his son is the spawn of Satan and thus, end of the world.

940,eskpliena,A brief exploration of evil superman. (Young edition),7,27 April 2020,"I'd like to begin by saying that I really like the idea behind this movie and purely that made me rate it as high as 7. Also, I have a tattoo of something very similar to what they keep showing in the movie, which was cool. That's my bias done.The film is a bit of a mixture of things. You wouldn't really class it as horror and not REALLY a superhero movie. Was there gore? Definitely, but very brief and not very realistic (I will get to that later). Was there horror? No. It's a thriller at best.
Pros:
The story was quite good and the script was believable. They don't make it easy to be empathetic with the characters, as you will see, but the acting had little to no flaws. The super powers were quite awesome and I was not bored for a second. The soundtrack was also quite cool, with some very well placed epic orchestra.
Cons:
The special effects. OH MY GOD what happened? I mean, I had moments where I knew where the damage is going to happen. You know in those old cartoons where the object that is going to be interacted with had noticeably more detail to it? Almost like that. That is why the gore was meh. It was bad CGI for today's standards. The horror elements if you can call them that were quite superficial and almost out of place.I won't write up too much, as I don't even believe in watching trailers as they spoil movies anyways. So.
I recommend you to watch this movie.
Marvel fans and such might be a bit disappointed, as I am sure there have been better iterations of this idea in comics or cartoons.

Which on paper is a great idea. The problem is that this movie just feels exactly that. This origin movie would be much better if it was squeezed around some epic fight scene or we see the adult version of the villein struggle with how his parents died (it was him!) imagine that cliff hanger.
Instead we see the arch of the main character go from a slight outsider school child to a full blown enemy of the world in about 5mins!
The only other character worth mentioning is the mother and we have seen many times that you can't break a mother love even if you are really a alien from outer space.

953,scraben,Brightburn Reignites An Old Flame Towards The Superhero Movie Genre,9,13 May 2019,"A friend of mine allowed me to garner a viewing of the new film Brightburn. I'm not sure how they acquired the chance, though I was thankful for the opportunity. Foremost & firstly, this is an intriguing spin upon the mythos that Superman spearheaded into mainstream. Now, before I coyly explain that, allow me to state that this isn't the first ever horror-esque-themed superperson story. Yes, there were such in the 80's with the likes of the campy-yet-adored Swamp Thing & a singular touch more recently with the good-idea/bad-execution Chronicle.This one, though, adheres a bit strongly towards the basis of Superman. Heck, remember the Man Of Steel scene when Clark runs into the closet at school & the teacher follows him? The one where he uses great vision on the doorknob to prevent the teacher from opening the door of the closet? Remember that? Remember that subtle feeling you had when you thought, ""Wait! What if he was evil?"" No, not that same cocky feeling you felt during Justice League when Superman is first resurrected & fights the other league members. That one was just a snarky showcasing feather in the cap of that original Man Of Steel closet scene feeling. That MOS moment, though, allotted for you to momentarily race thoughts through your mind about a malicious Superboy gone totally astray from his superhero aim. This movie, here(Brightburn, in case you forgot the page you're on), takes those speeding thoughts & tosses them up in the air like a baseball stolen from the wimpy intelligent kid by the brutal + foolish bully child.The big thing about this is the fact that neither director, David Yarovesky, nor writers/producers, James Gunn + Mark Gunn + Brian Gunn(truthfully, James produced & gave ideas, while Mark + Brian wrote), are foolish. They are intelligent & able to convey that bully regard in the manner that you'd want to see in fiction, though never hope would ever take place in reality. They play on what worked for MOS, showing the loner child with the loving parents that you hope would be willing to securely step into his own identity without making it seem like a ""Could this work?"" moment.Instead, when you see this character begin to come into realization of what he possesses, you see him test out what's possible, though not on the ones whom you'd presumed he would. The devastation caused by him is seen to be a task taken towards those of whom normally doesn't receive the brunt force by most of the villains in traditional Superhero films.One scene in particular somewhat fully shows what you'd expect to see General Zod conduct against a personal Earthly antagonist of his without Superhero powers(No, not Batman. Think of one of those military colonels). It is shocking, though what preceded it was a slow build to a tactic that proved futile against his preteen self. So, in a weird way, he received his justice. Though the villain loving crowd will cheer at it, the rest of the audience wouldn't help to feel a great deal of nervousness regarding what such a moment will fully unleash for the character.Is the film perfect? No. Such a thing is as impossible as finding a perfect person. Is the film good? Yes. Such a thing is honestly & strangely needed through this current overrun of Superhero films. Does it look to garner a sequel? The option is strongly open, though I'm sure that the intention is simply to make a one-off film & not a film series. Would I watch it, again? Yes, even more so if viewing it with others whom haven't seen it before. Shoot, I'd do such even with those whom have seen it before, provided that the additional viewers are intelligent & wisely jokeful. Honestly, even if the Gunn family & Yarovesky did make a ""spiritual sequel"" spinning another the basis of another hero into a nefarious tale, I'd be eager to see where it heads.From me, Brightburn is granted a 9.3 out of 10. Good work & many thanks, you wonderful actors & Fantastic Foursome.",Brightburn

974,FreddyChavez-Martinez,Interesting Premise,6,31 May 2019,The movie has a interesting premise of what of instead of receiving a gift from space its more like a destructive force of nature. The story for me was solid but I wish the parents were more flesh out including the main character Brandon. The special effects were great and it didn't took you off from the movie. I felt like the time was short so some things had to be rush which is understandable when given a small budget. My criticism is that they should focus more on the parent and child relationship. I know that its there but I would be curious about Brandon struggling with himself more into choosing if he will be somebody of good or a destructive force. One thing that bother me was how the parents did not confront Brandon about the ship when he opened it and asked questions about it. That would be a great scene to watch but who knows if they continue with this. The movie is good overall and its not boring enough to take you out of it.,Brightburn
975,johnwiesand,Superhero horror,8,24 May 2019,"David Yarovesky's Brightburn is a unique combination of horror and the classic Superman origin. The story of a kid with extraordinary powers and decides to use said powers for his own gain is truly suspenseful and will definitely keep your eyes glued to the screen in anticipation for what will happen next. Unfortunately the movie tends to have some pacing issues towards the start of the film, as if we were supposed to see more of Brandon's normal life before he goes ballistic but unfortunately we aren't given that and are left with not a very strong connection to the characters of the film. The acting of the film is absolutely fantastic, everyone gives a stellar performance and is definitely one of the big highlights of the film.

However, these two can not be simply compared, one is a series and the other is a movie.The important thing about movie is that the story needs to be done within that 2 hours time frame.From the beginning after Mr. and Mrs. Breyer heard the loud noise, the story fast forwarded to 10 years later. Brandon likes a girl, acts creepy, scares her, then hurs her. Girl's mom gets killed for ""not letting"" her talk to him, uncle gets killed for wanting to report him to his panregs for showing up in his closet in the middle of the night. Dad gets killed for trying to kill him. Random police get killed for just being there, then mom gets killed for trying to kill him.
The whole story can be summarized in a few words in my opinion: kid is attracted to the ship, starts hating the world and goes on a killing spree.Way too tasteless for a movie that I had a very high hope for. It's like chewing a piece of gum, it is tasty at the beginning, but just gets more and more tasteless and boring. If you ask me, how did I like it?

990,alicemgaspard,Predictable and disappointing,4,16 October 2019,"*Contains spoilers*
I heard great things about this movie, but after watching it, I just feel disappointed. The beginning is at least creepy and sets up the storyline very well, but the writing progressively falls into bad cliches that seem much worse when acted out. To be unsure if it is the acting itself or if the script is just poorly written is probably one of the worst things I could say about a movie. It's very clear which scenes the budget for this movie was spent on, most of which, I felt the movie would have been better without. Had this movie focused less on gore and more on the premise of parents in terror that their child is so mentally unwell as to become a serial killer, it would have felt much more disturbing. Had the father perhaps not been so quick to turn on his son, it may have felt more realistic, more interesting, or at least pulled at the heart strings just enough to pass with a C.
The second half was painfully predictable, down to each scene. My fiance and I sat calling out each cliche that could happen and watched as they fell accordingly. The running away at the truth. The father attempting to shoot the boy. The boy killing the father. The mother remembering the spaceship. The boy finding out his mother's intentions and killing her as well, and succeeding in his plans to take over the world.
Some minor details that bothered me more consisted of untied ends: the girl who lost her mother and just never heard from the boy again, but somehow never mentioned to the police that he showed up in her room and basically threatened her mother's life right before she died, where the boy actually came from, why his goal was to take over Earth, if that's why he was sent away, and if so, why it was in a spacepod composed of his literal kryptonite.
This movie was an interesting take on a classic, turned sour with an overuse of gore, drawing away from it's only redeemable quality: just how disturbing the plot could have been on its own.",Brightburn

1010,keb1976,Concept better than the script,2,30 December 2020,"So many already nailed it on the head, the reason Brightburn fails and falls apart is the motivation of Brandon.
Brandon does not have to be a superboy clone. In this film... he could have been an android or robot. A kid possessed by a demon. An undead entity seeking to kill all. An inter-galatic trophy hunter. Or even a mindless alien or mythical creature who is just running on instinct. The character Brandon is exactly as one-dimensional as the rest.
So... when YOU watch a film about, say, an inter-galactic trophy hunter... the reality is the story is NOT about the villain. If Predator was told strictly from the Predator's point of view, it would be an action-packed, bloody film... but also incredibly pointless and boring.I do not find 'flipping things in a mirror' to be creative or witty at all. Take the romantic-comedy Trainwreck. Trainwreck is a cookie-cutter script... with every beat and stereotypical romcom trope contained within it. There is NO part of that story that takes any risks or is creatively superior to any other rom com. But why does Trainwreck get accolades? Because they simply swapped the gender roles. The female is the wild crazy cant settle down while the male is the yearning for love sad sack.
That its. That's all. Stop and think about that for a moment.. YOU could have written the script to Trainwreck. All you had to do was copy any other romcom, then rename 'Jack' to 'Jill' and 'Jill' to 'Jack'. That is SO lazy.And that's exactly what Brightburn is. Its not a subversive superhero film and its not a 'refreshing take' on the 'superhero genre'. Because at its core, its just any other old done-a-thousand-times monster movie. Brightburn is more The Relic and Mimic than Watchmen or The Boys. Take the movie Alien and re-write it with a small kid as the Alien, Brightburn as the ship, and all the family/townspeople were the ship's staff. That isn't really all that fresh or different. In fact, Alien is far superior because it was actually about RIPLEY and not the Alien. Also think about that for a moment. In most popular horror films, WHO are you really watching? Whose story is really being told?
If you're going to focus on Brandon instead, then we need more than what the filmmakers gave. All you have is 90 minutes of 'how many different ways can this kid kill people for no good reason'.I know its insulting to say, but this is a base movie for basic people. That's not to say I think I have such great tastes (I love a LOT of bad cinema)... but James Gunns' old Troma films have a thousand times more characterization and entertainment value. Interestingly enough, the less-horror, more-drama version of this, Hancock starring Will Smith, also suffers from the same exact problem: the character's personal woes are deemed moot when the story introduces lame plot points about unalterable destinies.I read they plan on making sequels... I am not opposed to seeing those because I would hope the writers would seize the opportunity to tell an actual story this time. You can see the potential in this world they built... Brightburn was just not the best foot forward for it.",Brightburn

He has an 'on' switch that gets him going and that's his only motivation. There is no struggle with being good, only to be let down by someone and making him bad. None of that occurs. It is an on switch. That's it. Switch on: Boy go kill. Switch off... just a boy.
So at this point, the interest of the viewer would have to be... how does one stop the unstoppable Alien monster? If you establish your villain as a mindless killing machine, even if it's the star of the movie, there needs to be a counter. For a moment you think that's where the movie is heading... and instead the filmmakers attempt a 'twist'... NO HAPPY ENDING. Which, an unhappy ending would still work out if the kid was NOT just some killing automaton. But nope... we're going to present a story about a kid with no choice, doing things to people who have no choice to avoid those things, and ending with no choices. Brightburn isn't an alternative superhero film, it's an open door into the cynical, nihilistic mind of its creator. There is no hope. There is no point.I read they plan on making sequels...

I am a big fan of Superman and seeing how this movie was based on that alien kid with superpowers basically being a God among men Superman trope, needless to say, I was pretty excited. It was also interesting how this movie took that concept and tried to make it into a horror/monster movie. But if you forget the cool concept and the gimmick, the movie is bad. It's just bad and so very boring. It's not even a good horror movie. One of the major issues I had with this movie was the decision of the writers to make the alien boy act, not on his own will but as something that just doesn't have a mind of its own and is just sent to Earth to take over the planet. I know it's the writers' decision but I thought it would have been more interesting if the kid acted on his own will and did bad things just because he could without any repercussions. Any kid who would have such powers would do whatever he wants and some of the things he may want may not be innocent but be very cruel. The decision to make him a mindless killing machine didn't work for me. They made him just another generic monster. And as a horror/monster movie, the film just doesn't work. Even the modern horror movies are trying so hard to stand out by not falling into cliches and the overused horror tropes. But this movie didn't make any such effort.

Who says a crash landed alien-super-baby has to be good?It was the little things that made this movie start to fall apart for me. From the start - this is modern day, not Superman's back-in-the-40s-or-whenever-day. If something crash landed in the woods outside my house and I found a baby, I would immediately call the police. I don't care how baby-desperate I am, that would be the right thing to do, and people would kinda notice that you didn't have a kid one day, didn't mention anything about adopting, and then BAM!, suddenly you have a baby.But okay, I'll suspend belief, because in order to have a movie, they have to keep the baby.

Writing in the whole process of calling the authorities and social services and an actual adoption process would be take actual effort, I guess.His dad casually bringing up him being adopted seemed forced and bizarre. I don't know a lot about life as an adopted kid, and I'm all for parents having open dialogue with their children in regards to where they came from, but it came off strange in this film. It very much set up a division between father and (mentioned constantly so you can't forget) adopted son. And yes, I get that it's sort of intentional because of how the plot goes, but it's done so heavy handed and clumsily, it just came off strange. I get that foreshadowing is necessary sometimes, but I don't like to be hammered over the head with it.And then the conference in the principal's office after the hand incident? Who talks like that? I would've punched that mom in the face, it was disgusting. It was way over the top. I also thought his parents were kinda cavalier about the whole hand incident.Why did the parents keep the crashed pod/spaceship/thingy? And once you realized Brandon was being drawn to it, why didn't you get rid of it? Also, why did he turn into a sociopath LITERALLY over night? Like puberty hits these aliens, and boom, crazy murdering time?How did these stupid cops not take more notice of the symbols at the crime scenes? Also, what frickin' year is this that the cops are using POLAROIDS to take pics of the crime scenes!?WHAT KIND OF AUNT DOESN'T INVITE HER NEPHEW INTO THE HOUSE WHEN HE SHOWS UP LATE AT NIGHT!? If my similar aged nephew appeared on my doorstep at ten o'clock at night, my first instinct would be to bring him inside! But this lady leaves him on the doorstep like an unwanted vacuum salesman, chastises him for being there, and then tells him to go back home.In the dark. Through the woods. At 10 o'clock at night.Look, I'm from a small town. Like 9,000 people, 14 miles of road, small town, and even we didn't treat each other like that.And the uncle is just as bad - if I found my nephew hiding in my closet at midnight, again, my first thought wouldn't be to yell at him and drag him out of the house angrily and treat him like garbage. My first thoughts would be what's wrong, what happened, are you okay, are your parents okay?But I'm a weirdo, I love my nephew because he's, ya know, FAMILY, as well as JUST A KID. I guess in this movie, adopted children don't count as family? I mean, he's only been their nephew since he was a baby, but hey, no big deal, he's ADOPTED, so it's okay to treat him like he doesn't belong.Ew. If I was Brandon, I would've probably started killing everyone, too.The dad taking him out camping like he's Ol' Yeller, his mom calling and screaming over the phone before confirming who she's talking to, NO explanation for why he's there, why he's hearing a voice in his head, why he wants to kill everything, and then that ending. That awful stupid ending.I get a vague ending. I understand why some films like them. ""Cube"" to this day still has the best vague, unanswered ending.But this movie? It was like two-thirds of the way through, they just got tired of writing and said ""screw it, just kill everyone and end it.""So disappointed.",Brightburn

1031,hamza-12361,Fusion of Superman and Goku,5,16 June 2021,"The concept is great. An alternate evil origins of a superhero who has a good nature and all. Now, the problem is DC fans would think this is an evil origins of Superman but people who prefer anime would say it's just Goku gone wrong. A normal person would side with evil Superman because everyone knows him. So, let me explain how this story is related to Goku.Anyone who has seen Dragon Ball or Dragon Ball Z would know Goku/Kakarot's mission. He was sent to the earth to takeover it. The spaceship he sent in was suppose to tell him about his mission and take measure and make sure that completes his mission. But he lost his memory due to a crash landing.Now, here are the similarities to Brightburn. The kid was sent here to takeover the earth but he was adopted by good people and raised him as their own. The machine just becomes activated and explains his mission to him. Now this is if Goku Goku found his machine and the machine gives him his mission.In short, the kid is Superman who just entered the earth and had a mission to destroy earth, same as Goku's mission when he came to earth.A great concept just executed poorly. The only good thing about this movie was the mid-credit scene. Other than that it's just a kid who has issues and happens to be powerful.",Brightburn
1032,nicksturkenboom,Don't believe any glowing reviews,1,18 March 2020,"Apparently this movie about evil Superman. The main character doesn't develop at all. Backstory is not longer than your average tweet: boy falls down from the sky, gets adopted but turns out evil.
During the film, he turns 12 and decides to horribly end anyone who mildly stands in his way. I had the hope that somewhere this film would surprise with a twist, but it's just as exciting as the good Superman but without an enemy, kryptonite or people he cares about. There's no emotional complexity in the protagonist, not any emotion actually. A bowl of cold spaghetti could make a better performance.The film follows a stale slasher template with cheap scares and tries to amuse gore fans with graphic scenes. But because there's so little sense in the protagonist's motives, relationship building or build up towards the moment, it feels like this film reheated the rejected scenes from a straight-to-budget dvd final destination. Normally I can enjoy a cheap, brain-off horror for what it is, but this doesn't even meet that bar.I normally don't even write reviews but this film was so awful I felt obligated to warn you. This film is not for anyone, not for Horror lovers, not for a cheap movie night, not for the gore fans, it can't even meet the 'so cringey awful its fun' bar. It has nothing.

What's amazing is how stupid the characters behave. They are absolutely the dumbest people ever. I'm sure the filmmakers intended the usual horror movie experience of the audience yelling ""don't go down that hallway"", but the choices these characters make are on par with willingly sticking one's head into an industrial blender. Their choices are so ridiculously stupid that the theater audience (Pre-COVID) was laughing throughout the movie. Yes, it's so bad that it's good as a comedy of errors, a true Shakespearean tragedy as they could have dinner any number of things and avoided their fates.

1041,chappers_107,"""What is this? Where did I come from?""",2,27 December 2019,"The idea behind this is a good one - what if Clark Kent came to earth and became evil? The execution, however, is abysmal.We are introduced to two people who are having trouble conceiving. Within seconds, a spaceship comes down to earth. Then we are shown seconds of home video footage of the boy they presumably find growing up, before we're thrown straight into the mother looking for her son. Then the spaceship turns on and begins whispering to the boy and he is suddenly evil. Then he begins hurting people. Then he begins killing people... This is all in the first 20-30 minutes. While watching it I had to check to see how much of the film was left because I had no idea where it had left to go, and it doesn't go anywhere; the whole film is him killing people with no repercussions.So much vital stuff that would've given the film a beating heart is discarded. We are never shown how the parents had trouble conceiving, how overjoyed or conflicted they were about finding a boy in the woods. We are never shown how the boy is before he turns evil, and after he turns, we never see the boy trying to grasp what is happening to him. We barely spend any time with any of the characters before bad things start happening and, because of this, we hardly care about any of them or what happens to them. The film is devoid of any stakes, which is unforgivable.There are also too many points of view. We see things from the parents' point of view, then the boy's point of view, then the uncle's point of view, then the sheriff's point of view, then an aunt, then an uncle, then a... We know what's happening at all times. We see it all, so while all the characters wander around confused, we the audience have to patiently wait for them to catch up. But what it also does is kill any tension. It's like no one has bothered to think that perhaps what happens off screen is more unnerving, that what's out of sight is more terrifying. It would've been far more effective if we'd seen it from one point of view - perhaps from the parents - so that the film could've served as both a supervillain movie as well as a comment on the frustrations and insecurities of being both parents and adoptive parents. But the film doesn't care about that. It only cares about the killing and the gore.Aside from the manic scene jumping, the film has other pacing issues. It uses the same jump scare over and over again, with little to no effort in the build-up. We'll see a character become scared for a moment and then the kid will be there, as if the filmmakers were impatient and couldn't wait to show the gory kill, preferred that over the long drawn out build up that would've upped the ante.But this leads me to the overriding feeling I had while watching this - the film is an absolute mess.Scenes seem to exist in isolation with no bearing on the next scene, so that put together they exist haphazardly on top of another. In one scene the boy is looking at some chickens, and seconds later the chickens fry and the father automatically assumes it's his son; then in a later scene the boy begins messing with a guidance counsellor's intruder lights, then turns up on her doorstep and threatens her and tells her it will be a bad idea if she goes to the police, and then in the next scene she's texting her husband goodnight and that she's going to sleep. Then there is a particularly bizarre scene where the boy's father accuses him of killing a man while the boy is eating cereal, and moments later he's in his room apologising for being so hard on him. He's just accused a boy of murder! What the hell is going on? No scene has any impact on the next. It's like they've been put in a box and shook up.Characters spout plot points at us - ""He means the barn!"" - without trusting us to keep up. Characters come to outlandish conclusions to move the plot along. The sheriff, up to this point unsure of what's going on in his town, sees a symbol at two crime scenes and suddenly knows it's the boy: ""BB,"" he tells the boy's mother. ""Brandon Breyer."" The boy's mother, looking confused, says she doesn't see it. She's not the only one. How he's come to that conclusion with the information he has is beyond me - the symbols hardly look like Bs. We realise that he must moonlight as a psychic in his spare time. But what it also shows is that the filmmakers don't seem to care about any of the characters in this film. They only exist to be moved around to places they have to be, so they can be killed off by Brandon. Because never once in the whole film does he face an adversary, or show any kind of remorse or humanity.It's a film that shows its hand in the opening ten minutes and from then on seems to be anxiously looking for a place to go, and a plot to hold on to, while it careens ever faster into confusion. It's a film that you wish would just slow down for a second and take a look around.",Brightburn

Once he realized who/what he was, there should be no need to be upset about not being adopted, just as he wasn't upset about the uncle's death. Also, the dad should have known better then trying to shoot him since they knew he was not from earth, he believed he killed the uncle and how he mangled the little girls hand.

I went to see Brightburn with my friends today and I gotta say. I am very disappointed.
First of all, the horror. The movie does a very bad job at ""scaring"" people it only has a couple of jumps scares that are very cheap and predictable. The music is the only thing that can make you a little tense and nothing else. If you leave those things aside the movie cannot scare you in any way you do not feel the fear of the unknown because you can see who the bad guy is. Except for the mask,m there is literally nothing even creepy about the main antagonist. He is just a kid that is basically the bad version of Super Man. Yes, they copy the origin story of Super Man I just can't believe.
Another thing that bugs me is that the characters feel hollow and underdeveloped. The only positive thing I can say about the characters is they the acting is on point.
Now for the story. In my opinion, is absolutely inconsistent and even contradicts itself. The ship is my main problem. It kept our antagonist safe at the same time it can hurt him and wants Brian to come to him for some unknown reason AND it tetells Brian to destroy the planet. Yea like we have never seen this 98272622829292872 times before.
Now I know I am not picking and believe me I can not pick all day but Brian's costume is made from the same blanket that his parents found him with. And he had made ( from the same blanked) a mask and a cape. OK. There are MANY wrong little mistakes they can be found but I will not be focusing at that but attention to detail is very important for the authenticity of the story.
The ending is absolute bull***t Brian takes over the world WOOOOOOW. This brings bad memories from Jurassic Park World.
I can write ALL DAY about the bad thing in this movie. It's bland unoriginal uninspired even it has hollow characters predictable plot bad ""villain"" design in my opinion. At the end of the day, I just want to say that we people have a voice. We should not allow this kind of awfulness air anywhere at all and the only thing we must do is not pay money for it. We do not deserve these godawful disasters. I am not an examination. If we refuse to consume this kind of content the companies producers and directors will get their s**t together and will not make these kinds of mistakes again.

I was expecting that this is going to be a tragic story, of how an individual of great gifts wanting to do good, but instead turned to evil due to a warped sense of justice, or a tragedy, or the combination of both.I was mistaken...and boy, am I glad to be wrong!This is not a tragic story of good becoming evil, or the reluctant descent of a hero into a villain.This is a story of a love labours lost, of a terrible nature triumphing over compassionate nurture, and of evil simply wins.In short, it is an origin story of a true sociopathic supervillain, unhinged and unleashed...and I love it!In this age where superheroes movies almost completely reign unchallenged in the science-fiction genre, Brightburn brings a fresh wind to the film industry.
Is the idea behind this movie original and new? No, most probably not.
Is such idea a fresh one? Absolutely.From the fevered mind of (the mad geniuses) Brian and Mark Gunn, the viewers are presented with the story of a (Not-Kryptonnian and Not-Clark Kent) boy named Brandon Breyer, and his transformation into his alter-ego (or in actuality, his true self), the dreaded 'Brightburn'.Forget about a sappy tragedy, or a villain or anti-hero that we can correlate with; this is a story of a creature fulfilling its inhumane biology, of an alien accomplishing its malicious purpose, and of a wolf finally shedding its sheep-skin.However, in the execution of telling such story, this movie is anything but 'flawless'.Brightburn tries to be an unique origin story of a supervillain that encompasses elements of horror and gory flicks in it. Unfortunately, these elements fall flat within its plot. Some parts of the movie that seemingly are meant to be scary, especially with the build-up scenes and the music, just fail to deliver the terror.Some scenes are just ridiculously funny even after the build-up, such as the scene at the changing room in a family friend's house, and the scene where the father figure attempt to solve the 'problem' (which is the main antagonist of this movie) with his own hand, knowing FULL WELL that the boy cannot be harmed in any (earthly) manner.As for the elements of gore, there is nothing too significantly horrifying, or extremely revolting. If anything, they are forgettable at best, and hillariously tame at worst.Furthermore, the storytelling of this movie sometimes feels inadequate- especially at the part where the main antagonist of this movie began to subscribe to malevolent ideas, or where he started to come to terms with his 'inhumane' qualities. On those parts, the storytelling is blatantly lacking- and it is such a shame when those parts of the story can be explored and elaborated more deeply instead of being forced to the viewers.In addition, the scores of this movie are not stupendously incredible as well. They are good, but they are not that great either. I certainly can't remember the music of any scenes in this movie.Heck, I can't even remember the tune of the terrible rap/mumbling song at the end of this movie!With all of its flaws that I have mentioned before, is Brightburn a terrible movie?
No, it is not. Brightburn is far from being a perfect movie, it may not even win any awards, or be a timeless gem in the entertainment history.But it is a damn good movie.In my opinion, the movie suffers these flaws because the core idea of Brightburn, the origin story of an alien and sociopathic supervillain, outshines the other elements of the movie.Is it a bad thing? Probably, but not necessarily, because Brightburn as a whole, is a good movie in my opinion. Despite of it flaws, it manages to deliver an unique origion story of an unrelatable and murderous bad guy- which is good, especially in this age of superheroes and anti-heroes movies.Instead of conforming to the norms of superheroes and antiheroes movies, Brightburn has its own identity- an identity that is independent from the twin polars of Marvel and DC.The Gunn brothers should be proud on what they have achieved with this movie, and I hope that they will strive to improve, particularly in exploring this unique and independent universe that they have created with the release of Brightburn.Yes, people.

I do really enjoy watching this movie and see where the endings goes. And, I would really be happy if they make a sequel out of this, especially on expanding the origin of Brandon Beyer or his ""parents"" intentions.Firstly, you should really ask, would an alien which are superior to us lands in earth would then spends the rest of his life protecting it? No way! They would trampled the life here or at least won't submit to it.In the earlier parts of the movie, Brandon exposes his curiosity (or his innate nature) with see some type of hornet which take others lifeforms to hatch theirs progeny. I guess thats where the creepy mask design reminds me off; After all, once his weak stages of life was over, he become what was in his nature. Disposing anyone who stands in his way in creatively gruesome way. The early part of killings seems to a way to build more consistent narrative, associating his puberty to all the actions he doing (the diner killing) and some sort of pity for he had for his parents (the truck decapitation), in some sense to avoid confrontation with them which does happens of course at the end. It was beautiful : )For me, the whispering spacecraft and the intelligence he had (as well as the similar uncanny superman skills), was enough to justify his action to behave as he would. Similar to the way we treat other animal for foods, clothing and etc. They are born for us... In a way we're an insect to him and are there on earth to serve his purposes whether it's just plain fun to take down a plane, burn a forest or destroy a building with people in it.I've watch this after seeing John Wick's Parabellum, and IMO this is way better. One could hypothesize that his ""parents"" could another alien civilization experimenting with human genetic and sending out the modified version of it to see the results of their experiments.

So, I was really looking forward to seeing this. But predictably... it was very predictable. I don't know how it couldn't have been. Imagine a 12 year old superboy who is evil, what would he do, especially on a limited movie budget (it's no Marvel movie in the special effects area)?
Spoilers ahead.
He'd terrorize helpless people in his rural hometown and not go anywhere or do anything expensive. That's exactly what happened.
I was a little disappointing he needed evil prodding from his spaceship to turn bad, some people are just evil and rotten. Why couldn't he be, once he realized his abilities? That seemed unnecessary but, no biggie.
The fact that the entire movie (except for the end credits) stayed in his hometown with him terrorizing his family and other locals with such amazing powers was a let down. That was probably due to the obvious limited budget. But if they're planning on making a sequel it makes sense, as this is about his 12 year old evil awakening so, ok. Still a minor let down.
Didn't expect he'd live. Thought mama was gonna end him. That was a surprise.
I can't see where this could get good in a sequel. He's just going to keep terrorizing the world until people trick him into taking a knife or projectile made out of his spaceship. But, that's why other people write for a living and I don't. Hopefully they make a good one. Overall, it was meh.",Brightburn

The acting was pretty good. Our special space boy was indeed pretty creepy. Special effects were OK for the budget at hand. Cinematography, music, etc., it's all pretty good. Well, it's not a breakthrough by any means, but it's indeed a solid movie. Oh, and it's not a horror. It's a slasher movie that for some reason really tries to scare you with screamers from time to time. Screamers are essentially the only real gripe I have with this film. Maybe I would add more shocking scenes for the sake of it. This movie really likes to cut away from the violence, especially in the first half.

1084,u-20295,Brightburn is Burning Down,3,3 June 2019,"Brightburn was a movie that had a fantastic idea, I mean who wouldn't like a movie that has a superhero like character but twisted into a horror plot. Unfortunately the film was very poorly written that was backed by emotionless acting in traumatic situations.
The movie is set in a fictional town named brightburn that's out in farm country, which has a eerie undertone to it. The film begins with a couple Tori Breyer (Elizabeth Beth) and Mr. Breyer (David Denman) attempting to have their first child but have been struggling for the past years. Abruptly a capsule falls from the sky into their backyard containing a young toddler. They take the toddler in and name him Brandon Breyer (Jackson A. Dunn), they keep brandon's arrival to earth behind his back. Later Brandon finds out about this capsule and realises that he has super powers. Brandon starts to feel that people in his life are wronging him throughout preteen years. He builds this hate for those people and unleashes the power he has on them. His parents have two different outlooks on their child have to figure out how to stop the mess they created.
I feel that this film had a fantastic idea and premise. A superhero like kid that turns out being evil with a horror movie feel to it sounds amazing right. I thought the exact same thing as well when I was checking this movie out. But after watching it, it was very clear to me that the film was awfully written and not what I was expecting. The writers have a kid that just happens to have powers identical to superman also not to mention a symbol very closely related to supermans symbol. It seemed like they took superman's alien origins and just decide to twist it into a horror film. Brandon goes around murdering people for no reimer reason, he repeatedly says ""take over"" which no one understands why he keeps saying this. The film fails to give a background to why Brandon is there and what his purpose is. So it leaves the audience wondering why Brandon is doing all of these sinister acts. On Top of all of this the Director David Yarovesky lacks a great sense of emotion through his characters. Throughout the movie it seemed like no matter what's happening in the situation it wouldn't really impact how the characters felt. This was a major problem for me because as Brandon is zooming around killing people his parents don't show a lot of sadness or anger, just alot of ""how could he"" type of nonsense. That's what mostly turned me off about the film.
Overall I felt that Brightburn was a failure off a film. They had such a fantastic idea that's a large attention grabber and it could have had been an amazing movie. Unfortunately they took an awful approach on the writing of the movie which completely left it as a massive boiling pot of confusion. This was also backed up with emotionless acting and the most classic horror movie reactions in every situations. I would not recommend wasting your time going to a theater to see this film, not worth the hour and a half of time.",Brightburn

Here's why,This story actually challenges some very real complexities that might exist if a demi-God child were raised by humans (especially a small town couple). Where super man's tale reflects a perfect upbringing that effectively guides him toward the greater good, this story challenges that and provides parallels that are very realistic. It demonstrates imperfections of parenting and the self-serving human condition. It basically says, what if the child, who demonstrates evil inclinations at a young age, isn't properly guided?The sequence of events and acting as they unravel are pretty spot on.

1089,telsamouse,The Reason This Film Is Terrible,1,21 June 2019,"For any of my friends planning to watch Brightburn, let me save you a load of money and just say DON'T!
This film does virtually nothing right, it has a lot of effects, but there is almost 0 character or plot development. It is literally just a character who all of a sudden just starts killing people with little explanation of why or what is going on. The few devices the film has as predictable or really badly written and the film instils no feeling of interest or love for any of the characters, to the extent that other than the main characters name and his mothers name, you hardly remember anyone's name, if it was given at all. I swear even a little child could write a better story than this.
It is up to you if you choose to believe me, it's your money. But for those who value a good villain or horror movie, I will warn you that this film gets at best a 1/10.
The films premise to do an Evil Superman character, seems more like a cross between Superman and Damien from the Omen, it is an interesting idea, unfortunately in this film, that is all it amounted to being.
I would even ask how this film even got past the script checking phase as this is the sort of story writing that wouldn't even get you a passing mark at GCSE level, never mind at an industry level.",Brightburn

1098,beamen-76824,Children with birth defects and parenting of adoptees issues are the background of Brightburn film,10,7 August 2019,"I liked the idea that horror is the genre where you can hide the secret meaning...Apparently, the film is about adoption issues. I think the idea about children or adult children from dysfunctional families and children with birth defects encrypted in the movie. There is a big problem with adopted children from dysfunctional families or children with birth defects. I think it's hard to discuss it openly.Children of dysfunctional families and children with birth defects are a broad concept. Not all, but some of them may have brain damage, intellectual disability, behavioral and cognitive disorders, including difficulties with learning and memory, hyperactivity, lowered stress tolerance, autism and Asperger syndrome. Some of them have less severe forms of the condition - they just aren't born in love.Suchlike children during puberty begin to show antisocial or deviant behavior. But antisocial behavior is manifested in different ways. Symptoms may be caused by stealing, torturing animals etc. Children like that can insert a chopstick into the eye and at the same time feel nothing. They don't understand that they are hurting, that the other person or animal is suffering. Such individuals have schizotypal personality, characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted behavior. The symptoms of the adopted child in this film were manifested by the killing of people.Among other things the film offered options for addressing such issues, which is an even more difficult topic for public discussion of such issues in society. When the adoptive father realized that his adopted son was killing people - took him to the forest and shot him in the head.There is another aspect of this topic - adoptive parents and particularly the adoptive mother. The adoptive mother subconsciously knew that something about her child is wrong. But the adoptive mother continued to protect him to the end. And it's a natural reaction for any mother. Adoptive parents get into a very difficult situation. They raised him from the cradle. They invested so much love into him. They have been through so much. After all they have to get thrown him to the mob or take him to the court.Adoptive parents may have a high social status and a well-paid job. May be they are high-ranking officials. And now they can lose their life work, they can lose everything if everyone finds out that their child is a murder. They have a reason to cover up a criminal. A similar situation is well described in the Russian TV series ""The Method"" (2015). Psychological thriller consists of 16 episodes and is considered as adaptation of the American TV series ""Dexter"" (2006-2013).",Brightburn

1108,arodgerrabbit,Unexpected Pleasure,7,26 August 2019,"A pod falls on a farm in rural Kansas containing a baby. That baby isn't human but is adopted by childless farm couple and brought up in a kindly, loving nurturing environment. So far its a bit familiar; even more so when it transpires he has super powers and is virtually indestructible. Those who still haven't cottoned on might find a final clue in Brandon liking to fly wearing a red cape.The twist is this alien baby hasn't been sent to earth with good intentions; he really isn't very nice at all. Brian and Mark Gunn have written a twisted nightmare version of Superman where the superpowers are in the hands of an alien monster with few good intentions but the inconvenience of a very human boys puberty hormones.Skilfully Brandon's origins and childhood are skipped over with enough attention to draw the picture without to much shading in. He doesn't get interesting until his stash of ""unusual""Around that time he discovers an interest in a local girl in his class and the fun starts.Brightburn was an unexpected Gem. I don't like Hollywood remakes but this is a low budget, well crafted re-imagining of the modern fairytale of Superman, reworked as fairly gruesome sci-fi horror. The special effects are OK but look....inexpensive. What the film leans on instead is good storytelling and a competent cast of skilled but unfamiliar actors the writing is good never getting worse than Tori telling Brandon ""You'll always be my baby boy"".I have often been disappointed by offerings that didn't get a cinema release since that's often for a good reason. Brightburn shows you can tell a big story without spending hundreds of millions of dollars. A special shout out to Jackson A. Dunn who plays Brandon Breyer with aplomb switching between creepy and sinister to total normality and convincing wholesomeness.This film is good but its not perfect. Audiences might find it hard to buy devoted mummy lioness Tori falling for a freaked out Kyle wanting to take his son of for some armed father and son alone time in the woods and the scenes with Brandon tearing his mask and cape by shooting himself through the farmhouse like a dud missile doesn't work well.

1119,Sully_Sadface,"Dark, gritty, suspenseful",8,18 October 2019,"Well this was a ride.I enjoyed a lot about this movie. I thought it was well-paced, the feeling of unease gradually snowballed into full on heart-pumping anxiety. The backstory of the titular character was established early and quickly, which is a godsend given just how man times I've watched Ben Parker die on screen. I found Brandon's parents to be sympathetic, as they're just trying to do what is right for their son. The antagonistic characters I generally felt anger and resentment towards, and genuinely wished them harm, mirroring Brandon's feelings I'm sure. From there, I barely had time to think as everything just rapidly went horribly awry and then got worse, not from a quality standpoint, but just an overall viewpoint on just how the events were unfolding in the story. I don't think my heart reached a normal BPM between the lawnmower and the end credits.Storywise, it's a cool ""what if"" twist on a popular origin story, and does well conveying Brandon's detachment from those around him as he begins to realize just what is going on. As a horror movie, I found it excellent as I was generally uneasy at minimum and borderline arrhythmic during the climax.Do I take exception to some of the events portrayed in the movie? From a narrative standpoint I can pick and choose, but overall I enjoyed this movie for what it represented and how it executed it. Sure beats a shard of glass in the eye.",Brightburn

As what I was looking for, for a late night flick? 9/10, absolutely.Plenty of people have cited poor decisions by the main characters. Honestly, if you pay attention at all, the i's are dotted and the t's are crossed. Now, not everyone has the same childhood, but, a bit of miscommunication, and bit of turning your eye to your kid doing something wrong -before- things have escalated? Uh.. yeah. It's all on point. It's all really on point. There was one, one part that went a bit outside of what you'd reasonably expect. One moment of suspension of disbelief. If that really turns you off to a movie like this... watch the history channel. And if the overall context and plot aren't appealing to you, why watch the movie anyway?Seriously. It's scary.

I would really love to see, that this goes on. And the story shows what happens after this, how will humans go against it, what is the origin of this kiddo, who or what is he, who sent him and why?
It has so much to explain, and it can be a great story.
Give it a chance, and think a bit more open minded, like, one alien like human gone bad. What if there are others? What if they are coming? What if they did this to get rid of him, so they can find a way to stop it.

It's all about a little boy of 12 killing people senselessly. It is never said why he does it. We know that he came to earth in a spaceship. Where does he comes from? Why is he on earth? Are there any others? All of these questions are neither answered nor asked. The boy asks about it in one scene, but this has no significant meaning. He just kills people.Apparently the boy is being bullied at school, but that doesn't get a memorable scene either. Is that why he's evil? Nobody knows. What is that?!?One scene suggests that he loves a girl from school. That doesn't really matter either. It's the reason he kills her mother, but he would have killed her without it because he's evil.In the end, the father wants to shoot his adopted son, but fails. He loves his son and decides pretty quickly to shoot him?!? The movie jumps from one event to the next without savoring a moment.On the other hand, the film stretches eerily in the middle. Nothing important happens. The boy realizes that he is an alien. That could have been dealt with in the first third of the movie. Then comes the climax and bang ... the movie is over.What???

This movie plays as though Lex wrote his interpretation of Kal El's arrival and rise on Earth. It's insanely dark and plays well on the ""nature vs. nurture"" theme.
Brightburn is well acted and well executed. Honestly, I didn't think a superhero movie and horror could go so well together, but it managed to pull it off.

1156,bloodbitchbang,Surprisingly well done in areas and middling to mediocre in others,7,28 May 2019,"Let's get it out of the way that this isn't like an alternate telling of the Superman origin story this is exactly what that is. For obvious copyright reasons they can't use any of the names for the characters or places or logos but if you have ever seen the Superman origin play out in another film or read it in a comic book or saw it in a cartoon that's exactly what you're looking at here only with more evil.The movie its self unintentionally feels like a masculine answer to De Palma's original Carrie, there is a bit about coming of age and awakening a power rooted in darkness for a young outcast along with a foreboding feeling of unease and tension through out the first half of the film, which comes in at svelte hour and thirty minutes. However, after the first half of the film is where most of the subtlety ends and they begin to hit you over the head with every grade school playground argument you ever had about what would happen if Superman did this or if Superman did that in terms of his destructive capabilities. The movie never gets boring, theres enough great visuals and decent performances by the three main actors, Elizabeth Banks does the lord's work by taking this material and elevating it above the spoof that it could have very easily been with a lesser actress, but with that aside the movie does get very predictable for anyone but I would think especially more so for fans with a deep affinity with Superman. It doesn't ruin the film but it will hinder it as something you would ever want to watch more than once.The movie so closely mimics Superman that it runs into the exact same set of writing hurdles that very few writers who've tackled the character of Superman have been able to overcome, like how do you keep a character compelling if he is invulnerable to physical harm, has super speed, flies and shoots lasers out of his eyes at will? Well, you can't. Especially when you take away the good guy small town Kansas well to do lovable farm boy Clark Kent personality and replace him with a 12 year old somewhere on the spectrum between an evil Vulcan from Star Trek and Darth Vader, before the gas mask and the torso mounted LiteBrite but not too far removed from the slaughter of younglings, and have you actually worry about Brandon (Aka Superkid) and what he's going through for better or worse he is the main character of the film and for him to be less a character by the end of the film and more a force of nature was a serious misstep for the film that spent so much time developing him but by the end to only have as much emotional resonance as a villain with the audience as the tornado chasing Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt did in Twister, was a real shame.There are some obvious huge chunks of this film missing, I hate it when a studio puts out a film only to try to gouge its audience with a later extended edition on home video but I think in the case of this movie that's probably warranted if not a little despicably greedy but I'm sure there was a studio exec somewhere telling the editors who cares when or how he made the iconic mask and cape that every body has seen in all the trailers and advertisements just get that runtime down to 90 minutes and lose the scenes.Anyways, Brightburn delivers on its premise of being a horror take on the Superman mythos. It delivers legitimate frights and suspense, nails the atmosphere provides some absolutely stomach churning scenes of gore without feeling too exploitative, and delivers some really great jump scares which are becoming a lost art in modern filmmaking.
Elizabeth Banks delivers probably her greatest performance I've ever seen her give in a film which is a misplaced effort, it really took me back to Sheryl Lee in Fire Walk With Me, just giving a devastatingly incredible performance in a film that doesn't deserve or require that sort of depth or range but for whatever reason that was Sheryl's shining moment in history to show us what an amazing actress she is and for whatever reason Brightburn was that same movie for Elizabeth Banks. There is some areas the film could have been more polished like a more elaborate ending to the film. There is a majorly cringe inducing sequel bait mid credits scene that even Shyamalan at the height of his time as a insipid self flagellating blowhard would have said, ""no way man, that's way too self important of a thing for me to do to my audience."" I'm hoping the mid credit scene was just there as something ironic and was only meant to further the films agenda as being a deconstruction of the exact superhero films that have these types of midcredits scenes. With that in mind I'll close the ramble with this, that while I enjoyed Brightburn and I would possibly even purchase an extended version on home video if the marketing is enticing enough, but I will not be showing up for Brightburn 2 or a spinoff based on evil Wonder Woman or Evil Aquaman.",Brightburn

It is clear that it attempts to act as a horror film which is perhaps understandable but only through jumpscares that are not built up to with suspense and gore which I personally don't find scary. A lot of the horror elements seemed out of place and essentially were not scary because of this. It is actually kind of funny and cringey how badly some of these 'scares' are carried out.Elements of mystery are present however I feel that there is no explanation on anything that is questioned. I get it, sometimes it's good to have unanswered questions but I felt like there was no plot otherwise! This boy is presented to us as evil for no reason whatsoever - we are not made clear of what motivates him in his evil ways. I just find it lazy and not well-thought out at all.This concept has been done before it is just a shame that this version does not live up to its older inspirations.

Trendy clothes, and artist, all around hip mom. It felt too contrived and so basic. I felt she was reaching for emotions majority of this movie, it felt forced and fell flat with me.Outside of my personal qualms with that character, this movie made no sense. Apparently they are supposed to be in Kansas and are farmers. But, it obviously isn't filmed in Kansas and what do they farm? There are only chickens seen in the film and not enough to bring in an income, no fields, no other livestock.There were so many throw in unnecessary details that made the movie muddled and confusing.

It was nothing more than a rage fueled snuff film for a boy coming to age and into puberty. There was no hope, no protagonist to match Brandon Bryant's rage, no possiblility of redemption for our main character, and no real story line except how a boy kills everyone in his life.

I was a bit skeptical of this one because I'm very picky when it comes to horror movies...but I ended up loving this one! The storyline was brilliant, the acting was superb, and the special effects were amazing. I'm not a huge fan of movies relying on too many jump scares, and there were quite a few in this one. However, the story and quality of the actors made this a wonderfully unusual horror movie. I feel like the recent Conjuring craze has gotten out of hand and we were overdue for something different, and this gem is just that. You can relate to the parent's anguish as the realization that their son is genuinely evil, particularly his mother's desire to defend her child and love him unconditionally, only to realize that the boy she nurtured is a danger to everyone. Jackson A. Dunn was phenomenal as Brandon. That kid knows how to act evil...without even saying much!

And why are there ONE MILLION jump-scares that all result in the exact same thing, and are all shown by flashing lights? This movie and this story had SO MUCH potential. That potential was put through an old, whiny paper shredder, and instead we got this.

I think this is because of the smaller budget. I don't know why but the version I saw in the cinema had the red band trailer's ""eye / glass shard"" scene removed.

Breyer get out of the house. if this movie was at least 120 minutes long, i feel like it could have shown a good side to Brandon, and then realize that he doesn't like the american way and wants to just murder people when he doesn't get his way, and we could have gotten longer extended scenes showing the murders getting pieced together and then in the end find out that it was Brandon doing all these things all along.

1236,ivysun,This film opens a new chapter of Superhero and definitely sets a high bar!,9,24 May 2019,"Brightburn is an unforgettable origin story unlike any ever seen before, it can be categorized as both superhero and horror genres, and in each of these categories, it is unique and exciting!I love the deliciously wicked ""what if"" scenario asking what a bad superman would look like! I think the writer and director of ""Brightburn"" did a brilliant job in elaborating the refreshing idea. The tension and the thrills were genuinely great, and there are many moments that truly give me chills.The Superhero universe mostly created by Marvel and DC always assume superpowers equal superheroes and indeed human's best friends, but will it be the case in reality? Power always comes with a great risk of danger. Imagine if a superpower arrives on earth, humans look as vulnerable to him as ants to us, is he more likely to protect or destroy us? Do we humans ever show mercy to other species below us in the chain? I think ""Brightburn"" plots a ""superhero on earth"" scenario with a higher likelihood to reality than Marvel and DC did. If there is an alien baby appearing at our doorstep, we know that the baby might grow up to become a much more intelligent and powerful creature than human being, will we raise him up or kill him while we still can?In ""Brightburn"", the kind..or ignorant couple (Elizabeth Banks and David Denman) decided to keep the baby, but it turned out to be the biggest nightmare of their life.At some point of the film, I was still expecting to see a twist where the child would turn out good again, but it never happened... I am glad that the story wasn't written in that cliché way. The film ended on a bleak note, which I hope, implies the sequel is on the way!Excellent performance from the young actor Jackson Dunn, the scene that he suddenly had a wicked and evil smile appearing on his cute and innocent face gave me chills...Overall, I love how superhero and horror intersect in ""Brightburn"", it is definitely a perfectly entertaining film for fans of both genres!",Brightburn

This 'what if' Superman story is a tense, intriguing descent into hell. It's a parents worse nightmare of what their child could become if they obtained super powers. Both Elizabeth Banks and David Denman play their role as Brandon Bryer's parents well with a believeable relationship. Jackson Dunn who played the murderous villain Brandon also plays his character very well. This film is a slow burn at first until the final third part becomes a fiery chaos. The film really does a good job of creating a world of hell and impending doom on the horizon.Certain moments in this film will definitely have you on the edge of your seat and cringeful stomach churning Gorey moment's. There's a lot for us nerdy people to be amazed by in this movie and notice the many references and parallels to other super hero movies *cough man of steel *cough.I will say that for all the good in this movie there is some issues I had with it. For one I do wish there was more horror. The horror in it is great don't get me wrong but it just feels it moves on too quickly to each horrific scene. The horror sequences are only really towards the end. It could do with exploring Brandon's powers a little more and maybe show a little bit more F**cked up scenes of messy brutality in a slow and rising way.Make no mistake and go see this movie, it's short , brutal and enjoyable.Also stick around of the end credits. They open up a world of possibilities.",Brightburn

1249,szilay-38885,"Terrifying, surprising, serious!",10,12 May 2019,"Finally a superhero movie for adults, this movie had no candy-lovely-cutie. This movie was more a normal horror-drama-thriller, and not full of sci-fi or superheroes. We saw a lil guy, just like superman, but the story made him angry to the world, so does the ship he came, telling him that the world is his --> this is the main difference to Superman story. This world is his, and he is so chilled, clever and confident here eithout any fear. The lil guy acting was briliant, the story was great, it is not like a Marvel movie, we dont have much characters, like only Brandon is who we need to know. And yeah, the movie was a horror - not so hard, but it was so creepy cos Brandon could do whatever he wanted, so he didnt hurry nowhere, made his decisions slowly and quite smartly. Okay too much word, go and watch the Brightburn, it will be the best Superhero experience for you!",Brightburn

1252,thanospoulimenos,Worst Movie I've watched in 2019,1,28 December 2019,"Everything was bad. From the acting, to the story line. Some effects and graphics were done well but that's about it. I was just laughing the whole time. I think it's more of a comedy than a horror film. Do not waste your time :)",Brightburn
1253,carliebethfox,Left a bad taste in my mouth,4,12 June 2019,"Bad characters, badly timed gore, predictable choices. No level of suspense. Huge letdown. No good villain building, he just snapped one second and the audience was left confused as to why he started killing everyone. motivations were lame with little explanation and My friends and i couldn't get behind anything and a lot of things made us uncomfortable but not in a good way....",Brightburn
