0,Prismark10,Fatherhood,3,5 July 2021,"Kevin Hart gets serious in Fatherhood. Sony sold the dramedy to Netflix.Based on a true story. Maybe Lifetime or Hallmark would had been better. There is a movie of the week spin to it with dashings of mawkishness and syrupy sentimentality.Matt is a tech engineer who ends up balancing work life and being a single parent. His wife died soon after giving birth to their baby daughter.Matt unwisely turns down help from his mother and mother in law and raises his daughter Maddie single handedly. A life he is unprepared for, he nearly loses his job.The film has Matt struggling to change nappies or stop the baby crying. Later the movie skips forward a few years as the older Maddie goes to a Catholic school with a strict uniform policy. Only Maddie prefers trousers to skirts.Overlong and over sentimental. It is a lifeless, paint by numbers movie. Matt is portrayed as a saint. The comedy is non existent and it was done better in Three Men and a Baby over 30 years ago.",Fatherhood
1,Calicodreamin,Cute,6,22 June 2021,"Loved Kevin Hart in this, he played the role perfectly, using some comedy but sticking mostly to the drama and being serious. The storyline flowed well but the ""all falls apart"" felt forced and wasn't necessary.",Fatherhood
2,deloudelouvain,Snorefest...,5,5 September 2021,"I can't say I fit the profile for the right audience for this movie. My wife liked it more than me. Maybe it's her mother instinct, which I doubt as she has none and she's definitely not really into kids. I'm for sure not, I don't like kids, so watching a movie about raising one is just not my idea of fun. Fun, I thought it would be, because of Kevin Hart, a comedian that I can appreciate and that makes me laugh but in this case there's just not much comedy to it. Instead you get a very cliché story, the kind where you know exactly what is going to happen next and that's again not my idea of fun when watching a movie. I guess the people that scored this with the maximum ten stars (that's just crazy in my humble opinion) are the people that find it all cute, and that liked seeing Kevin Hart playing a more dramatical part. There was definitely too much drama, too much fuzz about basically nothing. I thought it was boring, certainly the second part. It's all much too cheesy to be entertaining. The movie was at least an hour too long. I was really waiting for the end to come with impatience this time.",Fatherhood
3,Thanos_Alfie,Kevin Hart...,6,16 July 2021,"""Fatherhood"" is a Comedy - Drama movie in which we watch a father bringing up his baby daughter alone after the sudden death of his wife. He faces many difficulties and obstacles on his way but he tries his best to overcome them and give everything to his daughter.I liked this movie because despite its simple plot it presents very well the difficulties of single parenting and how the person has to deal with society, family and the obstacles which have to surpass. The interpretation of Kevin Hart who played as Matt Logelin was really a surprise for me and I believe that he did an excellent job. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Melody Hurd's who played as Maddy Logelin, Alfre Woodard's who played as Marion and DeWanda Wise's who played as Swan. All in all, I have to say that ""Fatherhood"" is a beautiful family movie and I recommend you to watch it because it presents single parenting with its true face.",Fatherhood
4,cruise01,Kevin Hart delivers an emotional great performance in this comedy drama.,7,26 July 2021,3.5 out of 5 stars.Fatherhood is a pretty fair drama film. That has a story about a newly father. Raising his baby daughter alone. After his wife passes during child birth.It is a feel good emotional story. About a father doing whatever it takes to be the best father there is. While trying to maintain his career. And making sure his daughter is safe.Great performances. Strong story. The film does not seem to have any conflict to oppose to what the character is trying to overcome.,Fatherhood
5,eddie_baggins,An uninspired true life dramedy,4,26 September 2021,"Based on a touching true life memoir from Matt Logelin that details the firsthand experiences he had raising his first daughter when his wife tragically passed away, Netflix's high profile release Fatherhood (that is in no way connected to the Parenthood franchise) see's director Paul Weitz team up with a dialed back Kevin Hart to deliver a pedestrian affair that while having it's heart in the right place, fails to make much of an impact as either a drama or a comedy seeped in real life scenarios.Starting out promising enough with Hart working in a similar space as he did with The Upside from a few years ago and showing off a different side to his smart talking persona that has established him as one of the modern era's biggest comedic forces, Fatherhood suffers just as many other recent Paul Weitz films have also over recent times from a sense of by the numbers delivery and failed opportunities, as our initial interest quickly gives way to a struggle to stay engaged in a film that lacks the spark to make it fly.It's hard to remember that at one stage Weitz was part of the creative duo behind comedy classics such as About a Boy and American Pie, with his last twenty or so years in Hollywood failing to inspire much in the way of content worth recalling and that lazy and lethargic direction is found throughout Fatherhood, with many ripe and potentially fantastic moments in Logelin's parental struggles passing the film by to feel like nothing more than a checklist of familiar scenarios delivered in unsurprising and non-engaging ways.It's a shame this is the case as alongside Hart Weitz had the talented Alfre Woodard, Lil Rel Howery and the rising star power of DeWanda Wise at his disposal but all these performers are underutilized in poorly designed side characters and uninspired scenes with Hart left too do the films heavy lifting through his restrained performance, that at times you wish was allowed a little more breathing room to create a more flavorsome offering that is too clean and workmanlike for its own good.Being based on a true story and being relatable to anyone that exists amongst a family unit, Fatherhood should've been something a little more than what we get here but as it stands it ends up being nothing more than another quickfire Netflix original that will gain some initial wins for the streaming service but quickly disappear into its growing back catalogue of watchable but low-level films.Final Say -While its nice to see Kevin Hart try his hand at something a little more meaningful and while the story at the heart of this tale is well-intentioned and pleasant, Fatherhood does nothing we haven't seen before and was in dire need of more laughs or emotional highs.2 poker games out of 5.",Fatherhood

7,lisafordeay,Nice film based on real life events on being a single parent,7,18 June 2021,"Fatherhood is a 2021 Netflix/Columbia Pictures Comedy Drama starring Kevin Hart,Melody Hurd,Deborah Ayorinde and Alfre Woodard. Directed by Chris Weiz(who was
the writer for About A Boy) and based on a novel by Matthew Logelin titled Two Kisses For Maddy: A Memoir Of Loss and Love. The story is about Matthew Logelin(Hart) an African American who's been with his wife Liz(Deborah Ayorinde) since they were kids. However when Matt's wife is pregnant and has to go under a C Section for her baby,tragedy strikes when Liz dies leaving Matt heartbroken as he is left to rear his daughter Maddy(Melody Hurd) on his own without a mother figure for his child. While struggling with Maddy,Matt later meets a woman named Swan(DeWanda) and he strikes a relationship with her. But is he moving too quick or will he learn the challenges of being a single parent as well as facing obstacles along the way?Alot of people may be baffled as to why they cast an African American for Matt Logelin instead of a Causcian but I didn't pass any remarks on the casting for this film.Kevin Hart was very good in this film(he also served as a producer too with Chris Weiz), as I am so used to seeing him as the wise cracking buddy of Dwanye Johnson and being typecast in alot of his films.I've always loved Kevin Hart so that's why I watched it. If your a fan of Kevin Harts do check it out on Netflix.B.",Fatherhood
8,yusufpiskin,Good for Kevin Hart,6,26 June 2021,"Firstly ; Kevin Hart is an actor. He hinted at this with The upside, but it shows he's a great actor here. It's interesting why he didn't show it before that.The movie is a complete Paul Weitz movie. It gives the audience what it promises.",Fatherhood
9,jewelch,Ok watch,5,25 June 2021,Kevin Heart never dissapoints so far - even though this movie is not that typical comedy which Kevin is. But few joke lines saved it - so if you watch it with couple it will be a good one James Welch Henderson Arkansas 6/18/21.,Fatherhood
10,masonsaul,Great comedy drama,8,20 June 2021,"Whilst the ending is very generic, Fatherhood is still a great comedy drama that's emotional, heartwarming and really funny. Kevin Hart gives an incredible lead performance that's more emotional than usual and Alfre Woodard, Melody Hurd, Lil Rel Howery, DeWanda Wise and Anthony Carrigan are all great. Paul Weitz's direction is excellent and it's well filmed and extremely well paced. The music by Rupert Gregson-Williams is really good.",Fatherhood
11,richard-1787,A remarkable movie,9,23 June 2021,"This movie stars a very fine actor who looks remarkably like the comedian Kevin Hart. In fact, he looks so much like Hart that the producers have tried to pass him off as Hart - no doubt to capitalize on Hart's popularity. I don't think this actor has to worry about being sued by Hart for impersonation or anything like that, however. This actor is so good, gives such a powerful and often deeply moving performance, that Hart must be hoping that viewers believe it is actually Hart.I myself spent much of this movie wondering if the person I saw on screen could possibly actually be Kevin Hart. Is that possible????The actor, whoever he may be in real life, gets strong support from Alfre Woodard as the mother-in-law who cannot forgive him, a child actress who does not play cute, and a script that, more often than not, avoids the obvious and the cheap laugh, delivering instead a punch right in the emotional gut. This movie is not always easy to watch. But it is impossible to stop watching.If you don't like Kevin Hart's previous movies - and I didn't care for some of them - watch this. You will be amazed. If you did like his previous movies, watch it as well. You will also be amazed. It's an amazing movie.",Fatherhood
12,rannynm,"Expect the unexpected in Kevin Hart's new drama film, Fatherhood!",8,21 June 2021,"Expect the unexpected with Kevin Hart's new drama film, Fatherhood! The comedian takes his acting to another level and shows us a more serious side, still with a little humor, while delivering a heartwarming, tear-jerking family film. Fatherhood is based off the 2011 memoir Two Kisses for Maddy: A Memoir of Loss and Love by Matt Logelin and highlights the challenges and triumphs of being a single parent.In Fatherhood, Matt Logelin (Kevin Hart) and his wife, Liz (Deborah Ayorinde) welcome a baby girl named Maddy (Melody Hurd) into the world. A day after giving birth, Liz passes away from complications, leaving Matt as a single parent raising his daughter. He has no idea where to start, but, with the help of his family and friends along the way, he has to figure out a way to raise her.The main characters in this film are Matt, Liz, Maddy, Lizzie ""Swan"" (DeWanda Wise) and Marian (Alfre Woodard). My overall favorite part in this film is how Matt and Maddy's relationship grows as they go along. Usually, the parents are the ones teaching the lessons in life, but it was nice to see Maddy also be able to teach her father. Maddy is actually my favorite character for this reason. I enjoyed seeing her help Matt become a better father throughout the film. Even though this film is a drama, the director, Paul Weitz, uses creative ways to add humor. For example, there is a scene where baby Maddy looks back and forth between two ""crazy"" people talking and the camera pans back and forth showing us the scene from her perspective.The message of this film is that you should not be afraid to ask for help when you need it, especially from your family and friends. Matt refuses help because he thinks he can handle everything by himself, even though he has no idea what he is doing. But eventually realizes maybe he does need some help to get him on the right track. Parents need to be aware of adults drinking and mild profanity and themes about death.Fatherhood is a very uplifting film that will tap into your emotions. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for kids ages 11 to 18. Adults will enjoy it as well. Fatherhood comes out June 18, 2021 on Netflix. Reviewed by Tiana S., KIDS FIRST!",Fatherhood
13,arungeorge13,"Breaks no new narrative ground, but stays watchable throughout! [+51%]",5,19 June 2021,"On the upside, we get to see Kevin Hart tapping into his dramatic side for a change. The humour thankfully doesn't go the crude or slapstick route. It's mostly situational (and weird in a few instances, like the whole thing around the eulogy), working in the film's favor. A few emotional scenes are well executed, which helps connect with Hart's character somewhat better.On the downside, the narrative beats are too familiar and predictable. I feel the film would have played out finer if it was 90 minutes or less as it offers no storytelling surprises. The final act is a bit of a stretch, with every little cliché thrown right in. The supporting acts are pretty plain and straightforward, with Lil Rel Howery seeming the most out of place. Given that it is Father's Day weekend and the world's still recovering from a pandemic, I see this feel-good flick having some takers.",Fatherhood
14,saadgkhan,Kevin's Vanity Project,3,24 June 2021,"Fatherhood - C (Mediocre)I get that Kevin got Netflix money, which allows him to do whatever he wants from putting out unfunny/untried humourless homemade Standups to optioning off a White Father daughter's story in to a movie to show his dramatic acting chops.I believed the movie is watchable if you're on your phone. The biggest problem is that every scene or scenarios in the movie have been seen hundreds of times on celluloid. I felt i have seen this before, there is no new take or presentation from the director except that Kevin Hart in a drama movie.Kevin Hart needs to take sometime out and reevaluate his choices and craft as an artist. Honestly, i'm tired of seeing his face slapped on everything he is not even suitable for at all. From untouchables remake to this...",Fatherhood
15,gianmarcoronconi,Fun and heartwarming at the same time,10,20 July 2021,This film is a show and is as deep and beautiful as few others. Although very heavy and difficult to hold it can well dampen everything with a bit of comedy.,Fatherhood

How his father mostly along with family and friend companions help her grow is what the movie is about.Cinematography & Direction: Justified. The filming around hospital, around school, around cities, around housing, around play spots, around bar, etc. Have been captured well.Acting (& music): Acting is average. Music is good. In bits and parts music entertains us.Final Verdict: The story is great in in first- two thirds. It falls weak in last third. They could have done more justice and left the incidences as they should be. Instead to make it a concluding show, they degraded the movie. If it would have been the other case critics would have liked it even more.Patience & emotional vulnerability are the issues highlighted in the beginning of movie. Well I certainly have experienced the same and totally agree with them. But I also feel a man can learn. Damn it, it really becomes rocket science to unfold a baby carrier.I watched this movie on Father's day and for most of it, it was engaging and enjoyable.

19,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Okay film,6,27 June 2021,"It's a fine film but not exactly what I was expecting. The film is high on sappiness and low on comedy. It is a good family or watch-with-the-girlfriend film. I had to watch it over two days because I lost interest in the first 50 minutes. Then I watched the second half two days later.I was just expecting more comedy from Kevin. The good thing is that he proves he is more than just a comedian. He did a good acting performance. But the film really needed more comedy to liven up the mood instead of the self deprecating role ""I am not good enough to be her father"" Shtick. When I watch a Kevin Hart show, I want to be entertained, not brought down.",Fatherhood

21,kjproulx,A Very Sweet Story with a lot of Cliches,7,24 June 2021,"When it comes to feel-good films, saying that I'm a sucker for them is an understatement. Yes, a lot of them feel similar to one another in terms of their messages, but if it's well-made it usually gets me. Fatherhood has just dropped on Netflix and even though it's filled with cliches, it's a very heartwarming story that I found impossible to dislike. I've also never seen Kevin Hart dive into drama the way he did here before, so that also elevated it for me. Even though it's far from perfect, here's why I recommend checking it out.After giving birth to their daughter, Liz (Deborah Ayorinde) passes away unexpectedly, leaving Matt (Kevin Hart) to raise young Maddy on his own. Not knowing how to handle the situation and not looking for any new relationships or help, he puts himself in a very tough spot. Upon giving it his all to take care of his daughter and meeting someone new, this film eventually becomes a light-hearted story of a Father and his Daughter. There were a few narrative choices that were on the verge of losing me as a viewer, but I accepted them and was able to move on. This film strives to be sweet and tug at your heartstrings and it absolutely did that for me.Other than films like Top Five or The Upside, I've always been a fan of Hart's dramatic side. I believe this is the first major release to place him front and center the entire time, hardly giving him any time to shine in terms of comedy. There were multiple times where his dialogue or the way he would react to situations, had me in tears. This film isn't amazing or anything, but the touching moments really hit home for me. If for nothing else, Fatherhood hits all the right emotional beats.Overall, this is a very simplistic movie in that it really only strives to be a Father/Daughter film. In that regard, it works wonderfully and I loved watching it. When looking back on the film as a whole though, it definitely has a lot of predictable elements and many of the secondary characters are crutches for Matt. Everyone seems to be helping him and forwarding him in the right direction, which in turn never really gives him any down moments, other than the overall situation itself. Fatherhood has issues, but I thought it was very sweet and I recommend checking it out.",Fatherhood
22,Movi3DO,"Predictable story, but still feel good",7,18 June 2021,"Well I learned two ways babies poop and how Kevin Hart described them.A brand new Netflix film starring Kevin Hart as a single father trying to raise his daughter.When I saw Kevin Hart being the character in the movie, I automatically assumed that it was a comedy. Well, I was half wrong. It's mostly a drama with quite a bit of comedy. Instead of being goofy, Kevin played a calm and sad father who was still recovering from the death of his wife. He portrayed the character well and I bought his emotion and struggle as a grieving father.The first half was Kevin Hart struggling with taking care of the screaming baby. It wasn't a surprise that Kevin's character almost lost his marbles. It's every parents' early worst nightmare. I bet my mom related to this because she often told me about how she used to raise me. Overall, this part and the montage provided good comedy and weird situations that many parent would laugh and relate to.The meat of the story was the relationship between the father and the daughter characters, and I enjoyed their chemistry a lot. The girl who played the daughter was good and she showed the strong and a bit rebellious side of the character. In addition, they also dealt with another character coming into their life. They all were sweet and had fun moments together.The story itself was done many times before. There wasn't anything surprising or shocking that made this movie stand out. The side characters were straightforward and each only had one job to do in the movie. The conflict and ending in the movie were also obvious, and sometimes even felt overdramatic. However, the sweet relationship between the main characters and the comedy made me feel good and smile often. Not gonna lie, but I still feel emotional despite the predictability.Overall, a story that was done before, but I still felt good and satisfied. 7.5/10.",Fatherhood
23,msbreviews,"Despite the overlong stay, it's a movie I can see helping a lot of parents in similar situations while being entertaining and enlightening at the same time for other viewers.",6,15 July 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)There are many films about parenthood, but Fatherhood caught my attention due to the main actor and the director. Kevin Hart (Jumanji: The Next Level) is one of the most recognizable, famous faces in comedy, so seeing him bring it down to portray a more grounded character dealing with an emotionally devastating moment in life is captivating, to say the least. In addition to this, Paul Weitz, one of the directors of American Pie, is directing this Netflix flick. How can someone not feel remotely interested in watching the final result?Fatherhood may go through the usual plot developments and character building of the genre, but Hart offers a brilliant performance as the compelling protagonist who will grab every viewer's attention. The actor proves yet again that he isn't a one-trick pony, seamlessly incorporating the complex feelings of his character. From losing the woman he loves to raising a child on his own, the accumulated emotions keep the movie worth investing in. Alfre Woodard (The Lion King) is terrific as always, but Lil Rel Howery (Judas and the Black Messiah) isn't really able to overcome the script issues when it comes to the comedic bits.The jokes themselves are acceptable, but they're often inserted at the wrong moment. There are many scenes where a joke could have helped lighten the heavy, depressing atmosphere, but they're saved for dialogues that don't require them. Howery is usually hilarious, but in this film, his character genuinely feels a bit irritating. Despite the overlong stay, it's a movie I can see helping a lot of parents in similar situations while being entertaining and enlightening at the same time for other viewers.Rating: B-",Fatherhood
24,nathanmanson,"Yep, I cried",6,23 June 2021,"Can't even lie I fully cried. However just because I cried doesn't mean it wasn't boring because at times it was crazy boring. The story was good, the acting was really good from Kevin hart. It made me laugh and as I said it made me cry but it was just a bit slow and predictable to get a 7 or more. At the end of the day on the bigger picture a 6 really isn't that bad so I'm not going to defend myself anymore about the 6. It's a decent rating for a decent sad film.",Fatherhood

26,trinaboice,Respect for Kevin Hart,9,20 June 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
This lovely dramedy was directed by Paul Weitz. He also wrote the screenplay with Dana Stevens based on the book by Matt Logelin called Two Kisses for Maddy: A Memoir of Loss & Love. The story has a devastating premise: a father brings up his baby girl as a single dad after the unexpected death of his wife who died a day after their daughter's birth. The story is actually Matt Logelin's true story about when his wife died. It's heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time. This is Columbia Pictures' very first Netflix movie.THINGS I LIKED:
Kevin Hart used to drive me nuts because he always played the same character who was basically an angry, screaming man. Sure, he was funny, but I thought that was all he could do. My respect for him soared when I saw him REALLY act in the movie The Upside. Great movie! His career has now taken on another life and direction. I'm so proud of him for taking on very challenging roles and impressed with how much his acting range has grown. I'm now a solid fan. He gives an excellent performance in this movie and I can't wait to see what else he can do. The success of this movie truly falls on his shoulders but he is definitely up to the task.The movie isn't really a comedy like you might expect since it stars Kevin Hart, but more of a drama where you really get to watch him stretch right before your eyes. That being said, there is some humor.I also thought the rest of the cast was solid, including Alfre Woodard, Lil Rel Howery, and DeWanda Wise among others.Melody Hurd is completely adorable as young Maddy. She's already done quite a bit of work in Hollywood and has a bright future.There are some cliched moments, but they're still very heartfelt. There are a lot of touching moments if you don't mind the manipulative cheesy ones.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The film doesn't dive very deep into all of the nuances of fatherhood, but it absolutely shows the essence of what it means to be a man who takes his role of fatherhood as seriously as it should be. In this age of the cancel culture, even the name ""father"" is being threatened with legislation emerging in some places to rob that respectful title from men. The truth is that mothers and fathers parent differently and each fills very important roles in the lives of our children.I thought it was strange that none of the grandparents offered to move near the single father to help him raise the little girl. If this situation happened to one of my sons, I would be next to his side in a second. The script doesn't really give us reasons why the grandparents weren't able to move closer to him, even though they appeared to be retired. Instead, they pressure him to move to them.Surprisingly, some of the humor doesn't land. The trailer makes you think this movie is going to be a pure comedy, but it's really so much more than just a couple of hours of laughs.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

Kids crave boundaries and letting your little girl wear boy's clothes is letting them be the parent. That leads to confusion for the kid. And breaking up with an angel is just dumb. LOL!

I watched this film whilst taking care of my daughter at the same time so being a parent really helped seeing this film in a different light.

Overall rating 81/100A father brings up his baby girl as a single dad after the unexpected death of his wife who died a day after their daughters birth. It's a story about grief, acceptance and moving on for your own happiness.Despite being predictable, fatherhood was a fantastic and refreshing drama/comedy with a lot of heart. I liked the set up for the character development. The character background and how the flashbacks were structured at the beginning were great. The movie had such a great amount of emotional weight, it was so moving and has stuck with me. The film had a really nice charming tone and was filled with loads of heartwarming moments. Kevin Hart did a fantastic job here, showing that he can do serious roles excellently. Other cast standouts were Alfre Woodard, DeWanda Wise and Melody Hurd. The themes on grief and being a single dad were excellently handled with loads of depth and it was refreshing to see. I also liked the themes on allowing your children to decide what they want to do not based on gender stereotypes. The movie also had some great humour that felt authentic and not forced. The character conflict, development and depth was surprisingly strong. I also liked the representation this movie had with different communities and illnesses. The cast had fantastic chemistry, and balanced out the character conflict excellently. The plot developed nicely, and the ending despite being predictable, was heartwarming and satisfying.However, there was a few issues I had. I would have liked more background into Matt's relationship with Liz just so the scenes could have that little bit more impact. There was some generic narrative moments and opinions on men being a father and single dad. I thought some of the characters were fairly insensitive and unlikeable to the main character and how he was grieving. It was very predictable in terms of plotting. There was a jarring shift in time. And some of the humour, especially in the first half felt forced and caused a slight tonal confusion making the serious scenes less enjoyable or impactful.Overall, Fatherhood offers nothing that you haven't seen before with its predictability. But its charming cast and performances, and the authentic handling of the deeper themes makes this film stand out from the crowd with its emotional resonance.",Fatherhood

34,zac-04879,A Wonderful Feel-Good Tale,7,18 June 2021,"Kevin Hart delivers a touching performance in this heartfelt, teary and humorous parent tale. Fatherhood is a predictable but entertaining comedy-drama about a widowed father struggling to care for his daughter, making it unquestionable that Hart fans will definitely appreciate the comical aspect of this film.Having Kevin Hart star as a struggling father is a nice eye-opener. He has the ability to take the dialogue and mix it with realistic emotions, in which the film wouldn't have been that engaging or enjoyable if that weren't the case. The acting is followed by several elements mainly including parent-child struggles, so by the end, Fatherhood successfully submits the heartfelt message to its satisfied audience.Despite the delightful story and laughter, Fatherhood isn't a film that necessarily stands out to other comedy-dramas or parenthood tales. Yes, it's a little satisfactory and average, but it's enough to keep older kids entertained.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Fatherhood

36,novagirl11,not as funny/feel-good as I thought,6,26 July 2021,"Some parts were funny, but mostly emotional and dramatic.

Also, I did enjoy seeing lots of scenes filmed in Boston :)",Fatherhood
37,nidhunmoviebuff,A terrific Kevin Hart elevates this cliched father-daughter comedy,7,18 June 2021,"Director Paul Weitz's emotional comedy Fatherhood dropped on this special Fathers Day weekend, with the excellent Kevin Harte essaying the role of a recently widowed father of an infant.Everything from him coming to terms with his wife's passing to learning to care for his young baby girl is portrayed with so much grace, deft wit and charm that you are hooked from the onset.Kevin Hart displays there he is so much more than your average funny man, excelling in the emotionally charged scenes, especially the exchanges with his daughter, portrayed by the instant show-stealer, Melody Hurd.As expected, the comedy leaves you in splits, especially those unleashed by the insanely funny Lil Reid Howery, who excels as Hart's best bud 'Jordan'.Fatherhood doesn't break new ground or add anything fresh to the genre, yet it leaves you emotionally satisfied. A relatable coming-of-age comedy-drama where the dad matures emotionally, along with his child.The perfect fathers day weekend watch. Recommended.",Fatherhood
38,robawalker-77417,Cute movie,6,19 June 2021,This was a sweet and cute movie/story. It definitely brought a lot of ups and downs throughout. It really didn't capture my attention the entire time but it was good for what it is.,Fatherhood

40,bmiller59,"not being a fan,...........",8,26 July 2021,"I was shocked how enjoyable Fatherhood was. Never been a fan of Kevin Hart, he's annoying with his taking over any part/role/presence of when the camera is on him. Everyone I interact with says that I'm crazy.....OK....we all have different perspective of people.Kevin Hart was awesome in Fartherhood. I was really drawn to his tenderness and compassion (yea, I know, it was in the script.)This was a great script and talked to me from beginning to end. I may even enjoy him more.Great movie......see it and be emotionally moved.",Fatherhood
41,OneAnjel,Important story but extremely slow,5,22 October 2021,"This film has a lot of meaning. It touches on not only fathers who lose their partner but on the epidemic of fatherless homes in our black communities. Here, Kevin plays a father who is both scared and excited to see his first baby born. He's a rising executive who anticipated his wife to be the main caregiver of the child. Then the unthinkable happens. The film uses an otherwise idyllic setting as a backdrop to meander through Matt's juxtaposed perspectives, desires, and fears with some cheesy jokes sprinkled in--Not intended for mixed audiences.All in all, I appreciate the message of the film. I appreciate that Hart ventured to do a more serious role and it was nice to see that he can really act. But it was superficial, overall. They tried to toss in some funny moments, but few are more than chuckle-worthy. There was the cliché of the father raising a tom-boy who he teaches how to play cards and talk mean (and the cliché that tom-boys all talk mean and wear pants).I was a little confused early in the film when in one scene Maddy is a newborn and in the next scene she's a 4 mo old sitting in a baby swing. Seemed like we've skipped ahead a few months. But then we see the infant again and the grandparents are leaving-- meaning it's merely days later, not months. I know producers use several babies in a film that has only one baby character, but it couldn't have been that hard for these producers to find enough who were the right age/size?The film was very slow-paced and the super-slow piano music in every scene only emphasized that. I wouldn't watch it again but it was an interesting film.",Fatherhood

The story is really sad, something i really feel sorry for him, even if this is only a movie.The movie confused me and lost me at that scene where he goes to his mother in law for the kids christening, they sit both in his wife bedroom and next scene is with Maddie grown up, no ""x years later"" or some transition, they simple moved from a few months to kindergarten, that really confused me a bit and I didnt liked it.",Fatherhood

I did find it a little funny and that death scene boy that made me feel bad for the lad. I got all emotional when the women died. I found the baby to look cute but I guess that's not saying much but she did look nice and I love Babies. But I found this movie to not be relatable and sometimes very boring.

49,seanhmoss6,I loved it.,7,3 July 2021,"This film scratches another layer of Kevin Hart's talents. I cannot say for sure how deep that scratch can go. I think there is a little bloom that he's coaxing to grow. I saw his mastery of comedy give way to a broader range. He held his own with excellent, established actors without trying to own the scene. I look forward to seeing more of him in films that stretch his range. WATCH THIS MOVIE!",Fatherhood
50,Harry_Gleeson,A Heartwarming film where Kevin Hart shines.,7,26 June 2021,"Overall Fatherhood was a film told with heart and warmth. Focusing on sensitive subjects such as grief and loss takes real emotion from the filmmakers and cast in order for the audience to understand it from a characters perspective and I feel this film got it right in moments.Kevin Hart was the takeaway from the film, his performance was very commendable being as he's a comedian, yes he was his comedic self in parts but when the heart was needed for the film to hit, he was great.The narrative plays out in the way I thought it would which is cliche, but I didn't think this would be the best film I'd ever see. Instead it's one to be appreciated because of the message behind it.No one can truly dislike the film because that would be harsh, it's about a lot of life's various challenges and dealing them differentlyA film that even if it isn't great, it can be appreciatedQuote - 'Wherever you are, I wanna go there too'Rating - 3/5.",Fatherhood
51,ansharora-12638,Kevin Hart hit every point right,8,18 June 2021,"Never thought this man could be as good an emotional actor as he is a comedian. The story is simple, beautiful and very relatable for most. Hardships faced by a young single parent to raise a child not as an infant but also as a pre-teen which can be very tough. Tough how, balancing your life all around your child to give them a healthy surrounding with no one else to rely on. You don't wanna miss your golden years but at the same time you don't want to ruin your kid's life by giving no attention.Hart played the role very well, according to his capacity and the demand of the story. Some greag actors are in it, often forgotten but always a delight to see. A good family-friendly movie to watch this Father's Day, cheers!",Fatherhood

53,and_shove_it_up_your_butt,Loved!!,9,22 June 2021,"I loved everything about this movie. Kevin Hart fell off (with me) after making his back to back to back comedy specials to where I didn't want to even hear his name for at least a year or two. I'm so glad he switched gears a bit and Fatherhood was the perfect vehicle for him to do so. This was the realest, most endearing performance I've seen from him ever. He was funny, but not over the top and I want to give him credit for knowing how to pull back and be more subtle. I hope to see him in more roles that allow him to not be the butt of every ""little man"" joke.Little Melody is one of the cutest kids to grace the screen. Everything about her is captivating. Fatherhood is a treat for the spirit. You won't be disappointed.",Fatherhood

The realisation at the end that he could still find love and be happy.I thought all the actors handled it very well, and there was some really funny moments.It is a nice film one to just loose yourself in.",Fatherhood
55,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,"Fatherhood tells a simple story right, Kevin Hart gives a touching performance",8,27 June 2021,"Fatherhood is a touching family drama that confidently finds its charm in realism, rather than melodrama or gags, and manages to be engaging through simplicity and a heartfelt performance from Kevin Hart.After the unexpected death of his wife during childbirth, Matt Logelin must raise his newborn baby daughter Maddy as a single parent, balancing his own career, love life, and pressure from his mother-in-law Marion, who wants to raise Maddy herself.Paul Weitz crafts Fatherhood carefully like a delicate soufflé with the correct measured portions of drama and comedy. It is definitively a drama first. The worst nightmare of being a single parent is presented in a realistic fashion, but not morbidly so. Fatherhood explores its subject with earnest, never succumbs to the fear of boring the audience, and stays steadily on course to the end.Kevin Hart shelves his usual hyperactive comedic persona and shows a broader never-seen-before dramatic range, delivering a sensitive raw performance. Hart's comedic talents are used to a lesser degree, only to bring levity to situations that call for it.Hart and Melody Hurd, the child actress who plays Maddy, share great chemistry as father and daughter. At such a young age, Hurd projects intelligence naturally, something that is usually annoyingly manufactured in movies. Their dynamic plays authentically and will have audiences reaching for the tissues.Fatherhood will probably be overlooked due to its non-showy nature. Its intended audience, such as parents or soon-to-be parents, will find it thoughtful, endearing and a good cry. I could see now what Kevin Smith was actually trying to attempt with Jersey Girl years ago and how hard it is to tell a simple story like this well. Fatherhood achieves that.",Fatherhood
56,panta-4,Another dramedy,6,23 June 2021,"This is a second film with Kevin Hart venturing into the ""dramedy"" category. Following up 2019's The Upside, Fatherhood has a kind of a plot full with melancholy which brings the film to a borderline of boredom but the persistent positivity and his humour saved it few times during the 1 hour and 49 minutes on the screen.A simple feel-good movie, watchable and far from spectacular.",Fatherhood

My IMDb rating: 8/10
My Letterboxd rating: 4/5Not a lot to say about this movie except it's a beautiful, heart-warming movie about life after the death of a loved one that Kevin Hart was able to nail. He proved in this one that he can play serious roles while also bringing some of his wit and humour throughout. The main actors bonded well and felt/looked comfortable with each other. They seemed comfortable in way that made everything feel natural. For me as a single guy I loved it. That being said I think you'll enjoy it too as a simple and quiet evening movie.",Fatherhood
61,NestorTheGreat,"From cradle, with love.",8,28 June 2021,"Kevin Hart carries the weight of single parenting on his shoulders to great effect! As a single dad myself, I found much of the situations he's faced with relatable, even though many were brushed over with the comedy stick, hiding the true agony behind living them. Being told you can't may make some try harder and others feel incapable, but most just have no choice but to tackle it head on. Being able to keep a job throughout the naughty toddler years was a bit farfetched. The comedy throughout hits the spot, and the breakout performance of the young little daughter was amazing! The supporting cast are great, but it's really Hart's show- he's in nearly every scene. And as much as he can make you laugh, he can no doubt make you shed a tear! Well worth a watch!",Fatherhood

Unfortunately nothing clicks, it felt disjointed all the way through and never really got going. A lot of the attempts at humour fell short, they just weren't funny. As a result the experience in watching this movie is one of feeling underwhelmed, sadly, you're waiting for it to finally get going and it never really does. You just expected so much more, but it is not engaging enough to be feel-good/inspirational and it struggles with direction and what sort of film it wants to be. If it could be described in one word; bland. On a plus point, Alfre Woodard was excellent, she is a fantastic actress.",Fatherhood
63,ty-jensen,Fine drama,5,27 June 2021,"I like Kevin Hart so I was curious about Fatherhood. Sony produced the film and sold it to Netflix due to this pandemic. Fatherhood was cute, nothing special.Kevin Hart gives the best performance of his career and I'm sure others agree. If you seen The Upside, you know he's a good dramatic actor. Hart is natural, he's not showy. Yes, the cast was good.Fatherhood is lighthearted, it's a feel good movie. It has plenty of humor which falls flat for me. The film quickly explores the ups and downs of parenthood, they could of been explored more. There's only a few heavy scenes and the wife's death honestly hit me.The story is simple and predictable, you know what's going to happen from beginning to end. I was never bored but the pacing is just fine. The film meanders mostly in the second act and the conflicts in the third act are forced.Overall, Fatherhood was fine. If you like Kevin Hart, you should see it sometime. If you have Netflix, you might as well watch it. The film has plenty of language so it's not recommend for young kids.",Fatherhood

After the unexpected death of his wife, he learns to be a father thru his trials and turbulence being a father. Kevin played a great convincing father, but the story was a bit too long and depressing. Wish I could say it was entertaining but it was very dramatic and not comical. The cast also included Alfie Woodard as the nagging mother-in-law, Paul Reiser as the boss and Lil Rel as Hart's best friend.

75,Entertainmentsparadise,Who knew being a daddy can be so hard,6,27 June 2021,"Synopsis:
The excitement of becoming a father is quickly dejected as Matt( Kevin Hart) witnesses his wife passing away; He must endure the trials and tribulations of being a single father.Thoughts on the film:Fatherhood does a solid job with displaying the struggles a single father may face while raising a daughter. The film effectively develops an engaging plot with ambivalent corresponding elements; such as: gender roles, the impact of a single dad on a his daughter, balancing of work life and dating. Just to make a few! Ultimately the story being told is presented well and is relatable! ( No I'm not a single father)In addition, Kevin Hart can play some serious roles, but there were moments where he seemed too comical for a serious moment. Example : when he cried early on in the movie.The film is cast well, with some known actors and the daughter ( Melody Hurd) does an effective job in her role.Verdict:As a result, fatherhood is a story needed to be told. The elements that attack our emotions are relatable and the subtle comical relief, serves as decent formula for an enjoyable film. It's on Netflix, it's worth the watch!",Fatherhood

77,tarekali-19909,Fatherhood is a much needed and appreciated film,9,23 June 2021,"Fatherhood is a much needed and appreciated film in an age of cynicism and lost faith. I applaud the courage of everyone who made this film especially given the perceived redundancy and disposability of fathers in society today.Kevin Hart gives the performance of a lifetime. Never underestimate a performer, especially one who was previously typecast into comedic roles as the butt of jokes, often due to his height. I strongly feel he should be a contender on the award circuit. Kevin gave a nuanced and powerful performance as a father dealing with unimaginable odds and overwhelming grief. You can relate to his journey as he goes through various stages of grief and acceptance, tempered with hope and heart, and above all the courage to change and listen. It may come as a shock to many, but fathers are capable of deep emotion and connection to their children as depicted in this film.Melody Hurd gives a stunning performance as a precocious and courageous child, willing to challenge herself and above all guide her father to grow. She shows a wisdom beyond her years and I expect great things from this talented little actress.As expected Alfre Woddard delivers a powerful and moving rendition of a grieving grandmother, tempered with her signature gravitas. Indeed the entire cast is excellent and really rounds out the movie, each playing their role as a set of hands holding up the grieving, overwhelmed father.The tragedy depicted in this film had particular poignance and relevance with me on a personal level as I had a brush with a similar incident just recently in my life. I remember all too well those fateful days when as a father I felt crushed with the magnitude of responsibility before me, but the Mercy of God delivered.Fatherhood is an essential film and strongly recommended viewing. A good parent is a good parent, period. And a good parent shows courage and determination beyond the expectations of everyone else, even themselves.",Fatherhood
78,alejandro-bonilla,Something that I liked about the credits was realizing that Channing Tatum participated as executive producer.,3,25 June 2021,"There are bad movies and there are those movies that try by all means to be sentimental, ""an emotional journey"", personal growth. This falls into the second group, I do not think it is bad in itself, it is the set of decisions that made it like this, such as: too many scenes that really do not tell us anything about the story, reaching a point where one wonders ""What is the story about?"" That is what caused the terrible edition (it was saved as it could). Kevin's acting was not bad, I liked his performance throughout the movie but there were moments where he felt exaggerated (where he had to cry), not because the role, the scene or the moment did not ask for it, but because it did not fit with him, something more subtle would have been a better obtion. The best scenes were in which Kevin interacted with Viola Devis, have you ever seen an actress with such a good level of companionship that she is capable of lowering her performance level depending on what her partner is doing? I know that the director can do better, this is neither his best nor his worst work and something that I liked about the credits was realizing that Channing Tatum participated as executive producer.",Fatherhood

80,JoelAlexanderr,"Kevin Hart is amazing, the rest of the movie not so much",5,2 July 2021,"FATHERHOOD contains a career-best performance from Kevin Hart in which he masterfully embodies the role of a father who lost his wife during childbirth and who must raise his daughter by himself even though nobody believes he can do so. I just wish the rest of the movie was as amazing as Hart.To me, FATHERHOOD is solid proof that Hart is not just a silly comedian, but a talented actor who can adapt to most roles that any script demands of him. From this movie, I wanted something that finally gave Hart the role that broke him out of his shell and gave him an opportunity to get some real attention from both critics and audiences. This movie never quite does that, mainly because the writers and director are not as committed to making a fantastic movie about being a single father as the cast clearly is. The script is written in the vein of a silly rom-com with no substance or real character, and the plot goes nowhere from the beginning of the movie to the end. The first 20-30 minutes are riveting and devastating, but once it's clear that the movie doesn't have much more to offer after that, then the film becomes a boring rom-com between Hart and a new girlfriend at its core. Sure, there are meaningful themes about moving on from a period of grieving, but this was often overshadowed by pointless scenes with Lil Rel Howery and tiring subplots in the second half.It's a real shame that the writers and director weren't as committed to making a unique story, because with Hart delivering a spot-on performance and the Obamas producing, this movie could have soared. Instead, FATHERHOOD is a forgettable, fluffy Netflix movie that just comes across as one more Kevin Hart comedy to stream if you're bored. C+",Fatherhood

The attempts to make the film cute and funny are old, stale and very predictable which just makes the entire story sink to the bottom of the ""Whatever"" lake of pandering nonsense.I would encourage filmamkers wanting to make movies about breaking perceived minority parental roles to watch Deep Space Nine and sincerley look at the parenting and friendship betweek Jake Sisko and his Father Benjamin Sisko.

It was so believable, the acting was fantastic, the storyline was so well done. I laughed, I cried. It was very emotional and it was great to see a black man being portrayed in such a positive light, which you don't see in many movies. We need more of this! The little girl who plays Maddy was just adorable and her acting was phenomenal for such a young girl. I've already watched this movie twice and I'll definitely be watching it again in the future.",Fatherhood
87,seansoulo73,Bravo Kevin Hart,10,20 June 2021,"This is what I'm talking about! Superb cast, script, directing and outstanding performance by Kevin Hart and co-stars. I didn't know what to expect...cheese and corn, I guess. I was critical of Kevin's last few stand up specials, but after seeing ""The Upside"" I knew it was time for Hart to step beyond comedy. He brought his A game to that serious role and this one too! He has acting chops for real. Keep up this kinda work Kevin!",Fatherhood
88,a_filmcritter,a heartwarming family film,7,23 June 2021,"Kudos to Kevin Hart and the rest of the cast for delivering their characters in this film. I loved each character's portrayal. This movie had nearly every moment you'd want in a film: comedic, emotional, sentimental, and joyous scenes. Although predictable, it's something you can enjoy watching... especially with family, which was the intent of making this movie.Some flaws in terms of acting/storytelling: I couldn't really understand why the main character decided to some of the things he did - that internal conflict with himself could've been better portrayed on screen. I also thought the ending was a bit rushed. But overall, a great film and I'm glad Kevin Hart is doing something other than only comedy movies because his versatility in acting is showing.",Fatherhood
89,MahnoorKhan-FilmCritic,A Cute Movie,6,1 July 2021,"Fatherhood is a simple, beautiful, and relatable movie. It's a family drama with a predictable plot but it's a cute story. It's mostly drama with comedy and emotions.Kevin Hart performed the character of a single young parent very well. We have seen him doing comedy but he just rocked the character of an emotional parent who is concerned about her daughter's life and he is trying hard to balance both his professional life and family life.I enjoyed the chemistry between father and daughter. There wasn't anything surprising in this movie. It didn't capture my attention but it was indeed a sweet story.",Fatherhood
90,ryanwesthamfan,An Emotional Film With Good Enough Performances,7,8 July 2021,The Good- As the movie progresses Kevin Hart did a good job. There are a couple of scenes early on where I thought he could of gotten more emotional but beyond that he generally gave a good performance as he builds this relationship with his daughter. The movie works a lot better when it dives into the emotional stuff and by the end of the film there is a nice balance between the seriousness and the comedy.The Bad- I sort o fan rushes through things rather than spending more time on the big moments that happen in this film. I thought the time jump was a bit too big and happened to fast and I feel like this is down to the script of the film.Overall Thoughts- Kevin Hart shows a nice range of emotions as 'Fatherhood' tries to pull on those heart strings. Overall I'm going to give 'Fatherhood' a 7/10.,Fatherhood
91,stal-13652,Has a lot of Hart,8,4 September 2021,"I read a negative review for this film whereby the reviewer states that other than Kevin Hart, none of the characters have any development. The clue is in the film title. It is not Father, Granparent and Childhood: The Movie.I'm not a Kevin Hart fan so I wasn't fussed about watching this film but watched it with the wife with whom I have 3 kids. There are points in this film that really hit home. I'm not ashamed to say I wiped away a few tears.Kevin Hart dials down the comedy, uses it perfectly when needed and delivers a brilliant performance. It is all about him and his daughter. The other characters simply guide our twosome through their journey without needing one of their own.Highly recommended.",Fatherhood

When the time rolls around for the girl to start school, the daddy-daughter duo are met with a few bumps on the road to finding second chances at loving and living.""Fatherhood"" is to Kevin Hart what 2016's ""Mr. Church"" was to Eddie Murphy. This was Hart's standout role that showed that the playful comedian can and indubitably did deliver an authentic, dramatic performance.The storyline conforms to a standard family film formula. However, this film easily stands out for its substantial quality. The top-notch direction and polished editing surprised me on account of this treasure being so criminally underrated. The cast effortlessly executed realistic portrayals of their characters, and the rest of the film crew certainly produced an emotionally stimulating insight into the responsibility and value of fatherhood.A shockingly satisfying surprise, this is a picture for the underdogs that nobody thought could ""pull it off"". They sure chose the right leading man for the job. Two thumbs up, Mr. Hart. 93%!",Fatherhood

94,wonderstone_entertainment,Mr. Hart showed me.,9,30 August 2021,"There comes a time when extremely talented people, who we first recognized in a music video or comedy stage, show us that we were fools to ever define them by how they made us feel in that moment. It doesn't matter if they made us dance, sing, or laugh, we were foolish to pridefully lock them in boxes, and even more foolish to expect for them to stay there. Well, it took just one highly emotional scene from this film to force me to admit that I was a fool to ever refer to Kevin Hart as just a comedian, and later as a funny man in films. For, certainly, K. Hart is so much more than that.As for Melody Hurd, Deborah Ayorinde, Alfre Woodard, DeWanda Wise, and Franky Faison, they were beautiful shades of glory painting a love story that America often overlooks.

98,ian-dodkins,"This could have been cheesy, but it was amazing",8,21 July 2021,"Very well produced. In 5 minutes I was in tears (I'm a 49 yr old guy). With this subject matter it could have played on an incapacity of a man to bring up a child, or focussed on sorrowful aspects. Instead it was just a simple but good story with great characterisation that made you like all the characters. Young child was great actress as was female support and indeed all of them. Not a comedy but some light hearted one liners within character.I really don't know how such a story could have been told better. It didn't try to wrench emotion even though it could have, making it seem realistic and gently touching. Very pleased I saw it and you will be too. Made me think Kevin Hart is a very intelligent man with a beautiful heart who is able to humbly approach a film with gentle wit and beautiful story telling.",Fatherhood

-I believe Kevin Hart deserves a lot of praise for his performance in this. This isn't a role I'd expect him to do but boy did he do a good job
-The movie is very well written, the story is great, it's a very emotional and touching movie

108,NurgleTheUnclean,Fairy tale about a rich widower and an army of support for him.,3,29 June 2021,"Most single parents should be able to identify with being rich, having your job allow you to bring your baby to work, having two sets of extended family provide support, friends that stick with you even when you're a dick to them, and fawned over by a fantasy girlfriend prospect, even though you treat them crappy.This movie basically shows an incredibly privileged rich widower, with challenges that are basically dismissed by fantastically accommodating work conditions, friends, and strangers.The child character is completely undeveloped, she is about as memorable as the extras.It's supposed to be a tear jerker, yet the protagonist can't manage a single tear in the whole movie. Skip this and watch ""Happyness"" with Will Smith instead.",Fatherhood
109,reprisecompilation,"Kevin Hart tries, do movie doesn't - it's not on him",6,23 June 2021,"Well, I was quite curious about the new version of Kevin Hart, the one with more depth after things in his life making him possibly more mature and wise, experienced.Can he act? Yes.Is it visible in this movie? Partly.And it's not on him. An actor -especially one out of his depth- needs a good director who leads him to somewhere and gives actual tools to him/her... (just check Arnold in ""Maggie"", this actually can happen...)
The plot here is well, generic, storytelling is almost like on Hallmark Channel...
It's a totally missed opportunity both for Kevin Hart and both for the audience.With the right script and directing it could have been an emotional roller coaster from cries to laughs and back.By the end it's nothing more just and extended tv-series episode. The ones not really seen these days.The cast partly was a good choice - again things could (and should) have been used more and better.It's 6/10, mostly for Kevin Hart, and I really would like to watch a movie utilizing his actual skills for more. Not another Jumanji of course and no, not this lazy Sunday afternoon background tv something. Something real.",Fatherhood

And I can say that this is one of my favorites of 2021. I'm glad that Kevin Hart is breaking out of the mold of just comedy.

117,throwaway50000,Heartwarming but paint by numbers,5,22 June 2021,"I like Kevin Hart, generally, and his performance here is quite good. It's a nice, heartwarming story of a single dad raising his daughter and figuring things out along the way. A couple of chuckles along the way but nothing super funny. Some touching moments as well. But it just felt so bland. At the end of the day, a movie is a story and it needs to be a story worth telling.

It is very difficult raising a child, especially of the opposite sex, without the other parent in the picture. I did it myself. Kevin Hart did an outstanding job with his true to life emotion. I cried through most of it but sometimes we need a reminder that life is built on chances. No guarantees. It is short and to live it to the fullest. I liked this movie very much.",Fatherhood

I was not confident for him in the beginning but slowly he shows that parental side of him! The grown-up who has to be the responsible party!! The relationship between Kevin and his movie daughter was one that actually fit well!! The little girl really carried the film with her quick witted personality!!

This film is not groundbreaking or monumental in any stretch of the terms, but it's simply a feel-good film that appeals to a wide range of audiences and can provide a sense of relatability for many and uplift people from rough parts of their life. Kevin Hart is really starting to prove his doubters and nay-sayer's wrong with his recent performances, toning in his well known comedic style and jokes, while also committing himself to much more serious roles that require a lot from him, and that growth is exactly what you want to see from actors in today's constantly changing Hollywood landscape.",Fatherhood

129,stephenmatlock,Sweet and touching,9,8 September 2021,"Beautiful film that felt very real. Kevin Hart is known for his comedic chops and for his over-the-top style of comedy.But he has more than that, and this film lets him show much more of who he is.There is no one right way to handle the death of a loved one. We all have to balance our feelings, our imaginations, our realities, our fear of the changes to our lives. And in this film, Hart, playing the real-life person, has outbursts of grief and rage and destructive outbursts as well as tender moments of deep connection and understanding with himself as well as the people around him who try to love him in his pain and isolation.The character of Maddy is a standout star. Melody Hurd holds herself well in a demanding role for a young child. She feels believable in her forthrightness as well as in her need of her father. DeWanda. Wise, playing Swan, feels (and looks like) a bit of a young Whitney Houston, but she handles her role competently.Unfortunately I was not as impressed with Hart's wingmen, Lil Rel Howery (Jordan) and Anthony Carrigan (Oscar), who felt too cardboard-ish as the clueless men who think that you can power through grief. But I'll give them some grace as I imagine that we're seeing them through the eyes of the protagonist and not as they are in real life. Alfre Woodard (Marion) and Frankie Faison (Mike) play Hart's in-laws, and handle their small roles well.Is this an absolutely great movie? Not really, but not because of talent or production. Hart and The film itself is going to pull us into a very private moment of grief with a young child, and it is very good for what it is trying to accomplish. My eyes were drawn to Woodard who always makes her role as big as she wants them to be, and of course Hart ""exceeded my expectations,"" as they say. I was expecting a much more comedic movie and role, as I knew nothing about this film before I saw it, and while the movie itself was much deeper and more emotional than I expected, Hart was perfectly cast here.Kudos to the entire production team for creating this gentle, emotional, rich film that faces not only death but how we have to grapple with it.",Fatherhood

So this movie is not really a big comedy (laughed with only a few lines) and doesn't really teach you anything either, so overall is just mediocre.

Yeah I know I'm supposed to wait until I've finished watching, but I couldn't wait to review this heartwarming, funny, tearful gem. Kevin Hart is fabulous. I need more of this from him. The whole cast complimented each other and captured my heart. This movie touched the points of a father singly raising a child. The whole team on this movie did a magnificent job.

First word
And others.... But I don't wanna spoiler it so go see the movie right now if you didn'tIf you didAll the reviews I saw they were saying that all the decisions Matt have been through isn't hard enough no serious problems and I think they're kinda right because when I looked from the outside but
When I experienced it in the movie itself it's damn hard and ooh you serious that not hard come-on you destroyed my dreams being a fatherBUT I STILL WANNA BE A FATHER.Now to the movie as artistic unit it's good not too much to talk about but what is worthy of mentioning is the cinematography and the director he is great here and I'm looking forward to his next project the only problem that affected the whole movie is

This took you through a roller coaster of emotions and relatable on so many levels for so many people. Society has painted a picture of single parenting in such a lopsided way that I am certain many fathers feel this way that they would not and could not raise a child alone and provide that compassionate balance of parenting especially for us black fathers. It takes a village, this its fact. Its just a matter of choosing what that village/environment will be for your child and being selfless in doing so.I appreciated this movie so much.

Kevin hart was superb in this one, starting from the Gut Punch you get right off the bat, up to the ending. The trials, tribulations and doubts he goes through as a working single parent are easily identifiable by countless single parents throughout the world. This movie will make you laugh, cry and appreciate the efforts of parenting, share in the grief of loss and identify with his frustrations of self-doubt. In the end, this movie was really great. I am only giving it 8/10 because, aside from Marian and Maddie, the balance of supporting cast was just average. Definitely worthy of watching at least once!",Fatherhood

Nice blend of drama and comedy which I'm not used to seeing Kevin Hart perform in. His acting here is a bit different from his past comedies, as his emotions feel real throughout the movie. Laughs here and there, my friend and I almost teared up at one scene.We only watched the trailer after watching the movie (to avoid spoilers), and it was surprising to know that it was based on true events!

182,sweetlaci,Heartwarming! Perfect for a Sunday Afternoon,10,20 June 2021,Kevin Hart was amazing. He really brought this single dad character to life. Him and Maddie had great chemistry.

As a light skinned woman I can say it was refreshing to see this change.I don't have any kids but I think it's a great movie for all!,Fatherhood
183,omuhiddinoglu,Pretty funny!,7,25 June 2021,"Although I assume it would be more dramatic to be a single parent and raise a child, I think what they did in the film was one of the best ways to handle a topic like this. As it shows you the difficulties a single parent (a father) faces, it also makes you laugh (well, since it's starring Kevin Hart, you wouldn't expect much of drama so yeah it's pretty funny).",Fatherhood

I understand he works hard for it and he is proud of it, but he is supposed to be a single father with a baby in this movie. He is sleep deprived, but he looks as if he just finished workout all the time? (We don't see it in the movie, but his shirts won't allow you miss it)
Put that aside, it's a story told many times in different movies and different languages and it doesn't bring anything new to it.Kevin Hart tries to show he is more than just a stand up comedian, but he forgets phisique is as important as the tears.",Fatherhood

The movie is beauteously projected where a father learns to parent her daughter after his wife's demise.

190,profire-14366,Accurate reflection of fatherhood as primary caregiver,10,21 June 2021,"Unless the father is not the primary caregiver, few would be able to relate well with this movie.This movie certainly destroys the notion that parenting belongs to the maternal side. Parenting is a skill, like any other skill. It can be taught, it can be learnt. Like most fathers, Matt was suddenly thrown into a role for the first time that he wasn't prepared for. No one really is, anyway. There was no theory or practical lessons. It was straight into hot fires of examination.The emotions that a father has to go through is well depicted. There are few support groups specifically for primary caregiving fathers. Joining a parent support group is just plain awkward because there are only mothers.Not many bosses are also able to relate well with primary caregiving fathers. And probably only female colleagues are able to relate and assist in the workplace.Having to juggle work and parenting is really hard. Sacrifices have to be made. Fatherhood depicts all of it well.",Fatherhood

197,geritosub,Would recommend ^^,7,19 June 2021,"I enjoyed watching Fatherhood! It was a nice movie. Was it great or something miraculous? No. But thats not the movie's goal. By watching this movie you can partly experience what its like being a single parent and a father for that mater, which surely is not an easy task.Even from the beginning Matt (Kevin Hart) said to his wife that he was not ready to have a child, because no one is truly ready for that huge new chapter.Kevin Hart did a wonderful job. I've only watched him in comedy movies and this side of him is refreshing! I'm not going to lie, at the end I was caught in the emotion bubble and just couldn't let out a couple of tears. (Lmao)Things that I think would have made it a tad bit better
Going into the trauma he experienced after losing his wife.Going more in depth about gender norms as clearly the child liked things that are perceived as male items.Also the ""issue"" about the ""need"" of girls to wear skits and boys pants.I could probably think of more but overall I enjoyed the movie.

I was so looking forward to see from single father's perspective but didn't actually get much of it. "" fatherhood"" didn't live up to its title. There were phrases like ""hes going to take the challenge of raising her on his own"" but the challenges were not shown. All of sudden she's all grown up .

I loved Kevin Hart in this movie...to a point. I was impressed with Kevin's acting in this movie. However, he was carrying the weight of this movie. Clearly, by the time they paid Kevin Hart as lead actor and producer, they didn't have enough money to hire good, appealing supporting actors. The one guy reminded me so much of that ""Hills Have Eyes"" crazy looking bald dude that I had to stop watching the entire movie! He and the other supporting actor/Kevin Hart's friend, were NOT funny or appealing to watch. Also disappointing was Alfre Woodard. Her acting seemed forced. Ugh. I so wanted to love this movie. Seeing that the movie has gotten only 6 stars so far, this could've been a 7, 8, 9 star movie if it had better ensemble cast. Tom Brady wins Super Bowls because he knows he cannot win a super bowl without a great team. I am not a Brady fan, but have learned by him.

my favorite character, his mother-in-law, who plays its role, Alfre Woodardz, with her dramatic performance, was able to convey the feeling of a grieving mother over the death of her daughter, as well as the mother-in-law who is stalking her daughter's husband and the loving grandmother.All in all, the movie was entertaining, and I enjoyed it.",Fatherhood

It also explores the black experience with leaving your hometown or family house and moving far away for work because you are more likely to earn more in a more developed area, but getting alienated from family, a sacrifice you have to make as a provider. Touching narrative with realistic acting.",Fatherhood

229,GreenSleep,"Despite myself, I liked this",8,19 June 2021,"I forgot it was Kevin Hart. He did a great job in the role encompassing grief and love. There's nothing spectacular in terms of visual so it doesn't get in the way of performances. There are some great supporting actors try that elevate the dialogue. And d as some nice hilarious lines that break the tension of sadness. If you're a parent, you'll get this. It's a nice solid film.",Fatherhood

In this, we got to see Kevin Hart really act, really gave himself to a serious role.

239,ExOster,A strong story without having any big plots or adventures.,8,27 June 2021,"KH did a great job in this one! A movie that will have you in tears at several points, without being cringy or over the top.I see a lot of people complaining about the fact this movie has next to no adventure, or big things happen in it. In my opinion this is what makes it great! Parenthood is not about great adventures, and extravagant life, its about you, and your child. Your childs life is yours for the foreseeable future, all you can hope for is small glimpses of shimmering, glorious sun, every once in a wile, as so well put by the grandma, ""You keep all these little victories, like the one you had today, in a little box inside you. They will be your most priced positions!""Character development takes time. So many movies these days fall victim to flat characters, and in turn a story that you simply don't care about. KH does a great job of illustrating what parenthood in its essence is. Some of the great low's are cut out, but that might have been a good choice by the director as it might have came across as trying to force the viewers emotion. I felt throughout the movie that i was not forced to feel something, and that, by my standars, is a trait that only great movies/series have. And so whenever there is something bad that happens in the fathers life, you do feel for him. Such an essential component of a movie such as this one, where there is no big adventures, no abnormal happenings, no extravagant lifestyle, just an ordinary guy, struggling trough the thought times, like the rest of us.I cant help but wonder if all the bad grades for this movie, is done by young people, not yet exposed to the big hurdles in life.And hey, that's totally fine, but don't get fooled. For anyone above the age of 22, that's gotten a taste of the big bad world outside your youth. This is a great watch.",Fatherhood

241,veritech-70483,Kevin Hart can do it all.,8,23 June 2021,I loved this movie. It's not a fast paced action or fast paced comedy. It is a drama with some comedy. It's cute. Based on true story makes it a more interesting movie. The struggle is real for single parents.,Fatherhood

246,jarifmuhibayon,Refreshing,8,20 June 2021,Seeing Kevin Hart doing something which is not loud and a particular sketch of himself was really a refreshing experience. Fatherhood is about being a single father and being true to itself. It will never be a common picture for all single father out there but it serves some duties well enough.A very refreshing experience in the time of a global pandemic.,Fatherhood
247,valerie-12043,Best of Kevin's Movies EVER,10,20 June 2021,I loved this movie so much. It was heartfelt and it was wonderfully touching. I found myself relating to each and every scene as one goes through the role of raising children. Kevin Hart does a splendid job of recreating the frustration the fear and the excitement and joy of loving and raising a baby. I only wish I could see many more movies like this on the screen.,Fatherhood
248,constance-49709,Thought it would be funnier,6,6 July 2021,I was disappointed in this movie. I love Kevin Hart and maybe I was expecting something different.

257,kristinabrixm,Good story and emotional,7,21 June 2021,"When I see Kevin Hart I think comedy and while the movie had its humor, it was more emotional.Kevin Hart managed to portray a grieving single father well. You felt for him all the way through and saw how he struggled to figure out what was the best thing to do. No one believed he could pull it off being a single father, which was nice to see how he proved them all wrong.Sure, he failed at things but he kept trying. I would've liked to see more of the daughter growing up and see how he handled specific situations. Unfortunately we didn't get that.The side characters were all right. Some scenes with them were too weird for me. It was clear that those scenes were suppose to be funny, but it actually made me give 7 stars instead of 8. They were just not funny, more weird.Comparing his wife's death with an minor thing that happened in the past was disrespectful. Again, it was suppose to be funny but I didn't laugh.His friends were more awkward for me.The love interest were great though. I loved her and him together and she was great with the girl.The father and daughter had a great chemistry. It was nice to see. It was clear that the father wanted his daughter to be happy but also honor his wife's wishes for her.He taught the girl to be true to herself and not let anyone decide what she should wear.The story was predictable and nothing about it made it stand out, but I didn't mind it.However, there were scenes that felt...out of place. Like, they didn't make sense to be there. It was clear they were suppose to be funny but they weren't, more awkward.Overall it was a good emotional movie with strong characters. It's not one I would watch again, but it's one I think is worth watching.",Fatherhood
258,gemmavasellina,Emotional and Funny,10,21 June 2021,"Such a good film, really funny but also really emotional. The film deals with a story we don't see often enough of a single father and was acted beautifully by Kevin Hart. Really recommend this one.",Fatherhood

268,hasmax786,Watch it because you might relate and enjoy it.,7,21 June 2021,Kevin hart did well in acting I think he still needs lessons to get as good as Will Smith in drama type situations. His crying was believable but there were parts in the movie I just thought could have been hit harder.Showing more emotion in impactful moments the writing itself was simple which is good but again needed more. I feel with a little bit more direction and better writing this could have been the best movie of 2021.,Fatherhood

The Mother is the best one... how do they know?

271,JubilantSoul,The talented Mr Kevin Hart,10,24 June 2021,"Charlie Chaplin was a master of human emotions, capable of bringing hilarious laughters and heartfelt tears. Some of his movies work so well on so many levels that Chaplin's craft can be thought of as indistinguishable from magic. But there's a lot of hard work behind any masterpiece and the overnight succes of any master is built upon years and years of blood, sweat and tears. This journey of profesional growth is visible throughout Kevin Hart's career.It is a pleasure to see Kevin perfect his craft and grow as a comedian, actor and human being. From his obvious jokes, about his diminutive height, during his younger debut years, Mr Hart is gradually blossoming into a giant of cinema. He is touching people's hearts with simple stories about our capacity for sacrifice and compassion. In a world dominated by vulgar and cynical comedy, Kevin makes us laugh with thoughful jokes that touch our heart and blend perfectly into this emotional yarn.The story has many heartbreaking moments when you'll pretended that ""something got in your eye"". And Kevin gently guides us along the way with skillfully placed cathartic laughs that keep us immersed in this lesson about being a better person and a real human being.One takeway from this movie is that if you are always questioning yourself and trying to do better, that means that you are a good parent.Unlike other comentators, I never felt that the story needed something more. Being conditioned by contemporary media, that constantly shocks us with absurd ideas and gored novelty, we risk becoming callous and indifferent to the real stories and the life defining moments of our existence.Kevin Hart takes us back to this simple story of a single parent, that was lived and retold by so many since the beginning of time. He shows that this story will always be fresh and relevant. He teaches us that these sacrifices are not a banal aspect of the hard drudgery of everyday life. On the contrary, they are essential for defining our character and they are THE thing which gives meaning to our lives.",Fatherhood

Add Hart to the mix it's a no brainer to want to watch. I would've given a 10 just because of the casting but was not to be this time only because I know in my heart of hearts it would not be fair.

308,jamiedube,Amazing movie,10,20 June 2021,Incredibly sad movie with just the right amount of comedic relief. Kevin Hart delivers an excellent performance for this drama/comedy.,Fatherhood
309,daugust-00327,Not a good role for Kevin Hart,4,20 June 2021,"The movie is predictable down to the final scene, no surprises here. Kevin Hart was not convincing in this serious role, kept waiting for a joke. His lack of depth in this role made it difficult to watch. Someone else should have been cast in the lead role. The supporting cast was good.",Fatherhood

312,peepoclaps,"Fantastic movie, worth a watch.",10,21 June 2021,"I honestly didn't know Kevin was this good at acting. He played his role perfectly and i never once lost my immersion because of bad acting or terrible writing,All in all i would say if you enjoy this genre you're definitely gonna like this movie, not once did this movie lose my attention which says alot to me.",Fatherhood

314,stephanieborg-77173,Kevin Hart really impresses,10,22 June 2021,I loved this movie. Kevin Hart took this emotion role and killed it. I laughed and cried. It was such a well written movie and I would definitely recommend it.,Fatherhood

316,yojiteam,Thanks for making this film,10,27 June 2021,"A memorable movie should not always having complicated plot/story. It's probably a common one, but with excellent delivery. Really touch emotionally.You might have strongful relation when you lost (for good) your loved ones.",Fatherhood
317,gracesophia-47412,Kevin Hart!!,8,27 June 2021,"Kevin Hart is easily the best part about this movie! He proves he is a versatile actor; who knew he could do so well in a dramatic role. The plot is simple yet very sweet and heartbreaking at times. I did think it dragged a little at some parts, but overall really great movie, with my favorite part being Hart's acting!",Fatherhood
318,khollingsworth-15377,Amazing,10,27 June 2021,I never thought I would watch a movie where Kevin Hart was more serious than being a comedian. I loved everything about this movie! It made see that a comedian can still give comedy and show us great acting. I would love to see more of this from Kevin!,Fatherhood
319,casualflxr,I felt way more emotion watching the trailer than I did watching the film.,6,4 July 2021,"I felt this this movie was OK, but not great.Kevin Hart's dramatic moments were not very believable -- I didn't feel much emotion when watching him. Also, there was not much romantic chemistry between Hart's character and his love interest that appears later on in the film.The girl who played Hart's daughter was one of the best actors in the film. She was engaging to watch and her on-screen moments where very believable.The film felt like it was 50% comedy and 50% drama. It may have been more compelling to me if it was closer to 75% comedy and 25% drama - with quality dramatic moments that weren't rushed, unlike how they felt in this film.Overall, this film was not favourite.",Fatherhood
320,jespherjohansson,Kevin Hart and a beautiful story,10,8 July 2021,"I was certain this was another comedy movie, regular thing, Kevin gets baby puke and so on on himself.But this movie was one of the best movies I've seen in many years.I had tears in my eyes for many scenes.The most beautiful thing is that they really dug in on what he is feeling, when he feels lost, when he feels alone and overburdened. He used new words and really captured what atleast i feel in my life.This is a movie I will watch very many times again and most likely when I get my first baby.And finally a father empowering movie and not more of those ""father always leaves"" or is super conservative and an a**hole!",Fatherhood
321,swetagriet,Most underrated movie,10,9 July 2021,The movie is so good. The plot is perfect. What any father feels for a daughter is best depicted. It shows the real struggles of a single parent and what the single parent feels like. The plot has convincingly portrayed the reality without making it depressing.,Fatherhood
322,mrb-52725,AWESOME MOVIE!!,10,10 July 2021,This was an awesome movie from beginning to end!! This movie hit every feel that you could have as a person !! This is one of the few movies that paint a black man as a father in a positive light. If you are a father this is a movie that you need to watch !!,Fatherhood
323,lgsullivan-18728,Worth watching!,8,13 July 2021,"I've not seen Kevin Hart in this kind of role and he was very good. The supporting cast was also excellent. Alfre Woodard is always a stand out. And the young actress who plays Maddy was a scene stealer every time. It's sad, sweet, feel good, cry a little - all the best attributes for a solid film. Watch it. You won't be disappointed.",Fatherhood

325,czjkw,BORING!,4,14 August 2021,"It's just BORING. I had to watch it over three days, with every now and then checking how much time is still left so I don't feel bad beginning a thing and not finishing it.",Fatherhood
326,jondoe7,Fatherhood,10,18 July 2021,"The movie Fatherhood is about a new father who loses his wife due to a birth complication and has to raise a newborn child while dealing with grief. In the beginning, the father does not believe that he can raise a child on his own. He fears that he will not be a good enough single parent for his daughter. A true story inspires this movie. The movie Fatherhood shows the challenges and emotions a single father goes through when raising a newborn daughter.The movie Fatherhood does a great job showing what it is like to be a single father who has to raise a newborn daughter shortly after losing his wife. The movie shows different times in their lives. In the beginning, it shows when the daughter is born, then it shows when she becomes a toddler, and also when she is about five years old. The person playing the father is Matthew Logelin (Kevin Hart), the person playing the mother is Liz Logelin (Deborah Ayorinde), and the person playing the daughter is Maddy Logelin (Melody Hurd).Seeing the emotions Matthew Logelin went through when he lost his wife, Liz Logelin, makes the audience feel like they can feel what he is feeling. The movie shows both parents at the hospital for the baby to be born. Both of them seemed very excited about it. Shortly after the baby is born, the mother passes away unexpectedly due to a medical complication. As Matthew is dealing with grief from losing his wife, he has difficulty doing anything, even believing that he can raise a newborn child independently.Later on in the movie, you can see what it is like when parents get surprised by things their children do for the first time. When the daughter becomes a toddler, she starts to walk, which brings a lot of joy and happiness to the father. Because of how happy he gets, you can almost feel the emotions that he feels when he sees his daughter walk for the first time. To many, it may not seem like a huge deal when a child starts to walk for the first time, but to parents, it means the whole world. Every accomplishment, no matter how big or small, will always bring joy to the parents.In the movie, they chose the perfect person to play the five-year-old Maddy, who has a strong relationship with her father, and it shows how parenting changes after the kid is old enough to understand and speak. After the daughter Maddy Logelin becomes old enough to attend kindergarten, you can see the challenges of being a parent change for Matthew. The child can talk to their parents whenever they need to, and they can understand their parents. Once the kid is old enough to understand, the parent will need to make sure that they advise their children on getting on the right track and making sure that they are only learning things that will benefit them in their lifetime.What I like the most about the movie is how they showed the importance of grandparents being in their grandkid's lives. You can see that Maddy loves visiting her grandparents because she gets the same attention from her grandparents as she does from her father, and that makes her realize that she wants to be around more people that are family to her. As a parent, you always need to make sure that all your family members can be present in your children's lives. Most importantly, the children's grandparents, because they are the only people who will give them the same treatment as parents do.The movie also does a great job showing how becoming a parent can come with sacrifices to ensure what is best for the children. Once a person becomes a parent, they have to realize everything they do and every decision they make can impact their children's life. The father, Matthew Logelin, was given an opportunity for a career change that required him to make some changes in his life, so he had to make sure that he made the right decision for himself and his daughter. To make sure you can give your children the best life you possibly can, you may have to sacrifice certain things you genuinely want. A parent could be given a career opportunity of a lifetime but not be able to take it since it requires them to make changes in their lives that could be difficult for the whole family.",Fatherhood
327,janyves-99332,Advertising sets this out to be something else.. Its the oposite,9,2 August 2021,"Kevin Hart puts in his best ever performance, simply a joy to watch and as a dad, I can see the dad in his character. The supporting cast are spot on especially the kid, a star. Worth watching this and then something like The Intern if you need to feel good about life...",Fatherhood
328,embigard,Caught me off guard,10,3 August 2021,"We thought we were picking a new Kevin Hart comedy special and didn't actually read the info before hitting play. Never thought I'd be crying in the 1st 5 minutes and; I was hooked at that point! Amazing storyline, fantastic actors, comedy sprinkled throughout the seriousness. A new kind of role for Kevin Hart and he knocked it out of the park! He deserves awards for this movie! Best movie I've seen in years!!!",Fatherhood
329,alyeldridge,Amazing movie,10,5 August 2021,"I loved this movie, the theme was resilience, but the plot of the movie is something so many people struggle with and go through, so being able to watch it in a movie opens people's eyes, including mine on how hard being a single parent can be, and the struggles it comes with.",Fatherhood
330,sindicate-april,Outstanding movie,10,13 August 2021,This movie is beautiful and absolutely heart-warming to see Kevin Hart act in another role other than a comedic one. I love it!,Fatherhood
331,mprbfy,So Boring,2,19 September 2021,I created an account just to add a review to save someone else 1.5 hours of their life. I'm not sure why that was made into a movie. I was hopeful that it would be good but wow that was so boring.,Fatherhood
332,liranfeldman,It's ok,5,10 October 2021,"This movie made me laugh a lot, and the story is ok, but every time the movie tried to get me sobbing (like, really hard) it just didn't happen. I do think that this movie is fun and entertaining, but the movie was supposed to be emotional (at it's core) and it failed achieving that.I would recommend watching it with someone else, because watching it alone is kinda boring.(This is a personal review, I'm not an expert. Also,
I'm sorry if my English is not perfect, I tried my best).",Fatherhood
333,nournagy2006,emotional and funny,8,20 June 2021,Never thought that kevin hart could make us cry one day very touching movie and it has also alot of fun highley recommended.,Fatherhood
334,tamagotchipeacemaker,Sweet and simple,8,19 June 2021,I lost my childhood best friend two years ago after she gave birth to her second daughter. It was due to similar complications a few months after leaving the hospital. It was a huge loss. Her husband became solely responsible for both girls. Their first born is named Maddie so the story hit very close to home. It was full of cliches but I could look past that to see the beauty of what the author wanted to share.,Fatherhood
335,rtooson,Not as good as The Upside but,8,19 June 2021,I loved this movie! I think the Upside is a much better drama but this film delivers!,Fatherhood

337,safwanaosman,Kevin Hart can really act,8,19 June 2021,"This movie had me laugh, cry and have a good time and I was really frustrated it when I took a break and came back to continue watching except for the fact there are other two using my account.Watch It!",Fatherhood
338,sheriruiz18,Trying to figure out why this was a film,2,27 June 2021,"A story was told. The trouble is nothing happened in that story worth making a movie out of. Kevin Hart definitely proved he has more acting range than just comedy roles but I cannot stress more, nothing happened. The film ended and I was surprised. Why? Because nothing had actually happened asides from the obvious incident in the first 10 mins. Save yourself the time and image what single fatherhood could look like for a man earning 6 figures and you've pretty much watched the movie. It also did nothing for gender equality, way to make out like being a single father is near on impossible while enforcing the stereotype that women just know how to parent.",Fatherhood
339,willoogle,Go on the journey,10,19 June 2021,"Our family are Kevin Hart fans! So we were ""all in"" from the outset. However, I thought the trailer revealed too much. Boy was I wrong! Those that called it ""predictable"" are partially right, but it's the moments in between some of the milestones that surprised me. And Kevin and the other star of the show that took the cake, ""Melody Hurd"" did it with such authenticity. The premise is heavy, so it was amazing to see how each of the characters emerged from despair to have a happy-ish ending.",Fatherhood
340,bestvex-389-659434,A great family movie to watch,10,19 June 2021,"I avoided watching this movie for a while, mostly because of it's trailer...

Then it turns out he just told you he went to the supermarket to get some cheese, for 90 minutes.That's this movie. Completely flat. No dramaturgy or story, just a guy who happens to be a single parent.",Fatherhood
342,dgslzr,He did that,10,2 July 2021,"They did that! I don't want to give anything away.. I watched this movie without knowing or reading anything more than the title and Kevin Hart's name on Netflix. Must see for pretty much everyone who has a heart. Has the BEST acting from the main characters. Based on a true story, stays very relatable and believable.",Fatherhood

344,g-bakker86,Quite touching,7,24 June 2021,"It was pretty good. I usually don't watch drama's but figured there would be plenty of comedy sprinkled over it. That wasn't the case but it drew me in and had me tearing up several times. They could have fleshed out the main characters a bit more. KH's only idenditiy is ""widow father"" and while that is the main theme of the moviethey could've shown a little more. The ""new woman"" I didn't much care for, only the daughter.",Fatherhood

347,danielsolvstenp,Father figure is important,10,4 September 2021,"I was really moved by this movie. It does not have the greatest plot and depth, but it makes you FEEL. Probably due to me growing up without a father I feel this way.. Prepare to cry a couple of times.",Fatherhood
348,Zayneworley,This movie is the visualization of my worst nightmare.,7,12 July 2021,"Recently having my first child I would wake up sweating that this would happen. This is an emotionally packed movie that skips over the most bleak points. It leaves a lot of depression and challenges out as it take a significant time jump, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Skipping over that shows a way through and a way back from the impossible. It's a wonderful heart felt movie with some great performances. I feel as if they leave a little on the table in the true emotional damage that the dad would have, but a great movie non the less.",Fatherhood
349,KathyHowell1957,"Sad, nothing funny or enjoyable, long",1,8 September 2021,"This starts out sad, with a funeral, and never really got off the ground, never really got upbeat, with Kevin Hart, I expected funny, but, nothing funny, not enjoyable, seemed long, like it went on forever, in the same somber, serious, dramatic way, with no real highlights.",Fatherhood

How wrong was I. In this film he honestly gives an incredible performance, totally believable and with an overwhelming true and powerful display of his acting talents.

I looked at the trailers and saw there were some emotional parts and funny parts and assumed it would be mostly funny. It wasn't. It was a perfect combo of comedy and drama. So heartwarming.

364,victoraslucian,Worse than Friday movie,1,1 August 2021,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen period. There is no complexity to it, everything is plain and dumb. There is no character development throughout the movie. It reminded me of Friday movie with Ice Cube, where nothing interesting happens but somehow seeing Ice Cube sitting on a porch is more entertaining than watching this movie. It's so stereotypical, everything is expected, there's no plot twist, no shaking your emotions, just boring till the end.To be honest this movie actually makes me, and should make everyone else, feel very good and sure about themselves. It gives hope to everyone, the hope that anyone can make a movie. You don't need a plot, you don't need school for doing this, you don't even need to be human, you can be a babboon, you just need a camera, some music, stereotypical scenes, plainess and it's enough. You can start making your own movies right now and who knows, maybe you will become famous.I mean I have seen bad movies now and then, I have seen the Room with Tommy Wiseau, but at least you can laugh about the characters or the scenes there, but this movie, Fatherhood, is so bad you can't even laugh about it because there is nothing to laugh about it.",Fatherhood
365,edomasci,Best boring movie 2021,2,26 July 2021,"A nice story but is not enough to give 10 and not even 5, true story and drama together doesn't mean success, you have to engage the viewer in some ways.Incredibly boring and it's surprisingly long, I am still asking myself what I saw for almlst 2 hours, maybe is not delicate but if I have to represent with a drawimg the movie I can only imagine a flat line, always on the same tone and most of the time there's this drama music on the background that at a certain time becomes just irritating.Save you time and look for something different, 2 hours for this is just time wasting.",Fatherhood
