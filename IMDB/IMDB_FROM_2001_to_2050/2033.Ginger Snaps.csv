0,Leofwine_draca,Sleeper hit is howlingly good fun,9,22 July 2016,"A breath of fresh air for the teen horror film and a thumbs-up for the independent movie, this low-budget Canadian werewolf film is a real shocker which starts off slowly and gradually builds to a fantastic climax which is pretty much edge-of-your-seat kind of stuff. The standard ""innocent is bitten by werewolf and begins to turn"" story is propelled by some original touches, like the puberty angle which sees the teenage bite victim mistaking her transformation for mere menstrual woes. Frank dialogue, excellent developed characters, and actors who play each other off superbly are just some of the reasons this film became something of a sleeper hit, garnering generally rave reviews from critics who actually bothered watching it.What kept me watching the film closely is the unpredictability of the narrative; you're never quite sure where the film is going, or who might be the next victim, so you just have to keep watching to see where they're going with the story. The pacing is spot-on and the story ideal. Things start off on a decidedly realistic tone, with teenage woes and high school heartbreak on the top of the list. This gives us time to learn about and even like the principal characters, namely Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle as teenage sisters Brigitte and Ginger. Once the characters are properly introduced, the morbid and gory events begin to build up and we're then sucked into the film all the while, eagerly awaiting the next macabre happening and seeing what will happen. Themes of morbidity, friendship, and power run throughout to keep things interesting and the characters are likable only because they're all too human - no mindless sentimentalising here, thank god.Emily Perkins is the unorthodox leading lady and has a really interesting, thought-out character. Thankfully she isn't the pretty, vacuous untalented crowd-pulling lead a la Katie Holmes but instead a damn good actress. The person who really shines, however, is Katharine Isabelle, lending pathos and sympathy to her character's plight whilst at the same time being the monster and the villain. Some of her scenes are heartbreaking and difficult to watch as you end up liking her character so much despite her actions. The supporting cast are uniformly excellent, whether it be Mimi Rogers as the quirky mother or even the Chinese janitor. Respect to Kris Lemche, who invests his drug dealer with subtlety and charm.Thankfully for a modern horror flick, GINGER SNAPS doesn't skimp on the gore effects either. It isn't the goriest film ever made or anything but there are plenty of severed body parts and arterial fountains to appeal to the car-crash crowd, especially in the blood-drenched finale. But a sense of humour and lots of black comedy (involving severed fingers) keep it from becoming just too dark. Being a low budget film, the special effects aren't exceptional but they are solid and more than adequate, especially the much-criticised werewolves which aren't so bad either - it's nice to see animatronic creatures instead of CGI abominations and I know which I would take over the other any day. Despite being a tragic, downbeat tale this is never less than gripping and one of the best modern horrors I've seen for some time.",Ginger Snaps
1,SnoopyStyle,love this indie horror,8,22 May 2015,"Sisters Brigitte (Emily Perkins) and Ginger Fitzgerald (Katharine Isabelle) live in the cookie-cutter suburbs of Bailey Downs where something is killing the dogs. They are obsessed with death and are outcasts in school. Ginger intends to hold Brigitte to their pact. ""Out by 16 or dead on the scene but together forever."" They love staging bizarre deaths. Brigitte is picked on by popular girl Trina Sinclair and the girls try to stage killing Trina's dog. Ginger finally has her first period at 15 but is attacked by a werewolf. Brigitte saves Ginger and drug dealer Sam runs over the wolf with his van. Soon Ginger starts turning and turning heads at school. Brigitte tries to find a cure for Ginger with the help of Sam.I love so much about this movie. Firstly I love both actresses. They have terrific sister chemistry. Katharine Isabelle does a great slow walk down the hall. Emily Perkins is a terrific disheveled nerd. That song is hauntingly beautiful. I love all the bizarre deaths staged by the sisters. This is such an unique take on the werewolf transformation weaving it into the sisters hormonal transformation. It's one of the reasons why the original Carrie was so great. There is great sly humor and Mimi Rogers is a good solid foundation at home. The gore is a bit amateurish but that's indie horror for you. What they lack in expertise, they make up for it in fun. Slipping on your own vomit is such a great way to die.",Ginger Snaps
2,Prismark10,Blood moon,6,22 October 2015,"Ginger Snaps is a low budget Canadian horror film that also has a subtext of growing up and puberty.Bridgette (Emily Perkins) and Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) are two sisters who are very close and have fascination about death. They stage and photograph death scenes and regarded as weird at High School where they are regarded as outcasts and suffer from bullying. Ginger is one year older than Bridgette and is starting her period rather late.Ginger gets attacked by a werewolf very close to her first period and her body undergoes changes. Hair, mood swings, pains, bleeding, sexualisation and a tail. You see the parallels to growing up and becoming a werewolf. Heck there is even a 28 day cycle!Of course as the blood lust takes effect Ginger gets more savage and starts to kill. This is after the guys at High School find her hot and appealing which means she has no trouble attracting victims. Its left to Bridgette and high school drug dealer Sam to find a cure for lycanthropy and save Ginger.There is nothing much original about a werewolf film. Writer Karen Walton has given this film a feminist twist and a lot of it is due to the bond between the two sisters and Bridgette wanting to save Ginger out of that love.Director John Fawcett goes for a more realistic portrayal of High School life and more honest representation of family relationships when children hit adolescent. Mimi Rogers plays the mother and although the father does not speak a lot when he does his remarks are rather waspish.The film suffers slightly from its low budget and it could been tighter. I think the climax loses its way a bit and should had been better presented.Its a rare combination of intellectual horror and dark comedy which works to an extent but never quiet pulls it off successfully.",Ginger Snaps
3,claudio_carvalho,One of the Best Movies of Werewolf Ever (17 November 2008),7,24 May 2005,"The outcast teenager sisters Brigitte (Emily Perkins) and Ginger Fitzgerald (Katharine Isabelle) are very connected and have a weird pact of death between them. Their hobby is photography, more specifically morbid pictures of violent death scenes. On the full moon night the sixteen year-old Ginger has her first period, she is bitten by a wild animal, indeed a werewolf, but she omits the attack to her mother Pamela (Mimi Rogers). A couple of days later, Ginger changes her behavior; her body is covered by excessive hair; and she has the need of attacking dogs and other animals. While her mother believes that the menstruation is causing her changes of attitude, Brigitte seeks the cure with the local drug dealer Sam (Kris Lemche).""Ginger Snaps"" is one of the best movies of werewolf ever. This is the third time that I watch this movie, now on DVD, and I like the approach of the dramatic story, using the usual change of behavior of a teenager after her first period in parallel to a werewolf attack. The weird Fitzgerald sisters are brilliantly performed by Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle, and the conclusion is excellent. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Possuída"" (""Possessed"") My previous review of 24 May 2005: Gore, Weird and Original Horror Movie Brigitte (Emily Perkins) and Ginger Fitzgerald (Katharine Isabelle) are very connected sisters and very weird and morbid persons, having a great attraction with death. On the night Ginger gets her first period, she is attacked by a furred beast and her behavior and mood change. Her mother and friends believe that this changing is caused by her hormones, but her sister believes that she was bitten by a werewolf. Sooner Brigitte sees that she is right and tries to save her sister from the terrible fate.The first time I saw ""Ginger Snaps"", I did not like it, since I found the story too bloody and with an open end. Today I have just watched it for the second time because I bought the DVD with the sequence, and now I found ""Ginger Snaps"" a gore, weird and original horror movie. I changed completely my first opinion, and I really liked this movie. It is a very violent werewolf film, having two excellent lead actresses with great performances, Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle. Now I hope that the sequence does not spoil such a good story. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Possuída"" (""Possessed"")",Ginger Snaps
4,gavin6942,The Reason We Need More Female Werewolves,8,9 October 2006,"Katharine Isabelle (from ""Freddy vs. Jason"", ""Insomnia"", ""Bones"") stars as a Gothic sister who gets bit by a wolf-life creature. Then her carnal desires begin to grow.This film was an excellent example of a modern horror film without the use of disposable teen stars (like Sarah Michelle Gellar). We have two attractive Gothic sisters (which should attract the bulk of the horror movie crowd), some very disturbing behavior (playing with dead dogs), drugs and the suggestion of sex and nudity (though there isn't any explicit sex or nudity).The special effects are pretty decent, with the main character (Ginger) turning into a wolf a little more each day. The wounds were good, the syringe effects were nice and the tail. And the gore was excellent and perfect -- vomiting blood? We don't see enough of that in horror films, it's repulsive! What makes this film really stand out is the connection between lycanthropy and puberty. Since the main character is becoming a werewolf at the same time she is becoming a woman, her mother hardly seems to notice. Some parallels could be drawn to ""Carrie"", but only in a very general way. These films have nothing as far as plot in common.There was also the subplot of sibling loyalty, sibling rivalry and a greater call to justice. Some very interesting emotional moments.I thoroughly enjoyed this move and would have no problem watching it again. I strongly look forward to seeing both Ginger Snaps 2 and 3, because if the same people were involved this might be one of the best horror trilogies ever created.",Ginger Snaps
5,jboothmillard,Ginger Snaps,6,20 April 2020,"I'd heard the title of this cult a few times, I knew it was a scary movie, and it was rated well by critics, but I didn't know what the plot was, so I tried it out. Basically, in the small suburban neighbourhood of Bailey Downs, a series of animal attacks have been taking place. Teenage sisters Brigitte (Emily Perkins) and Ginger Fitzgerald (American Mary's Katharine Isabelle) have a fascination with death, as children they formed a pact to die together, and they often take photographs of themselves in deathly poses. One night, the girls are on their way to kidnap the dog of school bully Trina Sinclair (Danielle Hampton), when Ginger has her first period. The resulting blood draws the creature responsible for the maulings; it wounds and bites Ginger, but Brigitte rescues her. As the sisters flee, the creature is hit by an oncoming van driven by local drug dealer Sam Miller (Final Destination 3's Kris Lemche). Ginger decides not to go the hospital as her wounds heal quickly. Following the attack, Brigitte becomes concerned as Ginger undergoes physical and mental transformations. Ginger starts to behave aggressively (particularly in a sexual way), hairs grow from her wounds, she sprouts a tail, and she menstruate heavily. Ginger does go to the school to explain her worries, but the nurse says she is simply going through the motions of puberty and womanhood. Ginger ignores Brigitte's warnings and suspicions of what is really happening, she has unprotected sex with classmate Jason McCardy (Jesse Moss), furiously beats up Trina in public, and kills a neighbour's dog. Brigitte and Sam agree that Ginger was attacked by a werewolf and is in the process of turning into one. On Sam's advice, Brigitte persuades Ginger to get a belly button piercing made of silver in the hope of curing her, but it proves ineffective. Sam then suggests a monkshood solution, which is impossible as the plant is only found in the spring. Later, Trina fights with Ginger, after accusing her of kidnapping her dog. During the fight, Trina accidentally slips on milk and is fatally injured hitting her head on the kitchen counter. The sisters narrowly avoid their parents, hiding Trina's body in the freezer, and explaining the blood is for one of their photos. Brigitte accidentally breaks off two of Trina's fingers while trying to remove the corpse from the freezer, and the fingers are misplaced while burying Trina in the tool shed. Brigitte tells her sister she can't go out anymore, but Ginger remains defiant. On Halloween, Brigitte takes monkshood purchased by her mother and asks Sam to make the cure. While trying to find Ginger, Brigitte is attacked by Jason (who was infected due to having unprotected sex with Ginger) and she defends herself by using the monkshood on him. She witnesses his immediate change in behaviour, proving it is a cure. At school, Brigitte finds Ginger has murdered the guidance counsellor and witnesses her slaying the school janitor. The girls' mother, Pamela (Mimi Rogers), finds the fingers and Trina's corpse, and goes looking for her daughters. She drives past a running Brigitte and picks her up, driving her to the Greenhouse Bash, saying she will protect them, they will run away and burn the house to bury the evidence of Trina's death. Brigitte arrives to find Sam rejecting Ginger's advances, she breaks his arm. Although Sam pleads her not to, Brigitte infects herself with Ginger's in despair. She does this to convince Ginger of her love and loyalty to her sister and her genuine willingness to help her, ending their long fight. Ginger agrees to be helped, but suddenly Sam knocks her out with a shovel. Brigitte and Sam then take her back to the Fitzgerald house in his van and prepare more of the cure for Ginger. Ginger fully transforms into a werewolf on the way home and escapes the van. Aware that she has transformed, Sam and Brigitte hide in the pantry as he makes the cure. Sam looks for the transformed Ginger, she attacks him. Brigitte picks up the dropped syringe containing the cure and follows the blood trail. After finding Sam, injured and bloody, she tries to save him by drinking his blood to try and calm Ginger, but cannot go through with it. Ginger sees Brigitte's revulsion and kills Sam in front of her, biting him in the jugular. Ginger stalks Brigitte in the basement, until Brigitte returns to their room. She finds the knife that Ginger used to try to cut her tail off, Brigitte holds the syringe in one hand and the knife in the other. Ginger lunges at her, and into the knife, accidentally killing her. After looking at a picture of themselves, Brigitte lays her head upon her dying sister's chest and sobs. Also starring John Bourgeois as Henry Fitzgerald, Peter Keleghan as Mr. Wayne and Lindsay Leese as Nurse Ferry. Perkins, the mousy one, and Isabelle, the voluptuous one, are well cast as the unusual sisters, the werewolf movie is given an inventive twist, as the themes of womanhood are highlighted, typical teen movie things occur along the way, but the addition of bloody slaughtering gets your attention, I admit it was a little slow at times, but overall a watchable horror. Good!",Ginger Snaps
6,Woodyanders,"One of the best, most moving and inspired horror films of the early 21st century",10,8 March 2007,"Brash hottie redhead Ginger (a fabulously tart and ferocious performance by the stunningly gorgeous Katharine Isabelle) and her more plain mousy brunette sister Brigitte (superbly played by Emily Perkins) are a couple of weird withdrawn death-infatuated misfit Goth outsider girls living in a stuffy suburban town. A mysterious wild animal has been killing dogs in the neighborhood. One fateful night Ginger gets attacked and bitten by the vicious animal. The animal turns out to be a genuine werewolf. Pretty soon Ginger begins to radically transform, becoming increasingly outgoing, aggressive and even dangerous. It's up to Brigitte and nice guy pot dealer Sam (a winning portrayal by Kris Lemche) to figure out a way to cure Ginger's curse before it's too late.Ably directed by John Fawcett, with a strikingly original, intelligent and insightful script by Karen Walton, a supremely eerie and melancholy tone, bright, sparkling, polished cinematography by Thom Best, plenty of truly jolting shocks (the sequence where Ginger gets mauled is positively harrowing; another bitterly ironic moment involving an unexpected accidental death in a kitchen is likewise quite jarring), a heart-breakingly tragic conclusion, a refreshingly honest and gritty depiction of how messed-up teenagers can be (the kids in this flick swear a lot, have sex and do drugs, all of which are crucial components of adolescence), and a beautifully brooding and moody score by Michael Shields, ""Ginger Snaps"" turns the werewolf premise right on its ear, using the concept of the lycanthrope as an extremely potent, penetrating and provocative metaphor for the onset of puberty and the painful awkwardness of adolescent growing pains (Ginger's metamorphosis into a werewolf corresponds with the beginning of her menstrual cycle and subsequent budding of her newfound empowering sexuality). Better still, there are even pointed references to such classic fairy tales as ""Goldie Locks and the Three Bears,"" ""The Three Little Pigs,"" and especially ""Little Red Riding Hood."" The fact that Ginger is both scared and excited by her sudden abnormal dramatic changes qualifies as another smart and effective touch. But what really gives this picture its greatness is the wonderfully astute, moving and above all credible relationship between Ginger and Brigitte. Perkins and Isabelle are both outstanding in the leads, with equally excellent support from Lemche (who not only serves as Brigitte's love interest, but also ultimately comes through as an engagingly unlikely hero), Mimi Rogers as the girls' blithely clueless mother Pamela, Jesse Moss as thuggish jock Jason, and Danielle Hampton as stuck-up popular girl Trini. An absolute corker.",Ginger Snaps
7,Tweekums,A teenage werewolf in Canada,9,28 June 2019,"Sisters Ginger and Brigitte Fitzgerald aren't typical high school girls; when they were younger they determined that they would die together and now, for a disturbing school project, they've posed themselves for a variety of gruesome photographs. One evening, the night of Ginger's first period, they go out and are attacked by a creature that has been killing neighbourhood dogs; Ginger is injured and afterwards starts to change. She becomes predatory and violent. The only person Brigitte can turn to for help is school stoner Sam Miller; who knows about the original creature as he ran it over in his van! As time passes Ginger starts to physically change and become more dangerous.This is a top-notch addiction to the werewolf genre. It eschews most of the clichés such as silver bullets and the transformation on the night of full moon. Instead we get the search for a herbal cure and a gradual transformation following Ginger's infection. The story nicely uses lycanthropy as a metaphor for menstruation without overstating it. There is plenty of gore and just the right about of humour; this isn't knowingly ironic though. The cast does a really good job; most obviously Emily Perkins as Brigitte and Katharine Isabelle as Ginger... having a horror film with lead characters who are teenaged girls was rather refreshing. The special effects were impressive; nice to see modern film makers using physical effects rather than CGI. Overall I'd definitely recommend to horror fans who enjoy plenty of gore and like seeing new twists to old genres.",Ginger Snaps
8,BA_Harrison,Puberty bites!,7,15 March 2011,"Avid fans of Canadian werewolf movie Ginger Snaps make much of the fact that, by highlighting the many parallels between the uncontrollable transformation from child to adult and that from human to wolf, the film acts as a metaphor for puberty. What they fail to understand is that this analogous connection between growing up and growing fur 'n' fangs, whilst admittedly an undeniably interesting concept, is hardly a new one, being borne from age-old superstition and folklore. Hell, it's even been tackled in film before, in 80s UK werewolf flick The Company of Wolves. So, if truth be told, not all THAT original then.That said, Ginger Snaps is still a pretty entertaining effort, one that benefits immensely from sterling performances from its young leads, a well written script bristling with witty dialogue, an effective old-school style werewolf (once again proving that practical effects are always a better option than CGI), and a spot of gore PLUS some strangely sexy moments which ensure that, although predominantly aimed at female viewers of the type most likely to identify with the central characters (ie socially awkward female teens with a morbid obsession with death), the film will still appeal to red-blooded guys (let's face it, Isabelle is damn hot, even with a tail strapped to her leg!).",Ginger Snaps
9,paul_haakonsen,Quite good...,6,15 December 2015,"""Ginger Snaps"" is a nice addition to the werewolf genre, especially because it is more than just a werewolf movie. It does have different layers to it, which do all come together quite nicely.However, yes there is a however, I would have liked a bit more screen time for the werewolf creatures. But truth be told, then what was shown was quite good, and Ginger's gradual transformation was nicely done, especially the part about the tail.One of the best things about ""Ginger Snaps"" was without a doubt the acting performances by Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle. They really carried the movie quite well.The creature effects were good, although the werewolf looked a bit odd, especially the face. But hey, how is a mythical creature supposed to look like?""Ginger Snaps"" is an entertaining movie even if you are not a particular fan of werewolf movies.",Ginger Snaps
10,tavm,Ginger Snaps is a fine werewolf horror film concerning two teen sisters,9,29 July 2018,"Continuing to review werewolf movies in chronological order, I'm now at 2000 with this, an independently-made movie from Canada being the tale of two teen sisters-Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) and her one-year younger one Brigitte (Emily Perkins). They're both fascinated with depictions of death to the point of photographing each other in various ways of deadly accidents. Then Ginger gets bitten by a wolf while she and her sis are walking down the road...This was both horrifyingly scary and a little funny (I dug that scene of that school nurse giving advice on menstruation). And seeing Mimi Rogers as the deadpan mom was also a hoot to watch especially after she's told what's going on! So on that note, I highly recommend Ginger Snaps.",Ginger Snaps
11,Coventry,The next generation of werewolves,6,10 June 2003,"Werewolves have always been my favorite kind of horror creatures ( along with zombies ) So I was rather optimistic when I heard 2 new movies about them were coming out. Dog Soldiers and this one. Also, I heard and read good comments on the both of them here on the board and elsewhere. I've seen both now and my feelings are rather negative. This may be a personal opinion but the old legend of werewolves aren't respected anymore. I rather regret this. Sure a new wind can't do no harm, but I missing the sphere of the old ones like The Howling, American Werewolf in London and Silver Bullet. Out of Ginger Snaps and Dog Soldiers, I do prefer Ginger Snaps. the scripts contains some very original stuff and is overall funny. Also an important factor, off course.Ginger and her sister are 2 disturbed teenage girls. They don't have contact with boys, are obsessed by death and ... they never experienced their period. There's a monster loose in their village that rips apart dogs. When Ginger gets attacked by this creature, her whole personality is changing. She becomes social, hits on boys and she grows a tale. Her sister Brigitte seems to be the only one who realizes her sister is turning in to a werewolf and together with Sam ( the local drug dealer) she tries to save her sister. The make up effects in this film are very gore from time to time, so I'm sure some new and young people who are interested in the genre of horror will be very pleased by seeing this film. The more critic fans will easily forget this film. Some memorable things though: Mimi Rogers is great as the over-concerned mother. She goes nuts when she sees her daughter finally turned into a woman, and this is very funny to see. Also the slide show project about death ( which the girls are making for school ) put a smile on my face.They're already working on both a sequel and a prequel. That's probably great news to some people, but I think I'll skip them.",Ginger Snaps
12,michaelRokeefe,Once bitten...not a damn bit shy.,7,21 September 2005,"A gory coming-of-age flick with a stark turn of life caused by thoughts of suicide, ovulation and uh...werewolves. Ginger Fitzgerald(Katherine Isabelle)and her doormat younger sister Brigitte(Emily Perkins)share a fixation on suicide and sustain the thought by posing for their own 'phony' suicide photos. The girls are no doubt outcasts without concern of acceptance of their peers. Both girls are years late menstruating...keeping boys at a distance with major dislike. On the night of Ginger's first visit from the 'curse' her body's changes are escalated by being attacked by a werewolf. You might say, Ginger snaps...with a new voracious sexual appetite and finding pleasure in biting into anything that bleeds. Bridgitte rapidly becomes more bitter and agitated with the fact she has actually become her sister's keeper. Mimi Rogers plays the clueless, well-meaning mother. She finally realizes what is happening with her daughters; but is it too late to offer anything to change their fate? Also in the cast are: Jesse Moss, Kris Lemche, Danielle Hampton and Christopher Redman. GINGER SNAPS totters from frustrating to fascinating; but still having what it takes to be a dark, bizarre horror movie not to be missed. Kudos to director John Fawcett, who also shares in writing the story. I also found humor...albeit sick humor blending in the darkness.",Ginger Snaps
13,jotix100,Two sisters and werewolves,7,27 September 2005,"John Fawcett, the director of ""Ginger Snaps"", presents a horror film that shows a lot of originality. Instead of falling into the clichés of the genre, he avoids all the worst of this type of movies by creating an surreal world that scares the viewer in ways no other film in recent memory does. The tight screen play by Mr. Fawcett and Karen Walton works well on the screen.Best of all, and the main reason for watching ""Ginger Snaps"" is the work of the two principals, Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle, who play Brigitte and Ginger, respectively. Both actress add a lot to the film. There's never a false move from either one of these young actresses, who are clearly on their way to do bigger and better things, as they demonstrate in the film.The film has enough gore for this, and another film. The werewolves have a field day at the lonely fort where most of the action takes place. ""Ginger Snaps"" is recommended for a mature audience since there are some graphic scenes that will stay forever with younger, and more impressionable minds.Highly recommended for fans of horror movies!",Ginger Snaps
14,preppy-3,Brutal,7,5 December 2002,"Grim horror story about two strange sisters--Brigette (Emily Perkins) and Ginger (Katharine Isabelle).  They're very close--too close!  Their relationship got really creepy.  Then Ginger is attacked by a werewolf and starts becoming one herself.  Brigette wants to protect her and cure her, but then Ginger starts killing people...Dead serious horror film from Canada.  Well made with tons of blood and gore...I'm surprised (and pleased) that this got an R rating.  Cool werewolves too.  This is an unusual horror film.  There are no jokes, very little humor and the attack scenes are strong (this is NOT for weak stomaches) and there's an overall very depressing atmosphere.  Also good acting by the entire cast, especially Perkins, Isabelle and Kris Lemche--a real cute guy who tries to help the girls.  Strong stuff but a good film for horror fans especially.This was barely released theatrically in the US.  It's well worth searching out in video or DVD.",Ginger Snaps
15,LeonLouisRicci,Curse of the Werewolf,9,18 June 2013,"A new take on two old Themes. Here we have an Original combination of Teen Angst/Alienation and Lycanthropy Lore. This is a somewhat deep and darkly humorous Movie that Horror Fans should not miss. The two Leads are fixed in their Roles and lend total believability to their predicament/plight. They are sombre Sisters who have nothing but contempt for Life, so much so that they are fascinated with Death and banter endlessly about leaving this Worldly abomination. That is until one actually becomes a true abomination.It is at this point that the Movie wavers, just a bit, and starts to veer from its beginning of grim role playing and Goth Curmudgeon witticisms. The Film is so well handled to this point that the piercing one-liners and unconventional behavior that went before are not forgotten but are woefully wanting. The ending while not bad, just cannot compete with the Brilliant Set-up.This was a true Sleeper from Canada, ignored by American Distributors and whisked to the Video Shelves. But that didn't stop this Cult Movie from word of mouth and accolades from anyone who came across this hidden Gem. Now it has rightfully found its place among the better of Modern Horror and holds up well to its deserved and derelict reputation.",Ginger Snaps
16,poolandrews,"""If you don't like your ideas, stop having them."" Good horror.",7,28 March 2006,"Ginger Snaps is set in the small Canadian town of Bailey Downs in which a spate of gruesome attacks have left the local townsfolk dogs dead & torn to pieces. Sisters Brigitte (Emily Perkins) & Ginger Fitzgerald (Katherine Isabelle) are outsiders, they act & dress weird as everyone at their school think nothing of making fun of them especially resident bully Trina (Danielle Hampton) who mercilessly taunts them. While out one night Ginger is attacked & wounded by what appears to be a Werewolf which is killed when local drug dealer Sam (Kris Lemche) hits it while driving his van. Brigitte starts to notice a personality change in Ginger, she becomes aggressive, sexually active & also a physical change occurs as Ginger starts to grow hair on her body & a tail starts to emerge out of her backside. As Ginger's bizarre behaviour turns to murder it's up to Brigitte & Sam to try & discover a cure for Ginger before she transforms completely...This Canadian American co-production was directed by John Fawcett & is a pretty good horror film although I don't rate it as highly as some. The script by Karen Walton takes itself extremely seriously & is a Werewolf story mixed with a teenage drama as Ginger Snaps (a title which makes no sense to me) is as much about the growing pains of teenage girls, relationships, peer pressure & the emotional turmoil of periods. This is all fine, don't get me wrong as I like character development as much as the next guy but I couldn't help but find some of this stuff just a tinsy winsy bit dull & I was sitting there waiting for the action to kick in, which to be fair it eventually does. The upside of this approach is that you care & feel for the character's while the downside is that you may become bored.Director Fawcett keeps things simple yet effective & Ginger Snaps has a nice enough look to it. The special effects are entirely physical like puppets rather than CGI & they look OK, some of them look a bit rubbery particularly the transformation scene but the Werewolf looks pretty cool at the end & there's no way I would describe them as bad. The gore isn't anything to get excited over, a few mutilated dogs, an exploding Werewolf, a couple of severed fingers & lots of fake blood splashed everywhere but little in the way of graphic gore.With a supposed budget of about $5,000,000 Ginger Snaps had a pretty decent budget which I must admit I couldn't really see on screen, there's no big name actors, no exotic locations, action scenes, CGI effects & minimal Werewolf action so where did the money go? The acting was strong by everyone which helps you get into the film & become absorbed by it. A special mention goes to Mimi Rogers who is hilarious as Ginger & Brigitee's Mother.I liked Ginger Snaps as it's a very well written & thought out film but at the end of the day I couldn't stop thinking to myself that I'd wish they'd hurry up & bring the Werewolves on. Followed by a sequel Ginger Snaps: Unleashed (2004) & a prequel Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning (2004) which were filmed back-to-back.",Ginger Snaps

The sound, the cinematography, the lighting, the editing, the music: all first rate. This was a film that really made good use of it's budget.It is a horror film, but it certainly is not the best in werewolf films. There is blood, of course there is blood, but there is no carnage. Anyone looking for ripping flesh needs to look elsewhere. There is sex, as Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) is experiencing the onset of puberty and, combined with the attack by a werewolf that is changing her, is in intense need of sex. No nudity, however - hey she is supposed to be 16, you pervert! Ginger's sister Brigette (Emily Perkins) is outstanding as she tries to save her sister.Mimi Rogers is excellent as their mother and really added to the humor of this film.It's a must-see for werewolf fans.",Ginger Snaps
18,Boba_Fett1138,Just not that impressed.,6,18 January 2011,"It's not like this is being an horrible movie but I just don't get what everybody is raving about. The 'cleverness' in this movie only comes from its metaphors and it's mostly being a lack-luster movie, with just not enough tension, mystery or comedy.I would had probably loved this movie if it had been done as a comedy. I just think that the movie its concept would had better suited that genre and the movie that way could had really been a funny as well as entertaining one to watch. The movie is still being listed as a comedy but I just really can't see it as one. The situations are certainly over-the-top but there is just nothing else about this movie ever screams out comedy or even something remotely funny.To be honest, I like coming of age movies and I also really like horror, so by all rights I should be absolutely loving this movie but I'm just not doing so. They use a metaphor of werewolf-ism for puberty in this movie, which is about the only thing that makes this an interesting movie to watch but as the movie moves along it just becomes more and more ridicules, when stranger and stranger situations are happening, that are all extremely unlikely. This is when I started to loose interest in this movie pretty fast.Some more tension and mystery also really wouldn't had harmed this movie. I wanted more to happen but it's as if the movie is mostly holding back with all of its horror and mystery aspects. Granted that this also wasn't the aim the film-makers were having in minds but it at least would could had spiced up things a little more in this movie.This movie is also suffering from the curse of the '90's movies (even though this is a 2000 movie), which is meaning that it has an awful TV-look over it and just a bad overall directing style.Overall it's still being a good enough movie but just not one I'm crazy about or want to see again. Still will be watching the sequels though, so lets see if they've improved on certain points.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Ginger Snaps
19,view_and_review,Goth Girls Gore Fest,3,4 January 2021,"A goth emo girl gets bitten by a werewolf and becomes a goth emo vixen that's extra strong and thirsty for blood.Not a single character in this weirdo movie was normal, and the two sisters were the most abnormal. They were sisters who were one year apart and attached at the hip. They had some strange symbiotic relationship to the point they had a death pact with one another that they made at eight and nine-years-old. Whatever older moody sister did the younger moodier sister wanted to do. They were obsessed with death, fitting out, and each other. They were like older, vulgar, less funny versions of Wednesday from ""The Addams Family.""The older sister, Ginger (Katharine Isabelle), was the one bitten by a werewolf and became one too. ""Ginger Snaps"" get it. Yeah, I wasn't that impressed either. This movie would've been so much better if it was funnier. They went for some dark comedy at times while they went straight horror other times. They ended up with a goth girls gore fest.",Ginger Snaps
20,anaconda-40658,Ginger Snapped.,6,6 October 2015,"Ginger Snaps (2000): Dir: John Fawcett / Cast: Emily Perkins, Katherine Isabelle, Mimi Rogers, Kris Lemche, Danielle Hampton: Graphic and gory werewolf movie that opens with the discovery of a dismembered dog in the backyard. The blame is pointed at two sisters with an obsession with suicide as depicted in their gory student films. A plan to kill a popular girl's dog ends with one of them attacked and nearly mangled by a very large creature that would be struck by a van. The wounded girl begins to grow hair where she shouldn't and a tail emerges. Her sister struggles to conceal the change and find answers. This concludes with loose ends and a lot of spilled blood. Director John Fawcett creates a unique bond between two girls. Emily Perkins and Katherine Isabelle create an unusual chemistry as one struggles to help the other who herself, doesn't want to be helped. Kris Lemche is effective as the guy whose van struck the original creature. Now he attempts to find a cure. Mimi Rogers as a parent is an unnecessary distraction that is never involved in the film. Danielle Hampton plays a bully whose dog ends up in dire possession of the psychotic sisters. The climax is scary but it is also unnecessary in its presentation of violence. It is extremely graphic and quite fatal to its principal characters. The symbolic play on puberty is clever but the gore will make certain viewers snap. Score: 6 ½ / 10",Ginger Snaps
21,kannibalcorpsegrinder,New twist to a time-honored story,6,22 June 2015,"Living together in a small town, two sisters find the creature hunting them down is one of them who got turned into a werewolf and must find a way to contain the ravenous beast within before more of their friends are killed.Frankly this one turned out to be somewhat of a disappointment. The film's main problem here is also one of its best features in the connection between the onset of woman-hood with the curse of lycanthropy which is the big guise in this one. It associates some of the normal conditions of burgeoning femininity as the potential signs of lycanthropy, from the introduction of the feminine status, their biology starting to give away their conditions and the sudden outburst of aggressive behavior seems to be all consistent with the changes found in this situation, and the trade-off with the lycanthropy traits is something that's fun and unique to this one. That said, none of these are really all that enjoyable as they take the focus off the horror to such an extent that the film instead paces along quite dreadfully by remaining stuck with these teen-angst drama scenes that are just not that exciting. The scenes of the two girls lamenting their high-school situation, how they're concerned with that project of life-like death photographs of themselves or the utterly bland and boring school-yard meandering are not that exciting and really make it hard to care all that much about the girls or their condition in the first half and really makes it hard to buy into this one as a horror movie at times. Thankfully, what saves this one is the film's fleeting horror moments as there's numerous pretty well-timed scares and suspense in here which really brings this one up considerably. The initial playground attack is simply stellar with the hairy beasts' rapid movements an inhuman growling giving the impression of something running around that's hidden enough to make it a mystery about its identity while offering plenty of suspenseful tactics of them chasing off into the woods. The later attacks offer up plenty of gruesome attacks alongside some rather fun times here with the attacks at school on the personnel, the party scenes are a lot of fun with the seduction coming off rather nicely before the initial transformation scene and the big one that works well here is the finale at the house. Finally letting the werewolf loose, getting some impressive stalking as she follows the blood trail through into the basement and some fantastic action all together for a spectacular scene that serves as the highlight here. Lastly, the design for the wolf is a bit more modern, with a large head, lean body that has more wolf-like qualities than most previous werewolf designs yet still retains the vicious appearance and attitude that make it something to be feared and respected while looking somewhat original here as well. These here are the film's overall positives.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, drug use, several scenes of animal violence and detailed discussions and events about puberty.",Ginger Snaps

Redhead Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) is hot and blunt while Brigette (Emily Perkins) is mousey. When the former gets bit by an evident werewolf she slowly starts morphing and it changes the siblings' lives forever. Kris Lemche and Jesse Moss are on hand as the dudes in the girls' lives while Mimi Rogers plays the seemingly oblivious mother.""Ginger Snaps"" (2000) takes place in the Fall and there's a gloomy pall with constant F-bombs (mostly from Ginger), but an edge of black humor. The blithe mother, for instance, is amusing. There are similarities to ""The Rage: Carrie 2"" (1999), but it's nowhere near as effective. The set-up is good, but the story starts to drag from there and the suburban locations are disagreeably one-dimensional. Katharine Isabelle is the sole feminine interest, but Perkins plays a somewhat interesting character. Meanwhile Lemche's Sam is notable as the unexpectedly gallant pot-pusher.The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes and was shot in suburbs of Toronto (Brampton, Mississauga & Markham).GRADE: B-/C+",Ginger Snaps

24,sddavis63,A Tale Of Two Sisters,9,15 August 2009,"Surely this has to rank as the best werewolf movie made in quite a long time. Sometimes frightening and sometimes funny, there's enough in common with the traditional werewolf stories to offer a sense of familiarity to the story, but there's also enough original content that makes this unpredictable. The movie opens with a pretty graphic scene of a dog that's been torn to pieces by some strange animal, and then fades pretty quickly into the story of the two Fitzgerald sisters - Ginger and Bridgette. These are two troubled girls, friendless (except for each other) with death fantasies and an apparent pact to commit suicide together by the age of 16. Suddenly, Ginger finds herself attacked by this same strange creature, and her transformation begins.The transformation itself is a sort of heightened portrayal of female puberty, as Ginger has just had her first period and is having all the physical symptoms that accompany puberty being heightened by lycanthropy, with a few additional symptoms added to the mix - like growing a tail! Unlike most werewolf movies, there isn't a sudden transformation. It happens gradually (and actually begins almost immediately after Ginger is attacked), which heightens the sense of dread, with not everything waiting for the next full moon (the lunar cycle obviously, in the context of the movie, mirroring Ginger's menstrual cycle.) As Ginger and Bridgette, Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins were bang-on perfect, capturing the characters superbly. The movie is filled with assorted other quirky characters as well (maybe a few too many, and maybe some of those were a bit too quirky, which every now and then makes an otherwise frightening or funny movie fall into a bit of ridiculousness, although that doesn't weaken the overall story too much.) It's quite graphic at times, although nothing seemed gratuitous, and the last scenes of the movie, with Bridgette hunting Ginger down in the house, are really quite creepy and finally offer a look at a very unique looking and scary werewolf.This is extremely well done, and deserves to be considered as one of the better modern horror movies. 9/10",Ginger Snaps

26,lost-in-limbo,Adolescent woes with a werewolf twist,7,26 January 2005,"One-night two outcast sisters where out in a park when suddenly one of them is attacked by unknown beast. Her sister Brigitte notices the sudden change in her and she races to devise a potion to rid the curse from Ginger.This has to be one of the most unique horror films of the last decade (along with Scream). This is more about adolescent woes (periods, dating and such & such) for two sisters, with a werewolf twist added in. That's one minor thing that disappointed me about it, as the werewolf part of the film didn't really kick in until just over halfway through the movie. Otherwise the story never really had a boring moment. So I really give credit Karen Walton, on a pretty original take that was sharp and edgy.The performances are really excellent. The stunning Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins gel perfectly as the Gothic type who have an obsession with death, Ginger and Brigitte Fitzgerald. Mimi Rogers is good as the twitchy Mrs Fitzgerald and Kris Lemche is decent enough as a student trying to help out Brigitte.The main things that stood out for me was the superb soundtrack and the real moody cinematography that truly gave this film another distinguishing element. The special effects are reasonably good. Allot of blood & gore. Seeing small glimpses of sharp teeth, tails and growing hair of the werewolf, but the full design of the whole werewolf is not really seen until the last 20mins and it doesn't look that bad for a small budget film.Not in the same league as ""An American werewolf in London"", but this was quite surprising and enjoyable. A real stylish and yet sexy film, though don't expect it to be like the usual werewolf movies.3.5/5",Ginger Snaps
27,Robert_duder,"A gory, blood soaked, cult favorite that drags a little long",5,5 July 2006,"Ginger Snaps is another attempt at taking a timeless urban legend, the werewolf, and putting a new spin on it and when all is said and done it does that to the utmost. Filled with gratuitous violence, blood and bad language it tries to be a teen horror flick, and almost coming of age film all at once. The cast is really good including the two main characters and the special effects are adequate considering the film is low budget and Canadian. The funny thing is the amount of film awards this film took home back in 2000. This is really nothing more than a gore fest with an excuse to put as many ""F"" words in a film as possible just like most other horror films and yet it took him tons of awards. Nonetheless the film tries to be different with a tried and true tale of werewolves.Katharine Isabelle is really the star of the film. She plays eldest Fitzgerald sister Ginger. Isabelle plays psychotic in the film basically from beginning to end but it's the progression of psychosis that makes her truly disturbing. She is a great actress, has a certain spark to her and a worthy addition as a killer in the grand scheme of horror films. She does a great job and I think this film probably will be a stepping stone for her onto bigger things. Emily Perkins plays sister #2, Bridgett ""B"" Fitzgerald. She's far more conservative than her sister but both sisters are dark and goth and obsessed with the idea of death (although petrified by it in real life.) Perkins has quite a transition of character as well although different entirely from Isabelle's arc. Perkins' character goes from shy, withdrawn, completely useless without her sister to being the hero, the strength to stop her sister and in the beginning of the film I really didn't like her character, I thought she was really bland and lacked strength but she pulled it off by the end and really came out on top as the hero. Kris Lemche plays the sidekick who tries to help Bridgett with a cure to the Werewolf disease. He does a good job and is quite stereotypical as the third party horror teen. Destined to die but there for a purpose. I'm not sure that the story line of him being a drug dealer was for any reason at all and was kind of pointless except maybe to justify his death at the hands of Ginger. Finally veteran actress Mimi Rogers plays the Fitzgerald's Mom. Strong, overprotective, but yet withdrawn and naive in many ways. Her role isn't a big one but she does play her role very well and she is a worthy addition to the cast. She's almost played a little too stupid for what Mimi Rogers should have played and could have been written in a little more I think.Director and co-writer John Fawcett has done a lot of television including Xena Warrior Princess and perhaps that contributed to Ginger Snaps being so gory, dark, gritty, and overtly grotesque in bad language and blood everywhere. It's far darker and grotesque than your average teeny horror film so I think due to content this film gets bumped up a notch to non-teen slasher status. There is some truly unique moments about this film though. First and foremost the main characters and strength to the film both bad and good are female. They are sexualized or used as eye candy but genuinely carry the film and this is a pleasure to see!! The major problem with Ginger Snaps is that it dragged and did not need to at all!! The film could have easily been trimmed down another 15 minutes and been even better but especially the ending dragged on and on when it did not need to!! The two Fitzgerald sisters played off each other very well but their final battle where basically these two sisters that were inseparable have to go against each other and one is surely to die just didn't feel climatic. There should have been more focus on the battle. On top of that the whole film really felt downplayed, it dragged and it was just a little bland. There was no real excitement even in the scenes of death. Aside from being a huge horror fan and watching it because so far it's a trilogy (which I will watch) this one is kind of a dud. It's not bad per se, but it's not good...it's just there...it's just blah. 5/10",Ginger Snaps
28,paul2001sw-1,A teenage werewolf in Canada,9,29 March 2006,"Plenty of films equate the bloody lusts of vampires with sexual desire, usually without much subtlety or imagination; but John Fawcett's film 'Ginger Snaps' makes a rather more explicit link: one between lycanthropy and puberty. In fact, so lovingly does the film recreate the world of two Gothic sisters (including their hopeless mother, who wants them to be normal and happy in a way that doesn't help anyone) that becoming a werewolf seems like nothing more than a natural extension to the growing pains of a disturbed teenager. It's the believable psychology that makes this film genuinely scary, even though it's almost completely devoid of special effects until the very end; and even in the final showdown, one can still half-believe in the kinship of girl and beast. Overall, it's proof you can make a high class horror film set not in some fantastic landscape, but in the bland anonymity of suburban Canada.",Ginger Snaps
29,sol-,Maturing into a woman or a wolf?,7,1 July 2006,"A horror film with the horrors of growing up in the backdrop, 'Ginger Snaps' makes a rather refreshing, if not brilliant, horror movie experience. The film is about two ostracised sisters, who come into contact with werewolves at the same time as their bodies are starting to mature. The elder of the two sisters, Ginger, has her first period just before being attacked by a werewolf. Having survived the attack, her body experiences two lots of changes, both the normal pubic changes and the changes to her chemistry from the werewolf ""virus"". Through featuring a coming-of-age allegory together with the horror, the film gives one more to think about than just the horror plot and theories.There are also themes of loyalty and sisterly bonds tied in, with the lengths to which B (Ginger's sister) will go to in order to help Ginger out, mostly based on a pact that they made with each other eight years before. The premise of the movie is good: an ontological tale with literal coming-of-age horrors and something to think about in terms of loyalty. However, in execution these themes and ideas are more so in the backdrop rather than being the backdrop to the events that are played out. One exception though is that there is some slight allegory about having unpredicted sex, when Ginger accidentally infects a guy from school. Most of the film though is standard horror plotting, and does not necessarily fall back on the issues that the film is ultimately meant to be about. In this regard, 'Carrie' did a better job.It is interesting to compare the film to 'Carrie', because the lead character(s) are similar, and the plot has similar themes about growing up and the pressures of high school life. However, while 'Carrie' was more so a drama disguised as a horror film, in which the protagonist's powers were a result of her anger, and the horror all tied in with what she was feeling, the evil that the sisters in Ginger Snaps are introduced is not as a result of their own will. Ginger did not choose to become a werewolf; it just happened to her, which is a far less powerful stance than what is taken in Carrie. But, the film should not be faulted too much for not maximising its potential. 'Ginger Snaps' is well done in plenty of areas in addition to the satisfactory amount of depth that it tries to have.The film's best aspect would either be the makeup or the cinematography. Changing into werewolf special effects have advanced a lot since 1981, and the film does nothing special here, but in terms of the makeup on Ginger (and the guy she sleeps with), it really makes her look like someone in transit between being animal and human. And the makeup also changes quite gradually too - it is really well done in this regard. The camera-work adds suspense and thrills to the film, with many angled shots to make the viewer uncomfortable, and more often than not, the attacks cannot be seen when they happen due to the frantic camera-work. One of the best scenes though is a scene involved spilt milk. After the milk is spilt, bright white (milky) light is used on the performers.The quality of the acting by the actresses who play the two sisters is impressive, especially considering that the older of the two actresses, Emily Perkins, is playing the B, the younger character. Perkins gives the perfect portrayal of a social misfit - from the hunched over way she stands to the uncertainty in her voice whenever she speaks. The supporting performances in the film are not too wonderful, but then again, every single supporting character is a dull stereotype - we have the over-concerned, control freak mother; the powerless, shy father; the perky but stupid school nurse; the attractive but bitchy popular girl; the foreign janitor who just always gets in the way. It is a real shame that the characters are so poor when the screenplay itself is trying to be something more in terms of plot.Overall, Ginger Snaps is not a horror masterpiece despite being very well done in a number of areas. It could have done with more realistic and interesting supporting characters, and the coming-of-age aspects could have tied in better with the horror. However, when Hollywood is producing so much routine horror fluff these days, it is nice to come across a Canadian film like this that can bring something refreshing to the genre.",Ginger Snaps

31,Anonymous_Maxine,"Ginger snaps, Brigitte broods.",7,8 December 2004,"Ginger Snaps is kind of strange because it is, by definition, a teen horror movie, a genre which I have come to find is made up of almost exclusively awful movies. These are generally the stupid teen horror/sex comedies cranked out by Hollywood, but Ginger Snaps is able to escape that, with no help from the special effects department, by the way. The werewolf featured in the movie is an intricate piece of horror machinery, but it is immensely unconvincing. I have to admit that I had a hard time getting interested in the movie and often found myself checking how much time was left before it ended, but that is probably mostly because when I was watching it I still wanted to watch Bride of Chucky and Willard before going to bed.The very beginning of the movie starts with a great montage of some impressive shots of a typical Canadian suburb, I suppose. A quiet, picturesque community in which we can expect some not so quiet or picturesque things will soon happen. It's not long before a mutilated dog is discovered, and its owner, an understandably frantic woman whose son found a piece of the dog in his sandbox, runs out front and screams that it got her dog. Evidently there is some wild beast running loose, and it's not long before Brigitte and Ginger, the movie's two disturbed and disturbing sisters, have a run-in with it.We are introduced to a pair of sisters who live comfortably as outcasts in their school and neighborhood. Comfortably, of course, only because they each despise the majority of their classmates and other people, not because they enjoy their social status as outcasts. Ginger, played by Katharine Isabelle, may be more famous in America for her role in Freddy vs. Jason, and as horror fans surely you remember Emily Perkins, who plays Brigitte, from her role as Beverly Marsh in 'It.' Anyway, Perkins does a great job as the outcast disgusted with people in general, although her constant look of antipathy on a face always half covered with hair tends to get a little old. It's hard to accept as a protagonist someone who is constantly sneering at the world.What I really liked about the movie was the way it tied in Ginger's transformation with the raging hormones that tend to impact the lives of teenagers at right about that time of life. Well, typically about three years earlier, but that's just another reason the girls reject close friendships with other people. Three years late with their menstruation and dressed in heavy, dark clothing complete with over-sized and untied Dr. Martens, knee-high black socks, dark plaid skirts and heavy black coats tends to be a combination that wins you no points with the cheerleader crowd. Thus it is more understandable why the two sisters have developed such a bond, which is unusually close even for twins (which they are not).There is one point in the movie, after having been attacked, scratched and bitten, I think, by the neighborhood werewolf, Ginger starts to grow hair out of the huge claw-wounds on her shoulder, and in one scene finds herself talking to the school nurse, who explains to her about changes in her body, such as hair where there was no hair before. This is even further tied in with the girls' disgust with their own emerging sexuality, as Ginger's period equated with the disease she was given by the werewolf, referred to as 'the curse.' Given their attitudes about sexuality, it would seem that menstruation is being referred to, but in the context of the rest of the movie I would think that a disease that turns you into a hideous, hairless wolf would qualify for that title more than something as natural as menstruation.Screenwriter Karen Walton clearly writes from the perspective of someone who has been through the turmoil of female development, since a man could never have written something as accurate as this movie. On the other hand, I have no idea what it's like for teenage girls during puberty, so I don't have much way of knowing how accurate the portrayal really is, but I knew a lot of girls in high school and these girls look and act a lot like the girls I knew did. Except for the whole fangs and blood thing. Oh and the pictures of fake suicides. I never knew anyone who was into that stuff all that much.I remember when I was in high school I did have a femur pen exactly like the ones that Ginger and Brigitte both use in this movie. I used to use it to show people where I had broken mine when I was a kid. Snapped that ball at the top right off and it was no fun at all. I remember that my pen wrote in this weird purplish color and didn't write very well, as you can see briefly in one scene in the movie, but it was still a cool pen.Clearly, since the movie spawned two sequels, which both came out in quick succession, there must be something good about it. I was not that impressed with the lycanthrope at the end of the movie, but I loved how much it was kept off screen for more than the first hour, just like Spielberg kept that shark out of Jaws completely for a good portion of the film. I like to think that, like Spielberg, director John Fawcett knew that he had something mediocre in the effects department, if only because a living, breathing, bleeding werewolf is not the easiest thing to come up with on what must have been a less than extensive budget.It really is surprising that Ginger Snaps is able to deal almost exclusively with teens and their budding sexuality and not come off as another exploitive teen horror movie, but it succeeds because the movie is well written, directed, and performed by everyone involved. Also featured is a wonderful performance from Mimi Rogers, who, as the girls' mother, clearly remembers what it was like to go through what Ginger is going through, but just as clearly has no idea how to handle their outbursts (consider her reaction in the scene when Ginger screams at her to get out of the bathroom). I can't speak for the sequels yet, but this movie is worth a look.",Ginger Snaps
32,Vartiainen,Fantastic B-horror movie,7,16 July 2015,"Allegories are nothing new to the horror genre, or fiction in general, but oftentimes they're rather forced and/or unimaginative. There are of course some good examples, like X-Men, but often, especially in horror, it's painfully obvious what the allusion is meant to be and what the film makers want to say with it. It ain't exactly subtle, is what I'm saying. Which is why it's often better to not even attempt to be subtle and make the painfully obvious allegory slash symbolism work for you.Such is the case of Ginger Snaps. Two sisters, Brigitte (Emily Perkins) and Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) are hilariously alternative teenagers. They're into goths, suicides, the colour purple and living in the most dungeon-like basement I've seen in a while. Yet it doesn't feel fake, but just the right amount of over the top. But everything takes a turn for the worse when one of them changes. Both into a woman and a werewolf. Suddenly she's all about blood and lust and mating and bitching at people, leaving her poor virginal sister behind. I said the allegory was painfully obvious, didn't I. But, it works because the film is honest about it. It plays it off as a joke, with tongue firmly in cheek, which turns a groan-worthy B-movie shlock into quite hilarious horror parody, which is still works as a straight horror film as well. Almost like Stephen King's Carrie meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer.It also helps that the two main leads are both fantastic. Isabelle is the more typical horror heroine with the looks and the lines, which makes her a great partner for Perkins, whose portrayal of a wallflower shut-in Brigitte is one of the better ones I've seen. She's shy and the oddball in school, but she has character and smarts to make her more than a stereotype.The movie's only real fault is the third act, which is rather predictable and clichéd as far as monster horror movies go. There are some good twists, but it does drag quite badly and the ending is not worthy of the buildup. It's not really even all that awful, but it is disappointing when compared to the tone and promise of the two previous acts.Still, Ginger Snaps is a great movie to check out if you're into campy horror movies that know not to take themselves too seriously.",Ginger Snaps

Stars: Emily Perkins, Katharine Isabelle, Kris LemcheIn this modern werewolf tale, sisters Ginger and Brigitte are ostracized because of their obsession with darkness and death. Outcasts in their suburban neighborhood, the girls must deal with the tragic consequences when one of them is bitten by a deadly werewolf.This Canadian film surpassed my expectations with the strength of its leads, disturbing body horror transformations, and its dark humor. Even though it starts with a high school scenario, this is one of the best black comedies I've seen. At its core Ginger Snaps is actually a more complex story than it appears, it is about the meaning of devotion, and its failure. It is also a horror film that succeeds at being a classical tragedy . I bought this on Blu-ray like 5 years ago and never watched it till tonight. I absolutely adore this film. It's truly a classic with its, smart writing, and great acting.It's comparison between lycanthropism and puberty is unique. Fresh, edgy, and sinister. 9/10",Ginger Snaps
38,Chris_Docker,Cutesy and cool - nothing that shocking though.,5,11 July 2001,Cutesy wee horror film from Canadian independent cinema. Pubescent girls get werewolfish (extended tongue in cheek analogy - a bit strained but good humouredly so). It's nice to see a horror film not rely heavily on the latest special effects for punchlines but there again this film isn't outstanding - just quite good. We are so used to horror films that are awful that it seems a refreshing change.,Ginger Snaps
39,drownnnsoda,Strangely Appealing Teenage Horror Movie.,8,30 April 2007,"""Ginger Snaps"" is an obscure little Canadian werewolf movie that you would probably be surprised by. The story follows the Fitzgerald sisters, Ginger (Katharine Isabelle, ""Freddy Vs. Jason"") and Brigitte (Emily Perkins). They're misfit high school teenagers, very dark and obsessed with death and torture (they even constructed a slide show of themselves posing as dead people in many gruesome ways, and showed it to their class for a school project). They're known for their dark personalities, and aren't the most popular kids in school, but they've got each other. Things change one night though when Ginger is attacked by some sort of beast, and then begins having some strange side effects after the attack - both sisters slowly realize that Ginger is becoming a werewolf, and with the help of one of their peers, Sam (Kris Lemche, ""Final Destination 3""), Brigitte struggles to save Ginger.Definitely an off-the-wall teenage horror movie, ""Ginger Snaps"" is still strangely appealing and very entertaining. I'm not a huge fan of werewolf movies (of the few I've seen, my favorite is probably ""An American Werewolf In London""), so I wasn't sure what to expect before watching this movie, but luckily I was pleasantly surprised. ""Ginger Snaps"" is a nice mixture of a bloody werewolf movie and a teenage drama (with traces of dark humor also) that works surprisingly well. Unlike most horror flicks of the late, the writing here is really good, and the story is refreshing - it's something fairly new, you definitely don't see a movie like this everyday. The characters are believable, and while the situations they're in may not be, they still come off as ""real"" people. It's strange too because the main characters (both of the Fitzgerald sisters) are so quirky and dark, but they end up having a lot more depth than you'd think. The audience can actually sympathize with them, as hard as that may be to believe based on the first twenty minutes of the movie. These characters develop through the course of the movie, quite strongly.Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle lead the cast here, and I thought both of them did very well. Perkins plays the younger sister who is trying to be helpful to her sister who is in a very weird situation, and pulls it off. Isabelle is the older of the two, and her character makes some significant changes (personally and physically) as the movie progresses, and she does a good job with this. She goes from dark teenage girl to bloody-thirsty lycanthrope, and while she does become a little evil, I still sympathized with her. Both of these actresses were very good and worked well together - they were likable. Kris Lemche plays a drug-dealing side character who teams up with Brigitte to help with her sister's condition, and Mimi Rogers plays the girls' oblivious but caring mother, in a strangely funny role. The cinematography here is notable as well, John Fawcett (""The Dark"") crafts the film well, with plenty of great imagery and a moody atmosphere. The werewolf special effects here aren't magnificent, but I was surprised by them because I was expecting worse - they're really not too bad, but most everything else is realistic.Overall, ""Ginger Snaps"" is a strange little werewolf movie. It's entertaining, spooky, gruesome, and strangely funny on some occasions. It's not your typical teenage horror flick (or werewolf flick, for that matter), and it stands out from the rest of the crowd because of it's unique premise. Anyone who enjoys werewolf movies should definitely check out this indie flick, it's surprisingly a lot better than you might assume, and likely one of the best Canadian horror films in recent years. Give it a chance, you should find it rewarding. 8/10.",Ginger Snaps
40,I_Ailurophile,Is this the best werewolf movie ever made?,10,12 October 2021,"After years of hearing vague but good word of mouth, I was ecstatic to belatedly get around to watching 'Ginger snaps.' The recommendations did not lead me astray: This is an outstanding movie, and while I don't claim perfect knowledge, I think it's arguably the best of all werewolf movies made to date.The makeup, prosthetics, and effects that constitute the gradual transformation are fantastic. The movie plays fast and loose with varied, established lycanthrope lore, but portrays the condition, and all manner of knowledge and possible cures, in a way that feels as believably plausible as any other depiction, if not moreso. The beast itself is a better visualization than we have gotten from many others among this picture's brethren.The screenplay is rock solid. True, the broad arc of the creature feature story is not especially dissimilar from other werewolf films. 'Ginger snaps' is also far from the first or only movie to explore an additional layer of hardship befalling characters going through puberty, or the trials of high school. However, these are not inherent marks against this specific title, and moreover, this seems like an especially earnest rendition. The narrative is honestly very relatable as the story of two girls struggling to understand and manage something new and frightening while ill at ease with their peers and surroundings. Every line of dialogue, and every scene, is written with what feels like careful faithfulness to the experience of two social misfit teens who could be anybody. The execution is just as marvelous, with great consideration for all effects including blood and gore, costume design, hair and makeup generally, set design and decoration, and every little detail that goes into making this the movie that it is.Of course the centerpiece of the film is the relationship between sisters Brigitte and Ginger, and they are written as complex, intelligent, and sardonically brooding in their relative social isolation. Stars Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle are more than capable of filling the roles, and both embody the teens with wonderful range, nuance, presence, and body language. While Brigitte and Ginger are very much alike in so many ways, the younger is slightly more timid and demure than the elder, a disparity that grows with the advancement of the plot. Perkins and Isabelle bring these characters to vivid life through every turn, realizing varied emotions and states of mind leading into a phenomenal, riveting climax and ending. It's hardly surprising, but 'Gingers snaps' gets very dark, to my utmost delight.Never necessarily outright scary, the film is still rife with tension, and minor thrills and suspense. At the same time it also shoulders an air of dread, and sorrow, especially in the latter half as the sisters' situation grows more dire. It's certainly readily engrossing - easy to become invested in with the great story, and sympathetic characters portrayed so skillfully with excellent performances. It's a movie that gives a classic genre story its own spin, a take that makes werewolves feel more concretely real than other pictures are able to do. Director John Fawcett and co-writer Karen Walton have outdone themselves: It's not going to be for everyone, but for my part, I think 'Ginger snaps' is perhaps the superlative werewolf film of any cinema has had to offer so far - well worth seeking out, and earning my highest recommendation.",Ginger Snaps
41,ferbs54,The Curse Gets Worse,7,5 November 2014,"The viscerally effective horror thriller ""Ginger Snaps"" sports a doubly clever title. Gingersnaps, of course, are yummy cookie treats sweetened with molasses and, naturally, ginger, but that is hardly what is being suggested here. ""Snaps"" can also mean ""to go crazy"" or ""to lose it,"" which is certainly the case for the film's lead character, Ginger Fitzgerald. And more to the point, ""snaps"" can also mean ""to seize with a sudden closing of the jaws,"" which is what poor Ginger does quite a lot of here, as she slowly morphs into a truly grotesque werewolf, in John Fawcett's surprisingly effective film. Released in September 2000, the Canadian picture was moderately successful at the box office but has since then become something of a bona fide cult item, and one that has spawned two further entries.In the film, the viewer encounters the Fitzgerald sisters, the pubescent Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) and her 15-year-old junior, Brigitte (Emily Perkins); two death-obsessed oddballs who spend their time making movies of their faked suicides and rehashing their mutual death pact. But their morbid fixation soon palls in the light of a more serious concern. Their suburban community of Bailey Downs has lately been plagued by a series of attacks; some strange creature has been brutally killing the local dogs. And then one night, coinciding precisely with her first menstruation, Ginger is attacked and bitten by that self-same creature, which is then run over and squashed by the van being driven by the local high school drug dealer, Sam (Kris Lemche). Too late for Ginger, though, who soon starts to sprout hair, grow sexually rapacious, smoke pot, and ""utter sharp biting words"" (yet another meaning of the word ""snap"") at everyone around her. But when she actually starts to sprout a tail at the base of her spine, that is when Brigitte realizes that these are not just simple physical and personality changes brought on by Ginger's first period, and goes to Sam in the hope of finding a cure. And since Ginger's increasingly promiscuous and violent personality has already resulted in one more infected lycanthrope and at least three dead bodies, that cure cannot come quickly enough....Watching ""Ginger Snaps"" for the first time, this viewer was forcefully reminded of the films of another Canadian filmmaker, David Cronenberg, whose pet theme, in films such as ""They Came From Within,"" ""Rabid"" and ""The Brood,"" has been ""the body in revolt""; that quease-inducing horror that arises when a person's body turns against one. Here, Ginger's slow and agonizing transformation is no less shocking than Marilyn Chambers' Rose's was in ""Rabid"" or Samantha Eggar's Nola's was in ""The Brood,"" and her initial period is certainly rougher than Carrie White's was in ""Carrie."" Yes, the film does use lycanthropy as an apt metaphor for puberty (""They don't call it the curse for nothing,"" the film's promotional poster proclaimed), and one that should make all teenagers feel a bit better about their own occasional cramp or change in voice! Metaphors aside, the film succeeds as an excellent horror outing, and the creature that Ginger becomes by the picture's end is a fairly nasty addition to the werewolf pantheon. The film is pretty darn serious, grim, bloody and downbeat, and what little humor it does possess is provided by the gals' dim bulb of a mother, played by Mimi Rogers. (Rogers had previously starred in one of this viewer's favorite films of the '90s, ""The Rapture."") ""Ginger Snaps"" refuses to follow the typical outlines of more conventional horror films, and viewers hoping for a happy ending, with Ginger successfully restored and hopelessly antisocial Brigitte entering into a romantic relationship with hunky dude Sam, might be a little disappointed--no, appalled--at how things turn out. Perhaps the single best element of the entire affair is Perkins' contribution, although Isabelle surely has the flashier, showier role. It is genuinely touching what Brigitte puts herself through--including self-infection--to help her older sister, despite Ginger becoming increasingly problematic as the film proceeds. Perkins is just terrific; just look at her glower sullenly from behind her lank hair, shooting out expressions of intensity of which no one would want to be on the receiving end! Truly, the kind of sister anyone would want when the chips are down, or a bloodthirsty monster is running around loose!""Ginger Snaps"" is hardly a perfect film, good as it is. Many of the characters, Perkins' and Isabelle's included, give mumbled line readings, although that might be more a reflection of how teens actually talk today than an inherent problem with the actors themselves. Still, this viewer would greatly have appreciated some English subtitles for the hard of hearing on the DVD that I just watched. Another problem: The werewolf attacks--both those of the initial creature and those of Ginger at the finale--are very hard to follow, what with the frenzied cutting and rapidity of motion involved. Still, the disorientation engendered thereby only serves to ratchet up the fright factor, so no real complaints from me. As mentioned, the film spawned two sequels, ""Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed"" and a prequel (!), ""Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning,"" the latter having been released straight to video. And after seeing the first installment in what has turned out to be a trilogy, I cannot imagine anyone not wanting to learn more about those morose, death-obsessed Fitzgerald sisters....",Ginger Snaps
42,Jonny_Numb,Breathes new life into a stagnant movie monster,7,25 November 2007,"The current climate of horror cinema has very little interest in layered plots and/or characters, and even less interest in bringing metaphorical qualities to a genre consistently condemned for its own preoccupation with surface elements. Today, filmmakers attempt to 'justify' their excesses with the stand-by explanation of ""life in a post-9/11 society."" And even though ""Ginger Snaps"" is now seven years old, its cleverness and originality easily outshines any of the torture offerings that have infested multiplexes since. It's the tale of Brigitte (Emily Perkins) and Ginger Fitzgerald (Katharine Isabelle), two closely-bonded suburbanite goth twins wielding their sarcasm against a uniformly bland, WASPy landscape only to have that bond tested when Ginger is bitten by a lycanthrope. While ""Ginger Snaps"" is baldly obvious in its subtext (lycanthropy as a metaphor for puberty), writer Karen Walton cleverly uses it to reinvigorate a stagnant movie monster while bringing a pathos to the concept of ""the monstrous feminine."" And John Fawcett's direction is like a mix of John Hughes and Lucky McKee, lending an exaggerated look to the halls of a typical American high school, not to mention the surrounding suburban landscape. But what ultimately makes ""Ginger Snaps"" (and its sequels) such rich, satisfying films is the relationship between Brigitte and Ginger--Perkins and Isabelle run the gamut of sisterly emotions, from sarcasm to anger to humor and sorrow with absolute conviction, making them two of the most endearing characters in recent genre memory.",Ginger Snaps
43,Samiam3,"Good of Ginger to snap, because it's entertaining",8,17 July 2009,"Although there are times when Ginger Snaps almost directly resembles some of its cult-praised preceding horrors such as The Fly, The Lost Boys, and The Howling, the story is grotesquely amusing as a black comedy and surprisingly creepy as a horror, which allows Ginger Snaps to pass for good camp which is all it intends to be.We begin the story with two strange sisters, Brigitte and Ginger Fitzgerald. One night while trying to pull a dirty prank on a school mate, they encounter a werewolf. Ginger is bitten and she barely gets away with her life. From the moment she and Brigitte get home, Ginger begins her slow transition to werewolf. Strange things start happening to her body which she tries to hide, causing everyone to suspect she is undergoing puberty. Brigitte desperately seeks to find a cure, as her sister is becoming increasingly distant and dangerous.There is never a dull moment in Ginger Snaps. The story is always moving at a good pace, with a good balance of wit and tension between the scenes leading up to the climax. Ginger Snaps is also smart enough to avoid letting out too much energy in the ending, thus maintaining its stability and scariness. If you are really engaged in the movie, then you'll notice that it is well shot. The climax in particular is photographed in a very claustrophobic way, with high contrast lighting and strange angles.I would strongly recommend Ginger Snaps, to horror fans, it has a little of all the goods; black humor, monsters and make-up, suspense and for the extreme fans, gore (but not too much). I am tempted to try the sequel.",Ginger Snaps
44,lastliberal-853-253708,"A girl can only be a slut, a bitch, a tease, or the virgin next door.",8,14 October 2013,"Let's get the technical stuff out of the way first. The sound, the cinematography, the lighting, the editing, the music: all first rate. This was a film that really made good use of it's budget. It is a horror film, but it certainly is not the best in werewolf films.There is blood, of course there is blood, but there is no carnage. Anyone looking for ripping flesh needs to look elsewhere. There is sex, as Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) is experiencing the onset of puberty and, combined with the attack by a werewolf that is changing her, is in intense need of sex. No nudity, however - hey she is supposed to be 16, you pervert! Ginger's sister Brigette (Emily Perkins) is outstanding as she tries to save her sister. Mimi Rogers is excellent as their mother and really added to the humor of this film. It's a must-see for werewolf fans.",Ginger Snaps
45,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Ginger Snaps""- Refreshing, subversive and wickedly entertaining. One of the best werewolf flicks ever made.",10,25 October 2016,"An immense success by any stretch of the imagination, the phenomenal ""Ginger Snaps"" is a winning combination of horror and humor, filled to burst with satire, subversion and plenty of thrills and chills. Even sixteen years after its initial release, it remains a wickedly entertaining and refreshing take on the werewolf legend, courtesy strong visual direction, a witty script and some absolutely wonderful performances. It's a cult masterpiece, and deserves far more attention and admiration than it currently claims. I do firmly believe that it is not only easily amongst the best werewolf films ever made... it is perhaps even among the best horror films ever made.In the Canadian suburbs of Bailey Downs, the Fitzgerald sisters lead a depressive life. Death obsessed Goths who get their kicks creating mocked ""murders"" for school projects, Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) and Brigitte (Emily Perkins) are social misfits who just can't fit in, and have created a suicide pact to murder themselves by age 16 should they still be stuck in their droll, painfully boring life. With a wild animal on the loose that is terrorizing the neighborhood and killing family pets at an alarming rate, the sisters decide to play a prank on their school's resident mean-girl Trina (Danielle Hampton), by making it appear her beloved dog is the latest victim. However, on this fateful night, Ginger also happens to get her first period, and it soon draws the attention of the real beast, which bites and mauls her.Narrowly escaping, the sisters soon realize that the bites are healing at an unnatural rate. Over the following weeks, as Ginger begins her journey into womanhood, Brigitte begins to notice disturbing changes in her sister... changes that might not be from puberty and maturation... but might be the effects of the creature's bite! He sister might be becoming a werewolf! And so, Brigitte must team up with drug-dealer Sam (Kris Lemche), in order to try and use his chemical expertise to find a cure to Ginger's terrible ongoing transformation!Director John Fawcett guides this tale with a sense of visual bravado, expertly crafting a hard-hitting and consistently hilarious mood and tone through keen storytelling. His smooth, flowing camera-work and quirky use of strange angles and occasional ambitious movement has a very nice feeling to it, hearkening back to the good-old days of horror before modern trends of shaky, gritty stylings began to take over. It's very tactful, slow-building and deliberate, which is quite a pleasant surprise for a film that's relatively contemporary.The script is co-written by frequent ""Queer as Folk"" and ""Orphan Black"" scribe Karen Walton, who is just a joy. Her quirky dialog and wonderful use of metaphor and subversive humor helps elevate the idea to fantastic new levels. At its heart, it's a story about what it means to become an adult- more specifically, to become a woman. And with its clever use of becoming a monster as a metaphor for puberty, Walton crafts an incredibly wild and entertaining tale that all should be able to relate and identify with. She also injects plenty of pitch-black humor that really helps give the film a unique identity and makes sure to pull the rug out from under you just enough times to keep you on the edge of your seat.The performances are also a vital key- the cast is lovely. Isabelle makes for a wild and unhinged character. She's just a ton of fun, and you get a whole range of emotion from what she does with the Ginger character. You will both laugh and cry thanks to her throughout the entire runtime. Emily Perkins knocks it out of the part as our protagonist Brigitte. Perkins has always been likable and notable in the horror community, thanks to her child-actor roots in films like Stephen King's ""It."" And here, she really stretches her wings, with an incredible role that's just dripping with everything an actor could want. She commands the role of Brigitte with grace and style. Lemche and Hampton, along with others such as Jesse Moss round out the supporting characters perfectly. In particular the highly likable Lemche, who does a great job with his quirky character. But I gotta give the most props to Mimi Rogers in the wonderfully insane supporting role as the mother of our leads. Rogers is just so much fun, portraying the sort-of perfect ""supermom"" who begins to show cracks beneath the surface when her idyllic existence is questioned. Perfect role.Add to that a top-notch production, and you have the formula for a classic! Cinematographer Thom Best does an amazing job with the lighting and composition, delivering grand imagery to compliment the story. Editor Brett Sullivan (who went on to direct the sequel ""Ginger Snaps: Unleashed"") does a fine job with the pacing and piecing together of sequences. And composer Mike Shields delivers the goods with his moody and mournful score. The central theme of the film still stands as just a gorgeous and melancholy composition- one of the finest horror themes in years.It truly is a shame that the film is not a household name, and has been relegated to the status of ""cult film."" It's a complex, genre- bending masterpiece that delivers non-stop laughs and screams, and it should be highly recognized for this. But it was a sad victim of poor timing, losing much of its audience due to events like the Columbine Massacre and other world tragedies that pushed audiences away from its tale of teens in peril. Here's to hoping that as the years go on, its small but dedicated audience continues to grow and grow. Because this film deserves all the fans it can get!""Ginger Snaps"" is a perfect 10. It's one of the finest werewolf films ever made. One of the finest horror-comedies ever made. And perhaps even one of the finest horror movies ever made, period.",Ginger Snaps
46,mjw2305,A different kind of teen horror,7,7 January 2007,"Ginger Snaps is both a teen horror and a werewolf movie, without any hallmarks from either. Both of the above suggest a fairly cheesy script and fairly light hearted approach to the horror within; but with this film we see a more serious approach with some seriously outstanding performances from both lead characters, thanks to Emily Perkins and Katherine Isabelle.Plagued by adolescent woes, school and their parents; Ginger and Brigitte have become somewhat cut off from the real world and have retreated into a kind of self created existence where other people don't interfere and they can be how they want to be. When Ginger is attacked by a beast in the woods, all that changes; and Brigitte has to make a decision.Ginger snaps is slick and stylish in it's delivery and it makes a refreshing change to see the subject matter of this film tackled with a little more maturity and realism.7/10",Ginger Snaps

One night Ginger is bitten by a werewolf, and she gets that invitation into horror she's been looking for... but the sisters soon learn that it isn't like a bad romance novel, being a werewolf is beyond terrifying! The acting was overall pretty good, as was the soundtrack. The plot reminded me somewhat of Donnie Darko or Harold & Maude. As in a lot of movies, an overlooked but highly unstable kid finally snaps... that's Ginger.Overall it was a good movie, worth watching and although in the horror genre still really comedic. The only thing I didn't like was the stereotypical view on kids like the sisters, that just because they are into horror and death they are emos and necrophiliacs who are insane and will never grow out of it.

Her sister helped her with the dealer guy. They injected the plant to the guy Ginger had sex with and it worked. But it was a bit too late for Ginger as she's a full blown werewolf then. She killed one of her teacher and the janitor and the bully girl from the cricket team and the sisters buried them in the shed in their garden. The mother found the dead body and wanted to burn the house down to start over. It was Halloween and people thought ginger was in a costume. Brigitte and the dealer guy took her home from the party at the greenhouse of the dealer. Ginger ate him down in the basement and Brigitte had to stab her to death and couldn't inject the liquid in the syringe. And she mourned and hugged the dead body of her werewolf sister.

It should be required viewing for every male so they can form a sense of empathy for their female friends and family.Brigitte (Emily Perkins) and Ginger Fitzgerald (Katharine Isabelle) are sisters and the best of friends.

Can Brigitte save Ginger from her insatiable bloodlust before she fully turns into a voracious creature of the night?The version of ""Ginger Snaps"" I'm reviewing is Unrated. There's a lot of graphic violence and gore in this fine example of a Lycanthropy-centered film. I would consider it to be ""R"" rated because of strong language, adult situations, and scenes of female werewolf nudity. Ginger's hairy upper torso makes a cameo appearance during the movie's exciting and emotional conclusion.Rarely does a horror movie come along that infuses such immense chills and thrills while so beautifully capturing the pain and awkwardness we all feel journeying from childhood to adulthood.

There is so much teen angst and drama to keep you entertained and it's truly frightening and freaky.

55,ThurstonHunger,doesn't quite escape its horror film fate,4,31 December 2003,"I had heard enough of a cult film buzz about this, that I thought to check it out, even though I am decidedly not a horror film afficianado. Indeed I've never really been into horror that much, and am pretty much done with it these days.If you are in the same boat, I'd regrettably say skip this.Regrettably, as the film starts out with much promise. The alienated sisters move in their own high school ghost world, Plot details are revealed in a non-forced manner; as an example we see the girls in the same classes, and later in passing find out that ""Be"" jumped up a level.Their closeness, and their morbidity are well-entwined. Believable enough for a horror film... Some here criticize the dialog of the parents, but as we are supposed to see this from the eyes of the girls...this too works well. Indeed the dinner scenes are more easily devoured than some of the flesh in this film.Obviously with the tag line of the film, we are supposed to connect a more natural curse with a supernatural one. And that was done quite well, but slightly halfway through the film this felt more and more like a generic sort of horror film. Indeed how radical can a film be that has a sequel and a prequel already in the works.Now that's gruesome.I guess I just enjoyed Karen Walton's dialogue...and and as the body of this movie metamorphosed into more howls and gasps, I found myself wanting it to hurry up and mercifully die.Katharine Isabelle I thought was quite good in this, and not just from a reanimated-Shannon-Doherty angle either.
** SPOILER COMING **
This film did play with horror expectations. Isn't it a rule that dogs are the chosen lifeforms...this starts with a slaughtered pup. Later in the film, I was certain we were being set up for Mom's confession that she truly was to blame, and in fact has passed the werewolf gene along to her darling darklings.I know that's saying something that DIDN'T happen, but that still is a spoiler...just like folks who say, ""film X has a really great twist,"" should not be allowed to talk about films. And they should eat at the little table.Also I'm not sure why Be didn't try the magical bullet/syringe stab at a happy ending. I suppose she was saving it for herself, but then it seemed she had enough time to hit the beast and then cook up some for herself and the Good Fairy Drug Dealer of the West as well??Alas...for me, this slipped down to a 4/10And it will likely slow me down from checking out  ""The Ring"" (or its Japanese predecessor) and old Lucio Fulci films.",Ginger Snaps

57,jlthornb51,Magnificent Acting,8,23 April 2015,"Kathrine Isabelle and Emily Perkins give what is nothing less the performances of their very lives in this terrific film. Under the direction of John Fawcett they are absolutely electric in their respective roles as sisters. Screen writer Karen Walton creates characters here that the two leads can realistically bring to life and embody. It is not your typical horror script with girls in jeopardy and behaving helplessly. These young women are relatively strong and proactive in facing their ungodly peril. Perkins and Isabelle are simply unforgettable and hopefully this film serves as a vehicle which will get them noticed for future projects. Kudos to all involved with this production but especially to those responsible for the screenplay, the gifted director, and the two magnificent young women leading a fine supporting cast.",Ginger Snaps
58,raypdaley182,Beyond Bizarre!,8,27 March 2006,"So weird it's excellent! This starts out as the dark tale of 2 sisters obsessed with death and dying young. They are the weirdo's, the outcasts. So right off the bat you can tell who this film is meant to appeal to. Made by Lions Gate Films (The same people who bought you Saw) this is a very dark but quite well observed and at times very funny film. Two teenage girls struggle through school and life in general. At first they seem to live alone in a very weird neighborhood where dogs keep getting killed.We see the girls at school where they are shown to be general outcasts, Goths, freaks, unpopular. They are 15 and 16 but neither have started their periods, a fact that will prove to be very important later in the film. This film looks like a cross between American Werewolf In London and Carrie.The actual werewolf itself looked like the creature from Dog Soldiers. Ginger is attacked by an unknown creature but after not bleeding much, then starting her period it's suddenly obvious that the creature was a werewolf but the legends aren't all true.The silver thing seems to calm Ginger down for a short time but the werewolf that bit and infected her was easily killed when hit by a speeding van.This film follows Ginger as she enters womanhood, dating boys (infecting one by having unprotected sex with him) and trying drugs and parties. As she becomes more infected the downward spiral seems to be inevitable that she will become the wolf and go on a killing spree.Luckily for Ginger her major facial transformation happens on Halloween so she isn't noticed. Ginger's mum keeps her daughters from danger and her sister does discover a cure. She cures the boy Ginger had infected.There is no real ending as Ginger/wolf is killed by her sister and we know the sister is infected and has the cure in her hand but we never see her take it.If you like weird films, films about unusual people or horror in general this is well worth a look.",Ginger Snaps
59,Nightman85,"Not your typical teen horror, and that's a good thing!",9,11 May 2006,"Intelligent and gruesome black comedy isn't your ordinary werewolf flick, which may be why it's the best werewolf movie we've seen in quite some time.Misfit teen struggles to save her sister, who was bitten by a monstrous wolf and now is having some alarming side-effects.What sets Ginger Snaps a part from your average teen horror flick is the outstanding characterizations that Walton and Fawcett's well-scripted story produces. For once the most off-beat and bizarre characters are actually the heroes of the story and turn out to be deeper than one would imagine. There's a good set-up and plenty of tension and bloodcurdling action to pay off, especially in the harrowing climax. The direction of John Fawcett is well handled, providing an unsettling atmosphere in a seemingly normal neighborhood. The creature FX are nicely done and the blood is plentiful.The cast of this film is a strong highlight. Emily Perkins and Katherine Isabelle are excellent and oddly heart-felt as our two misunderstood goth sisters. Kris Lemche does a cool performance as a teen stoner who must help Perkins save her sister. Mimi Rogers even does a surprising turn as the girls quirky mother.It's not every day that one finds a teen horror film with some heart and depth. This film wisely has both and comes off a terrific genre entry because of it. Also, there's plenty of bloody scenes that will satisfy most any gore fan. Recommended.Followed by a sequel and a prequel*** 1/2 out of ****",Ginger Snaps
60,departed07,I really enjoyed this film a lot,9,20 April 2004,"I saw this film on HBO zone yesterday night, and it's very original. Compared to many horror movies, Ginger Snaps takes its time developing until the final conclusion. Just like most horror cliched movies, this one takes place before Halloween. Emily Perkins who starred in Stephan King's It in 1990 grew up, i didn't even recognize her. She plays Bridget who her and her older sister, Ginger are attacked by a creature, but one of them starts to deform slowly into a wolf. It is up to Bridget to help Ginger before she kills and turns into a wolf.
They ought to show more movies like these in the theaters instead of Bad Boys II, Gigli, Freddy Vs. Jason and the rest of the stupid movies from Hollywood. And this film is from Canada, I am impressed.",Ginger Snaps

Compares a girl's becoming a woman to becoming a werewolf. I've heard of hormonal mood swings, didn't realize it was THAT bad. I'm a man so I'll have to take these ladies' words for it
The blonde cheerleaders are here, in spirit at least, as the goth girl's opposing field hockey team, the horny obnoxious group'a guys, the sensitive helpful guy, the strict guidance counselor, clueless parents, even a Chinese janitor! Throw a werewolf into the mix and voila, you've got yet another variation on a mean girls movie.
Teens will identify, adults will identify it as something they've already seen too many times before.
The cliche' Hot Girl-named Ginger (Katherine Isabelle) IS hot, incredibly beautiful as so many are at 19, not so much as a.werewolf.. Plain Jane sister Brigitte (Emily Perkins) is supportive of Gingy, werewolf or no, right to the end, and she's the glue that capably holds this plot together. Kris Lemche is amiable enough as Sam, the standard Sensitive Guy. Mimi Rogers is reduced to playing a stereotypical ninny mom..
Effects deteriorate throughout till the final climax, I don't know if it's all the cgi I've seen in the meantime or just cheap Canadian cinema, but was that
""threatening"" plastic wolf snout scary, even 20 years ago?
for a better treatment of the perennial mean girls ethos, see ""Heathers""

62,ebeckstr-1,Entertaining combination of Carrie and American Werewolf,6,16 July 2021,"Okay, the claim that this film is like a combination of Carrie and an American Werewolf in London might be a bit too on the nose ) or on the snout, as it were) more or less accurate. There are some pretty darkly humorous overtones similar to American Werewolf, and themes that are very similar to Carrie, which was a clear influence on this movie. It's a fun ride through a nightime carnival of blood, both menstrual and murderous, with decent acting and a better than average script for a low budget horror flick. Probably a must see for fans of werewolf movies.",Ginger Snaps
63,Flagrant-Baronessa,Very daring and very sexy,8,28 June 2006,"This low-budget Canadian horror flick is edgy and a lot of fun. It is also much sexier than any vampire film I can think of and it takes Gothic culture to a whole new level of daring. At least I think the two sisters are supposed to be Gothic, because they dress and act accordingly and have a morbid fascination with blood and gore, as well as their own death.One of the sisters, the ""hot"" oneGingergets bitten by a werewolf one night, right as she enters womanhood in the form of getting her first period. It deals with the coming of age simultaneously as it deals with turning into a lycanthrope and the film shows that these two transformations are not altogether different. Ginger starts bleeding, gets hairy legs, suffers pains, gets horny and grows a tail. I get squeamish just thinking about all the nasty blood and themes in this movie, but it's not that scary. It's mostly fun to watch on a freaky level.It also blends this together with typical high school culture and troubles of acceptance in social life. And drugs. And sex. So it basically has a little bit of everything and the result is great. There have been at least two sequels (or prequels, whatever) to this indie horror flick and that is really quite cool and an indication that this is a good film. I highly recommend it.",Ginger Snaps
64,PyrolyticCarbon,A good horror with some misplaced laughs to be had.,6,22 January 2003,"A simple, almost standard werewolf plotline, although this one concentrates more on the change and the effects within a dysfunctional family, and in particular, the two sisters approaching puberty. It's stylish, with a superb opening sequence that pretty much sets the tone for the entire movie. It has a good script, with a real Heathers type feel to it, just more gore! The effects are well done and don't detract from the story at all, in fact some of the werewolf changes are done brilliantly well. The performances are good and combined with the script give a realistic feel to school and family life, if a somewhat askew view. Added to that, there isn't a reek of Hollywood in the latter part of the film. A good horror with some misplaced laughs to be had.",Ginger Snaps

B and Ginger are deranged little lunatics and should have locked up years ago because of their sick obsession with death. Also, Ginger's mother wasn't very supportive. The whole film has an unlikable Gothic feeling and I don't like it. Here's a fact of life about Werewolves, they are normal until the night of the full moon. Werewolves don't change over the course of the days leading to the full moon, I mean if that was true then there would be hard evidence proving the existence of werewolves by now. Now let's see what the movie did right, which wasn't much. The cast does a great job with the badly written material they were given and the creature effects are okay for nearly naked werewolves. But I will have to give it the THANKSGIVING TURKEY.",Ginger Snaps
66,jmbwithcats,"Decent, but no masterpiece",7,23 August 2004,"I went into this film expecting a B-movie about social outcasts, putting themselves in unoriginal and macabre situations.. but what I got was anything but, and a whole lot more.Made on a meager budget, Ginger Snaps relies on acting to win it's credibility. Although Isabelle is the ""Ginger"" of the title and she is damned good, it is Perkins as Brigitte that earns respect for her effort.The Fitzgerald sisters with their fascination for 'staged horror' find themselves very much on the social fringe. It is not until Ginger is bitten by a werewolf, in what is undoubtedly the most graphic and realistic lycanthropic savaging ever filmed since An American Werewolf in London (1981), that they are forced even further into social isolation. What neither the sisters or the film ever lose sight of however is their sisterly bond, itself consummated by a blood-pact at the age of eight.The heartfelt tragedy of Ginger's condition is poignant and evolving, and that is why this film leaves most other horror films in its wake - it is multi-dimensional with strong characterizations. Mimi Rogers even, in a smallish part as the girls' mother is spot on hitting the exact right note as a frustrated mother and increasingly unfulfilled wife, although her character seems to  entropy quickly into a incohesive mess as the story progresses.The film weaves brilliantly the coming-of-age pains with the physical transformation brought on by the lycanthropic condition. Marvelous imagery of menstrual blood at critical moments.The film does have some massive plot holes, that simply cannot be ignored... from the mother who all of a sudden wants to cover up the whole thing, her character truly made no sense and lacked any sense of cohesion, the father character was about as nonexistent with being there as a writer could muster. ::: Why for one doesn't the sister go back for more antidote earlier on, for herself so she can be able to help her sister more efficiently? The dialog is pretty awful, and it wasn't a really fun movie, which left it wanting.Quotes from the movie:Brigitte: ""Ginger, what's wrong... something is going on, like more then you just being.. .female..""Ginger: ""I get this ache, and I thought it was for sex, but it was to tear everything into pieces.""Definitely a better movie then the recognition it was given, but not a masterpiece either.",Ginger Snaps
67,Coffee_in_the_Clink,Powerful horror film with superb symbolism and sense of time and place,9,23 May 2020,"""Ginger Snaps"" is possibly the last great werewolf film. In the two decades since its understated release the reputation of the genre has all but been decimated by the ""Twilight"" saga and a horde of remakes. I stand to be corrected on this but I don't think the werewolf subgenre has seen anything as original or brilliant since ""Ginger Snaps"". A superb, beautifully-shot horror film with a gorgeous Halloween seasonal vibe about it, the film boasts some strong horror, excellent special effects and a brilliant screenplay full of symbolism and metaphors. But best of all are the performances from the two leads; Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins. In ""Ginger Snaps"", the stalking and attacks by a vicious werewolf in a quiet suburban area is a metaphor for the symbolic changes that puberty and the first period brings for 16 year-old Ginger. Director and writer John Fawcett strikes an excellent concoction in mixing the traditional horror of the old werewolf tale with a modern teenage-soap opera. The girls are truly brilliant here, very well acted and are great characters. Great respect is paid to the genre in this film, with Fawcett showing great appreciation for what has gone before him, and turning out a solid horror film that will subsequently go down as one of the classics in decades to come.",Ginger Snaps

69,Jacques98,"One of the best, semi-original teen dramas ever made.",4,1 November 2008,"There is nothing higher I can say of any movie than that it's memorable. I've seen literally thousands of movies and, honestly, the second after I write a review for them, I usually forget them. They're just a blur then. Asking me to even remember the main character's name as the movie is playing, much less afterward, is just a joke, because characters have no character anymore. In the majority of movies I force myself to sit througha lot of them critically acclaimedI can walk out in the first opening 15 minutes, then come back in the last 15 minutes and know everything that happened when I was gone. (And, no, I don't do that, though I wish I could.) But Ginger Snaps isn't like that at all. It's memorable. While the majority of Hollywood just draws plots out of the pathetic pit of clichés the original monstersvampire, werewolf, ghosthave become, Ginger Snaps doesn't. It's truly the most original werewolf movie ever written.But do not get me wrong: Ginger Snaps is a drama set in a horror universe and that's all it tries to be. I could go on to the point of nausea about how pathetic the drama genre has become, but Ginger Snaps also flies in the face of those clichés as well. Do not let the word ""drama"" scare off all the hardcore horror fans, either. Ginger Snaps has enough bloodthe opening scene must have sent PETA through the roof!and action to hold you until the end. The dramatic bits are some of the best I've ever seen, as well, because none of the characters are clichés and you honestly care for them. Also, I've seen a lot of ""funny"" horror movies that just repeat the same jokes over and over again, but Ginger Snaps had me genuinely laughing quite a few times.On a technical level, the directing in very clever, and it's noticeable. The camera shows/doesn't show certain things that always keeps the audience in a bit of mystery as to what just happened, and it's never once annoying. You hear a certain conversation and you assume it means one thing, then the next scene shows it meant something completely different. I've never seen directing quite like this, and it was very well-done and never predictable. A lot of the movie even has a crimson tint to it, which was downright awesome. Acting is perfect.Now the bad: The length is a little unnecessary, especially around the ending, when it seems the same things keep happening over and over. It it were cut by 20 minutes or so, my score would be a lot higher.The visual effects are horrible. The werewolves look like big plastic figurines, being that their skin and faces don't move. This has nothing to do with the overall awesome effect of the movie, and can be easily ignored, but it's just a big problem I have with calling it a perfect film.In the end, though, Ginger Snaps is nearly perfect, even if my score suggests otherwise. You won't see a better teen drama in your lifetime, and you won't find any film out there like it at all. Ignore the really bad pun, but it's totally a beast of it's own.4/10",Ginger Snaps
70,Cedric_Catsuits,Quirky alternative teen monster movie,9,13 April 2010,"A welcome change from the usual generic American offerings, this Canadian take on moody teens and the horrors of growing up has a laid-back, low-budget feel to it. The monster looks a bit plastic-y but the film is really about the sisters, and both roles are admirably filled by two capable but very different young starlets.Perkins is compelling as the awkward, introverted class nerd, and Isabelle magnificent as the slightly scary, sexy, ex-nerd who turns into a real man-eater. Together they share a fascination for bloody re-enactments of death, and their scenes together are outstanding - if you're not too squeamish.It's not really a scary horror, although it has it's moments. The performances from the entire cast are spot-on, and this makes it a very watchable film. Isabelle sizzles and Perkins fascinates, providing the icing on a tasty if unremarkable movie.",Ginger Snaps

Soon, she starts to turn into one herself and the gruesome fun begins! Katharine isabelle (the girl that played ginger) is really beautiful, i love her so much. I really like that whole gothic/dark mood in this movie. Very nice. The only bad thing in this movie was how they made the werewolf, it looked fake and cheesy.

They enjoy simulating death scenes, which doesn't seem to bother their doting mother Mimi Rogers or carefree father. One night, Ginger gets bitten by a wild beast, and begins to change into a sexually charged vixen. Her new lease on life separates her from her less than appealing sister Brigitte, well played by It's Emily Perkins. So Brigitte seeks the help of a pot dealer, Kris Lemche, who just so happens to know a lot about werewolves, how convenient for her.The effects are handled well, especially the death scenes that Ginger and Brigitte perform. I thoroughly enjoyed the one with the picket fence impaling Katharine Isabelle, well done.I recommend this film for the younger crowd, but Ginger Snpas Back will appeal to a broader audience with it's setting and less emphasis on the trials of puberty.",Ginger Snaps
73,RockPortReview,A Teen Wolf Movie that is GOOD!,9,8 June 2010,"This independent cult horror hit from Canada was released in 2000 and is one of those movies that comes along that has no big stars, no budget and yet is a completely satisfying experience. To date it has also spawned two sequels that were filmed back to back in 2004. ""Ginger Snaps: Unleashed"" and ""Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning."" This is the story of two teenage sisters named Ginger and Brigitte Fitzgerald, played by Katherine Isabelle and Emily Perkins. They are your average rebellious suburban teens. They are obsessed with death and stage phony crime scene photos for a class project. They are counter culture outsiders that have made a suicide pact with one another, ""Out by 16 or death by then."" Screen veteran Mimi Rogers nails the part of Pamela, the girls' neurotic and clueless mother. There is a father somewhere in the mix but is really a non factor.This movie is a suspenseful horror movie, a strong metaphor for female puberty and a great character study of the relationship of the two sisters. While out for a walk in the park one night Ginger is attacked and dragged away by a werewolf on the very day of her first period. Brigitte finds her and they return home. Ginger starts to heal from her wounds almost immediately, and transformation has begun. She becomes ""sexified"" and trolls the halls of her high school looking for her next victim. This movie also warns about the dangers of unprotected sex, when one of the high school guys does the deed with the ""new"" Ginger and starts to change himself. Ginger starts to grow hair in strange places and also begins to sprout a tail.Brigitte searches for a cure and becomes friends with the local high school drug dealer. They find that a certain plant called ""Monk's Hood"" could possibly cure what plagues Ginger and the others. Because the filmmakers were working on such a small budget, they did not use any CG effects when Ginger finally transformers into a werewolf and it totally works. Just like in ""An American Werewolf in London"" all of the werewolf effects were created through practical effects and sheer inventiveness. I was truly surprised at how good this movie was, the two main characters were dead on perfect, there was lot or real suspense and it was just a fun time watching it. I thought the first sequel was pretty decent with the latest one being pretty unwatchable. Ginger Snaps has a special place in my vast DVD collection.",Ginger Snaps
74,GirishGowda,Good Storytelling at its Finest,9,8 August 2013,"In a suburban neighbourhood, there seems to be attacks which are prevalent on canines by some kind of an animal which leaves bloody flesh all over the place. Two death obsessed sisters, Brigitte and Ginger encounter this animal. After they escape from it, Ginger notices hair growing all over her body and a tail as well. Brigitte is convinced its because of the bite of the animal which she deduces as being a werewolf.This is how horror is done right! The movie has almost next to no budget and therefore, the entire burden of carrying the movie falls on the shoulders of its young and very able leads. The acting is simply brilliant. The portrayal of the bond between the sisters rang true. Even though titular character, Ginger, is supposed to be the main draw for the film, its her younger sister, Brigitte who steals the show and makes you feel. These two girls are bored with life and obsessed with death. They aren't your regular movie teen girls. The movie uses lycanthropy as a metaphor for female menstrual cycle and puberty. Its brave, avoids many clichés and the ending is pretty terrifying. The dark humor made me very uneasy at times.There are many other characters like the mom, the weed guy, the janitor and the teacher who add a certain level of quirkiness and credibility to the movie. The moment the opening scene played, with the bloody parts of a dog all over the place, I suddenly remembered that this movie had terrified me as a kid and I still hadn't watched the whole thing. As I was watching the movie now, I thought this couldn't be scary as attacks on dogs seemed quite lame. But, as the story progressed and the characters were developed, it had a huge impact. By the end, I was terrified for Brigitte. I'm so glad I stumbled across this again. This is good storytelling at its finest.9/10",Ginger Snaps

77,LanceBrave,The Sisters May Never Be the Same Again,8,22 March 2014,"The early 2000s brought a renewed interest in the horror genre, mostly because of films made outside of America. Mixed in with a bunch of Japanese ghost stories and the gory European films was ""Ginger Snaps,"" a quirky Canadian werewolf story as much about the relationship between two sisters as it is about horrible transformations into a half-human, half-wolf being.Brigitte and Ginger are two teenage sister living in an idealic Canadian suburb. The sisters are both social outcast and extremely close to one another, promising to die together. To solidify their gothy interest, the girls' favorite hobby is to create gory death scenes for one another. Older sister Ginger receives more interest from the opposite sex then awkward, mousy Brigitte. Ginger's differences are further actualized when she's the first of the two girls to get her period. While out planning revenge against one of their school bullies, Ginger is attacked by the same werewolf that has been eating the neighborhood's dogs. Ginger's personality begins to change. She dresses more sexy and seduces a local boy. Also, she sprouts a tail, grows some fur, and begins to uncontrollably crave the flesh of living beings. Brigitte is forced to form an alliance with a teenage drug dealer in hopes of saving her sister.""Ginger Snaps"" is probably best known for the way it uses the werewolf as a metaphor for puberty. This is not an uncommon connection, see also ""Teen Wolf,"" but ""Ginger Snaps"" is special for contrasting the were-beast transformation with a young woman's puberty. Ginger's first period is explicitly what attracts the werewolf to her. However, the changes she's going through aren't limited to physical ones. The way Ginger acts out forces a wedge between the sisters. The sex and the boys make Brigitte uncomfortable but it's really the sisters fighting for the first time that upsets her. Close siblings frequently drift apart during puberty. ""Ginger Snaps"" maximizes the drama of such a situation with its horror devices.The film would make Katherine Isabelle and Emily Perkins stars in the horror fandom and it's no surprise why. Both are electrifying. Isabelle should have inherited Winona Ryder and Christina Ricci's mantle as the snarky young actress of her generation. Isabelle certainly has no problem playing the character's changes. A great moment is when she expresses her disappointment with the realities of teenage sex. Perkins is, perhaps, the more relatable of the two girls. Her Brigitte is neurotic and nervous. The situation at hand certainly tests her nerves. Perkins eventually develops into the film's heart, holding the audience's attention and emotions during the wild events to follow. As notable is Mimi Rogers as the girls' clueless, doddering mother. Most of the film's humor comes from Rogers' adorably feckless performance. Even she gets a strong moment of her on, during a surprisingly honest, private conversation with Brigitte.Following fellow Canadian David Cronenberg's footsteps, director John Fawcett and screenwriter Karen Walton aren't interest in your typical werewolf transformation. Ginger doesn't change under the full moon. Instead, she slowly morphs over the course of the film. The movie plays these changes for full-on body horror. It starts with a series of small hairs before Ginger gains an arching spine and a tail. The reveal of the tail is darkly humorous but, when Ginger tries to remove it, the film gets some honest squirms. The werewolf transformation seems permanent as well, the threat being that the sisters may never be the same again. ""Ginger Snaps"" isn't an overly gory picture but, when the red stuff comes, its thick and dark, victims painfully torn apart. This isn't a light-weight splatter flick, its mind on more weighty issues.In the last act, Ginger stops fighting her werewolf instincts and gives into her urge to kill. During these moments, ""Ginger Snaps"" becomes a more typical horror film, Ginger gorily dispatching random victims. Even then, the film has the strong relationship between the two girls to fall back on. At the very end, Ginger's transformation is complete, taking Katherine Isabelle out of the film. It's not that the film can't generate any suspense during these final moments. It actually does all right, the audience feeling for the threatened Perkins. However, removing the chemistry between the girls in favor of more general werewolf action is problematic. The film finds that emotional core again in its final moments even if Isabelle never returns to the film.""Ginger Snaps"" remains a cult classic, enough so that it spawned two (somewhat underwhelming) sequels. Katherine Isabelle and Emily Perkins' careers never took off like they should have but both have certainly remain prominent in the genre. It's not perfect but the film is indeed a fascinating picture, beautifully realized at times, smartly written, and anchored by two stand-out performances.",Ginger Snaps
78,Horrorible_Horror_Films,Very good,8,5 October 2006,"This is exactly how to make a good movie with a limited budget. In fact, if this was big budget it absolutely would not have been good at all, would have had name actors that suck. And in the horror genre, this film is an extreme rairty - not a huge budget, yet it was well made, interesting etc.The monster - a werewolf in this case - was actually well done, and used well and wasn't stupid like in so many new low budget horror movies. Acting was good, and they used actors who were actually high school age and not some 30 year olds trying to pretend they are younger. The writing was good too, this movie was like a good horror novella.I found the opening credits really inventive, I loved the way they tied it right in to the start of the movie, and the score was really well done, especially the piece composed for the opening and closing of the film.The only thing I really hated was the wig the younger sister was wearing. What the hell was with that? Who made the decision for the wig?

No cheese, no clichés, no monotony.I have seen a few werewolf movie, but this one is, by far, the best in the genre. Excellent performance by the lead actresses, and a strong storyline.I quite enjoyed the scenes where B interacts with the weed dude. There's something strangely appealing about the whole thing.The things I did NOT like: Some really bad acting from the girls' parents. The Mother was particularly obnoxious, though the Dad wasn't much better. Very lame and unrealistic.Tina was supposed to be the queen bee, yet she is in the same league as Bridgette in terms of looks, and a lame actress to boot. Totally wrong for the role. Her character was not developed well enough in order for the viewer to get genuine satisfaction from her demise.The second part of the movie is kind of weak compared to the first. It starts to drag a bit and, eventually, loses its appeal and becomes a bit boring. I though they could've come up with something... different... for the ending. It was not particularly effective, and, to me, slightly disappointing.Anyways, it's a matter of taste, I guess, but I'd say that there's a strong chance anyone interested in this genre will enjoy this movie. I'd definitely watch it again.P.S. And the sequel isn't bad, either.",Ginger Snaps
80,senortuffy,Wickedly funny horror film,9,23 July 2006,"""Ginger Snaps"" is a very clever film that combines humor with horror. There is a story line involving two sisters who encounter a werewolf near their suburban home one night, and how they deal with the changes one of them undergoes after being bit, but in the midst of some very tense scenes, someone says something that makes you burst out laughing.Ginger and her younger sister, Bridgett, played by Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins, are disenchanted with suburban life and fantasize endlessly about running away or killing themselves. Their mother, played by Mimi Rogers, is a ditz who still imagines herself as just one of the girls. The father is silent and hardly there at all.The film is about teen alienation, told through a conventional horror story line - girl gets bit by werewolf, begins turning into one, sister tries to help her out. The really good part is the humor. There is a sly social commentary running throughout the film, much in the way ""The Lost Boys"" was constructed. Teen angst, social alienation in the suburbs, high school madness - they are all themes that are dealt with in this film.Emily Perkins is especially good as Bridgett - her portrayal of a goth teenager is classic. The rest of the cast is good also, but the real star of this film is the writer, Karen Walton. Her biography lists her previous experience as singing telegrams and handing out cold cuts in the supermarket, so I can see where the satire comes from.An all-Canadian production, from director to writer to actors, ""Ginger Snaps"" is a terrific film and a must see.",Ginger Snaps
81,kergillian,"Great start, but gets tired.",6,26 May 2002,"The state of Canadian film is slowly but surely improving. Just five years ago we had maybe 4-5 good directors, with nine out of ten films being awful. All you had to do was watch the CBC weekly Canadian film on Friday nights and you'd probably run away screaming in ennui. But now it's good to see many up and coming Canadian film-makers putting out good films like Kissed, Maelstrom, and Une Crabe Dans la Tete, among others.This film had the potential to be a wonderful film, but it fell short. Which is better than many others which never have the potential to begin with. The two main actresses (Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle) are vivacious and act their parts wonderfully. Unfortunately they're the only standout in this film, which is filled with useless roles and stock characters, the worst of which are the Fitzgerald parents. Some of the weakest scenes in the film involve the mother (played by the usually good Mimi Rogers) and father, with horribly written dialogue. In fact I'm not sure why the parents are even there, since they have no relevance to the plot whatsoever, even in terms of character development.The film starts off with a strong setup. The first hour, involving Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) becoming infected as a lycanthrope (or werewolf for the layman) and Bridget trying to find a cure while hiding Ginger's state form everyone. Then the film drowns in generic resolution and cliche, with one or two good suspense moments smothered among an anti-climactic ending. After an hour's buildup we have a dragging hour of letdown.Overall, this is a good film. Fairly low-budget but with decent effects and makeup, the main characters are very well acted, and the potential of the script makes it much more interesting than most of its genre. Anyone who likes this should check out the hilarious 'The Convent', a great US not-quite-b-movie form 2000 which has some of the same elements, but great humour and a better follow-through.Still, I'm glad to see some solid Canadian film-making outside of the usual Cronenberg-Egoyan-Burns-Kellar-McDonald suspects. If not for the letdown I'd probably rate it as high as an eight. If not for the beginning I'd rate it a four or five. As it stands I give it a 6/10.",Ginger Snaps

Good Werewolf movies are hard to come by these days, and while this isn't perfect its definitely good fun.

83,marc5477,More organic making it feel a bit like old school horror,6,11 September 2015,"It was not a ground breaking movie, nor a bad movie by any stretch. A lot of reviews here attempt to overthink the plot and state that its yet another tweeny horror movie, but it wasn't. There is no retarded teenage love story in this movie nor any nudity nor a bunch of topless guys. There are no cheap gimmics in this movie designed to draw teens. It is a straight forward drama about two sisters and how they try to cope with one turning to a werewolf. The quality of the film is definitely limited, this was not a big budget flick but at the same, the low budget and lack of CGI really give it a very natural eerie feel similar to how old horror movies used to be. The only exception is the werewolf itself which looks pretty 80s (in a bad way) but was not really in the movie for very long any way. I always felt like older horror movies were much more convincing due to narrower camera perspectives (smaller resolutions and angles) and use of imagination over CGI and special effects. Todays horror is very bad and has mostly devolved to formulaic snore fests requiring over the top violence and gore (a la Saw or Hostel) or cheap surprise scares which stop working once a person gets older. This was a nice change of pace. I liked it and I give is a 6, or 1 point above average. I will be watching the next two movies soon.",Ginger Snaps

And all though the parts that had caught my attention watching it when younger didnt blow me away this time round, I found myself crying at the ending, which dont think I did when younger. It was sad and moving the end.. both girls still fit their roles great, but I think the film couldve done with something slightly more inbetween.

85,dave-sturm,Twisted sisters,8,22 November 2009,"You got your zombies, you got your vampires ... but werewolves are different. They are almost always depicted as victims of fate. They're infected and cannot control the changes that come over them. We fear them, but also pity them.In the Canadian werewolf movie ""Ginger Snaps,"" it is through the character of 15-year-old Bridgette, played brilliantly by Emily Perkins, that we learn to fear and pity the fate of her older sister Ginger, played by Katherine Isabelle.Ginger's been attacked in the woods and is gradually becoming a werewolf. She's getting patches of fur on unusual places, like her shoulder. She's growing a tail. She has cravings. At first her victims are the neighborhood dogs. But then ...Ginger formerly, like her sister, was a hair-hanging-in-her-face goth shlub with a suicide fixation. Now her usual pout has been replaced by a sinister grin. She's glamorous and sexy, much to the delight of a kind of Greek chorus of boys who stand on the sidelines of the movie and comment idiotically on passing events.Ginger and Bridgette are more than just sisters. They are soulmates who confide totally in each other. They are alienated teens living in a depressing Huckburg in the middle of nowhere and they comfort each other in their misery. Their parents are well-meaning, but clueless. There's a striking scene of the girls going through their morning routine, which includes Bridget strapping Ginger's tail to her thigh so it won't show.Finally, the dialogue. It's all sideways, snarky, off-handed and obscene. Teens haven't riffed this cleverly in a movie since ""Heathers."" And there's a hilarious scene of the sisters in the school nurse's office having the onset of menstruation explained to them with too-much-information cheeriness by by nurse. ""Voluminous flow"" is quite normal, she says helpfully.""Ginger Snaps"" almost flew under my radar. Don't let if fly under yours.",Ginger Snaps
86,ksj870,"Fascinating, if overrated, werewolf study",5,1 May 2013,"Most lists of the best werewolf films of all time are bound to have Ginger Snaps ranked fairly high, and so when I got my hands on the DVD I was eager to experience what I expected to be a modern classic.Naturally, I was in for a big letdown.Ginger Snaps isn't a terrible movie, but it's not what most reviewers lead you to believe, either. Yes, it is a werewolf movie--but only just. Ginger (Katherine Isabelle) spends most of the film gradually becoming more and more wolfen, but the character was pretty far out there to begin with and being bitten by a lycanthrope really just accelerates her transformation from teenager to woman. Eventually Ginger does go wolf, but the climax isn't particularly exciting or even as moving as it should have been. The werewolf effects leave a lot to be desired, and lycanthropes from the 40s and 50s generally look better. And as for internal logic, forget it. The script leaves multiple plot threads dangling, and in particular hangs the girls' mother out to dry after spending a lot of time turning her into a major character.So what does Ginger Snaps get right? Characterization and interraction. The relationship between the two sisters is almost painfully realistic. Lycanthropy aside, their interplay is witty, heartfelt, and true to life. Perkins and Isabelle have a tremendous chemistry, and their evolving relationship as Ginger metamorphosizes is fascinating. In fact, if I hadn't been caught up in the dynamic being played out between the two, I wouldn't have finished watching the movie. In a way, it's a shame the werewolf angle wasn't either more fully developed or simply dropped. As it is, it's more of a gimmick than a real plot point. It would have been great to see Ginger's lycanthropy better realized, but of course some will say this isn't supposed to be a traditional werewolf movie, but rather a character study about two sisters coping with growing up and apart. I buy that--but such a story doesn't need werewolves to make it interesting. At times, the thin werewolf element is more of a distraction to the real story, not an enhancement.Ginger Snaps may be well shot and directed (it certainly is) and both Perkins and Isabelle may deliver bravura performances (they do), but it's not much of a werewolf film. The filmmakers deserve credit for trying something different, but unfortunately they just miss the mark. A little more lycanthropy might have made all the difference.",Ginger Snaps
87,hippiedj,"Exceptional take on the werewolf story, refreshing twist",9,17 December 2001,"With so many big budget yawners getting widespread release, it's a shame that a unique film like this sneaks out on home video without much fanfare. Ginger Snaps may not be easy for some to watch -- it's rather rough, every other word is the ""F"" word, and the obvious hints about sexually transmitted disease and drug use is strong and not presented gently.  This film is fun to watch though, and the performances from Emily Perkins as Brigitte and Katharine Isabelle as Ginger are very powerful.  Mimi Rogers does a wonderful seemingly clueless mom, and her one emotional scene where she blames herself for her daughter's troubles is hard to forget.Brigitte may seem to idolize her older sister Ginger, but you can tell she has more smarts than she appears to show. At one point when Ginger tries to remind Brigitte about their suicide pact and said she'd die for her, Brigitte looks right at her and says, ""No, you said you'd die WITH me 'cause you had nothing better to do,"" and explains ""It's easy for you, you don't care."" Her fondness for re-enacting death scenes and being gloomy all the time seem so frivolous after she finds herself trying to keep her sister from turning into a lycanthrope and infecting or killing others.  Some of the scenes illicit a giggle like the ""hide the tail"" ones, but they are also handled with affection that you feel sorry for their predicament.  Katharine Isabelle handles her role with just enough angst and sexiness without going over the top.  Good to see a ""werewolf"" film where the transformation works like a virus and no one seems to instantly and magically change right away.I'm always eager to see the Canadian films that are made for The Feature Film Project, Telefilm Canada, The Movie Network, etc...the creativity in such productions like Ginger Snaps, Cube, and Blood & Donuts (all of which I see Vincenzo Natali has worked on) is bountiful and the care put into the films is clearly seen.  You gotta love how Emily Perkins looks like the famous image of the little girl from Night Of The Living Dead on the cover! Plus, the special effects are somewhat subtle and decently executed, check out the fast editing in the playground attack scene where Ginger gets dragged about.Great story, great performances, really great score by Michael Shields (still trying to get my hands on the soundtrack), and what a GREAT title! Ginger Snaps.....when you see it, you'll go ""OHHHHH,"" and grin! It's a somewhat brutal tale, but worth the viewing experience and unlike a few reviews here that have said the ending is a disappointment, I must disagree -- it ends rather poignantly and bittersweet.  This is one you'll be telling your friends about!Only one gripe about the DVD:  there are chapter stops, but no chapter selection menu so if you want to go to a certain scene you have to keep pressing the ""skip"" button on your remote. Oh well, a minor complaint for an otherwise exceptional film!",Ginger Snaps
88,Morbius_Fitzgerald,Is this a GOOD werewolf movie?,10,3 August 2012,"Everyone knows that good werewolf movies come too few and far in between. Everyone remembers An American Werewolf In London because it was such a good movie, it had its own sense of humor as well as attempting to scare its audience. Personally I thought AAWIL was a good movie but a 10/10? That is far fetched for my taste(I give it 8 for those who are interested in what I actually thought of it). I decided to watch this because according to most werewolf fans this Dog Soldiers & AAWIL is the best werewolf cinema has to offer. Something I agree with.Being a ""social outcast"" at school, a goth and around the same age now I could immediately relate to the two lead characters, I could easily see myself getting along with these sisters If they existed. They both give off great performances and the character development set up for those two girls is outstanding.The plot is when Ginger and Brigitte are out attempting to kill a girl's dog (after she pushed Brigitte onto the bloody corpse of a dog during a hockey game) Ginger gets her first period and they are attacked by a ""big dog."" Over the next 3 weeks Ginger is leaving Brigitte out, Her mother says its hormones but Brigitte thinks she's becoming a werewolf. With the help of a local Drug Dealer named Sam, Brigitte attempts to cure Ginger before she 'wolf's up'.That plot synopsis might have a few people laughing or thinking ""What the hell?"", I understand this wont be everyone's favorite film but this is a lot better than expected (I was expecting a 6 or even 5.) and a must see for horror fans.",Ginger Snaps

Really,Ginger Snaps is one of my most favorite horror movies of all time,I'm surprised it didnt go into theaters,and if it did make it to the silver screen,it probably would have been rated NC-17.

90,Boggman,"They don't call it ""the curse"" for nothing!!",8,28 September 2005,"""Ginger Snaps"" deserves praise for it's originality & acting alone. This is a solid teenage horror/werewolf movie. It's everything ""Cursed"" tried for and should have been.Loner/Goth sisters Brigitte (Emily Perkins) & Ginger Fitzgerald (Katharine Isabelle) don't have all that much going for them- accept each other. At school, they are mostly revered by the other girls and the more popular crowd. They have a particularly strong bond with each other however- which seems to be more than enough.Although born a year apart from one another, they are in the same grade due to Brigitte skipping one grade ahead. One odd fact of life about the duo is that they have never had a ""period"", something which Ginger is more than happy to keep waiting for.However, when mother nature finally comes a callin'- she does so with a vengeance! On the night of her first period while out walking with Brigitte, Ginger is attacked by a ferocious animal and almost mauled to death. Shortly after, she starts to exhibits all the classic werewolf signs such as a thirst for blood, pointy little teeth, and a nasty scar that seems to be sprouting some seriously ugly hair.As she begins to change, the bond that Ginger feels with Brigitte begins to deteriorate rapidly. Ginger begins to get herself all sexed up and starts being a lot more flirtatious and outgoing, separating herself from Brigitte the whole time.However, Gingers hunger and urge to kill can not be contained, and as the bodies began piling up and Ginger turns to Brigitte for help- Brigitte finds herself in a race with time to save her sister from this curse before anybody else pays the price! ""Ginger Snaps"" has its cheesy and formulaic moments- but overall the film is completely enjoyable. That's largely due to the exceptional acting of it's young stars. Both girls do a fine job in their roles and are completely believable.This reviewer really enjoyed ""Ginger Snaps"", and having read many reviews on the movie prior to watching it; feel that it lived up to its promise and reputation.Without a doubt. a pleasing and solid entry into the werewolf genre of films.Recommended!",Ginger Snaps
91,MovieLuvaMatt,One of the most repulsive movies I've ever seen!,5,18 January 2004,"""Ginger Snaps"" is not an awful movie, but it made me feel genuinely uncomfortable throughout.  I like to think I'm desensitized to all kinds of violence and gore, but every once in a while a film like this comes along and forces me to question how strong of a stomach I really have.  The film is relentlessly gory, to say the least.  All the gore effects are extremely bloody and over-the-top.  So be sure that you're not eating while watching this movie.  The acting is good.  The girl who plays Ginger is very pretty, possessing a certain natural beauty.  Some of the dialogue is cheesy, though.  The nonstop gore distracted me from the overall plot, but that wasn't my only problem.  I just didn't feel too satisfied with the film altogether.  The third act really drags and nearly put me to sleep.  I was wondering why the movie got so much acclaim, being it went straight to video--at least here in the states.  If I'm wrong, it surely wasn't in wide distribution.  It isn't complete trash, but it isn't anything special either.  As several people pointed out, it's not for all tastes, so I understand if other people's opinions differ.    My score:  5 (out of 10)",Ginger Snaps

In the beginning of the movie I found them a little annoying and to self-conscious, but they grew on me as the plot got going and at the end I found them utterly believable (if you can imagine such a thing in a werewolf picture!). The script manages to handle the tenderness between the two sisters and the bewilderment of puberty. Ginger gets ""the curse"" in more ways than one and some interesting points are made from this premise also. There is also quite a lot of humour brewed into the stew along with some sharp satire.

The fact that it came from Canada is even more refreshing. Do horror movies have to be made outside the US to be intelligent? Look at the current trend of remaking all the Japanese and Korean horror movies. Look at Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" from the UK. Look also at the immensely talented Guillermo Del Toro and the fact that his best movies (Cronos and Devil's Backbone) are both essentially foreign films. Maybe there's a trend there. Maybe Americans don't know how to make original horror movies anymore. I certainly hope not. But regardless, this is a worthy contribution to the werewolf genre, and fits nicely with ""American Werewolf in London"" and ""The Howling"" - despite the rather shoddy FX by hackmasters KNB, the story managed to rise above its budgetary constraints.

This so well paced and acted that we finally have the first good werewolf film since the creature left London and Paris. The film suspends our disbelief to make the story almost plausible and there are some frightening scenes along with the gore. The ending is a little weak and our creature is not as well made up as he was when he was in London but this is well worth the watch for fans of the genre.

97,Teknofobe70,Superb teen horror movie ... almost perfect.,9,6 April 2005,"The first thing you need to know before you watch Ginger Snaps is that's a real horror movie. That means genuinely unsettling, disturbing, makes-your-skin-crawl kind of stuff. And you're plunged right into this from the start. The opening scene involves a mother and her young son discovering that the family dog has been torn to pieces, bloody scraps and guts all over the back yard ... which pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the movie.In a way it's not really that gratuitous. The whole movie is a metaphor for adolescence, which in itself is a pretty gruesome thing to have to go through. There are these two morbid sisters, Ginger and Bridgette, who are afraid of growing up so much that they have a suicide pact together. They are obsessed with death, and for art class they take photos of each other in disturbingly realistic fake death poses. Ginger begins going through puberty, has her first period, and whoosh! Cue the werewolf attack.The initial changes she goes through are pretty common -- mood swings, bleeding, pains, hairy legs, growing a tail ... okay, maybe that last one isn't quite so common. Bridgette, along with a drug dealer named Sam who accidentally hit the original werewolf with his van, begin to suspect what's really going on and start thinking of how they can cure the disease of lycanthropy. The idea of werewolves is introduced early on, and the characters accept it pretty quickly after the things they see which means we can just get on with the story.Karen Walton has written a fantastic script here, and John Fawcett proves himself a competent director. All of the leads are excellent in their roles, with the two lead actresses Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle expertly playing the disturbed Fitzgerald sisters with fantastic chemistry. Kris Lemche is also notable as the drug dealer, giving a performance reminiscent of Christian Slater's shining moment in ""Heathers"". In fact, the two movies are similar in tone in a number of ways, and both have become cult classics with very similar audiences. The special effects team, headed by Paul Jones who worked on such projects as ""Dracula 2000"" and ""Wolf Girl"", have also done a pretty good job, creating some great-looking physical effects, with blood and guts piling up in every passing minute. The design of the wolf itself is interesting and original, giving us something that we really haven't seen before.And so, though not for the faint of heart, this dark and wonderful piece of work ranks as probably the smartest, most subtle and intelligent werewolf movie ever made.",Ginger Snaps

I believe if it were released in today's theaters it would be a smash hit, especially compared to what it did twenty years ago in its release in Canada. There's enough relevance to modern issues with high school youth (esp. young women) they could easily identify with this film. And that's TOTALLY despite the horror aspects of this excellent motion picture. Some of the best things I can say about this movie is that it's DARK. Not just dark horror (which really carries it) but there's dark comedy plus just the dark way Ginger (Katherine Isabelle) and Brigette (Emily Perkins), to a lesser degree, look at the entire world. The one thing they do have and count on is each other. It is made obvious from the start that their sisterhood bond is granite solid and that they would do anything for one another. Now I won't give away much of the story but how they deal with lycanthropy is one of the best plot lines I've seen done on the silver screen. It's in my top five favorite werewolf movies.

This film has some really spooky and some really creepy scenes, and in between those the writer managed to stuff some pretty cool jokes and funny moments.

First of all the two girls playing Ginger and Bridgette are extremely annoying. Thirty minutes in, I was ready to turn it off. This has got to me Mimi Rogers worse movie ever. She is just lifeless and wooden. I had to do a double take several times to confirm this was really Mimi Rogers. She looks like hell to begin with and her acting here was obviously thrown out the window. The guy who plays the father is clueless and has almost no speaking parts.The story is about two sisters who are really into Goth and death. They take pictures of themselves in various death scenes, whether it's a pitchfork through their next or a fence through their back, they are setting up the props and snapping the picture. They are two peas in a pod until Ginger is whisked away by a werewolf and bitten the day she has her first period. She starts to treat her sister Bridgette badly and gets turned on by boys in her high school. Soon she's making out with boys and killing students. Bridgette takes it into her own hands to try to reverse the curse with the help of a pot dealing loafer who sells drugs to the students. The story isn't terrible, but the execution is just poor. The special effects of the werewolf is creepy and weird. It doesn't look like any werewolf you would normally see. The ending is completely forgettable. Apparently there are 2 sequels, but this ending doesn't really point you in that direction. The movie isn't really worth seeing unless you must see every werewolf movie out there.

103,great_sphinx_42,"""Out by 16 or dead in this scene, together forever, united against life as we know it.""",7,15 December 2001,"It was funny, because I was standing in the video store looking back and forth between ""Ginger Snaps"" and ""The Grinch"" (they were both in the G section, after all), trying to decide. I tried to go and see ""The Grinch"" a year ago, but the sound in the theater was screwed and I didn't get to. So here's my chance. But something about this lone box with two morbid-looking girls on the front of it vs. the panorama of Jim Carrey roused the rebel in me, so I snapped up the indie and left the commercial geegaw behind.So anyway. ""Ginger Snaps"" concerns two sisters, Ginger and Brigitte (known as 'B'), living in a town called Bailey Downs, which I think is supposed to be a satellite town of Toronto. Ginger and B are just-turned-16 and not-quite-15 respectively, and they really, really hate the suburban mundaneness they're stuck with. They might well be called Goths, as they do dress in a good deal of black and are obsessed with death. They spend their time on wholesome activities like faking fatal accidents for school projects and planning the details of their suicide pact. The post title up there is their motto. All the boys are hot for Ginger, but she and her sister scorn them. They are both enormously proud of fact that neither has menstruated yet, as it sets them apart from the simpering girls they see all around them. One of these girls is particularly annoying to them- a stereotypical bimbo-bitch named Trina. Another of the girls' greatest joys is imagining the horrible deaths of their peers, so they decide to really freak Trina out by doing something evil to her big-ass dog. Dogs are important in this movie, in part because ""something"" around town has been mauling them and in part because they're obviously related to wolves. And in case you didn't know, ""Ginger Snaps"" is a teenage horror movie about werewolves. On the way to Trina's, they discover two things: one of the town dogs mauled to death and Ginger's first period. And whoops! Two seconds after this second discovery a huge, incredibly ugly dog-man thing attacks Ginger and bounds off with her into the woods. And here we discover just how surface-only the girls' death obsession was. This is the single scariest scene in the whole movie, and there is no question that Ginger wants to live and that B wants to save her. Eventually Ginger does get away from the thing and she and B start running like hell. They do make it to the road, which proves advantageous as the thing is subsequently run over by the friendly neighborhood drug dealer.So now Ginger has been chomped and clawed by this thing. And pretty soon all kinds of weird stuff is going on. And that's all I'm gonna say about the plot. Now I'm gonna yap about the acting. It's good- really good for a horror movie. In fact, how often does the acting in horror movies even merit mention? With this one, it does. The two central actresses are terrific, and the whole movie hinges on whether you can be concerned about them and believe in their very strong relationship. I'm hard pressed to say who gives the stronger performance, because they are significant for different reasons. Ginger is, quite literally, the libido-driven crotch of the flick while B is it's sad, neglected heart. The drug dealer turns out to be an important character, and even he has a bit more depth than you initially imagine. Mimi Rogers- an actress primarily known for her role as The Wife in Tom Cruise's first marriage- plays the girls' mother with some sort of disturbing mixture of psycho glee (she makes a strawberry cake to celebrate Ginger's period) and over-earnest intent to bond.Their are streaks of humor to be found in this movie (although they are so pitch black I fear not everyone would catch them), which is delightful in that its not the typical ironic `Scream'-inspired post-modern sort of humor. A word of warning to anyone with a delicate stomach: this movie absolutely gushes gore. Some truly gross stuff is here, but really I don't think it matters. I don't like gore, and except for the occasional flinch it didn't bother me. I was concerned with the characters and what would happen, and the gore was incidental. It feels almost classic, in a way, as it's focus is the struggle inherent to werewolf lore, the one that makes it such a great metaphor for (particularly female) puberty- the fight for and against one's own body and its impulses. That said, the ending does veer into far-too-familiar territory toward the end, only to be saved by its final, quietly shattering last shot.",Ginger Snaps
104,EdYerkeRobins,A New Horror Classic - Brings Dimension and Meaning to the Monster Film!,10,21 March 2002,"The term ""classic"" hasn't been used to describe a horror movie in a long time, because most films from the genre of the past few years have been either enjoyable but unoriginal and unmemorable or terrible.  Leave it to the independent Canadian production ""Ginger Snaps"" to be the one to break the trend.	Though ""Ginger Snaps""' evil beast is a werewolf, this is far more than just a monster movie.  The film is as much, if not more, focused on the changing relationship between two sisters, played masterfully by Emily Perkins (Brigette) and Katharine Isabelle (Ginger).  The girls promised that they would be together in their deaths (a subject they have a rather unhealthy fixation with), but Ginger's first period brings about changes in her that tear a great divide in their relationship.  Brigette finds herself to be a little jealous of her sister (and vice versa, her sister's growing overprotection and distaste for her), and her management of these feelings, the physical and personality changes in her sister, and beginning to find her own identity, is well-written and developed.  The issue is a very real one, which everyone has dealt with to some degree in their lives, yet the movie is smart enough to be able to focus on that without having a hokey after-school special feel to it.	Given that this is a werewolf movie, there's obviously some serious lycanthropy playing heavily into the plot.  The connection of changes due to puberty/teenage years and changing into a werewolf is rather brilliant, and, as mentioned in the last paragraph, adds a real depth and class to the characters.  It also adds another interesting thinly veiled metaphor to the teenager/werewolf connection  that lycanthropy is a disease spread through blood, which takes place in both attack and unprotected sex (Michael J. Fox's ""Teen Wolf"" never had to deal with this!).  As for the actual werewolf/make-up effects, they are believable - not the best but certainly not hokey either (though Ginger looks much better as the `mid-transformation' girl/werewolf at the greenhouse party scenes than as an all-out werewolf).  The film's best make-up effects, however, are utilized during the girls' death photography project; they are eerie in their realism, and set the tone for the sisters' relationship and negative attitudes towards life in general throughout the rest of the film.	""Ginger Snaps"" is a new classic horror film because it develops and maintains believable characters and their relationships, while at the same time keeping a horror movie atmosphere and monster.  It's the next step from the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" TV series, which has added realistic internal developments to their characters as well, but not as seriously and consistently as this film.  Its balance and seamless connection of both elements (growing up and werewolves) makes this highly recommended, as it's truly the most intelligent and best horror film I've seen in years, and one of the best I've ever seen.",Ginger Snaps
105,DorianWynHowells,Spot-on horror/sex education movie,10,29 November 2001,"Yes you read that correctly! This is not only a damn good horror film, but it also has a lot of information about girls and what they face during puberty. The script is very witty, and in some instances spot on. I really liked the idea that we as an audience aren't sure if Ginger (played with real gusto by Katherine Isabelle) is really turning into a werewolf or just having PMT! After all ""They don't call it the curse for nothing!""The curse relates to either 'the curse of the werewolf' or the curse  of 'period pains'. This is, in a sense, a sex education video for the younger audience's of the MTV generation, who would also like a bit of blood and gore to boot! What a winning combination! This film MUST be a hit with girls!A bit of a shock to the system is the fact that this is a CANADIAN film! Three cheers for them for showing Hollywood how to make a really good and effective horror film with a witty, and intelligent script!The two leads are marvellous, and the 'goth' background really holds up well. I didn't understand the title before I went to see it, but after coming out of the cinema, I grasped it's meaning. Believe me, when Ginger does finally snap, she does it so convincingly.The ending left me in tears (I won't spoil it though!) It really did. It was a good film that held my attention throughout.The SFX are very good too, but I'd wager that audience's will either like them, or not, I doubt there'll be many indecisve comments.
The film also creates tension and suspense with ease, with the attack on Ginger a very good example of this.All in all, a film which oozes confidence from it's two leads, with a good premise to match. I will give this film a very deserving 9 and a half out of 10. It is almost faultless. Enjoy the film!By the way, if you didn't guess...I'm actually a guy! Just in case you thought I was a girl!",Ginger Snaps
106,Rooster99,"Terrific horror movie, one of the best I have seen.",9,7 February 2004,"I was expecting a low-budget B-movie werewolf flick when I rented this one. Was I ever surprised!  The dialog was crisp, the story evolved in an extremely intelligent manner, the ending was completely unexpected; in short, this was a terrific movie.  It is so much better than your average horror flick, it actually has a storyline and characters you care about who weren't in it simply to party/have sex/do drugs/find really lame ways to end up by themselves so that the killer can pick them off one at a time.****MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS****The character development was expertly accomplished.  The sisters start off as social outcasts and evolve slowly towards acceptance (or at least one of them does).  At the same time, they grow apart as one achieves recognition while the other is left wishing things would not change.  And all the while, Ginger is becoming more an more animalistic, trying to cope with slowly turning into a werewolf.Everything about this movie was very well done.  It's not for the faint of heart, some scenes are quite bloody and the sisters are very crude in a teenage ""trying to be cool"" kind of way.  I can't think of a single horror movie I liked more, and I have seen many.  There were no cheesy one-liners which plague most horror films, there were no run-of-the-mill scares, fake scares (phew it's only the cat), or any sort of done-a-thousand-times happy ending (finally we killed that big bad serial killer, we can all go home smiling).  This movie hits hard!  It is one of the best endings of any horror movie, totally unexpected, and very moving.All in all, a 9 out of 10.",Ginger Snaps

This movie is brutal, fresh, atmospheric, original, effective, emotional and tons of fun. I loved the chemistry between two sisters, they had an amazing relationship. Katharine Isabelle as Ginger was so damned good and totally hot in it. When I watched it for the first time when I was like 18 years old, she was actually one of my biggest cruches from horror movies. Emily Perkins as Brigitte is also really great.

After enjoying Underworld and becoming a fan of films relating to vampires and werewolves, I am currently searching for good movies of these dark mythical creatures. Since I have watched plenty of vampire-themed movies, right now my main focus is the werewolves. So far I have enjoyed An American Werewolf in London, Dog Soldiers, and Werewolf: The Beast Among Us.I watched Ginger Snaps only because it was well received by critics and some viewers. Well, those who highly praise Ginger Snaps, how wrong they are!The werewolf is so fake and laughable. The story featuring 2 girls sounds like fun, and has great potential, but is a mess. The film is neither funny nor scary, just tedious and laughable.Ignore the good reviews and the awards it received, and stay away from this monstrosity, if you cherish your life and do not intend to waste 2 hours of your free time.",Ginger Snaps

So, I picked it up, watched it, came back excited because even though I've never heard or seen it before, it was packed with horror ad lots of gore.  The plot is good.  The story involves two sisters, Brigette and Ginger, who always fake their deaths in gruesome ways and take pictures of themselves.  Then, one night, during their walk, Ginger gets bitten by a werewolf, then, after running for their lives, the werewolf gets runned over by a van.  After Ginger gets bitten, she begins to change differently and becomes more popular while Brigette looks like a loser.  So, Brigette meets up with a kid named Sam (who raned over the werewolf) and they talk about different kinds of myths about werewolves and Brigette must stop Ginger from turning into a werewolf and wreck havoc all over the town.

Ginger Snaps is about two Gothic sisters(Bridgette and Ginger) that have a very strong connection and have a strange obsession with death.Well one night in the park,a furry creature attacks one of them(Ginger) and things get really weird.Everyone thinks it's just her hormones,but Bridgette thinks she was bit by a werewolf.With the help of Sam,who is pretty much a drug dealer and knows a lot he and Bridgette are out to help Gingrer before it's too late.The whole idea of it is just awesome.The sequel is just as awesome.O yeah,I forgot to mention the fantastic make-up effects in this!The make-up is just so radical and nicely done.The script is nicely done as well.Overall,i love this movie.Definitely in my top ten.I'd watch this about another 1,000 times before I stop.",Ginger Snaps
112,Brian B-2,Truly awful- hard to see anyone enjoying this,2,22 June 2002,"The concept- ""The Craft meets American werewolf meets Scream"", seemed like a good idea at the time. Unfortunately, this movie is so bad that its hard to find anything nice to say, Sure, there are a few goood shots of Emily Perkins "" not a child star no more"" in crop tops and tight pants, but given she's supposed to be under 16, even that seems creepy in a soiled sort of way. Katherine Isabelle is fine as the moody sister/heroine, but isn't given much to work with. The plot makes no sense, like those old Roger Corman foreign inport dubbed movies of the 60s. At least Corman's films were supposed to be camp. Ginger snaps wants to be a message movie about teen angst and alienation, but ends up being a poor slasher movie. save your money for Jason X. And what's the ending all about? It leaves us hanging, which ruins any efforts at a message. Does Brig save Ginger or not? Does she save herself? I couldn't figure it out. And earlier, what was mom ( Mimi Rogers) digging up in the basement anyway? Mimi is horrible, as are most of the supporting cast, and they deliver their trite dialogue hollowly, like the rewrites were still underway as they shot each scene.
Rent any of the Scream movies or The Craft instead.",Ginger Snaps
113,mbworm,Superb acting and plot,8,26 July 2007,"Ginger Snaps is devastatingly ingenious, self aware, dark, scary and extraordinarily performed and directed. Ginger and Brigitte are a pair of outcast sisters who live in the dismal town of Bailey Downs. On a particularly nasty excursion one night in a deserted playground, Ginger is attacked by none other than a vicious werewolf, and the following month that ensues stores a nasty transformation for Ginger as younger Brigitte desperately tries to keep up with her sister and the possible cure.The smart thing about Ginger Snaps is that it is completely aware of itself. It never takes itself too seriously, and the pacing, cinematography and hilarious writing are all too perfect. It's not really all about werewolfism though, the genius thing about this film is that the story is about coming of age. Ginger gets her first period the same night she is attacked, and the transformation she goes through is a perfectly blatant metaphor for puberty and growing up, and the younger sister, played to perfection by Emily Perkins, trying to understand is the perfect, hopeless cliché that occurs in every sibling relationship.To be noted, both of the actresses are amazing, the aforementioned Emily Perkins is outstanding but Katharine Isabelle really stands out the most as Ginger. It's hard not to love or appreciate this superior werewolf nailbiter.",Ginger Snaps
114,diztorted,Be careful...It bites!!!!,8,14 August 2001,"I was amazed by this film, there's so much more than the title implies. This is by far on the best werewolf movies I've ever seen, a film worthy of becoming an instant classic, and that is as much as I can say. And the grace in Ginger Snaps resides not only in how well it manages the good old werewolf concept, but in how this concept is converted and transformed into something new; a classic horror tale with a twist of acid.The film deals not only with the struggle of becoming a total animal or staying as a human being with animal instincts, which at the end is not the same. Also, it portrays the thin line between being obsessed with death and at the same time living afraid of it. But as the characters are developed, the sizzling attacks come leading to the crushing end, maintaining a nostalgic and asphixiating pace that keeps your attention and your breath inside your lungs all the time.Although licantropy is referred as the setback to primal animal instincts (in this case wolves), it also has something to do with power and submission, about victimizer and victim; and this is widely pictured in the love-masoquism relationship between the two characters Bee and Ginger.Aside from that, this film has everything a great horror flick must have: an excellent soundtrack, great off-your-seat tension, great darkly performances, great mood, and of course tons of blood. So watch it, but be careful, it may just bite you!.",Ginger Snaps

I found myself fast forwarding towards the end just to see if it could redeem itself. Alas it was not the case. There is very little blood or gore and no scares at all. If you want a good werewolf movie, watch Dog Soldiers. The werewolf portrayed in this film doesn't look like one and it doesn't appear until the end of the movie.

121,ryshpr,Horror films aren't like this anymore...,8,9 April 2010,"In all honesty, Ginger Snaps has to be one of the most underrated horror movies in existence. Ginger Snaps uses the transformation into a werewolf as a metaphor for puberty. When Brigitte's sister Ginger gets attacked by a mysterious creature and starts to change into a werewolf, but all the adults around them think she is just experiencing puberty.It has all the makings of an independent movie, the lack of CGI helps with that. But it's the absence of the flashy computer trickery that makes it so different to other horror movies from the past 10 years. It has more charm than other recent offerings from the horror genre, even in spite of the hundreds of obscenities uttered throughout the course of the film.The make-up and prosthetics are extremely well done when considering the budget. The werewolf at the beginning is very convincing and the small changes to Ginger's face and body never look overly done or fake. In fact, Ginger looks a little scary and menacing in some later scenes.Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle are both brilliant in their own ways as the sisters. Isabelle in particular shines as the titular character Ginger who's personality changes incredibly rapidly and throughout. The two play sisters so convincingly that it's a wonder why the two haven't scored more starring roles since the movie's release.Although I'm yet to see the two sequels I'm pretty adamant that this would be hard to top. Congratulations to the makers on producing a decent, interesting horror movie.http://ukmore.tk/",Ginger Snaps
122,peter-ramshaw-1,"Corny by name, not by nature",7,15 January 2007,"One often suspects with films with names like 'Ginger Snaps' that maybe the writer came up with the name first and then crafted something around it. If NOT so, then why retain that titles. It's a play on words sure but this film (and its box office) would have benefited so much for a catchier title in my opinion.In a similar vein, the DVD I have has a sub-heading/catch-line 'The is one babe with massive teething problems...' - the less said about that the better.Now, that said, this is a good little movie. The dark, film noir, Gothic horror works very well as a running side-bar to the ancient old werewolf folk-lore. I was a little disappointed that the 'hero' (as opposed to Ginger's sister, the heroine) had to be portrayed as (and albeit smalltime) drug dealer. Maybe I'm just old-fashioned but it didn't seem quite right. Nevertheless, both lead girls give great performances and, when push comes to shove, you can all but forgive the rather puppet-like werewolf itself.. because, the story isn't really about werewolves, it's about changing; about unleashing the beast inside us all.Teen horror has a poor name in the movie business (no wonder several actresses turned the lead down) but this Canadian effort does at least something to set the record straight. The mix of horror and humour is about right and the girls delightfully insane mother is a treat.This is a pleasant surprise in the world of a usually C-grade rubbish genre.",Ginger Snaps

124,experten,Half baked Carrie clone mixed with Howling but without the gore.,5,3 November 2001,"Don't be fooled by the other reviews. When you read their reviews it is easy to think that Ginger Snaps is a gory masterpiece with an original story. The truth is that it is not gory, it is not very original and it is nowhere near being a masterpiece. Let me explain. First of all, it is a somewhat entertaining horror movie containing mostly of half interesting well acted teenage problem drama (Mimi Rogers has a small easy role but the sisters are good and they look like normal people which make you care more about them). But the story is half baked, the pacing is sometimes a little slow and there are some scenes that feels unnecessary and some scenes that hurt the movie.
The beginning of the movie resembles Carrie, telling the story of two oddball sisters that don't go on very well with the other students in school, but unlike Carrie, this part never leads anywhere and it has no importance for the conclusion of the movie. It would have been more interesting if the problems in school had been more severe and if this had had an impact on the story, for instance if the sisters really had been suffering from the other kids abuse and they resorted to evil deeds to revenge (but then it would have been Carrie). Also thrown into the mix is the theme of menstruation but this was done so much better in Carrie (remember the shower scene ?) and here it has no importance at all. After the Carrie part comes the rather unoriginal transformation part of the movie including the not so interesting and too easy hunt for a cure, followed by a standard horror movie ending, only more kind than usual and not gory at all (influenced by ET ?)A couple of reviewers make comparisons between GS and the movies by David Cronenberg. Do not think for a minute that GS is in the same league as for instance The Brood. The only similarity is the tail scenes (you will understand if you see the movie) that are a little grotesque but Cronenberg is of course the master of the grotesque. The movie is not funny like some reviewers has stated, but there are a few ridiculous scenes like the one with the school nurse and the one with the partly transformed boy that only looks stupid. GS would have been better without those scenes.Now to the matter of gore content. Here are a couple of quotes from other reviews on IMDB that I find misleading: `it sloshed out gore by the gallon', `very gory and disturbing in places', `the extensive gore may deter some squeamish viewers, which is too bad'. You don't have to compare GS with extremely violent movies like Italian splatter movies from directors such as Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci, it is enough to compare GS with almost any horror movie and it is obvious that it is not a brutal or gory movie. MINOR SPOILER ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF VIOLENCE IN GS: Yes, there is blood in the movie, but no on screen killings only aftermaths (mostly of animals) including fake death pictures. As a matter of fact, there is not even any on screen violence except for an accidental death, a not so brutal beating and the tossing around of a victim (standard procedure when movie makers don't have the guts to let someone be brutally killed on screen). Did I forget any violence ? Then it was not worth remembering. END OF VIOLENCE SPOILER.SHORT SUMMARY Good things: No computer graphics, good sound effects, and  the teenage school drama is OK with good acting. Bad things: The story is half-baked, there is no gore and not many scares, it drags in the middle, some scenes feels unnecessary, the humanoid werewolf make up is ridiculous and not at all scary, the werewolf make up has been done better before, the transformation scene is no good  we hardly see anything (probably because of lack of money), the werewolf is not dangerous enough and not very powerful.Alternate recommendations: Carrie (better movie, better teenage drama), The Brood (more disturbing), Howling and An American Werewolf In London (better werewolf movies). If you want gore: check out the movies by Dario Argento.Fact is: the trailer is much better than the movie. I think many will be disappointed by GS. Rent. Don't buy. 5 / 10",Ginger Snaps
125,fedtho,"Utterly enjoyable cocktail of humor, horror and - Yes - meaning!",9,23 August 2003,"Oh, yes, I'd like to comment on that movie! When I saw the votes didn't even reach the seven mark, I decided to give it a nine instead of an eight, and it deserves it, no question.I've got to go back to the ""American werewolf in London"", ""Howlings"" and, OH YES, the more recent ""Dog soldiers"", by the very British Neil Marshall(2002)... but that was given a 6.9 here... (why?), to find a comparably smart, witty achievement in using the horror-genre to do a both entertaining and meaningful job like John Fawcett (I) did in this case!I was so lucky to discover it during a small and extremely recommendable horror & fantastic film festival (""Fantastic'arts"") in Gérardmer, France, in January 2002. Lucky, because it'll never get on a screen in MY town...I still wonder why ""Ginger snaps"" (how's that for a title? and it DOES live up to the expectations, I swear!) didn't raise more praise and attention: doing a horror-comedy based on both the idea of two solitary sisters, sticking together in face of rejection by other schoolmates AND the parallel between starting menstruations and the metamorphosis into a monstrous, blood-thirsty werewolf (this is VERY delicately and successfully treated, as two girl-friends who saw it confirmed to me, that's the opinions I got!)... I say that is bold and risky - to say the least.The comedy is very well-paced, the dialogs are a pure joy, the characters - even when caricatured - very convincing, and the actresses (Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle playing the two sisters and -just WOW ! - a delirious/hilarious Mimi Rogers as their mother!) absolutely fabulous, yes! (I know there's a TV-series with that name, but I never saw it, so no intended connection).The movie manages to keep the high level it sets for itself from the very beginning on through to the end - where I might concede it slows down just a bit...So those who thought it worth of only a SIX, please, try and have a second look...And everyone else who's not entirely allergic to horror and the least bit open-minded and curious: YOU WON'T REGRET IT ! RUN AND RENT IT!",Ginger Snaps
126,arabesuku,"Stunning, surprising, unique - my favourite movie of ALL time!",10,13 June 2006,"This film is AMAZING. 'Ginger Snaps' uses the metaphor of werewolfism for puberty and teenage life, but with clever little twists.Brigitte (Emily Perkins) and Ginger (Katherine Isabelle) Fitzgerald are two social outcasts, sisters and best friends, together ""against life as we know it""... obsessed with death and suicide. Neither of them (despite the fact they're 15-16) have experienced puberty as of yet, and are glad that they haven't so they remain different to everyone else. But one night, when out tricking their loathed enemy from school, Trina Sinclair (Danielle Hampton), Ginger gets ""the curse""... now angry she has something in common with the others (she's properly hit puberty) she doesn't notice a werewolf stalking her. It finally attacks and after a desperate struggle, with Brigitte attempting to save her sister, she takes Ginger back home. Ginger is very much wounded but Brigitte finds it scary that they have almost healed within minutes of getting cut... Slowly, over the next 28 days, Ginger becomes more and more like a young woman on the prowl. They think it's puberty and hormones at first, but when Ginger starts growing a tail they realise something's not quite right. As the best friends slowly grow apart as Ginger grows more wolf-like Brigitte knows she has to find a way to save her sister before she loses her completely. With the help of local drug-dealer-and-plant-know-it-all Sam, can she get her sister back? Or will she lose Ginger to the werewolf virus? So whats all the hype about? Well firstly, Katharine Isabelle, Emily Perkins and Kris Lemche shine like gems in 'Ginger Snaps'. Their acting is beyond superb (Perkins does even BETTER in 'Ginger Snaps II: Unleashed')! The black humour in this movie is hilarious, gets me in stitches every time! For example, after Ginger is accused of being a werewolf, during the family dinner time, Ginger takes a bite out a chicken wing, looks at Brigitte and bitterly says ""Wish these were babie's legs."" - cracks me up every time! Pamela (Mimi Rogers), the girls' mother, is fantastic too! She is absolutely hilarious in her mother role, but I think we are meant to be laughing at her sometimes. Or maybe because we are with the two depressed girls all through the movie, we HAVE to laugh at her contrast with her daughters! The gore, horror, shocks, surprises, humour, soundtrack, acting and unique idea for 'Ginger Snaps' is what makes it so special. This movie, I feel, has inspired many people and influenced them a lot. My friend received a t-shirt with the girls' pact on it as a friendship birthday gift once, and I know that this movie has inspired a lot of death shots (I myself did some after seeing 'Ginger Snaps'!).You MUST see this movie - it's pure genius!",Ginger Snaps
127,Manji,Ginger Snaps and Goes for the Jugular!!!,7,27 April 2002,"Few horror films in the last decade have been given as much care as Ginger Snaps, a modern take on the werewolf phenomenon. Heavily advertised, well in Canada anyway, and given a wide release fit for a huge summer blockbuster, again in Canada, it hit theaters in 2000. Unfortunately, virtually no one went out to see the film regardless of numerous positive reviews and reactions from critics. Perhaps it's because it is a Canadian film? Ok, I won't go there in this review...maybe another time, but the point is that this flick kicks some major ass! Not since American Werewolf in London have I enjoyed myself this much watching a wolf film. But I digress, to compare it to John Landis' 1981 masterpiece is an insult to the originality of either film.Ginger Snaps is the story of two sisters, blood relatives none of that bestest friends in the world that are like sisters crap. Anyway, these two sisters are morbid, dark, and brooding the perfect anti-hollywood teen (aka. a real/normal teenager) and loathed at their school. Of course, they don't need or seek the approval of their peers as they have eachother for any real comfort or support. But one of the local female bullies at school just won't let up on either of them. Needless to say, a line is crossed and the girls feel that it's the perfect time to exact revenge on this bully.Now, what is uber cool about this flick is that the girls are real. Unlike in most horror films, these two keep their tops on, and it's not just because they portray characters that are under the age. Instead they are like many girls that are around that 15-16 year-old age, who have serious concerns about their bodies. Regularly these girls wear baggy clothes to school so as not to emphasize their features. They aren't looking to draw attention to themselves or even be noticed, the less attention is paid to them the more free time they have to create their art (death related photography!). All they need is each other, even in the worst of circumstances. Of course, this delicate balance can't remain intact and soon their world is turned upside down when, during a night time trip to play a prank on their bully, one of them is attacked by a bizarre creature from the nearby woods.Personally, I find that the best horror films lack a real explaination for the occurance of some evil presence. Like Romero's NOTLD series, who cares where the zombie threat originated, it makes it more realistic for us as human beings not to know where the source of the problem is. We don't know everything and it's this concept that Ginger Snaps employs for the werewolf creature that attacks the girls in the park. Just as soon as it has appeared it is dispatched and all that is left is the impending doom caused by the threat of infection.Cleverly, the writer-director team of John Fawcett & Karen Walton have woven the wolf's infection in with the idea of puberty and the end result is ""growing up"" like you've never seen it before. Here are two girls who have never sought the assistance of anyone outside of their relationship trying to figure out how to deal with their first periods AND growing fur & claws.
It's a strange film indeed bordering at one point on the comedic and the next minute on the horrific with nary a misstep. For those fans of gore, sadly there's not too much but don't worry lotsa innocent teen blood still flows as NO werewolf goes for the clean kill. Definitely not your typical werewolf or teen movie and it's completely worth your time!",Ginger Snaps
128,wonderdawg,A teen horror film with subtext? What a concept!,10,17 November 2009,"""I had a lot of problems with horror films in general, especially the portrayal of women"" Karen Walton confesses on the Writer's Commentary track, "" ... lots of screaming and bouncing ... violence for the sake of violence .... I really hated the genre."" So why did she spend four years writing and polishing her script to razor sharp perfection? Simple. Director John Fawcett offered her a chance to rewrite the rules. Gothy, antisocial and obsessed with images of death, twisted sisters Ginger (Katherine Isabelle) and Bridget (Emily Perkins) are toughing out their teens in high school hell in deepest darkest Canadian suburbia. Harassed by the popular girls and hustled by the jocks, the pair huddles together for protection. All that changes when Ginger is bitten one night by a savage wolf like creature. Once shy and quiet, she becomes assertive, self-confident and sexually provocative. Her body is going through changes as well. I mean, what's up with those silver hairs on her Lady Schick? Bridget begins to suspect her sister has been infected by the bite and may be turning into a monster. ""Thank you for taking my nightmare so seriously, "" Ginger scowls. Her tone is sarcastic. Yet it is precisely the film's serious treatment of her predicament that sets it apart from all those self- referential satires that followed in the wake of Wes Craven's Scream trilogy. Ginger's slow and terrifying transformation into a werewolf is meant to be a metaphor for the emotional upheaval, confusion and terror of adolescence with all its attendant physical and psychological changes. ""It's really important to go for emotional honesty, "" Walton stresses. She gets it from Isabelle and Perkins. These two talented and intuitive young performers know and understand their characters intimately and are able to reach deep inside and come up with intense, unsettling, often poignant feelings and emotions. The premise may be ""out there"" but the portrayals ring true and it is that reality which grounds the story and makes the fantastical elements believable. The focus of the film is on the bond between the two girls and it is intriguing to watch the shifting dynamics in the relationship as Ginger begins to lose control of her mind and body. To save her sister's life, timid Bridget must finally take charge of her own. Although the subject matter is treated seriously, the film is laced with deliciously dark humor. The dialogue crackles with sharp, sardonic wit, Mimi Rogers plays the girls' clueless suburban mom to poker-faced perfection and director Fawcett has a clever way of using visual cues as a wry counterpoint to action unfolding on screen. Operating on a lo-fi budget, the director relies on sly camera-work, atmospheric lighting and canny editing rather than an arsenal of special effects to create tension and drama. He has a keen eye for little details and a shrewd sense of pacing. Check out the deleted scenes (15 in all) to fully appreciate his discipline as a film-maker.There are two commentary tracks, Fawcett's is full of breezy chatter about the actors and shooting details but it is Walton's track that I found intriguing. Thoughtful and analytical, it is recommended listening for any budding screenwriter looking for tips on story structure and characterization. The extras include behind the scenes footage of Isabelle and Perkins auditioning and rehearsing their roles.",Ginger Snaps
129,andyman618,A great new take on the werewolf genre,8,13 August 2003,"A great new take on the werewolf genre of horror films. Two sullen, isolated sisters run afoul of a local lycanthrope, with some unexpected results. The interaction between the sisters, and how their relationship changes in the course of the movie lend this film a depth I had not expected. Strong performances, and some interesting new ideas make this the best werewolf movie I've seen since An American Werewolf In London.",Ginger Snaps
130,severin72,Wow.,9,24 November 2006,"I just realized that this film could reasonably be called a ""teen horror movie"". To do so though would be not far short of calling ""2001"" a ""science fiction adventure"". However you define it ""Ginger Snaps"" benefits greatly from being made by a relatively unknown band of Canadians with a small budget. Alas, they seem to have had an even smaller amount of marketing savvy thus denying their creation the exposure it deserves. This is a great shame because their story of two teenage sisters (Katherine Isabelle and Emily Perkins), morbid, awkward outsiders both, who are attacked by an animal in their suburban neighborhood one night, is the first great werewolf film since Joe Dante and John Landis opened the genre's modern era way back in 1981. Compare this to ""Cursed"". Young siblings + werewolf + experienced film-makers + big budget = trainwreck. Little old ""Ginger Snaps"" on the other hand, strives to be thoughtful rather than hip and achieves a perfect tone: darkly funny and ironic. The characters drive this movie. You believe in them and their relationships completely. You even believe that Isabelle is the older of the two sisters when in reality she's five years younger than Perkins. Both are spectacularly good as is Mimi Rogers as their well-meaning but moderately clueless mother. This a very female-centric movie. The male characters don't emerge as well and the political subtext occasionally veers towards sermonizing but the central metaphor of lycanthropy as puberty never becomes labored. The suburban Ontario locations are wonderfully bleak and work well with a Mike Shields score that emphasizes the bittersweet core of the film. It is as sad as it is funny. The werewolf design is extraordinarily ambitious considering the money available. All effects are mechanical (not one CGI shot) and, sparingly used, they work pretty well. As part of trying to fit the werewolf into the modern world Wilton and Fawcett have demythologized it. The supernatural elements are gone and the creature acts very much like a real animal not like a toy the director is using to make the audience jump. It's only after the film is over that you'll realize it wasn't scary. I don't think the film-makers cared about that and the audience shouldn't either. It's incidental to the story and there is a real story here not just an amusement park ride. It's a nice tribute to the material that the two sequels it spawned were both good (and in one case arguably even superior) to the original.",Ginger Snaps
131,Chromium_five,Goth girls + werewolves + heroic werewolf-hunting stoner = Halloween classic,8,23 May 2009,"The Canadian film industry is proof that American criticisms of Canada's supposed lameness are baseless and uncalled for. Canada has produced some amazing and twisted movies, and this one--best described as a cross between ""Freaks and Geeks"" and early Cronenberg--ably continues that tradition. The visionary screenwriter injected new life into the nearly-dead werewolf genre by having the wolf transformation be a gradual one (recreating the same ominous mood as in Cronenberg's classic, ""The Fly"") and giving it a female perspective. The story is ostensibly a puberty metaphor (which is kind of strained, if you ask me: she's becoming more confident in her looks while turning into a dog? What?), but it's equally interesting as a metaphor for human change in general: Brigitte is terrified to see her beloved older sister turning into someone she no longer recognizes or understands. The talented leads make that conflict believable and moving. When combined with shocking gore, deadpan humor, and a sidekick who lives in a greenhouse and spends his days smoking pot and researching werewolf lore, I'd say this movie deserves the rare title of Halloween classic. Definitely an 8/10 (or 9/10 in metric ratings).",Ginger Snaps
132,cutie_mcpretty,Out by sixteen or dead in the scene but together forever,8,19 July 2008,"Ginger snaps is one of those films where you can't just watch it once, you have to watch it again. It is a snappy, interesting, funny horror movie, with the most perfect cast the film could have asked for. Let's start with the plot: Ginger (Katherine Isabelle) and Brigitte (Emily Perkins) are sisters who's only friends is each other. They are obsessed with death and have planned to kill themselves by sixteen. They are both growing up and through out the movie are seen to grow apart. One night Ginger is bitten by a mysterious dog in the forest which is later to be revealed is a werewolf. We see Ginger's frightening development from best friend to Brigitte to a monster. With the help of botanist Sam (Kirs Lemche), Brigitte plans to make a cure for Ginger so she can get her sister back. I loved how dark and mysterious the plot was and actually how much I wanted to have a bond like that with someone. The plot was very well thought out, making the story realistic and human, which is the scariest thing.The actors were perfect. Katherine Isabelle was great as Ginger. Each line was said with great energy and toward the end you were actually scared of her. Her look as well was perfect for a werewolf, with the fake teeth and contacts. Emily Perkins played Brigitte wonderfully. I think she is a wonderful horror actress. She has great facial expressions and can pull off each line that she says. Kris Lemche did great as Sam. Kris Lemche's character was what gave the movie humour and it was nice to see his character develop into 'cool dude' to Brigitte's only friend. He played the part really realistically, his death scene was so brilliantly acted, by Emily Perkins too, that I almost cried. Simply put, this film is the ideal horror movie. It's creepy, it's funny, it's dark, it's everything a horror move needs to be.",Ginger Snaps
133,Patsy-9,A small miracle,8,13 May 2001,"Werewolf movies are really few and far between, but when my local reviewer (in whom my faith is limited) declared Ginger Snaps to be the best made in the last 30 years, I took notice. I'm not sure where he got that figure from, but what are the contenders? An American Werewolf in London, most would say. It is a tolerable movie with effective bursts of humour, but stagy and overblown, with a completely unsatisfying end. What then - Wolfen, Silver Bullet, The Howling and its sequels? Wolf? An American Werewolf in Paris? No way. Perhaps the Neil Jordan's very odd and very Freudian In the Company of Wolves. John Fawcett's marvellous Ginger Snaps is close to the spirit of that movie than the others I've mentioned.In the wake of Hannibal, here is a movie to remind me that gloss makes a horror movie less scary, not more. From its opening moments, Ginger Snaps seems drab and real, and is almost as evocative in its gray atmospherics as Halloween (or early David Cronenberg). Its moment of horror are, for once, actually shocking - the first attack on Ginger is scarier than anything in The Blair Witch Project. But it was only after the movie was over that I became really unnerved - here is a rare horror film scarier in its implications than in the gore on the screen. It has something to say about parental neglect (a telling moment is when Mimi Rogers as the mother says she's happy that her plan was working - letting her daughters come to her), STDs (to which lycanthropy is explicitly connected throughout), addiction and obsession, and even the spectre of violent sister-sister incest is palpable (as mother-daughter in The Exorcist). And menstruation. Blood is a consistent visual symbol from the first scene to the last; in fact, this is the only movie I've seen that might earn its R rating for ""explicit scenes of menstruation."" Carrie is the tale of a menstrual initiation gone terribly wrong, and so is Little Red Riding Hood. But this movie trumps them both - a psychoanalytic scholar could really sink his teeth in here (no pun intended). Even the title can be read different ways - is it a reference to what a werewolf's jaws can do? Or is it a description of what happens to Ginger's psyche (when her animalistic side takes over before she beats up another girl, there is an audible snapping noise on the soundtrack). I'd like to think it characterizes the essential difference between her and her sister Brigitte. Ginger may snap, but Brigitte never does.I also admired the persuasive logic with which the story unfolds. I like that the Hollywood rules for dealing with werewolves (which Hollywood invented) are quickly swept aside. And when a character says ""There has to be a cure, or else there'd be more of them"" I was shouting ""YES!"" - monster movies always seem to ignore that fact. The research into herb lore to try to find a cure seems plausible and leads to a plausible solution (which, I would be remiss in not noting, seems a homage to The Werewolf of London.)Copious praise must go to Emily Perkins in the lead role as Brigitte. She is completely believable from start to finish in what begins as a very unsympathetic role. But what a role it is! The character has a complete arc. She gets to play sullen, concerned, excited, scared, subtly in love (this is handled with particular grace), brave, determined, emotional, level-headed, crafty, she gets to surrender to her animal impulses and she gets to fight them off. She even manages to bring off a tender scene played with a hunk of animatronics! I cared about her character deeply, I felt a need to protect her. How rare for a horror film! Neve Campbell has nothing on this girl. I want more of her.Mention must be made to the curious similarities to American Beauty, from uncomfortable dinner table scenes between parents and sullen daughters to a smart and resourceful drug dealer as the nominal hero. I wonder if these were intentional or unconscious.There is a lot of humour in Ginger Snaps, but not of the tiring self-referential Scream variety. It is as cold and dark and bloody as the movie itself. Flaws? A few - I could have done without the occasional bursts of tuneless rock music on the soundtrack, but those were blissfully few. A few of the characters are overdrawn; the camera compositions are sometimes too studied. And, unusual and effective as the ending is, we needed to see one other thing before the curtain in order to complete the plot and the theme alike (those who've seen the movie should know what I mean). The ending is meant to be ambiguous, but this is a point where it should be unequivocal. Still, these are minor complaints. I'm not sure if it will be released in the States, but it's well worth a look, perhaps on video. But for Memento, this is the best movie I've seen yet this year. It's the movie that's restored my faith in the cinematic horror genre.",Ginger Snaps
134,le_chiffre-1,"Starts out strong, but runs out of steam",3,21 July 2010,"I've seen this movie twice, once on video shortly after it came out and more recently at a movie theater that was re-screening it, and both times I was left with the same impression. The movie starts out strong, with interesting, mostly likable, if a bit derelict, characters, and adds some minor original twists to werewolf lore, but halfway through it starts to drag and by the end you really don't care what happens anymore and just want the movie to be over. Past 75 minutes there's no story left to tell and it feels as though they're deliberately stretching it out just to waste film. Not even the actress playing Ginger, as easy on the eyes as she is (at least, when she hasn't turned into a werewolf), was enough to keep me interested 'til the end. While initially intriguing, by the middle the characters have become two-dimensional and the viewer grows indifferent to their fate.If the movie had been 20 minutes shorter and the feminist rhetoric and latent lesbianism had been toned down or removed, this would've been an OK teen horror-thriller in the same vein as Lost Boys or Disturbing Behavior.A few minor points about this film which have left me scratching my head: 1) Isn't sixteen years of age a bit old for a girl to be having her first period? I'm sure it happens sometimes but it can't be all that common. Was her late period supposed to carry a symbolic significance?2) Why does the movie try to elicit pathos when the Asian janitor is murdered by Ginger, but not when the school principal is? Is this subtly trying to communicate that blue-collar immigrants who intervene in potential rapes should be regarded as morally superior to white male authority figures?",Ginger Snaps

136,Viator Veritatis,Not a real horror movie,4,3 March 2015,"This is in fact a witty teenager comedy full of black (and unmistakably Anglo-Saxon) humor, sexual metaphors, goth elements and a liberal amount of splatter. It masquerades itself as a horror movie, but really, the horror element is just a metaphor for female puberty, the pangs of growing-up and the loss of innocence.If you enjoy pastiches like ""An American werewolf in London"", only a bit gorier and tighter, you will have a good time with 'Ginger snaps' . However, if your idea of horror is bound to Lovecraft and other classics of the genre, if you demand a logically consistent plot and credible, realistic reactions from the characters, and any hint of comicality spoils the concentration you are investing in the build-up of the atmosphere, you'll be irritated in a matter of minutes. I was.In this movie there are plot holes as large as block buildings, dialogues are meant to be wickedly funny rather than scary or evocative, and no effort is invested in realistic behavior on the part of the characters - if you knew that your sibling is affected by a mysterious illness that's transforming her body, threatening her life and turning her in a deadly menace, would you attempt to treat her with silver rings and wolf bane while chirping quaint teenager banter, or would you call in the doctors and the police? I realize that viewers interested in alternative fiction might be surprised and delighted by this movie. That's the only reason why I allot it four stars.

It's fabulous.Whoever thought of this plot was the weirdest person in the world.

On the same day the older, prettier one finally gets her period, she is bitten by a werewolf and you can guess the rest.  But she only becomes a werewolf when it's her period.

I like to think of it more as a coming of age movie, it just so happens that while coming of age, the lead happened to be bitten by a werewolf.Ginger and Brigitte are two socially backwards sisters with a fascination with blood and death. While out hoping to play a prank on the 'cool' girl Ginger gets 'the curse' and then moments later is savagely attacked by a werewolf. From then her personality and appearance changes, she blames it on her period whilst Brigitte believes her sister is becoming a werewolf.The concept sounds absolutely ridiculous but the dark, subtly twisted and almost camp way the story is told makes it so fun to watch. Its obvious low budget adds a grainy edge to the film too that compliments it.Every detail is thought out for the best effect the scene needs. The school nurse is hilariously chirpy whilst delivering a graphic and disturbing description of the menstrual cycle whereas more tense scenes, such as the demise of Trina in the kitchen, are more heavy.Emily Perkins and Katherine Isabelle shot right up my favourite actresses list with this film with their raw and miserable performances.If you like your Rob Zombie horror porn slashers then you will be disappointed with this.

141,SmashMonkey,an absolute howl,9,23 August 2006,"This film is an underrated masterpiece, truly innovative. It manages to convey the horrors of unwanted lycanthropy whilst at the same time generating feelings of both empathy and sympathy for its two female leads. Sisters Ginger (Isabelle) and Brigitte (Perkins) share an unhealthily close bond, which is stretched to its limits when Ginger is bitten by a werewolf on the same day she has her first period. Soon, Ginger is craving blood and has more hair than any lady shave could deal with. Despite the fact that neighbourhood pets and the odd school-kid goes missing, the girl's self-obsessed parents notice nothing out of the ordinary with their morbid brood. Brigitte spends most of her time trying to control her lupine sibling whilst searching for a cure. Ginger, on the other hand, spends her time acting like a schizophrenic slut, unable to control the feelings and hormones rampaging through her metamorphosing body. The climax of this film is like no other and is done with such sensitivity and finesse that it is easy to forget that this is a horror film. In short, if you like brainless slasher films where the body count is the most important factor, give this one a miss. If, however, you are sick of predictable Hollywood gore-fests and would like to see a brilliantly written and stylish take on the whole werewolf theme, this is the film for you.

142,writevjnow-IMDB,What a laugh!,9,24 January 2019,"I howled with laughter through much of this werewolf horror movie (seen it a few times over the years) but also I laughed out loud at some of the low-rating reviews. I mean, someone wrote about the mental state of two girls who like to create fake 'death scenes' - oh goodness, are we going to get all politically correct here too? Who says youngsters are never morbid and fascinated by death? Sure they are, some of them. Heard of Halloween? And aren't such types often budding horror-movie-makers in the making? Best of all were the reviews complaining that werewolves don't really act this way, that they don't change this way, etc. Seriously? I mean, really, seriously? :-D I've got some news - there are no such things as a werewolves.Movie makers, authors, screenwriters, have always played with folklore characters, bending and breaking rules. Vampire movies and books are especially well known for it - think of the twinkling vampires in the Twilight saga, all living together in a designer house with not a coffin in sight. Anything goes, you know, and just because Bram Stoker had his Dracula (great book) climbing up walls and not liking stake and garlic, doesn't mean to say that all vampires are like that. Oh, I forgot, there are no such things as vampires (except vampire bats etc).Ginger Snaps is hilariously gory and fits right into the dark comedy/horror genre. It's not for the squeamish but some seem to be taking it way too seriously. There are actually some similarities to the cult horror 'Lost Boys' (a superior movie, I confess). Instead of two brothers we have two sisters, the younger looking out for the older. There's the scatty devoted mother and instead of a grandfather who pretty much lets the women around him get on with it, there is the sisters' father who pretty much lets the women around him get on with it.Ginger Snaps is not meant to be taken seriously.

The sisters are unusually close and both are fascinated with extreme morbidity. Sort of dark and gothic. You know the deal.One of the girls is savaged by a werewolf one night and slowly begins to change. Her body, her personality, it all starts to change. The rest of the movie involves them trying to find a cure for the werewolf infection.This movie took me by surprise. I knew it was a cult classic but you never know when you hear ""cult classic"". Some movies have a reputation for being great but then you watch them and its like blahhh. Not Ginger Snaps. It really sucks you in. The characters are three dimensional and exceptionally well drawn.

144,freeist,"A great, largely overlooked horror movie that's more complex than it looks.",9,13 November 2009,"The only reason why I do not rate this movie a 9 or 10 is that the characters will not appeal to everyone, and that's essential to liking this film.This is a horror movie Hollywood would never make and would screw it up totally if it tried. A small Canadian movie, with few production values but with an original approach to an old horror motif: the werewolf story. This movie is pure horror: harsh, suspenseful, violent, bloody, and in every way disturbing. However, it had a very low budget for special effects, and therefore much of the horror depends on the acting and on identifying with the the characters. Provided that works for you, Ginger Snaps will shake you and stay in your mind and gut afterward. It is a horror movie with enough connection to real life to stir your emotions and thoughts for days, and with characters that soak into your heart and stay there.At its core Ginger Snaps is actually a more complex story than it appears, it is about the meaning of devotion, and its failure. It is also one of the few horror movies that succeeds at also being a classical tragedy, though many try. The film is about two teenage sisters, Ginger and Brigitte, born close enough together to both be fifteen, and totally devoted to each other. Ginger, is the older, dominant and prettier one, and Brigitte is the younger, shy and nerdy one. The simple fact that they look like real high school outcasts and not buffed-up Hollywood androids adds a lot to the movie. The sisters are not exactly outcasts, however, unlike ""Carrie,"" their isolation from others is their preference. They take a ""circle-the-wagons"" approach to peers, and are captivated by death. The movie begins by them staging photographs of themselves dying violently. This has to be the best credit sequence I have ever seen. The dark humor from the ""fake"" violence at the beginning is totally at odds with their response to the ""real"" violence and death later, starting when Ginger survives an attack from a werewolf.When this happens, the sisters had been approaching a crisis over a blood-oath they swore when they were eight, to be ""Out by sixteen or dead in the scene, but together forever."" It is no accident that an implied argument between the sisters in their first scene over this oath is settled in the very last scene with the last two last lines of dialog. Listen and watch closely when the oath is mentioned in the movie, and you might appreciate it more.The werewolf attack itself is a very graphic savaging, and it contains very unsettling childhood motifs, suggesting child-rape. After that point, the movie turns into a nightmare about puberty making Ginger into something ugly and vicious, straining a childhood bond with her sister that had previously seemed eternal. The connection made between puberty and werewolfism is original, and is made stronger with a female character whose first menstruation attracts a monster whose life is also dictated by a 28-day cycle. This is only werewolf movie I've seen in which there are no shots of the full moon. Instead, the time of the werewolf cycle is marked by Brigitte on a menstrual calendar. Writer Karen Walton and director John Fawcett have created a werewolf story so outstanding that it is almost a correction to, rather than a revision of, the werewolf myth.For Ginger, you have very little time to get to know her before grouchiness and then violent insanity take hold. Brigitte shows courageousness in helping her sister, and has the most mature concept of devotion of the two, but she wavers at bad time. Even so she gains independence and stands up to Ginger even as Ginger becomes stronger, less human, and more homicidal. Some might call this a ""coming of age"" story, but that does not describe the tragedy evoked. It is more like a loss of childhood story.For the acting, Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle as Brigitte and Ginger, respectively, give performances worthy of Shakespeare. They are perfectly cast, and play off one another with style. Kris Lemche does equally well in his supporting role as Sam, a drug dealer, who is the only other person to know about the original werewolf, and who tries to help the sisters. You might occasionally find performances just as good in a horror film, but you will never find performances that are better, and this movie has three.This has to be the most closely edited movies I've ever seen. There is nothing extraneous here. This, and some well-condensed dialog, make the film move FAST-- until near the end. It was closely edited, however, because independent movies by little known directors usually must run under 110 minutes to get distribution. Some good material was lost.There are some cons to the movie. First thing, I'll repeat, if you don't like the sisters, turn it off immediately because this movie will not work for you. Also, the editing is almost too close. The production had a lot of trouble raising money. The time and budget constraints leave little room for establishing atmosphere in many scenes, and it barely gives the viewer enough information to follow the plot. Budget constraints also meant scenes had to be altered and scaled back to bear bones. The party scene toward the end comes to nothing, it was cut and scaled back so much from the script. It just makes the ending longer. The special effects may be called adequate only because of the acting around them. Perkins, Isabelle and Lemke probably saved the movie ten million dollars in special effects needed to otherwise make it work. Finally, it could have used just one totally dazzling scene showing Ginger's superhuman strength and speed.Yet, it's an awesome move. Personally a 10 star for me; for others, I give it an 8.",Ginger Snaps
145,andrewbarry6336,Looking for a great werewolf Movie? Look no further.,8,22 November 2013,I finally decided to review this unknown gem. First saw it in 2008 and watched it about 2 months ago so I decided to review it. So into the good stuff.This movie is as much about werewolf's as it is about teenage girls coming into age. The movie stars two sisters who are really outcast at school and like to pull horror gags on their family. One night they are out walking when the older sister gets attacked by some kind of beast and the rest of the movie is about her dealing with the transformation. I have to admit I was surprised how good this was for a movie and while the design of the wolf wasn't the best it wasn't bad. Also it was done practical and not CG for those it matters to.There is more but I will not ruin the movie. If you are looking for a good horror flick this one is slow building but keeps things really interesting throughout. They did a sequel and prequel which both are equally good so check those out after watching this one. Overall a 4 outta 5.,Ginger Snaps
146,darkcybergeek,"Original, smart and very entertaining horror/werewolf flick",9,2 June 2005,"Ginger snaps was for me the best werewolf flick I've seen in a while. I mean it was very different than most werewolf horror movies, it wasn't just smart and original but it was also very entertaining, I didn't got bored once. The performances were very good, the two girls were very believable as well as everybody else that worked in this movie. I love the story and the relationship of the girls was simply very well done, you got into the world of this 2 girls. The characters were very well develop and you cared for this girls and relate to them in some way (i relate more to Bridgitte). There were some really funny moments as well as gory ones. The monster design was really cool, it wasn't really scary but i liked it. The atmosphere is one of the things i really like a lot, i mean you cant go wrong with a movie set in the winter. The credits scene at the beginning was one of the things of the movie i found more original, i mean its not everyday that the credits are very entertaining. In here they were just so sick and you could truly see that this girls were just nuts lol, i mean who could be obsessed with death? or suicide. The ending felt too long though and felt that it was unnecessary, it was just a typical chase scene, it was fun still. But overall i really did enjoy this movie a lot! Its one of my favorite horror/werewolf movies I've seen in a while, and i really don't like werewolf movies that much.",Ginger Snaps
147,TrickyTheHorrorFreak,An intelligent and unique werewolf flick. Who would have thought?,8,14 September 2006,"""Ginger Snaps"" is a low budget werewolf flick from Canada but that statement hardly does it justice. What we have here is one of the most intelligent horror flicks that have been produced in recent times. What it lacks in special effects it more than makes up for with superb writing and a cast that's capable of making it all come together.Ginger and Brigitte are teenage sisters that are struggling through the very awkward years of puberty. They help each other through all the confusion and trials by imagining morbid fantasies of their own suicides and making pacts that they will stay together forever whether living or dead. But things become far more taxing when Ginger is bitten by a werewolf and starts to turn. Her pubescent changes are now exacerbated by her gradual transformation into a lycanthrope. With her growing power comes a previously unknown popularity at her school that separates her from Brigitte along with her concern and help.The choice to combine both feminine pubescence and lycanthropy is pure genius. ""They don't call it the curse for nothing"" is the tag-line of the film and really displays this films split themes. It's both a story about growing up and a horror yarn based on werewolf mythology. The cast are simply fabulous! Emily Perkins' Brigitte suitably appears insecure and apprehensive about life in general. Her character struggles to look people in the eyes and has an almost pathetic look that she cowers behind. Katharine Isabelle is also awesome as Ginger. She oozes both adolescent nonchalance and sexual energy throughout the film. I found myself laughing hysterically several times throughout due to her morbid one-liners and looks of disgust at the world around her. While her transformation into a deadly beast may have been a difficult one as an actress, she pulled it off beautifully, remaining both expressive and sexy in equal doses. The other actress that deserves a mention is Mimi Rogers, not simply due to her being the most well-known of the cast, but due to her role as the sisters' mother. She portrays an extremely caring mother that's totally detached from the reality of her children. It's a demanding role and she performs admirably.""Ginger Snaps"" is almost totally devoid of clichés and manages to be both very funny and quite horrifying at times. It's not all that gory (although dogs do not fair well in this film), but it is a little bit disturbing in its use of violence and teenage struggles in tandem. For such a low budget movie I think the special effects are really very good, yet those used to Hollywood blockbusters should not go in expecting too much. The transformation effects are fantastic, yet the actual werewolves once completed are rather fake looking. But I'm willing to accept that due to the unique qualities of this film and find it to be thoroughly entertaining as a film that traverses several genres. Check it out if you haven't already.",Ginger Snaps
148,SenoritaTorres,'Out by sixteen or dead in this scene. But together forever.' The best teen horror film since Carrie.,9,27 February 2007,"I only heard about the Ginger Snaps movies last year, so I went out and bought the first film and watched it. I have to say I was impressed. It's not often you watch a horror film that is as intelligent, witty and stylish as this one.Ginger (Katherine Isabelle) and Brigette (Emily Perkins) are sisters, outcasts and soulmates. They are obsessed with death and hate their boring existence in Bailey Downs. They even have a special pact to die with each other and be 'together forever.' Then Ginger gets bitten by a werewolf and things begin to change.I found it interesting in this film that at the time Ginger was bitten by the werewolf she was experiencing her very first period at Age 16. She's obviously a late developer and also very uninterested in understanding her menstrual cycle. She mocks her mother's enthusiasm and sees her first period as a 'curse'.One other thing I have to point out is Emily Perkins' performance in this film. She simply has to react to what happens to Ginger and Perkins did a wonderful job-she was playing the sidekick as such but in turn came into her own and ended up taking centre stage for a lot of the film, teaming up with loner older guy Sam and desperately trying to find a cure for her changing sister. Brigette's only problem is that Ginger seems to enjoy the fact she's quickly becoming a wolf-killing people, feeding off them, becoming sexually aggressive with men (and also turning them into werewolves), and Brigette doesn't know how to stop her because no one else knows Ginger's secret. People are getting hurt or killed and Brigette is desperately trying to put a stop to Ginger's killing spree. Perkins is amazing. Brigette comes across as painfully shy and living in her older sister's shadow but of course when Ginger starts to lose control it is up to Brigette to help her-before it's too late.Isabelle and Perkins are wonderful together-they put you right there in the action and you see them as sisters-both hating the world and wanting to escape it, together. The werewolf bite tears them apart (so to speak) and they are no longer as close as they once were because Ginger is clearly hurt that Brigette won't embrace the curse and join her. When she finally does it is both tragic and heart-rending-making you realise that Brigette never really saw any other alternative because, in reality, Ginger is all she had in the world.This film is a dark comedy with brilliant performances all round, particularly from Mimi Rogers as the concerned yet somewhat drippy mother. Fantastic special effects and werewolf make up which make Ginger's eventual full transformation into wolf so much fun to watch.Ginger Snaps is a definite one to watch. Nine out of Ten.",Ginger Snaps

It's a shame he came to such a bloody end.Overall i'd tell people to not only rent this movie, but buy it because it is so good you'll want to watch it again and again.

Well, maybe the producers think that such a movie just cannot have a happy end - but I - and I guess many more people - disagree. The solution was at hand, and having the protagonist killed in the end is an extreme disappointment. Why? Because all Brigitte would have had to do is to stab Ginger with the syringe instead of the knife.
This disappointment almost destroys the whole movie. If it had ended the way I mentioned it, I would have not the slightest problem of placing it into my list of ""10 best movies ever"". But know it just keeps the bad aftertaste of a passed chance.Therefore my advise: enjoy this movie until the final scene where Brigitte fights the Ginger-Werewolf - and shut off the tape/DVD and pretend that it *could* work out in a good way. That will make you feel much better and it will make you think about this masterpiece in a different way.So, for me it is a 9/10, because of the spoiled ending.

All of the scenes are very dark and grim, there's a lot of blood and guts and a whole lot of tension. It touches the delicate issues which come along with being a teenager and does so in a very bold way - it really doesn't leave any room for interpretation.The neighbourhood the girls live in is sort of restricted, it gives the viewer an idea of isolation. It's the kind of place where everybody knows everybody, so the gruesome deeds that start to happen seem even more serious.The acting is good and professional, it's not underdone nor is it exaggerated. Not to mention the characters themselves - the slovenly appearance of Brigitte gives a very distinct view of the girl's shy character. Ginger, on the other hand, is more Gothic, in a dark sexy way and it's very clear how Brigitte looks up to her older sister. So the movie doesn't only bring about a moral dilemma (and trust me, the movie presents plenty of those), but also sort of analyses the relationship between two sisters.Though it has a few mistakes and comes across a bit raw at some points, the movie in general is still really enjoyable.",Ginger Snaps
154,H-Volke,Outstanding cast!,9,30 January 2004,"One of my favorite horror movies. It has two subjects underlying it, and it manages to deal with them without playing to the gallery. First of all, it deals with sexuality and the coming of age. The combination between the first period and her turning into a werewolf is a great idea showing disturbing feelings about one's own body. The second subject is treated as well: exclusion, and the fear of being alone. Both sisters have spent a great deal of their time together, and, as both are outsiders, the older sister protects the younger one. When Ginger is bitten, her sister slowly comes to grip with the alterations Ginger's body is going through, but the process of separating from the beloved sister is difficult. At the end, we see Ginger (as a werewolf)lying to die on the floor, with her sister crying on her chest. These final shots are maybe the greatest of the whole movie: they show the beginning of adulthood for Ginger's sister. Great movie, great acting performances, keeping into account the small budget spent on this movie. Worth a look.",Ginger Snaps

I especially like the scenes in the woods while Ginger is being attacked, the savagery of the beast. It's hard to find a film with such good characters that deliver so much truth and feeling behind the words, and that's what all of the cast did. The blood-amount is to die for, it's quite rare to find THAT much blood in a violent film, even IN werewolf films, namely Dog Soldiers and The Howling.

The new take on the traditional story is refreshing and the chemistry between Perkins and Isabelle presents us with some first rate screen moments.  As most effective monster movies do, the beast remains hidden for the majority of the film. The weakness here is the supporting cast.  As a whole, they were bland and very forgettable.  However, Perkins and Isabelle will keep your attention glued to them so forgetting everyone else is not a great loss.",Ginger Snaps
157,JP_Shay,An underrated horror/comedy gem,9,4 November 2015,"I just finished watching this very underrated gem. A good, solid horror/comedy flick with great acting from Katherine Isabelle and Emily Perkins. It's a werewolf picture that instead of steering away from most of the clichés, reinvents them. But it's more than a werewolf picture; it's a movie about a bond between two young sisters who are obsessed with gore and how far little sister is willing to go to save big sister. Ginger is attacked by a lycan on their drive home and immediately starts noticing physical changes. The funny thing is everyone else is blaming her changes on her period. At times it seemed like an episode of ""Goosebumps"" (crooked camera angles, some overacting, etc.), and not in a necessarily bad way. This is probably because it was the director, John Fawcett's first full length picture. But overall, it was a very entertaining and fun film that really makes you care about the characters - at least it did for me! And there are some genuinely creepy moments.",Ginger Snaps
158,The Fuzz,"If Ginger Snaps was a person, I would want to punch it for the rest of my life",2,4 August 2001,"I hated this film, absolutely hated it.  I hated it because, in no particular order, of its pretensions to be saying something profound and original about teenage girls, because of its reliance on the most patronizing cliches when trying to 'establish' 'character', because of its godawful and unrelenting US high-school lingo (satirical? lazy, more like), because of the way it sloshed out gore by the gallon but not once, not even for a second, delivered one of your actual scares, because of the director's copping out of trying to generate any tension or excitement in the action scenes in favour of noise and frenzied cutting where it's absolutely impossible to make out what's going on, because of the waste of two clearly talented young actresses, and because of the idea that in the end, after all the sneering and attitude and posturing, it turned out that it was expecting us to find it all terribly moving.  But what got to me most of all, what really annoyed, was its crippling determination, exemplified in the opening minute when a woman's horror over the death of her dog is played for laughs, to be, above all else, 'cool' - not fun or exciting or intelligent or witty or wise, but 'cool', that indefinable and much-prized quality which - and could all would-be 'cool' auteurs please pay attention here - is not the artist's to assume but is the in gift of posterity.Good points?  All right: the two leads, handsome photography, the credit sequence, that line about ""there's something wrong, I mean apart from you being female.""

159,Dianafan79,Finally A Great WereWolf Movie - About Time!,7,23 June 2007,"Having watched 'An American Werewolf in London' last night I was stuck thinking when the last really decent werewolf film was made. At the time I thought that there were none since John Landis's film of perfection. The only film that initially sprung to mind was Wes Craven's 'Cursed', which is a heap of rubbish.Then while scanning through my DVD collection I remembered Ginger Snaps and what a great film it was. This time the film has females as the main characters. Usually in these types of films the lead is a male (just like An American Werewolf in London'.I loved how the girls were outcasts in their social groups long before Ginger was bitten by a werewolf on the night of her first period. THe two sisters are close and when Ginger starts to grow excessive body hair and is having mood swings Bridgette has to try and figure out a way to save her sister from the beast that is growing inside her.It's a really cool, dark and at times darkly funny film. THe acting and special effects are cool. It's just a shame here in the UK that it's only ever played on the Sci-Fi channel. I think it deserves at least a occasional airing on SKY MOVIES or something.I have to say, though, I was hugely disappointed in the films sequels.

168,pervocrat,Semi-original but vastly over-hyped teen horror schlock,4,3 July 2017,"It's possible I'm biased, but I've never managed to make it all the way through this movie in one sitting. I just get so bored. Ginger Snaps is often feted as a smart, slick, witty teen drama/horror/comedy hybrid, using werewolf movie tropes as a metaphor for puberty, loss of innocence, and a character study of two sisters growing apart. It does have some snappy lines and genuinely funny moments, such as Brigitte (Emily Perkins) and Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) consulting the supermarket's 'feminine hygiene' aisle as Ginger's lycanthropic changes blur with the clunky plot point of her first period, but for me those are also the scenes that highlight the movie's weakness.For my taste, the preoccupation with Ginger's burgeoning womanhood - her menstruation, her 'wolfishness' portrayed through aggressive sexuality (including flipping the roles on a pushy boy who has the nerve to ask her ""who's the guy here?"" shortly before she pins him down and bites through his chest), pleasure- seeking, and short-tempered moodiness - are a set of clichés that never feel as clever or deep as they seem to think they are. The scene in which Ginger compares blood lust to the joy of masturbation never fails to make me cringe. It doesn't help that writer/co-story writer Karen Fawcett's dialogue sounds less like genuine teen-speak than the esprit d'escalier of a 35 year old remembering high school. Maybe it's because Brigitte and Ginger are so hard to identify with, being cast so firmly as outsiders from the start, with their shared obsession with death, a la Harold and Maude. Emily Perkins' performance - swaddled in baggy clothes, and hiding behind a forest of uncombed hair - is whole- heartedly committed to a vision of teen awkwardness, but the excessive wild-eyed staring overwhelms any sense of nuance or character development which could have brought the story some genuine depth in its first two thirds, and adds to the feeling of playing scenes for laughs instead of balancing dark humour with real emotion.The movie's practical effects are unusual, and I don't have a problem with that, though it seems to put off a lot of horror fans, and the lycanthropy is not the conventional kind. Most of the liberally splattered gore scenes are effected with high speed cuts and crunchy sound effects rather than a more psychological approach, which feels like an odd choice given the movie's attempts at locating itself so firmly inside the sisters' shared bond. Ultimately, Ginger Snaps may be many people's idea of a sharply comic modern(ish) take on horror movies - and particularly the role of women in horror - and if it speaks to you like that then great; such is the power of representation in movies. Unfortunately, for me it feels severely dated, clunky, and unrelatable, and it's easy to see the excitement about the movie as chronic over-hyping. If you go in expecting a teen drama with naked-molerat-werewolves and a somewhat second-wave feminist message, you might be pleasantly surprised, but if you remember the 90s trope of being too cool to take anything seriously and found it annoying then, you may want to give this movie a wide berth.Maybe there'll be a reboot one of these days to smooth off the rough edges from a potentially promising idea?",Ginger Snaps
169,sdonovan-2,Girl werewolf chick flick,6,28 November 2001,"I was recently forced to watch this by a friend who absolutely loves it. Although I thought the film was OK, it didn't deserve the rave reviews my friend gave it. I do admire the fact that it's a distinct take on the distinct werewolf story, cleverly tying the lunar cycle in with a girl's period cycle, but to be honest, it was a bit boring. The scares were unscary, the special effects were a little on the cheap side, and some of the secondary actors were just poor (the guy who played Jason came from the Porky's school of acting). Amongst the plusses was the lead who was convincingly wacko and threatening and Mimi Rogers was wonderfully weird in it.Although I wouldn't watch this film again by choice I am glad my mate forced me to watch it. It made me realise how lucky I am that I don't have to go through periods.",Ginger Snaps

Ginger is 16 and Brigitte 15. One night Ginger gets bitten by a werewolf and slowly turns into one herself. I cant bring it into comparison with any other movie because its a special movie and you will see a movie like this only 1 time. The sisters relationship was so deep and powerful maybe because Katharine and Emily know each other in real life for some time to. Katharine did her job just perfect like always.

Confused cameras and no clear pictures of the beast until late on lets your imagination run wild. It deals with the folklore surrounding Werewolves in a clever and considered manner. Great acting from the two girls particularly as well as the whole cast helped draw you in. Initially I dislike the two central character and wondered if I would care when things got going, but they manage to suck you right in to their situation. I'm sure writer/director Michael Fawcett has a big career ahead of him (probably in Hollywood where his talent can be watered down to suit mass marketing better).",Ginger Snaps

But this is unfair criticism - the creature in ""Ginger Snaps"" is at least as good as those we see in movies costing ten times as this small-scale Canadian feature.  And the acting is a treat - full marks for Emily Perkins and (especially) Katherine Isabelle, who are terrific as the screwed-up teeny-Goth sisters who run into Something wild and fangy one full-moon night.  The movie is stylish and - take note, Hollywood! - slyly intelligent. A real breath of fresh air, highly recommended.",Ginger Snaps
173,tarryrob,"Ginger Snaps"" A Howling Good TIme",9,10 November 2008,"""Ginger Snaps"" A Howling Good TIme *contains some minor plot spoilers* ""Ginger Snaps"" takes the old cautionary tale of Little Red Riding and turns it on its furry ear. Instead of Lon Chaney Jr. howling at the moon and chasing poor unsuspecting girls through the woods - enter the Fitzgerald sisters, Ginger and Brigitte (Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins) two slightly morbid, teenage sisters entering puberty who are about to experience ""the curse,"" and put a whole new humorous lycanthropic spin on the phrase ""that time of month."" Ginger has ""the bite"" put on her by a werewolf while walking through the woods with her sister. She then begins to experience ""the change"" much to the horror of her younger sister Brigitte. Ginger begins experiencing cramps, ill temper, hair in strange places, and a new found ""taste"" for boys much to the horror of Brigitte who must hide her sister's secret, clean up the mess, and find a way to help end the terrible curse before Ginger ""snaps"" again! ""Ginger Snaps"" is a horror at it's best. The film benefits greatly by a strong cast, particularly Perkins and Isabelle as the Fitzgerald sisters, Kris Lemche as a dope dealing, knight in shining armor/love interest, and Mimi Rogers  who is a real hoot playing a well meaning but ineffectual ""Beaver Cleaver"" house mom trying to help her teenage daughters deal with the trials of puberty.Though Karen Walton and John Fawcett's script was written tongue in cheek  the film has many genuinely horrific moments. There is more than enough blood, gore and entrails here to keep any bonafide horror fan happy. That being said, because the film had a limited budget, it relies primarily on acting, atmosphere and suspense building to deliver the scares  probably a plus rather than a minus. Our lycanthrope is seen only in glimpses a la ""Alien"" until near the end of the film. Thankfully, the special effects it does employ are innovative and well done.Director John Hawcett does a fine job creating a dark chilling atmosphere. He moves the plot at a good pace, deftly interweaving moments of horror and humour. Though the scares come fast and frequent, Fawcett wisely takes the time to give us glimpses into the amusingly macabre life and relationships of the Fitzgerald sisters. Their situation may be fantastic and comic, but the Fitzgeralds, though misfits, are in many ways average teens, dealing with everyday teenage problems (problems with parents, teachers, peers, bullies, boys, etc.) and thus draw empathy from the audience. The gritty dialogue and snapshots of high school life help to underline this realism and contribute to the viewer's willing suspension of disbelief.The only place where I felt the film didn't quite work was the ending where the I won't go into any in depth criticism and spoil it for those who haven't seen the film, but suffice it to say that I suspect the reason for this may have been that it was written with a sequel in mind (""Ginger Snaps"" ultimately became a trilogy).Despite this,""Ginger Snaps"" is still the most innovative horrifying piece of lycanthropic lunacy to come down the pike in decades. I highly recommend it to fans of the genre. ""Ginger Snaps"" is a howling good time! Rob Rheubottom Winnipeg, MB Canada",Ginger Snaps
174,thatsarappp,Umm...No.,3,24 September 2009,"Once again, I was drawn to a film I hated in the past, but figured I'd give another chance, now that I have evolved very much as a movie watcher. Actually, the main reason I decided to give it another chance was the ridiculously high rating it has for a horror film (And more specifically a werewolf film). I thought, ""There has to be SOMETHING to it""...Well, there isn't. I'll say it flat out, this is among the most overrated films of all time.First of all, I don't understand what is so smart or clever about using puberty hand in hand with werewolf transformation, or as some kind of metaphor. The concept, like the film itself, is lame.Second, the film is one sequence of absurdity after another. Really, a collection of completely ludicrous and unrealistic situations. For instance, slaughtering a girl in your kitchen, and somehow pulling off hiding her in a freezer in a matter of seconds, which is presumably the amount of time elapsed between them hearing their parents arriving home, and their parents actually making it to the kitchen. Add to that the fact that she was frozen solid in a matter of no more than a few hours (And that is a stretch), AND the fact that they managed to somehow pry her out with a screwdriver, and it's getting laughable now. There was also a scene in which they murdered a guidance counselor in the middle of the day, and somehow no one seemed to notice. I guess a bloody mess in a school office is more easily overlooked than it would have been in my school days. Who knew? Those are just two examples...That was the theme of the film. Absurdity.There is no intense or somber atmosphere people speak of. It is drab and boring. Nothing special acting-wise either. Nothing holding my attention whatsoever.The one thing I will give it credit for is some pretty comical moments. The school nurse was especially priceless in her discussion of the female reproductive system, and even moreso in her facial expressions. The mother also had some gems of her own. But without a doubt the funniest moment was the one time you actually got to SEE a werewolf. I swear it resembled one of the goblins from Troll 2 more than a werewolf. I actually said out loud, ""Go back to Nilbog Ginger"". That moment at the very end of the film salvaged the 108 minute endeavor from being a complete waste, I suppose.In the end...6.9 is not just dumb, it's unjust, and bordering on offensive. I say this because there are legitimate horror films out there that have far lower ratings. FAR lower. I will NEVER understand what people see in this....On a side note, after reading the plot summary for the sequel (As I somehow own both), which in itself exceeds the comedy of the first, I have been suckered into watching THAT. That is on my agenda for tomorrow. We'll see how that plays out.",Ginger Snaps
175,msic,Howling mad... (mild spoilers),8,28 July 2001,"I had the good fortune to see GINGER SNAPS at a festival screening, and it's without a doubt one of the smartest, most emotionally complex teen films *or* horror films I've seen in ages. (In fact, only the South Korean film MEMENTO MORI comes to mind as being remotely in the same league.) I'll just reiterate what some of the other comments have said: excellent performances, especially the two leads; great writing, funny without being drenched in irony; a keen, original visual style, until the not-so-impressive latex werewolf shows up in the finale.GINGER SNAPS compares with Joss Whedon's work on BUFFY, of which I'm a great fan. It isn't easy to take horror-film tropes and scenarios and invest them with sincere and complicated emotions.The most horrifying thing of all is that this film looks like it isn't going to get picked up for distribution in the States. Why? Well, maybe because nobody here is smart enough to figure out how to market it. (Not teensploitation, not a parody, sort of an art film, sort of not... Let's just throw the masses some more crap like FINAL DESTINATION.) Or, some critics have conjectured that U.S. distributors are too squeamish to promote a film about misfit teens and violence, for fear of backlash following Columbine. With this kind of narrow thinking, U.S. audiences will be treated to films which are ""offensive"" only because they're so poorly made.A film as fresh and original as GINGER SNAPS deserves to be seen by U.S. audiences. The fact that this may not happen makes me howling mad.",Ginger Snaps

It's about creepy and scary were wolves. This movie is so good that they made 2 sequels to this hott film. It is one of my most favorite movies of all time.

178,kanda81,"Ah, the problems of youth. As good a story as The Fly...",8,26 April 2004,"Greetings...Rated: 8/10 Excellent!Not since Alien has a monster movie made me ""Scared"".Simply said - This movie is a fantastic monster movie.Monster movies, for the most part, are cliched formula flicks that follow certain rules of engagment.  Ginger Snaps, breaks all the rules, in the right ways, and gives surprises and twists, mixing the terrible night terrors and the mundane teenage life is hell attitude, into a completely entertaining and refreshing scary movie that does it's job, and does it well!  Artisticly and masterfully mixing in just the right amount of campy humor, teenage nudity, peer abuse, sneering teenage angst, and sheer mind numbing stark raving terror.  Toss in a dash of emotionalism, titulation, a few tear jerking touching scenes, then SLAMS you back on the meat table with the blood gore and guts flying! Very well done...   And that's difficult to do well.I generally rate movies on ""predictability"" - Ginger Snaps is NOT predictable.  It is a refreshingly unique WereWolfe tale.>>><<<  !!! =-( SPOILER WARNING )-= !!! >>><<<At the end of the movie, when Ginger is stalking her sister in the celler, after making a meal of the doper science hack, I was fully prepared for MOM to come down the stairs and reveal that she was the Queen WereWolfe and say something like ""Oh you girls, Ginger stop knawing on your sister's leg!"" I thought I had it figured out!All the classic Monster movie clues are there! Mom keeps a stock of the ONLY flower that can make the secret elixyr that cures the lycanthropic deseise, MOM discovers the body of the neigbor girl and is willing to cover it up, to burn down the house and ditch dad at a whim! MOM says the magic prophetic words ""Just We Girls""... But NO!!! Ginger is Killed!?!?!  But she has 2 more movies to do!  How could she be killed?Like The Fly (the remake) it's a tragedy story where every one dies, or wishes they had.  This is one of those few monster movies, that ISN'T an insult to your intelligence, or your common sense.  It is true Gothic Horror mixed with a psychotic decent into madness.However, There ARE a few nitpicking mistakes that could have been handled better:Using Isopropyl Alchohol as a base liquid for an injection is a VERY bad idea and is INSTANTLY lethal...They didn't include the standard Disclaimer line:  ""We can't go to the authorities, because they will never believe us, and they will think we are crazy""  It is just assumed...The low budget is plain, the monster is a bit comic in it's movements, and doesn't express well.  It's obviously a latex animatronic or low cost digitizing to look that bad.  There were a couple of scenes, where an expressive ""Ginger-Wolfe"" would have played very well. Especialy the finale scene when Bridgette kills her.  A potentially touching heart wrending scene was lost there because the animatronic couldn't show any pain, sorrow or sadness...",Ginger Snaps

After surviving the fatal attack ginger starts changing in weird ways like growing hair over her wounds and later growing a tail followed by fangs. Everyday Ginger starts changing and her sister Brigitte has to find a cure to end this werewolf thing or it'll be too late to save her sister.

If you love werewolf movies with gore and thrills then this movie is the movie for you i don't want to spoil the whole movie but you have to buy it or even rent it i actually own the whole Ginger Snaps trilogy and they are the best werewolf movies up to date.

My parents saw it, and said I was too young to see it yet. Sure enough, three years later, I ended up seeing the third one, and eventually got around to seeing this one, and the sequel. It was a little slower than the other two in my opinion, but was nonetheless a great movie.The beginning was very effective, seeing the mutilated dog in the doghouse. It really set the mood, and upon seeing the dog, I knew that it would be a somewhat gory movie. The beginning credits when we see all the pictures of the two sisters (Ginger and Brigitte) dead in different scenes was pretty weird, but I kind of liked it. It was darkly funny.Another good point was the acting. I thought that the two actresses that played Ginger and Brigitte were really great actors. They played the parts, in my opinion, perfectly. Brigitte was especially dark, and was played really well. It was kinda gross seeing Ginger transform (growing a tail, hair, what not?), but I thought it was a lot more realistic than other werewolf movies. It was really modern version of the classic werewolf myth (or not-so myth).Overall, this is one of the five best werewolf movies ever made, in my opinion.",Ginger Snaps

This movie was really cool, bloody, sad, funny, and overall entertaining. The script was very well written and the directing was also done very good.If you want to see a really good horror movie, unlike most recent ones to hit theaters, then rent this movie, you wont be disapointed.

184,TheVern,* * * * Most creative werewolf movie ever.,10,11 January 2005,"GINGER SNAPS. * * * *Not only is ""Ginger Snaps"" one of the only great teen horror flicks ever made. It's also a great satire on the whole puberty process. This little gem from Canada was released four years ago, but it never caught on here in the states. ""Ginger Snaps"" follows Brigitte and Ginger Fitzgerald as two teenagers living in suburbia. They are bored, they don't fit in and while other girls are busy planning on getting the cute guy to ask them out. The Fitzgerald sisters are performing fake suicides for an art project. They are goth chicks, but their obsession with death is not used to become popular like it is today. They just don't want to grow up and conform like everyone else.One night while on their way to play a prank on a girl who attacked Brigitte. Ginger has her first period, which they both have named the curse.GINGER: Well, it's not contagious. At that moment a wild animal attacks Ginger and almost tears her apart. Brigitte gets her sister back home but discovers her scars are healing. That's not the only thing odd with Ginger. She has been ignoring her sister and has taken an interest in some of the boys, something that she would never do before the attack, and she is growing hair in places that shouldn't have hair. Brigitte's parents tell her that it's all a process of growing up and it's perfectly normal. But Ginger is anything but normal. Soon she is tearing apart animals from around the neighborhood and her so called normal sex drive is actually a desire to killGINGER: I get this ache and I thought it was for sex, but it's to tear everything into f*#king pieces.Ginger does have sex with only one guy but he ends up pissing blood and getting weird rashes on his faceBrigitte: You gave it to Jason. You had unprotected sex and you infected him.GINGER: Opps.Brigitte befriends Sam the local pot dealer and the two of them find out a way to use Wolfsbane plant to cure Ginger. I don't want to give away the ending but I will tell you that there are two more sequels.If this movie was a straight horror plot then it would be boring, but by adding the whole hormone subtext. It takes the transformation story that we see a million times into another level. I believe that both guys and girls can find compassion for both Ginger and Brigitte. We've all been like Ginger and wanted to break away from your siblings in order to meet new friends and we have all been like Brigitte and felt betrayed. Most horror films show stereotypical characters who are there to just get slaughtered, and even though some of those types are in this movie. They are not the main characters like they would be in other flicks. ""Ginger Snaps"" has to be the best werewolf horror film since ""American Werewolf In London"" and the effects are nicely done. It was wise of the film makers to not fully show you the wolf, but just little glances. Horror films like this one is rare. Only a select handful get the genre right and what works the most is good characters. I recently saw ""Open Water"" and the number one complaint is that I had no understanding of the two main characters so I didn't care if they lived or died. Ginger and Brigitte are two very unforgettable creations.",Ginger Snaps
185,dinsvin,the best werewolf ever!,10,6 April 2006,"GINGER SNAPS""Ginger Snaps"" the first movie of this  so far - trilogy is a breath of real fresh air. Even as a fan I have to admit that the 'werewolf' genre never had all that much to offer. There has only been a few fairly good ones and even fewer ones to go down in history as memorable. All that drew my attention to this flick was the DK cover and I only bought it 'cause it was a bargain. The best 10$ I spent in like years. The movie  to me - totally lacks flaws, it all just seems to come together perfectly. If you listen to the commentary track you will learn that the author of the story ( a woman - that in itself mostly goes ) loathes the horror genre all in all, never saw more then 10 minutes of any horror movie. Yet she came up with the best written werewolf-script in ages. The movie in itself is really good, a bit modest but that just underlines the purity of it's goal; to tell a good story. And isn't that what movies are all about! Must say, the plot is somewhat surprising, a teen-age movie flick turned bad, meaning that it actually has a storyline above superficial slash and kill. As usual I do not reveal too much, Landis in '81 did the the all-timer but this certainly shares the throne  king and queen you might say. And if nothing else, this definitely is an appetizer for the its successor. GINGER SNAPS  UNLEASHEDTHE ULTIMATE WEREWOLF-MOVIE! ABSOLUTELY AND UTTERLY GROUNDBREAKING! EMILY PERKINS FOR PRESIDENT! This movie pays no mind to the (unwritten) rules of the genre, what so ever. To me they proved themselves better already by simply killing off the 'hottie' sister in the first one! Hopefully they did so to make room for outstanding actress Emily Perkins ( the sister Brigitte, who survives the evil spell that was passed on to her by Ginger; Hottie Model Katharine Isabelle  and who's now trying to fight off the metamorphosis with the herbs ). Emily's appearances in both movies is rather disturbing. Her bodyweight is scary her bodyweight adds to her performance. She deserves recognition, an Oscar at least, she is the best actress I've seen in many years. Maybe because she doesn't remind me of anyone, but certainly because she is so good that I'm short of words big enough to praise her performance. And that was just to begin with! Then they pay the ultimate tribute to Patricia/Patty McCormack's incredible performance in the all time best thriller/suspense movie ""The Bad Seed"" from 1956. They do so by introducing Tatiana Maslany ( called Ghost ) who fascinates to such a degree that it is  again - hard to figure out why this movie didn't go straight to the top. Talk about perfection. If she can do this she is bound to fail Sucks to peak that early, doesn't it. Or did she peak? In the extra's you can watch the scenes with ""Ghost"" that were cut out, which  to me  proves that this is something rare; an intelligent and very carefully thought through production. To top it off they actually  so I imagine, referring to the successor  'stumbled' on to an ending so cool and surprising that it can actually compare itself to ""Sleepaway Camp"" ( Talking about the first one just in case you don't know it, it's the best camp/slasher trilogy ever made!) GINGER SNAPS BACKS  THE BEGINNINGWell, run of the mill. Not at all living up to anything! Personally; I'm waiting for the follow-up to ""Unleashed""!Not that it's a bad movie! Just it's a crowd-pleaser. Smells a bit like rip-off ( know what movie I'm thinking off, just can't remember the name, even have the trailer somewhere! ) and it ABSOLUTELY ruins the trilogy. But like so many times before I just write it off like it doesn't belong, and so should you! Sorry.",Ginger Snaps

Ginger (Isabelle) is 16 years old and very beautiful, despite her negative and reclusive attitude. Her 15 year old sister Brigitte (Perkins)is just the same. The girls are outcasts at their high school and share a bedroom in the basement of their home. 'Together forever' is the girl's childhood pact. while Ginger is tougher and more rebellious, Brigitte is more shy and a bookworm. Also, the girls share the same fascination with...dying. This macabre interest is nothing compared to what's about to happen. One night while walking through the woods, Ginger and Brigitte are viciously attacked by a mysterious creature. Ginger is seriously wounded by the beast and both of the girls narrowly escape. Although Gingers horrible wounds quickly heal, all is not as it seems. Ginger is changing. She becomes more socially active, abandoning a stunned and horrified Brigitte, Ginger begins hanging with the in-crowd. Her appearance changes too, silver hair begins growing from her scars and highlighting her red hair. She changes from gloomy to sexy. While the girls' mother sees the change as a positive one, Briggite knows that something is horribly wrong with her sister. As Ginger turns more and more into a aggressive seductress, Brigitte discovers that her sister is becoming a werewolf. Ginger denies this and continues her horrific transformation. As a full moon approaches, Brigitte races against the clock to save her sister from becoming a hideous beast. Will she succeed? Or fail and pay with her life?

The trials and tribulations of two teenage girls, deadset on remamining ignorant of life outside their morbid fantasy of what life is. Living in essence scares them. Death intrigues them.

The simple genius of tying in the whole menstrual-cycle myths regarding werewolves with puberty and teen isolation worked very well.The scary thing about this is, that even though I'm male, parts of this film very definitely cut too close to the bone, as it were, which always makes for an exciting film for me. The whole ""isolated teen called a freak by the rest of the school"" and social outcast thing rang too many bells, as did some of the scenes involving self-mutilation. I identified too well with all of that to be entirely comfortable. Uncomfortable is good, for this kind of film.It definitely has some Carriesque elements, though the torture and vengeance is rather more protracted. It also says a lot about neglect, in at least one of the scenes involving bullying, you start to realise why so many people believe that telling teachers about bullying solves nothing. (again, something I have personal experience of). Of course, these are all subtexts in what is a way-above-average werewolf flick, which doesn't fall back on the Hollywood cliches of silver bullets and the transforming man-beast).
On the whole, the monster effects are very good, although some of the makeup for the sections where she's still vaguely human seems to have come from the stuff used for the Vampires in the Buffy TV series.Only thing I would have liked to see is a little more resolution in the ending. Actually, could have made an interesting sequel.Its an excellent shocker, that has a cleverer message than the average.",Ginger Snaps
193,crackedimage,a loosely disguised coming of age tale,5,16 December 2003,"i recently watched this movie and felt it started off strong (morbid girls obsessed with death) but it soon became apparent that the whole story was preaching at its audience, being a tale secretly about puberty and growing up, and being a tender 18 myself i cant stand this stories. there are obvous metaphors everywhere (gingers transformation into wolf being about puberty, her boyfriend becoming infected being about STDs) and as the story continues with a feeling of being in a sex education class. i think the movie suffers from this (and also the fact that all teenage boys are shown as being sexually obsessed) but its still a good movie with a  very emotional ending",Ginger Snaps
194,kenziemay,Dark and delightful!!!,9,20 December 2013,"Ginger Snaps has been a favourite of mine for a long time! Just as I was about to turn off the TV at around 3AM one night, Ginger Snaps was beginning and I wasn't intending on watching, but it had me glued from beginning to end. If it wasn't for that, I probably would not have ever known about this amazing film, which is sad because so many horror lovers out there have missed this one. With extremely strong language and brutal violence, it's not suitable for the youngins! Ginger(Katherine Isabell) and Brigitt's (Emily Perkins) close knit relationship felt genuine. They were best friends, they were almost one. Their dark interests of death and dying really captured their desires and true feelings of how they viewed life. Sure, it is disturbing, but what good horror movie isn't? I loved the atmosphere throughout with a bit of a Halloween theme toward the end. Fantastic Canadian cast! The acting however was excellent from the entire cast except for Emily Perkins (Sorry, Em!) but it's true. I understand it was difficult for her to remain a depressed, shy loner (as she explained in an interview once) and it showed because her angry scenes felt forced and she ended up making hilarious facial expressions. I don't let that bother me and it does not wreck the film but I often wonder who else could have pulled off her part. All in all, the movie is highly engaging for a teen werewolf story, one of the best I've seen! See it. Buy it. Watch it a hundred times.",Ginger Snaps
195,jbmajzner-87228,Hazel says...2 stars,3,27 May 2016,"As taken from: http://www.beyondvalwood.com/#!A-review-of-the-movie- Ginger-Snaps/c218b/5744d7480cf29ab9ec2c8270Hello readers,It was a typical Monday night. Hazel and I were bored and playing the usual ""What would you like to do?"" game while I procrastinated on writing my sequel to Beyond the Veil, A Veil of Stars.""Do you want to watch a movie?"" Hazel barked at me.""Yes, but I want to watch something inspiring"", I said. ""Hey, maybe a werewolf movie, since I'm writing about werewolves!"" And so folks, this is how we came to watch Ginger Snaps on Hulu last night. And OMG, do I wish I hadn't. Of all the inspiring movies we could have filled our eyeballs with last night, I chose this horrifyingly bad flick and I want my hour and forty eight minutes back. Think of all the amazing, awe inspiring words that I could have written today that may have been inspired from watching an amazing, awe inspiring werewolf movie (do any of those exist?)...but no. Instead you get this review :PNumerous problems abound with Ginger Snaps, including characterization, pacing, special effects, and the writing itself. Katharine Isabelle as Ginger seems to be trying to hold this entire film together herself, while the other actors are clearly struggling with their parts (with perhaps the exception of Kris Lemche as Sam). This unintentionally funny/horror movie does not know what it wants to be, and it suffers for it with a title that does not match the tone of the film. Hazel, being easily entertained, bless the little dog, gave this film 2 stars. I was not so kind, so it only receives a measly one star from me. Harrumph.This film follows the lives of sisters Brigitte and Ginger as they stage their own deaths and go to school. Things quickly take a darker turn when Ginger swiftly approaches puberty (and by that I mean she starts spewing blood at very inconvenient times) on their way to prank a snotty, popular chick. A werewolf, smelling her menstrual blood, attacks and she is bitten. We follow her journey into lycanthropy (and this could not be any more boring if this film tried, which it clearly didn't). Emo, expressionless and uninteresting Brigitte skulks throughout the entire film as she tries to hide her sister's ""curse"" and cure her. When we finally do see Ginger in her most glorious werewolf form, I was disappointed to see that she quite resembled the love child between a bat and a pig. And while most of the film is lacking in sufficient action, the ending is so gratuitous that it quickly loses steam into its very fitting, but altogether unsatisfying conclusion.The puberty=werewolfiness angle was bad enough. But the biggest problem Hazel and I had with this movie was the suspension of belief. I don't mean that I had trouble believing werewolves were really pig/bat mutants, but none of the actors would be believable in any setting except for Ginger. If you were thrown into the eviscerated remains of a dog you would be horrified, not merely humiliated and if you suspected your daughter of murder, you would not simply ""light a match in the house, forget your husband, and start a new life with your kids!"" It was moments like these, AKA bad writing, that pulled Hazel and I out of the story and prevented us from fully enjoying what I believe was a good story buried in the rubble. Somewhere.Now Hazel was not nearly as harsh on this movie as I was. The acting is alright, the cinematography solid, if not a bit bland, and the gradual transformation of Ginger was well done, if not a bit tedious. The adjusted score for this film is 1.5 stars.",Ginger Snaps
196,uberman5000,A tough-as-nails werewolf movie that every lycanthrope fan needs to see!,9,21 April 2006,"15-year-old Ginger and Brigitte ""B"" Fitzgerald are going outside to do a school project, where they photograph themselves impaled on white picket fences, with rakes in their backs, daggers through their chests, run over by cars... yes, Ginger and B are fascinated by death. They resent their spic-and-span suburban life (their sugary-sick mother doesn't help matters) and have a strong sisterly bond. They have an oath that they hold sacred and defines the movie's essence: ""Out by sixteen or dead in this scene, but together forever. United against life as we know it."" As Goths tend to go, they're teased relentlessly in school by preppy cheerleaders, Trina in particular. They want to kill her dog to get back at her, but it seems someone beat them to it, and they quickly and painfully find out it was actually ""something"".Ginger is ravaged by some wild animal. B beats him off with a bat and they run away. We see the animal caught in the headlights for a split second. It's a sickly brown thing with a manlike shape walking on all fours, but it is also wolf-like with its long muzzle, bony tail and patchy coat of tangled fur. It's then run over by the local drug dealer, Sam. It begins.Ginger's severe wounds heal overnight and she starts bleeding out of her crotch. That's her body trying to remove toxic werewolf blood, but everyone thinks she's having her first period, so they visit the school nurse who cheerfully presents them with condoms and advises ""Play safe!"" This is the underlying theme that differentiates Ginger Snaps from other werewolf films: lycanthropy becomes a metaphor for puberty and teenage independence. When it begins, this point is humorously forced when Ginger awkwardly goes to buy tampons (which conveniently come with a calendar that says when the next full moon is), but soon it becomes cleverly integrated into the movie: Ginger's body and personality begin to change, she starts to grow a tail, which she takes pretty lightly (B has to tape it down for her when she plays field hockey), she starts indulging in more exhilarating thrills (from getting a belly button piercing early on in her transformation to eating a guidance counselor near the end), and she has violent unprotected sex, infecting a guy with her lycanthropy. Her wild side is taking over. This might be because of the lycanthropy, it might not be.But of course there will be room for the horrors of a werewolf fable. After Trina nearly gets killed in a field hockey game, she goes to attack Ginger, but she ends up stabbing herself accidentally in Ginger's kitchen, so they hide her body in the deep freezer. They lose one of her fingers in the yard, but Mrs. Fitzgerald think its just for one of their ""death projects"". The guy that Ginger infected is also feeling the symptoms, too: growing a tail, becoming more violent and temperamental, urinating blood.Yes, this is a dark film in every sense of the word. It's not a campy werewolf movie like An American Werewolf in London, it's not an action special effects demonstration like The Howling; it's a bitter, ruthless, no-holds-barred horror. Ginger may just be a good-looking rubber werewolf suit by the end of the movie, but that's another difference between this werewolf movie and any other ones: Ginger's transformation is gradual rather than sudden and immediate; thanks to convincing makeup, twisted behaviour, and Ginger's openness and musing about killing things, we don't believe that that's a rubber werewolf suit, we believe that's the werewolf Ginger has been turning into.But the film never loses sight of its underlying tone: Ginger and B are still sisters that care about each other, but they have differences about their pact. Ginger wants to infect B so that they can be together as lycanthropes forever, but B thinks Ginger's lycanthropy/puberty is forcing them apart, and she doesn't want their togetherness to come at the cost of blood. Right up until the last shot, though, the movie never descends into mayhem; the Fitzgerald sisters make certain that it doesn't need it. They're out by sixteen or dead in this scene, but together forever.",Ginger Snaps

Now, I know that really doesn't say that much, but it's better than American Werewolf in London, and that says a LOT.  Besides being the all time best werewolf movie, its also imo the best indie movie of any genre in years (Memento? What about it?)!  This movie ranks right up there with Bad Taste, Evil Dead, and Dead Alive as far as horror movies go.  The cast was perfect (Ginger is... delicious).  The humor is absolutely black as night, and so I fear not everyone will get it all.  Repeated viewings will bring it out tho, have no fear.  I swear, I wish the sisters were real so I could talk to them. Finally, when was the last time a horror movie was so well-written and acted that the uber-sad ending brings forth tears?  18 year old males do not cry because of movies, and certainly not _horror_ movies.

Bridget (played to perfection by Emily Perkins) is the intelligent, insecure younger sister, trying to figure out how to put an end to some truly horrifying changes which her sister, Ginger (the lovely & talented Katherine Isabelle), are going through.  Along the way, there is plenty of black humor and gore.  Mimi Rodgers is ... Another reviewer referred to her as a ""housewife on acid"" ... That's about the best description I've heard or can come up with.  The final fade-out does leave you wondering what happens when Mom gets home.

203,katieholmes30,The best horror film i've ever seen!! also my favorite movie ever now,10,19 June 2002,"well, I have alot to say about this film, but its all positive though. when i first saw this film in theaters, i was totally blown away by its story and originality! i came out of the theater with my friends and we were totally psyched!! Ginger Snaps is the first good horror movie to come in a very long time! it definitely beats all of hollywoods new crap...it is a film with incredible potential.God, i absolutely love this film!! its my fave ever!! when i made my huge party, we watched Ginger Snaps on DVD, and not the crappy U.S. version either, and everyone at the party loved it!! the film has very hilarious dark humour and is also very scary. i jumped many times while watching the film.my friends did also! the special effects and sound in the movie are incredible!! this film kicks ass and it shows everyone, including hollywood, that you don't need CG to make a good film. the werewolf was made of latex and looked amazing. i don't understand how some people can say that this film was no good. most of them say that because they think that the effects were crappy. well, if those people are definitely the type that only look for special effects. well, that should not change just how great this film is. its the story and characters that matter, not the effects. like i said before, the actors in the film were at their best. especially the two leads, who have amazing talent. they are two canadian actresses to watch for, especially the beautiful katharine isabelle. anyhow, i don't want to write a big review because i don't want to spoil the film, which is really worth watching. this is my little review. the film is about two sisters, Ginger and Brigitte, who share an incredible but odd relation ship. they are obscessed with death..one night they go out to play a prank on one of the students of the school, trina sinclair, to get even. on that night, Ginger is having her first period. as you've guessed it, she is attacked by the so called ""beast of bailey downs""(the dog killer). after that night, Ginger starts changing. she becomes more sexual,starts growing pointy teeth, hair in strange plaves and long wolf-like nails. as the movie progresses, brigitte starts to notice more and more the changes in her sister. she starts to notice that there is something very wrong with her. she goes to see sam, a cute drug dealer, for help. he tells her that the possible cure to Ginger's infection is a plant called monkshood. brigitte first tries it on Ginger's infected boyfriend and discovers that it works. near the end of the film, there's a party at the county greenhouse and brigitte goes to fing her sister. when she finds Ginger, she seems to be transforming more and more. she takes Ginger outside to bring her home so that she can give her the monkshood, but when outside, sam hits Ginger with a shovel. so, he outs Ginger in his truck and he drives brigitte and Ginger home. when they arrive, Ginger is fully transformed and busts out of the van and storms into the house. anyways, i'll stop there cause i don't want to spoil the whole surprise of this movie. i know i missed a lot of the important details of the film, but that's good cause i don't want to ruin the fun for you guys. so, to sum it up, Ginger Snaps is the best movie ever. i absolutely loved it and any horror film fan would too. i bought the canadian DVD which has great special features. i bought the soundtrack, which has great gothic music that goes very well along with the film.i even bought the united kingdom poster and put it on my wall, i have the canadian poster also, that i took at the video store when they took it off the wall.i'm just in love with this movie!!! its the best!!!  i recommend it to all of you!! Ginger Snaps gets a 10/10 from me!! go us canadians!",Ginger Snaps

Usually when I tivo movies I know nothing about I delete them after about 5 minutes, but this thing got me hooked from the start. The acting was superb and the story telling was mesmerizing. This serves as an effective art film, horror film, or drama. It somehow manages to feel like a classic horror film without getting stale or predictable. I'd highly recommend this to any fan of GOOD horror films, as this one blows away the garbage posing as horror films these days. I'd give this an 8 out of 10, which I consider pretty high for a horror film.",Ginger Snaps
205,evangilligan,"Ginger snaps, one the best horror films EVER!!!!!",9,16 March 2010,"Ginger snaps is one of the greatest horror films ever made even though it is low budget, with the great performances by both Emily Perkins as Brigitte Fitzgerald and perhaps one of the hottest Canadian werewolves ever Katharine Isabelle as Ginger Fitzgerald. The phenomenal story of two sisters The Red and the Black, the red getting bitten by a werewolf and the other appearing dark, shy and morbidly disturbing. What this film really needs is nothing because it is properly one of the best Canadian films ever made even though that it is almost 11 years old it still makes a big statement for itself in the film industry and provides very big competition for any filmmaker that wishes to create a werewolf film.Ginger snaps is a truly legendary film, although if hot and very talented actresses like Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins were not in the movie then i properly would not think twice about seeing it. The characters are very well written, the very embarrassing yet funny dominant mother, the father who says virtually nothing all throughout the film, the depressive looking daughter and the very attractive but still very scary (in a hot way) redhead, creates the audiences understanding of the contents of this film.I even felt sorry for Ginger's boyfriend after they had slept together. (the bathroom scene, but it still was very funny) and half the audience that watched that scene still would say that it was worth it.So in conclusion I give this great and horrifically awesome movie 9/10",Ginger Snaps
206,Zombie_Vzla,"When nature calls, it rocks!",8,6 September 2003,"First of all, I must say I love horror movies since I was a kid. Today is really strange to find a good film, no matter the genre, but horror movies are specially a dangered species.But as in past time, low budget movies turn to be the best ones in this genre!, perhaps they care to make a really good movie and script by the cost of sacrifice the `Hollywood-shinny-and-many' special effects; the right choice.Well, this piece of art is a living proof of this. We see a social problematic sisters denying the `plastic and makeup' future expected for a grown woman (sadly is the truth), and they live under a bubble of admiration for death and isolation of the `so-called' normal world.So, you knew this a movie about werewolves?  Yeah! This is the best part. Under the scenery where those special girls live (a little town of cold, careless people), a big dog-eater monster is roaming and causing little havoc (most of the citizens really don't care). Finally the older sister ginger (Katharine Isabelle) hits the first of her `bloody' days (yes, the common nightmare of women once a month) and for bad luck she also has her encounter with the wolfie-thing.Her changes start to kick in, and the young one (Emily Perkins) has to find the cure for this strange phenomenon. Is there when the movie really starts: sister against sister, society against reality.The effects are simple but effective; the tension is made by the good acting of the girls (as it should be) and the indifference of the common folk. Good scares and a strangely deep criticism are the good punches of this not-for-kids price. Go and see it!",Ginger Snaps

To fight the curse of the wear wolf, two sisters (only one really wants to do it, the other is content being a wear wolf after a while.)have to trust a marijuana growing high school drop out. The heroes in this one don't even close to make you care about what happens. After a while, I kinda wanted to see the whiney girls die. But as I said, it has its good points.

208,clockworkstu,"Finally, A Werewolf Movie With Actual Bite!!",7,5 July 2005,"The genre of lycanthrope horror has been a limbo of cheap, dull, and even pretentious drivel up until now. Even compared to the likes of Dracula and Frankenstein, lets face it, The Wolf Man never quite cut it. With the onslaught of brainless teen horror that has bombarded our screens over the past few years one would expect that we would never again get a glimpse into the jaws of this Gothic fairytale. But lo and behold, another one!! I was sceptical, having been bored to tears by Joe Dante's over rated The Howling, I cringed at the Hollywood cheese of Jack Nicholson in Wolf. A teen Werewolf movie, from an independent director from Canada. Not, no prejudice intended, a country infamous for its cinematic masterpieces. However, and seldom will I admit this, I was amazed, this is an intelligent, witty black comedy brimming with social comment and intriguing characterisation. Katharine Isabelle is incredible as Ginger, exuding repulsive immaturity and sexual maturity in equal measures, challenging some of Hollywoods greatest femme fatales. Her portrayal is one laced with sardonic wit and a realisation that her character's situation is, in actuality, completely ridiculous. This is an important part of reversing psychology on an audience. If Ginger thinks its ridiculous, suddenly the audience is roped in. Her sister Bridget (Emily Perkins) is wonderfully mousy, naive, and maybe a little too imaginative. Perkins' performance is powerfully tortured and subtle. The commentary on real life these sisters portray is one that most depressed, outsider teenagers can empathise with. The director pushes the point that something very disturbing is happening in a very bland town. An approach used by Friedkin in The Exorcist, abnormal events happening to normal people. In recent horror the teens have been too beautiful, plucked and preened, picked off but ever looking glamorous, here Bridget and Ginger are plain, introvert, and even, some may say, ugly. It is refreshing to see that this is not only a good werewolf movie but a good movie in general. Itis accessible to mainstream without being passé, intelligent fodder for students and intellectuals to ponder on its many parallels between PMT,monstrosity, and sexually transmitted infections, and a witty, dry social study on hierarchy within schools and its shifts in power. See it now, the overall effect is hilarious, hip, and horrific. Three ingredients that blend perfectly!! Enjoy!!",Ginger Snaps
209,BlueDragon21120,Breath of Fresh Air,9,21 March 2005,"This film is a breath of fresh air when it comes to horror movies and werewolf films alike. With a unusual contrast of plot to violence that makes this film unique and allows you think about the characters in a whole new way. This film boasts more than just gore and outcasts, it gives a whole new perspective on the werewolf genre. The plot twists turning in to a werewolf a metaphor for puberty and changing from a simple outcast teenager in to not just someone expected to make there own way in the world, but a horrific monster. This films only major flaw is a few far fetched coincidences, the local drug dealer mixing a cure, the climax of the film is based around Halloween for no apparent reason.

An obscure and dramatic outcome of what puberty can do to you. Actually it can do more than that. It can turn you upside down and make you become something you don't necessarily be. But the times of change in a young person's life is always a brutal one. We all remember going thru phases we didn't know if the outcome would be anything pleasant or if it would destroy us forever. The things that hormones can create are pretty disturbing, the fantasies are going bezurk and you don't really wanna go where it take you. The film has good actors mainly because they act themselves which gives the picture a sense of reality. The story telling is really great. Suspenseful, unexpected, and surprising. Somewhat on the amateur side but that makes the film more realistic. It's not the typical Hollywood stuff and thus much more interesting to watch. I'd give it a 9/10.",Ginger Snaps

The director makes excellent use of Dutch angles, which I normally hate.
Ginger Snaps is, ostensibly, an allegory for puberty and growing up. It's not especially deep or subtle, but it works. The werewolf lore is similarly simple and effective; it's a disease, nothing more, whose side effects are similar to puberty.

There is a hysterical scene in a supermarket, towards the beginning, watch for it when you see it.The actress that played Bridget perfectly portrayed the geeky lost teenager in between girlhood and womanhood.  How many kids in high school did you know like that.It lost momentum in the last ten minutes though which was disappointing. The movie took so many unusual twists and turns until then but *spoiler* suffers from the most conventional ending.  It's as if the filmmakers ran out of ideas, which is a shame because what preceeded it was funny and tense.Overall I would say definitely worth your time, though it will probably take you about 15 minutes to get into the mood of the picture, so give it a chance when you first start watching it.",Ginger Snaps
217,colin_keltie,Mmmmm: bite me!,10,11 July 2001,"Now, I've liked horror movies for years, and recently I've been distressed at the plaudits given to the spate of ""post-modern, self-knowing, ironic comedy-horror"" nuggets such as Scream, I know what you did etc. etc. If you ask me, these movies cop out with laughs because they don't have the balls to make you shake, scream or jump.Imagine my pleasure and surprise then to come across ""Ginger Snaps"", which manages to be creepy, scary, sexy and wry without drowning in self-depracation or CGI. I think that this is a classic monster movie in the ""American Werewolf"" mould, with a neat teen post-feminist twist (well, everything's got to be post-something these days).Excellent performances from all cast, and a raft of subtexts to suit all palates. I particularly like the fact that this movie manages to be an OVERT gothic wet-dream without having to resort to crass teen tittilation. Wolf-girls rule the world!Highly recommended and I hope it does a bomb at the box office.",Ginger Snaps

The transfer is bad and loads of extras are left out. Check out the special edition DVD. Good writing, good acting and cheeky without going overboard.

Not sure how else to put it. -both Emily and Katherine do the ""freaking out"" thing magnificently. You'd think they were actually losing it at those moments.Very nice.

Put an outpost of traders under siege by were wolfs, add noble natives with clichéd mystical properties and you have... a Canadian hazardous waste site. I must credit Canadian writers, either they're very good or horrid. Since the the Hatchet based film ""A cry in the wild"" took a fall with ludicrous sequels have Canadian films started out so great only to end in drivel. While some thought may have been put into period costuming, absolutely none was put into period behaviors and speech. These girls are as 21st century as they come. The formidable Bridgette of Ginger Snaps 2 is abandoned to the whims of this exceptionally poorly conceived script. ""This place is f**ked"" is an example of the creative intelligence of writing. As fascinated as these girls are to watch, they can't carry this dud. The clichéd noble Indian is no less insulting than had they made his character do a war dance and ask for wampum. Absurdly ennobled and empowered, the native people become cartoons. At the same time an absurdly strict preacher, who seems to be out of pilgrim era Salem Mass, is intended to be ominous, he comes across more like a Phil Hartman Saturday Night live skit.

223,tylerjwood,Criminally underrated gem,9,2 November 2020,"20 years I've known about this movies existence and just never got around to watching it until now. What a fool I was to wait this long. The movie is not perfect, but it's truly something special.Katherine Isabel and Emily Perkins have such good chemistry as dark, suicide pact, goth teen sisters.
Ultimately it's a great dark story about the struggles of becoming a woman, and also becoming something a little more.. hairy. Some good laughs in it too.
The ending crushed me however.I really wanted Ginger to make it. I know if I had seen this movie around the time of it's release, when I was in high school, I would have had such a crush on her character. Now in my early 30's, I saw a lot my younger self in her and her sister (eccentric ""woe is me"" high school behavior), so it was a very sad ending for me. However, it adds to the film I believe. Makes me a proud Canadian to watch a movie like this. Wasn't expecting to be blown away by one of my Halloween-a-thon movie watches.",Ginger Snaps

I liked the lighting, which seems very natural and provides a superb ambience to the film, plus the direction and production design is solid as well.  Both Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle do a fine job as the two leads.

Character Developments are completely believable, there is not a line of cheesy dialogue, explanations and coincidences seem seemless. Great attention to detail is paid, props and make up are consistent even in very complex scenes that obviously take days, acting is very well done. This is an excellent piece of cinema period, it's Canadian also, which I'm a big fan of, it just happens to be a monster film.",Ginger Snaps

Ginger Snaps is absolutely one of the best horror movies of the year!!  Taking a twist on the well raked legend of the lycanthrope, this movie sets the standard for new horror movies to come.  Well done dialog, excellent acting, good special effects, and a great story, make this a classic.  Some may say that a Werewolf movie is only as good as its transformation scene...but this movie, with a low emphasis on the drastic transformation scene, blows the doors off of wolf movies of the past.  Not since American Werewolf in London have I witnessed such a modern master piece that blends spontaneity, dark humor, and originality that will stand the test of time.",Ginger Snaps

I found their attitude & razor edged reality of what it may feel like to be turned into a werewolf to be stimulating.

What happened to their father? he got eaten? or what? When they were preparing the antidote, why didn't she risk it and tried it on her sister first, instead on the guy that first got infected by making out with her, the movie could have continued with the guy killing everyone in the neighborhood while they tried to track him down and kill him or leave it a mystery some how, like some movies do. anyways, its just what i thought, but it wont kill to watch it anyways.",Ginger Snaps

When was the last time you saw lycanthropy equated with puberty. There were some original and really fun scenes throughout the movie as well as some of the standard schlock. I loved that Ginger was completely unapologetic about her violent outbursts and reveled in the fact that she was able to get so much pleasure from lashing out. I was truly amused as she faced the changes of her body with disgust and soon learned acceptance. This is the first lycanthropic coming of age stories I've ever seen and plan to watch it again soon.,Ginger Snaps

I plan to be a screenwriter and I LOVE writing scary movies so, I rented this one day and now I have every edition of it ever! I love this movie because it gave me such good ideas and is EXTREMELY original. I look at 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and 'Scream' and 'Halloween' and they're all pretty much the same.

It's rare to see a horror film that takes so much time developing its characters, but the sisters easily steal the show. I've never considered myself a fan of Mimi Rogers, but she does quite well as the girls' mother. That said, I think the werewolf in Ginger Snaps 2 is an improvement over Ginger's wolf in this film. I have seen all the GS movies, and this is the best in my opinion, though I did appreciate the darker atmosphere of the second. There aren't many werewolf movies out there, but this is an excellent addition to what few there are. I highly recommend this movie to all who are tired of clichéd, recycled slasher plot lines.",Ginger Snaps

It has enough gore to keep the gore people interested. It has a werewolf for monster-horror lovers. It even has a generous amount of oddball dark humor. One gets the sense that a lot of kids these days would pattern themselves after the girls in the films if this movie had seen a wider release (thank goodness it didn't see a wider release, eh?). Even if you don't look at this movie as teen horror, it's great. Probably even better that way, really. The love B has for her sister makes you want to weep.

This movie plays with a great array of emotions that range from fright to hilarity. The actors play well and really give this impression of jaded teenagers. As a Canadian I recognized that attitudes that you can find here and I think it is realistic. The places you can see in this movie are clearly Canadians. The special effects are neat, I actually saw worse in movies with higher budget.Technically this movie have very few flaws and is actually well done.I highly recommend this movie",Ginger Snaps

What is does do effectively is create a bond between sisters that is truly tested right to the end of the film. It is funny and genuinely pulls you in to a dark place. It has plenty of gore even though some of the special effects are not up todays standards, but that aside it has plenty of blood spilling . It gives you a look into the dark side of teenagers and how we all don't fit into what society deems normal. If you haven't seen it yet , please give it a go . I watched it on cable late one night not knowing what it was about , and now it one of those i have to watch whenever it is on.

I'm normally not much for horror movies, but I loved Giner Snaps. The acting was good. The look of the werewolf was also original. The gore effects were well done as well. I especially liked the claw marks and bite marks. Overall the story was very entertaining. There were tense moments, very dark moments, and even comedic moments. I would recommend this to any horror fan or werewolf lover. I'm sorry to say that I didn't get to see the last 20 minutes of the movie, but I'm sure it's as great as the rest of the movie. It was nice to see such an awesome movie come out of a Canadian studio, and nicer still to find out that there are two sequels. I hope to see Ginger Snaps II and Giner Snaps Back ASAP.",Ginger Snaps
242,meg-wax,A new twist on a classic concept,7,23 August 2000,"I went to see this movie at one of those pre screenings where they get the audiences view on the movie after the credits roll.It starts out about two sisters who are obsessed with death and each other, but quickly evolves into a classic horror type movie.  When one of the sisters, Ginger,  is attacked in the woods one night by a mysterious animal, the other sister helps her hide her injuries from their parents.  To their surprise she recovers at an incredibly fast pace and everything seems great. It isn't until Ginger starts exhibiting some lupine qualities that they come to realize that their problems may not be over.  Their race for a cure crosses their path with all sorts of different towns people, often with some very strange and funny results.I found the ending to be a bit of a let down, just because it was so typical, while the rest of the movie was anything but.  The two girls who played the sisters were excellent and so was Mimi Rogers who played their mother.  She had that perfect house wife on acid feel to her.  My only other qualm with the movie was the werewolf special effects.  Some were very impressive, but once again it was something that has been done and re done with little or no change.  I would love to see a werewolf movie that puts a whole new spin on this terrific monster.On the whole I highly recommend this movie.  I really enjoyed it and found it really funny and well done.  But then again, I am crazy.",Ginger Snaps
243,matriarch,Thoughtful horror - the best kind,9,4 June 2001,"The best horror has subtext that examines what is feared. 'Ginger Snaps' has both the genuinely creepy moments of the classic monster film and a searching look at the personal terrors of being a social outcast, or the uncontrollable changes of puberty.  Strong, well-acted characters abound - I especially appreciated Mimi Rogers' deft portrait of the suburban mom. The soundtrack is marvelous as well.  An excellent companion piece to Neil Jordan and Angela Carter's 'The Company of Wolves'.",Ginger Snaps

See her like you've never seen her before, in a comedic role.  Very un-X-Filian.The movie is well directed and gives the audience some intellectual credit. There are many interesting shots and of course the mandatory scares that are made even more powerful with terror-ific sound.  The editing is fast paced and keeps the audience interested.I highly reommend this movie.  It's a refreshing, intellectual horror movie. The tension is high and the laughs frequent.",Ginger Snaps

While many of the previous werewolf movies produced seem mired in the campy dregs of their predecessors, Ginger Snaps delivers a good story on many levels.The acting is quite solid and believable.  You get the feeling that the characters are genuinely trying to deal with the situation at hand instead of simply following a script.The humor presented in the movie is not contrived, but rather appropriate to the situations at hand.  It has a dark edge that runs consistently throughout the movie.The camera work and scenes are consistently dark and really bring out the horror aspects of the film.All in all, it is a good production of Canadian cinema.

I'm not sure how I missed this gem when it first came out, but luckily it came up in conversation with a friend who subscribes to Netflix. I immediately went out and rented it. Loved it. Ordered a copy for myself on the Internet. Got impatient for it to arrive. Rented it again. Ripped open the package upon arrival & I've watched it a bazillion times since.Every time I watch this movie, I get something new out of it. It's got everything I could want in a film: a timeless plot (coming of age), intertwined with elements of mythology (werewolves), set in a time & place that could be anywhere (those treeless housing developments of Bailey Downs seem to be cropping up everywhere). The script is tight, well-written, and the cast can actually act! Sure, there's the blood & the adolescence & the pact (or is that a not-so-subtle reference to 'the pack' later in the movie? -- it kinda makes you wonder, doesn't it?), but the bond the sisters share is more complex that just the pact. It's about power (""you do everything she tells you to"") and support (Want me to kill her? I'll kill her for you, B"") and change (""just don't go average on me"") and independence (""We're almost not even related anymore"").Plus, there are sly statements made regarding the burbs (""full of dead ends""), transforming (""...it doesn't make me a monster""), and oddly, morality (""You gave it to Jason. You had unprotected sex and you infected him"") -- All of which add up to a scary, funny, tense, bittersweet, amazingly brilliant film.""I get this ache ... and I thought it was for sex, but it's to tear everything into f_cking pieces."" -- How's that for a one-sentence summary of teenage confusion, anger & angst?

It's in my Top 5 at least and I give it a full 10/10The movie really tells about the two sisters their bond, I do recommend that you at least watch it if you ever encounter it on TV and if you like it that you should definitely watch the sequels.Greetz Jpmaarten",Ginger Snaps
252,susancurrie,See this film!,10,17 July 2001,"*Note: review contains minor spoilers*Having expected to see a standard teen slasher, I was pleasantly surprised by this unusual horror.Focusing on the intense (some would say dysfunctional) relationship between two death-obsessed sisters, Ginger Snaps moves easily between genuine horror and black humour(such as the opening credits, which take place over a sequence of photos depicting one or other of the girls in gruesome mocked-up death scenes). However the film avoids the self-aware irony of Scream and its clones and is much better for it.After an encounter with a strange creature coincides with the onset of puberty, the older sister Ginger distances herself from the younger Brigette and embarks on increasingly violent and sexual behaviour.This allows the real star of the film, Emily Perkins, to shine as the outcast younger sister Brigette who must find out what is wrong with her sister and save her before the situation escalates out of hand. Perkins gives an astonishing performance as Brigette, capturing the gawkiness of adolescence perfectly.The last 15 - 20 minutes of the film are a bit of a let down compared with what went before, but don't let that put you off. Undoubtedly the best horror film for years.",Ginger Snaps
253,phil_eagle,80% great,7,13 August 2001,"Ginger Snaps is one of the best revisionist horror movies I've seen - if you liked ""Ravenous"" you'll enjoy this.  Contrary to a previous reviewer's remarks, the film is not heartlessly ""cool"" - no chilly hipster would be capable of the compassion this film shows to its outcast, unbeautiful characters.  Like all the best horror films, the true subject of fear is very real - the earthquake effect of sexual maturity on teenagers, girls in this case, and the disruption of sibling relationships by differing levels of sexual maturity.  It also speaks to a genuine post-Columbine concern. When youth culture admires alienation, morbid affectation and misanthropy, how can genuine psychosis be distinguished from acting out?  The highest praise goes to Isabelle and Perkins, whose characterisation is superb. Mimi Rogers as the mother who raises denial to an art form is also excellent.On the downside, the last twenty percent of the film declines into cliched stalk-and-slash, with typically idiotic behaviour by previously intelligent characters, and an embarrassingly polymeric monster.  The humanoid werewolf makeup is so derivative of ""Buffy"" I'm surprised Optic Nerve didn't sue. Moreover, for its revisionist pretensions, the films underlying attitudes to sexuality are disappointingly regressive, as are the final fates to which it consigns its characters.On balance though, highly recommended.",Ginger Snaps

The title seemed interesting and then I saw the cover of the film, I'm a huge horror film fan so I rented this movie.  You would think this movie could be another dull teen horror flick, but this film was actually very good.  The film has a great story that's not very conventional to horror movies.  It has some horror, a little blood but it also has a great story behind it dealing with the lives of two teenage sisters.  There is a lot of great high school drama dealing with popularity and peer pressure.  The two sisters have a very close relationship but they have a horrible family life, their mother is played by Mimi Rogers and I think she did a wonderful job in this film.

However as soon as we see our first glimpse of the beast I'm afraid any sense of dread and terror went out the window.  Totally unconvincing as a monster and the make-up and effects disappointed throughout.  This was supposed to be a scary horror film, but due to the effects all the hard work of the director and actors failed to convince. Which is a shame, as this movie could have been very good.

From the creative title sequence, to the gradual change of girl to woman to monster, the film is relentless in creativity. Rarely does the film lose its' edge, and when it does, it soon retrieves its' momentum.The two young actresses, Emily Perkins (""Stephen Kings' IT"") and Katherine Isabelle (""Disturbing Behavior""), deliver incredible performances. Isabelle shows her portrayal of a young woman gradually changing into something more and more grisly, while her counterpart, Perkins, demonstrates her reaction to someone who is going through this process. Both of these fine actresses deserve an award for their achievement in this film. Also, a special notice should be directed towards Mimi Rogers (""Lost in Space""), who displays the cheerful, happy-go-lucky mother. However, a few characters could have been more developed. One such character is the father, played by John Bourgeois (""Thin Air""). This character was almost non-existent, and sometimes the Fitzgerald family felt as though they could have been without the man of the house. Also, young Christopher Redman (""Bless the Child"") as Gingers' boyfriend who is infected with the lycanthrope virus, is under-developed. The sub-plot of him turning into a werewolf is under-developed, as well. In fact, this sub-plot should have been edited from the script (it leads to a very unflattering scene, one that deeply hurts the mood of the film). However, the good far out-weigh the bad in this film, and ""Ginger Snaps"" proves to be an entertaining piece of horror-movie history.*** out of ****",Ginger Snaps

I think that the make up was really well done and the script was very well written. The only problem I found was that when I was reading about Katherine Isabelle's other movies I noticed that her very odd role in, ""The Chris Isaak show"" I also like ""Brigitte"" she was a hilarious character. I loved how she said, ""Shut Up Norman"" I recommend this movie to everyone who likes a good scare and to be on the edge of your seat. Sincerely!",Ginger Snaps

Although les loups-garou have often been associated with male puberty, this movie makes an extraordinarily explicit linkage with _female_ pubescence and coming of age. It extends the gender-bending, so that instead of the standard horror morality warning against maintenance of female virginity to werewolf as an STD for unwary males. The feminist standard is also explicit in suburban-mom's alignment with murderess-daughters and exclusion of dad. Low budget, but they had fun with standard conventions.",Ginger Snaps
259,LeatherRaven,Who ever said being a teenager was easy?,9,23 February 2002,"It's so refreshing to see a teen horror flick that can genuinely rely on the strength of the script and the talent of the core actors, rather than the size of the budget and any swanky my monster is bigger-than-yours CGI effects. Both Emily Perkins and Katherine Isabelle are more than convincing as the two troubled teenage sisters, even if Perkins has only one look, the 'big eyed haunted' one. The dialogue between them is superb and their suicide project is a work of genius if not an extremely troubled mind. In fact you can't help but feel that that you've been to school with one, if not both them. Or in my case started my teens as Brigitte and ended it as a Ginger.Unfortunately the film does suffer from a number of loose ends, particular their poor mother who wanders off into the midst of high school party clutching a Tupperware box full of severed fingers and is never heard of again.  Like most werewolf films, the end creature is always somewhat of a disappointment, the 'Ohh, is that it?' factor, and Ginger Snaps is no exception on that level, although the use of models over CGI is a rather nice homage to earlier werewolf filmsIt's a pity that the film did not get a wider cinema release, because it is far and away a more sophisticated and enjoyable film than American Werewolf in Paris, accurately pinning down as the original American Werewolf in London did, that the horror is in the transformation and the gradual break down of  the emotional state, rather than in the beast itself.",Ginger Snaps

Well, okay, maybe it's an opinion, but what else manages to make the main characters and the monsters so realistic yet still so entertaining. Ten bloody, severed thumbs up! Also, this is the most romantic movie ever. Admittedly, it's not a traditional 'romance' since it's about sisterly love but still, these sisters are closer than any couple I've ever heard of. Not to mention, doesn't 'Dead by sixteen' and 'Together forever' sound as least as committed as 'Til death do us part', especially since many couples don't or can't marry, and many more divorce, while Brigette and Ginger stay loving through a G*d-D**n Werewolf movie.",Ginger Snaps

262,smells45,"Depressed, emo teens aren't my cup of tea",4,29 November 2007,"A lot of the movie deals with teenage angst. To me, it was very dull and predictable, with the typical 'Down with authority' and 'No one understands me.' They also lacked a lot of emotion in my opinion, mostly just being sad all the time.The good points are that once the action was going on, it was good. The slow transition from human to werewolf was quite well done. However, the drama between the werewolf part of the story was very drawn out and very lame.I admit it's a different spin on horror, but I admit that I like typical horror movies better than this type.

264,NicHambright,Genius,9,20 January 2008,"A very perfect and touching horror film, ""Ginger Snaps"" packs quite a punch. Katharine Isabelle is outstanding as Ginger, who shares a morbid fascination for death and mayhem with her sister Brigitte. They live in a quiet Canadian suburb, sheltered from the rest of the world and depending on each other. They're outcasts at school, and they hate everyone.When Ginger is bitten by a werewolf in a playground at night, things begin to take a nasty turn for the worst as she begins to slowly mutate over the following month into Brigitte's worst nightmare.""Ginger Snaps"" is totally self aware, and the two leads (Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins) knock it out of the park in their roles as the demented Fitzgerald sisters. A heavy undertone of black humor is apparent throughout the whole film, and there are some genuinely scary moments aided by equally funny ones. The thing that sets ""Ginger Snaps"" apart from hundreds of lame teen slasher flicks is the ingenious script and performances that capture this dark story all too well.The theme of Lycanthropy and mutation never holds back and it's all done creatively and quite effectively with the terrifying makeup effects, but the true heart of this tale has nothing to do with werewolves at all. The movie is an account of the pangs of growing up- and apart. Ginger and Brigitte begin to lose each other because Ginger is becoming something different, as is foreshadowed in the beginning of the film when Ginger gets her first period. Writer Karen Walton masterfully depicts the sister's pain as they cope with the changes of life, even if it is told through a bloody (extremely bloody) and shocking werewolf analogy. This is a fantastic film, intense and cleverly crafted from start to finish, and surprisingly touching for a horror film.",Ginger Snaps
265,OnceBittenKitten,The bark is as good as the bite,10,8 December 2002,"**Some SPOILERS contained in this text** After reading some of the commentary made on this film I think that many people missed the point completely.  This is an extraordinary and unusual horror film.  In my opinion, this film has a great deal in it's favor: horror, humor, insight, and intelligence.  How many films these days even have a message in addition to being entertainment?  Horror in particular is notorious for being a genre that is stereotyped as pure entertainment. Horror is very often born out of the particular space of a film. Some horror is born from the mysteries and dangers of nature, others seem to be born from the high-tech alienation of the city, some is born from the junctions of the two where technology and industry mutate nature. This film is the perfect horror child of the Suburbs.  It is a film about normalcy, social conventions, expectations, deviance, generation gaps, and growing up to be a woman in the midst of all the confusions wrought by these other things.Even if it isn't completely ""original"" in all of it's substance and form, what movie is completely original?  It's been done before for a film to change a supernatural horror to a natural one.  Science is the silver bullet of our age.  However, this film changes a supernatural horror into a natural one BUT it also has the added twist that ""science"" relies on cures that come from traditional lore, thus giving back some credit to the wisdom of ancient healers that has been stolen from them by modern medicine.  In one brilliant piece of dialogue in the film, Bridgette and Sam discuss the possibility that myths may hold some valid truths.  Bridgette snidely remarks of the wisdom of ancient healers, ""Yeah, they also thought that leeches cured people."" ""They do."" Sam succinctly states to win the argument.  Often there are moments like this in this film which seem to be unoriginal but are original in sly ways.  And, who's to say that the moments of unoriginality in the film are not there for the express purpose of connecting to and commenting on other works from similar genres or that have made similar statements?  For instance, the two main characters' obsession with death is not unlike that of Harold from ""Harold and Maude"" which, when the parent generation in this film were teenagers, was a film that expressed many formative ideas for that generation.  I think that this film, though it doesn't have the optimism of Harold and Maude, does fairly accurately comment on society. Besides, this IS a highly original film. I don't believe that another film exists which connects the cycles of the moon to both werewolfism and through menstruation to the experience of becoming a woman.  That is a HIGHLY original idea.  Not to mention that the ""She's All That"" like transformation of Ginger is not all really that usual.  Her transformation from the outsider to the popular girl also includes an interesting reversal of traditional gender roles which provides interesting commentary on sexuality and gender relations during the transitional time period of puberty. Instead of entering the traditional role of the submissive and weepily emotionally female, Ginger becomes a truly powerful, sexually aggressive, and, yes, bitchy (aka angry and forceful threat to masculine domination among other things) person.  I wouldn't just normally state the factor of bitch being a label given to women who seem to threaten male dominance, because I'm not some uber-feminist who sees men as the enemy, but the film actually comments on it directly.  Females who are strong and sexually aggressive are a threat to some men and some women in our society, particularly during that age when people are just testing out sexual gender roles and this film is aware of it.  In one great moment, Ginger's lover tells her to slow things down and be less sexually aggressive, asking, ""Who's the man here?"" and she just takes what she wants as men in film and real life have done for years.  Another ironic twist to this, the consequence to this action is that the boy experiences something like the female curse of menstruation.  I say: ""Hooray for bitchy women who admit to having sexual hunger and go for what they want!""  It's just too bad that typically this kind of strong woman can only appear or have real power within the deviance-accepting confines of the horror genre.The central emotional action of the movie skillfully touches on perhaps one of the least filmicly explored consequences of growing up which is growing apart from someone or something that you have been so close to that it is nearly an extension of yourself.  Even if you do not have a person, place, or activity that fits this role, metaphorically as you grow up you are always leaving behind a piece of yourself that you can no longer completely connect with and thus you can relate to this occurance.  The real horror and sadness of this film comes from the changes in Bridgette and Ginger's relationship.  They go from being so close that they share everything with each other, to exclusion, and are prepared to die together and, over the month long space of the film's duration, they experience for the first time unsurmountable distances between them and find that it is impossible for them to share everything with each other.  Most notably unshared is the experience of death that they once promised to share with one another. I'm not here to say that you are wrong if you didn't like this film. There are many ways to appreciate a film and in making a film, you can't please everyone.  But I think that in many instances it seems like people who saw it didn't pay very close attention to this film. Some of these people liked it, some didn't.  Maybe it's easier to like this film if you can identify with the characters or in some way connect to them.  But even if you can't, even if you are experiencing a generation gap like Ginger and Bridgette's mother, or you have never experienced what it's like to be an outsider, or you don't know what it's like to grow up as a female in this time and culture, this is still a smart film that makes insightful commentary on society and does so in an interesting and unexpected way.",Ginger Snaps

268,Timeshredder,Ginger Snaps is both a well-made horror movie and a wickedly funny satire,8,21 October 2004,"Like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" but far grittier than network television would allow, this 2001 Canadian film uses tired horror movie conventions to comment on and satirize teenage life and suburban culture. Written by Karen Walton and John Fawcett and directed by the latter, it tells the story of two goth sisters, sexy Ginger (Katherine Isabelle) and shy Brigette (Emily Perkins). Outsiders sharing a private world, they have rejected--- a little too self-consciously--- the conformist world of suburbia. For a class project on life in their planned community of Bailey Downs, they stage and photograph gruesome scenes of death and suicide. The Fitzgerald sisters even appear to be rebelling against nature; neither girl has started menstruating.Their lives change when they encounter the Beast of Bailey Downs, a wild animal that has been killing local pets. As this is a horror movie, the beast turns out to be a werewolf, and it snaps a piece of Ginger before dying. Later that same night, Ginger gets her first period.Over the course of the month, the moon waxes and Ginger transforms. We're left to wonder if she's becoming a monster or merely a teenager, and to contemplate which is actually scarier. Brigitte feels abandoned, left to deal with a sister who grows more bestial and hormonally-charged with each day. She seeks out a helpful drug-dealer (Kris Lemche), whose knowledge of herbs and willingness to believe make him a natural ally.The film contains many extraordinary moments. Walton and Fawcett bleed the adolescence/menstruation/lycanthropy parallels; a conversation with a helpful school nurse on Ginger's transformation no doubt resonates with every teen who has believed that, no, adults don't really understand. Both Isabelle and Perkins turn in riveting performances; many ordinary teen movies do not permit their characters' relationships to develop so convincingly. Mimi Rogers as the girls' June Cleaveresque mom plays her role with frightening perfection; suburbia may be the scariest monster of all.The ending becomes overly tortured and perhaps a little too conventional. Nevertheless, the film's best moments make it must-see lycanthrope viewing. Witty, funhouse-style frightening, and extremely bloody, Ginger Snaps takes ""I was a Teenage Werewolf"" far beyond the comfortable horrors of the 1950s drive-in.",Ginger Snaps
269,rainbowryder81,Katherine and Emily,10,19 December 2004,"This movie is an example on why American movie producers need to learn a great lesson in movie making! Ginger Snaps made it to theaters everywhere but in the great US Of A! Here it went straight to video. I first saw it my Senior year in high school when it came out on video. I felt I could relate to the movie because it portrays the stress of trying to ""fit in"" high school that plagues most teens. This movie is almost believable and almost anyone can relate to the dark sense of humor! Katherine Murray and Emily Perkins really made these characters if you ask me. I find it funny how well Emily who is 4 years older than Katie did such an amazing job playing the brave younger sister of Ginger. I just feel that this movie is one of the best horror cult classics of the 21st century. I have also seen the other two movies and to me they were just as great. The prequel was a bit more morose than the other two just because it leaves you wondering. If you have not seen any of these movies go to a video store NOW! I also encourage you to check out more fine Canadian flicks!",Ginger Snaps

271,donaldthewolf,A Werewolf Masterpiece,9,30 November 2014,"Ginger Snaps is a rather odd addition to the world of werewolf flicks. Opting for a more emotional and personal approach, over the typical sliced and diced mish-mash of an almost-plot that most werewolf movies cozy up too, Ginger Snaps is perhaps a masterpiece of the werewolf genera. Following themes of coming-of-age and sisterhood bonds this film is both moving and intense.Taking on macabre tones throughout, Ginger Snaps has just the right amount of werewolf gore--with effects that are quite good, considering the movies low-budget. Their main cast all do a good job acting and their story is cohesive and well-written.The only down side to the film might be in the cliché high school setting, although even this manages to come off as believable-- thanks to some of the well written characters and their deviations from the typical high school tropes. Overall, the film is quite enjoyable and certainly a thrill to watch. It's unique and bizarre, in short, a necessary film for any werewolf-lover.",Ginger Snaps

275,internet_bazaar,Fox in wolf's skin.,8,7 February 2006,"Good new approach to an old subject. What I just said about this film was for thriller fans only. I doubt that many others would agree on this. Two somber sisters undergo the radical changes of puberty, such as the ominous coming of menstruation, which they refer to as: The Curse. So a series of parallelisms between this natural recurrence and the other less natural, and quite more ominous, cycle of Lycanthropy drive a whole lot of the movie. The two main actresses give a very good performance, specially so the younger darker sister of the two: Emily Perkins, who is fantastic. They both give the movie the vital heaviness it needs but infuse it with a sense of unquestionable and humane sisterhood. The director sets us from the start in the correct environment via a set of pictures taken by the sisters for a school work and a wonderfully moody musical score. The story gets interesting complications that evolve quite logically. The reactions to events and the dialogs of the characters (including that of the sister's mother played by Mimi Rogers) are not only screams, or the absolute opposite that is seen commonly on this flicks: ""instant assimilation"", but try to be closer to what I imagine would be if such people would encounter these sort of situations in the real life. All in all the movie works smoothly and ever more interesting, until, as usual, one fourth before the end. From about the time when a school party is taking place the film slowly goes wrong. Many of the interesting situations that conducted us here become ever less so. The first sighting we get of the creature is not as exciting as the whole movie prepared us for. And the end result of the effort on the make up effects was only average. The actual idea of how to finish the movie is quite good except that when implemented not, to my taste, as nicely done as that first opening sequence that leaves you no chance but to feel what the director intended. Anyhow, if your thing is the thrillers and you are on the look for a refreshing little surprise, this is a good ticket to get there.",Ginger Snaps
