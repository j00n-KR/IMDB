0,Leofwine_draca,Atmospheric serial killer thriller with a great performance from Washington,7,12 December 2015,"This serial killer thriller-chiller was severely underrated by critics on release – and I'm not sure why. The film is impossible to dislike and even if not magnificent or original it has all the right aspects. The score is good, the dark and moody photography excellent, even the script gives light to some interesting characterisations once in a while which is a bit of a surprise. The usual elements torn from the two most popular ""serial killer"" films of the 1990s are all present and correct but the film does have some interest in the shape of its central pairing, Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie.Washington takes the role of Lincoln Rhyme, a top cop who gets his back broken and spends the rest of his days as a quadriplegic lying in a bed in his huge, spooky house. Although bedridden he's still a force to be reckoned with and Washington is typically excellent in the role, especially in the scenes where he deciphers puzzling clues and puts two and two together like a modern day Holmes. The sexy Angelina Jolie, on the other hand, is a young, tough female police officer who initially spars with Washington before growing to understand (and love?) him as their relationship deepens and they grow respect for each other.Fair enough, the plot of the serial killer is familiar and the deaths are all as unpleasant as they should be. Victims are eaten alive by rats and boiled to death by steam pipes. The film goes for a dark, unwholesome SEVEN vibe here which pays off dividends. These scenes come as no surprise but are pleasingly atmospheric and spooky, especially the hunting through dark underground tunnels. One thing I will say is that the identity of the killer is far too easy to guess; I had narrowed it down to two suspects early on and at the end my suspicions were confirmed. Saying that, the adrenaline-pump of the finale is excellent (if predictable), proving that you should never underestimate the power of the human will.The supporting cast is pretty efficient for this kind of movie, with nice turns from Queen Latifah (a real surprise, this one), and especially Michael Rooker who excels as the hard-nose police Captain in charge of the case. Plus we get some turns from distinguished character actors like Leland Orser (weird and geeky as always) and Luis Guzman (underused, sadly). Despite the lengthy running time the film fairly flies by, with a good pacing and some excellent suspenseful and taut sequences showing the killer trapping his victims. You could certainly do a lot worse, which I why I recommend this movie to fans of the genre.",The Bone Collector
1,SnoopyStyle,Serial killer drama with two superstars,6,5 February 2014,"Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is a brilliant police detective and forensics expert who was left a quadriplegic from a job. There's a killer in the city who traps his victims in his taxi cab. Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) is a beat cop who discovers two bodies buried in the train tracks. The investigating detectives (Michael McGlone, Ed O'Neill) enlist the help of Lincoln who in turn enlists the help of Amelia.This was right before TV show CSI first air. So it had some fascinating CSI bits for the time. But the movie has two problems. It's a minor problem that Denzel is stuck in bed all the time. It restricts his physicality. It also limits the visual dynamics of his scenes.The bigger problem is the role of Amelia. After all, she is a beat cop without the basic forensics training. The movie is treating this less as a science and more as an inborn ability that an elder can bestow upon a youngling. Also Angelina is so emotional that it's unbelievable anybody would allow her near the evidences. Heck she fires her gun at the rats. What kind of forensics expert is that? There is no doubt that Denzel and Angelina are big time stars. It's a simple serial killer movie. They're shooting in NYC. It looks good. There is a good movie here. They should have allowed Angelina be a techie, and let Denzel have a wheelchair. That way she's more believable, and he could be mobile with her.",The Bone Collector
2,Prismark10,Fingering the killer,5,10 April 2018,"The Bone Collector is a serial killer thriller in the vein of Seven. Here the gruesome deaths are hinted at rather than shown in a gory visceral manner.Denzel Washington is Lincoln Rhyme, a paraplegic detective now bedridden who needs round the clock care after an accident. Rhyme was a brilliant forensic detective who wrote several books on the subject.Now his superiors want his help as a maniac pretending to be a cab driver, is abducting victims, torturing and killing them yet leaving clues behind for Rhyme to solve. He is assisted by a rookie cop, Amelia (Angelina Jolie) who acts as his physical being as she goes does the leg work and goes out out to the subterranean dark lairs where the victims have been held.As the film progresses it almost seems like a chess game is being played with Rhyme, the clues are aimed at Rhyme somehow as if the killer is taunting Rhyme, like they might have dealt with each other in the past.Director Phillip Noyce uses the film such as Sea of Love as a template for misdirection. It even has Michael Rooker playing a police chief, he played the villain in Sea of Love, initially appearing in a small scene.However the ending was rather cheesy with some campy lines and the motive of the killer felt like a bolt from the blue. Still it is an entertaining thriller but not up to the standards of Seven, Sea of Love or The Silence of the Lambs.",The Bone Collector
3,lee_eisenberg,mostly interesting because I got to see it with subtitles,5,1 January 2007,"""The Bone Collector"" isn't really anything that we haven't seen before: a rookie detective (Angelina Jolie) has to investigate a case because something happened to the original detective (Denzel Washington). The scene where she discovers the book was, in my opinion, the best part of the movie, explaining much of what was going on. But the movie's ending really spoiled everything; I mean, why just end it like that? So, the movie had no intrinsic neat qualities. But while I was in Spain for a school trip, we watched it, and got to see the subtitles. OK, so that doesn't really add any good traits. But I liked seeing the movie that way. As far as I'm concerned, the movie's worth seeing once.Also starring Queen Latifah, Michael Rooker, Mike McGlone, Luis Guzman (happy birthday, Luis!) and Leland Orser.",The Bone Collector
4,jboothmillard,The Bone Collector,5,13 September 2007,"From director Phillip Noyce (Rabbit-Proof Fence, The Quiet American) this is an okay thriller film with some good moments and acting. Basically there is an accident in a train tunnel, and Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) is the one who found and photographed the scene of the crime, and it seems paralysed forensics expert Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is the only man who may be able to crack the case. Even though he can only move his head and one finger, and has help from his loving carer/nurse Thelma (Queen Latifah), he is still perfectly capable of accessing most information and evidence on his computer. As he is confronted with more clues from a serial killer, he is drawn away from his thought of assisted suicide, it re-invokes his interest in life. He needs Amelia to go around crime scenes, i.e. be his eyes, ears and legs, but her squeamish nature is slowing them down, best seen in the scene where she refuses to cut a woman's hands off. Towards the end, Amelia finds a book, ""The Bone Collector"" that seems to have reference to the crimes the killer has committed, and Richard Thompson (Alien: Resurrection's Leland Orser) is the man who comes out of the shadow to reveal himself as the killer. Also starring Michael Rooker as Captain Howard Cheney, Mike McGlone as Detective Kenny Solomon, Luis Guzmán as Eddie Ortiz, John Benjamin Hickey as Dr. Barry Lehman and Ed O'Neill as Detective Paulie Sellitto. There are some small disturbing moments with the crime scenes, and the acting is quite gripping, but I personally don't think I'd see it more than once. Worth watching!",The Bone Collector
5,ccthemovieman-1,"Okay, But Needed Less Lip-Service",6,1 April 2006,"Here's another interesting modern-day serial killer saga which keeps your attention the full two hours. Although grisly in parts, it doesn't overdo the violence.However, once again we have the too-often case of an ending where the villain talks instead of shoots and, of course, he pays for it. Why oh why does this annoying scenario play out so many times in movies? It's so annoying and stupid and ruins many a good show.Acting-wise, Denzel Washington gives another likable performance and we get to see Angelina Jolie's King Kong-collagen type lips which are ludicrous. She's too profane and hard-looking for this old-fashioned reviewer, anyway. I'd rate this movie higher with a different lead actress.",The Bone Collector
6,Tweekums,A solid thriller despite some clichés,8,31 March 2016,"Protagonist Lincoln Rhyme is a former detective and a forensics expert who was left a quadriplegic after an accident. He is not enjoying life and tries to persuade a doctor friend to help him commit suicide before that can happen he is approached by colleagues wanting help. The film's other protagonist, rookie cop Amelia Donaghy, is the first police officer at a murder scene and impresses Rhyme with the way she processes the scene so much so that he wants her on the case. The dead man was last seen entering a taxi with his wife and she is still missing. Rhyme, with the help of forensics experts, processes the clues deliberately left by the killer workout where the killer is holding the woman and when he intends to kill her. Donaghy heads to the site with other cops but they are too late to save her. This isn't the end though; clues point to further victims as well as suggesting that the killer is forensically aware and has an interest crimes and locations from the turn of the twentieth century. Before the case can be solved Rhyme and Donaghy will have to decode a lot more clues, deal with incompetent senior officers and face personal danger.This film may contain plenty of clichés but it is still effective. Denzel Washington impresses as Rhyme; apart from the opening flashback scene he spends almost the entire film lying in bed. Angelina Jolie is also good as Donadhy; making us believe in her character even when things get a bit far-fetched. The deaths are a bit gruesome but either take place off screen or the scene ends before things get nasty. The ending is a bit cliché as the killer targets Rhyme and it turns out that everything we've seen is part of his attempt to beat Rhyme as he holds him responsible for things that went wrong in his life. This does at least lead to a fight where an able-bodied is badly injured by quadriplegic man! There are plenty of tense moments throughout the film and the identity of the killer isn't obvious. Overall a solid thriller that fans of the genre should enjoy.",The Bone Collector
7,BA_Harrison,Bone-headed but fun.,6,22 June 2012,"From what I have gathered, The Bone Collector deviates quite a lot from the Jeffrey Deaver best-seller, which goes some way to explaining the film's more ridiculous elements and many dangling plot threads, Hollywood having a nasty habit of turning perfectly good literature into patently absurd movies. Fortunately, this Se7en-style psychological thriller has the benefit of a decent director and a fine cast who manage to make this an entertaining effort despite the many flaws in the script.The pairing of Angelina Jolie and Denzel Washington is the film's strongest suit: I'm not a massive fan of Jolie, but she's not at all bad here (in a rare role that doesn't require her to push out her tits and pout) and the always affable Washington puts in another winning performance. The supporting cast, which includes Michael Rooker, Ed O'Neill and Queen Latifah, do equally as well with their material. The film also benefits from one or two enjoyably grisly scenes and several well crafted moments of tension that still have the desired effect despite their decidedly preposterous nature.So, while it might seem unlikely that the film's killer would ever concoct such a convoluted plan, and it is clearly ridiculous to expect novice Amelia to examine a fresh crime scene all on her own, and the script gives zero explanation for such seemingly important details as the Peregrine Falcon and the use of antiquities in the crimes, The Bone Collector still manages to be a reasonably entertaining time waster. Hell, I recommend it purely for the chance to see Washington's quadriplegic forensic expert managing to kick butt despite only being able to move his head and one finger.",The Bone Collector
8,moonspinner55,"Lots of ideas cooking, but overall film is half-baked...",5,7 January 2003,"Thriller involving a bed-ridden ex-homicide detective in NYC, still on the police payroll, heading up tense investigation into serial killings involving a psychotic cabbie. Overly-familiar movie material, adapted from Jeffery Deaver's book, has a fatal case of ""Silence of the Lambs""-itis. Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie (as a rookie policewoman) do decent work in underwritten roles, however Ed O'Neill and Queen Latifah are both excellent in colorful supporting parts. Not a sterling example of the genre, yet director Phillip Noyce does everything he can to make it exciting, and cinematographer Dean Semler gets some intriguing shots of the Big Apple. Semler also does well highlighting Jolie's 1000-watt smile--what a beauty this one is! ** from ****",The Bone Collector
9,michaelRokeefe,Intense mystery. A brutal thriller to the end.,7,20 May 2000,"Not for the faint of heart. Not for the weak stomach. If you like a down to the bone, knuckle biting chiller...this is for you. Denzel Washington plays a quadriplegic detective that teams with a beautiful female cop, Angelina Jolie, to track down a sadistic serial killer. The killer leaves clues that lead to a turn of the century true crime novel.Also in the cast are Michael Rooker, Ed O'Neill and Queen Latifah. You will squirm in your chair till the very end.

10,sunwarrior13,A Watchable Crime Thriller,8,16 October 2012,"The Bone Collector is a suspense thriller that combines Rear Window and Seven.This thriller is about two cops on the trail of a brutal serial killer must see as one, act as one, and think as one before the next victim falls.It stars Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie together with Queen Latifah,Michael Rooker,Mike McGlone,Luis Guzman,Leland Orser and Ed O'Neill.It is based on the crime novel of the same title written by Jeffery Deaver,concerning the quadriplegic detective Lincoln Rhyme.Lincoln Rhyme is an intelligent forensics detective who was paralyzed in the line of duty. The author of several books, he has a keen eye for detail and nose for clues that have made him a legend in the law enforcement community. Amelia Donaghy is a street-smart policewoman in her twenties. On her last day as a street cop, before being transferred to a desk job, Amelia discovers a badly mutilated corpse. Rhyme is asked to investigate the case, but he declines. To him, it is an open-and-shut case not worth his time. But when he takes a close look at the evidence, he is intrigued, as the photos reveal complex messages in their details. The lunatic, who might be a taxi driver, amuses himself by paying homage to legendary murders in his own gruesome acts. Amelia is assigned to assist Rhyme, and she must be the eyes and ears of the quadriplegic detective. And they must capture the killer before he strikes again.This settles instead for mere competence and the modest rewards of a well-handled formula.The terrific cast is wasted on a bland attempt at a suspenseful,serial killer flick.Also,it can't overcome the limitations of its screenplay as it shares with most of the films of this genre like a penchant for moody photography, startling bursts of violence and, regrettably, a finale that's so far-fetched and relies on so many coincidences.Good thing that Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie muster enough electricity to make it a watchable thriller.",The Bone Collector
11,Theo Robertson,Take Away The Gimmicks And ....,3,20 February 2004,".... What have you got ? Not muchRemember those cop shows from the late 60s/early 70s . They seemed to be having a contest with who can come up with the biggest gimmick . CANNON had a big fat guy as the hero while COLUMBO had the gimmick of a wee scruffy guy in a raincoat . Perhaps the best gimmick was IRONSIDE which featured a cop who did nothing except sit in a wheelchair . Well THE BONE COLLECTOR goes one better , we have a hero detective who stays in bed all day . How`s that for an action thriller ? A hero detective who does nothing except lie in bed
That`s the gimmick but other things like making a newbie cop a woman and having inventive deaths aren`t gimmicks - They`re cliches , and I must say if it wasn`t for the unintentional laughs of watching people tortured to death the gore would have been off putting not to mention unoriginal since we`ve seen the same only done better in SEVEN . There is a truly skin crawling moment involving the bad guy`s hand but apart from that I`ve seen this type of story far too often which means I won`t be putting THE BONE COLLECTOR in my DVD collection",The Bone Collector
12,LeonLouisRicci,A Derivative Diluted Disappointment,3,12 September 2012,"A slick serial killer movie that has some interesting and creepy moments that are overwhelmed by some really silly situations and stiff characters. It is atmospheric and attempts to be dark and disturbing but is turned trite and tiresome by the typical Hollywood treatment.It has one ""romantic"" scene that will have you shaking your head, rolling your eyes, and slapping your knee. The suspension of disbelief is a strain and the lame script can't rise above mediocrity. The film's potential is constantly polluted by popular audience pleasing formulas and it is frequently flaccid and fails to maintain a constant feeling of foreboding.A derivative movie that has been done much better many times and adds nothing really new to the genre. A misfire that so often happens in mainstream movies and is a good example of what not to do when you are attempting to make cutting edge, true crime thrillers. This is a watered down disappointment that has some good cityscape cinematography, but little else to keep you interested or involved. Contrived, clichéd, and completely couched in a silly situation that demanded serious, intelligent intrigue, but delivers a droll, desperate melodrama that loses its way in the dark underground and along the rainy side streets and can't seem to find directions out of the fitting of a friendly nightmare.",The Bone Collector
13,CinemaSerf,Serial killer hunt that runs out of steam...,6,23 July 2020,"Denzel Washington really didn't have to get out of bed for his performance here as ""Lincoln""; a now-quadriplegic forensics expert who is prone to dangerous seizures. Not wishing to risk surviving one of these in a vegetative state, he has elected for euthanasia. Before he can implement his plan, though, his former colleagues alert him to a series of grisly murders with folks in taxis being hijacked and left to die in the most horrific, sadistic fashion. Intrigued, he hooks up with rookie Angelina Jolie (""Amelia"") to try to suss out who's behind these apparently unconnected crimes. It doesn't take them long to discover that their protagonist is leaving clues and when a man and his kid become the latest victims it becomes a race against time to get to them before the tide does. The suspense here is very much in the first fifty minutes, and the performances from Washington and Jolie are strong, but it can't sustain the menace and by midway through has become a rather procedural cop drama with an inevitability about it that really robs it of any real punch at the end.",The Bone Collector
14,poolandrews,"""His catheter's blocked!"" A total mess.",2,24 June 2008,"The Bone Collector is set in New York City & starts as one of the world's foremost criminologist's & crime scene experts Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is involved in an accident which leaves him a bedridden quadriplegic. Jump forward four years & Alan (Gary Swanson) & his wife Lindsay Rubin (Olivia Birkelund) are kidnapped, soon after New York cop Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) is called to a crime scene & finds the buried & mutilated body of Alan. Amelia notices some unusual crime scene evidence & makes a note of it which impresses Rhyme when he is asked to work on the case, he quickly realises the evidence are in fact cryptic clues to the whereabouts of Lindsay. Having cracked the clues the cops get there too late to save her but this is just the beginning as a sadistic serial killer continues to kill & leave forensic clues for Rhyme & the police...Directed by Phillip Noyce I watched The Bone Collector last night & I have to say it's one of the worst big budget post The Silence of the Lambs (1991) & Se7en (1995) serial killer thrillers I have seen, in fact it makes Friday the 13th (1980) look sophisticated & realistic! The script by Jeremy Iacone was based on the book by Jeffery Deaver & is so poor on so many levels I hardly know where to begin. For a start it takes itself deadly seriously & that makes all the other flaws seem twice as bad. The character's are truly awful & I didn't believe any of them were actual human beings. First we have Lincoln Rhyme who is paralysed from the neck down & there's just not a lot the script can do with him, in fact he quite literally can't do anything but lie in bed for the whole film. He is seemingly impressed with Amelia because she stopped a train & thought a fresh footprint near a murdered person might be of relevance, I'm not being funny here but wouldn't any cop realise a footprint near a murder victim might be of some relevance? Why is he so impressed with her? Then there's Capatin Cheney who is not only unlikable & shouts at everyone for no apparent reason but is so incompetent that he failed to connect several murders committed in a short space of time where each victim had sections of flesh & skin surgically removed from their bodies, how exactly did this guy get to be a police Captain? Then there's the killer whose motives are less than plausible, are you trying to tell me they devised an intricate plan to murder at least seven people because they spent six years in jail for something they actually did? If they wanted revenge on Rhyme why did they kill all those other people who had no connection to anything, I could maybe just about buy someone wanting revenge against the guy who put them away but not to kill several other people who have no connection to themselves, the intended target Rhyme anything else. Also after devising an intricate plan to kill these people & get away with it they suddenly turn into the most stupid person in history as despite holding a large knife & being able to walk & use their arms they are actually defeated & nearly killed by a quadriplegic who has no movement in his body below his neck! How did that happen? I should also mention Amelia who is a terrible character, she actually buys her own camera to take crime scene photo's & shoots rats for no apparent reason.Besides some of the worst written character's ever the story & plot isn't much better We never find out why the killer is using The Bone Collector book as inspiration We never find out why the killer was taking strips of flesh from his victims. It's never explained why a rookie cop like Amelia is allowed to enter crime scenes even before the proper forensic teams. There is no reason given for why the killer chooses his victims. Also the killers clues are a little obscure aren't they? I mean a bloody animal bone & shaved rat hair? Logically how does someone go from a bone & rat hair to the exact pinpoint location of the next victim & has the whole of New York to choose from? There's some nonsense about a bird that sits on Rhymes window ledge which is just totally random & at almost two hours The Bone Collector is really slow going. There is so much wrong with The Bone Collector & it all comes down to one of the worst scripts ever, it's atrocious on all levels & has zero credibility. Apparently Angelina Jolie has stated that she shot nude scenes for this film but they were cut because they were felt to be too distracting.With a supposed budget of about $48,000,000 The Bone Collector is well made with good production values & that Hollywood gloss about it. I also must add right now that I think Angelina Jolie gives one of the worst performances I have ever seen, I think she is absolutely terrible in this. Denzel Washington just sort of lies there really, Queen Latifah is awful & even Michael Rooker can't do much as he is stuck with a clichéd & one dimensional character.The Bone Collector has to be one of the worst Hollywood films I have seen in a while, I saw it for free on telly last night & I still feel cheated & ripped-off. There are just so many things to poke holes at it's silly, embarrassingly awful or should that be awfully embarrassing? Works either way to be honest...",The Bone Collector
15,Bunuel1976,"THE BONE COLLECTOR (Phillip Noyce, 1999) **1/2",6,22 November 2006,"Another watchable but utterly routine serial killer thriller in the SEVEN (1995) tradition which even cannibalizes Alfred Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW (1954) in having the male detective figure invalidated in bed and a female rookie cop doing the on-site investigating; Denzel Washington does not have much opportunity to shine here in his restricting role but Angeline Jolie is quite good and arguably the only real reason to watch this movie at all. The cardboard characters (Michael Rooker's senior cop is particularly annoying) and the air of deja' vu hanging over the whole production do the film no favors and the identity of the killer when it is revealed comes off as merely unconvincing; on the credit side, the detailed sequences of police procedural maintain one's interest.",The Bone Collector

17,zardoz-13,"""The Bone Collector"" is a spine-tingling serial killer thriller.",9,20 March 2008,"""The Bone Collector"" is a spine-tingling serial killer thriller. Denzel Washington stars as Lincoln Rhyme, a bedridden quadriplegic NYPD forensics detective who rivals Sherlock Holmes with his insights and expertise. When a scrappy but sensitive rookie cop, Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie), discovers the mutilated corpse of a millionaire buried in a railway tunnel and stops an Amtrak train from destroying the evidence, Linc knows that he has found the perfect protégé to help him collar this diabolical murderer.Masquerading as a cabbie to trap his victims, their sadistic quarry challenges them by planting cryptic clues at the scene of each crime. When our heroes aren't trying to outfox him, they exchange verbal barbs and contend with an inept police official, Captain Howard Cheney (Michael Rooker of ""Jumper""), who wants Rhyme off the case and Donaghy back walking a beat.Veteran Australian director Phillip Noyce of ""Patriot Games"" and ""One Tough Cop"" writer Jeremy Iacone have fashioned a first-rate, white-knuckled police procedural yarn that borrows from the best of the genre. Despite the unsavory subject matter, the filmmakers know how to grip audiences without grossing them out. Ace lenser Dean Semler of ""Waterworld"" enhances the paranoia with his agile camera work that plunges us into the dark gritty catacombs of the Big Apple. The urban sprawl of New York City where this homicidal maniac lurks has never appeared more sinister and claustrophobic.The best thing about ""The Bone Collector"" is that the heroes seldom get a break. Classic thrillers use nail-biting suspense to heighten the tension. Our heroes must hurdle many obstacles before they can capture the killer. As this cat-and-mouse saga unfolds, our heroic duo take on dimension so that by fadeout we know what make them tick. Initially, Rhyme had resigned himself to a physician assisted suicide. Periodic seizures devastate his crippled body, and he realizes that the next seizure may leave him a vegetable. Rhyme has reason then for a rapid assert. Meantime, Donaghy wrestles with her own demons. She saw her policeman father shoot himself, and her boyfriend is pestering her to quit the force. When Linc tries to boss her around, Amelia refuses to let him intimidate her.Ingenious villains make memorable thrillers. Right up to the heart-stopping finale, the mysterious nemesis keeps our heroes guessing. While Rhyme wracks his brains form the confines of his hospital bed, Amelia serves as his arms and legs, rushing off to rescue the poor victims but rarely arriving in time to save them. Sadly, the only flaw in ""The Bone Collector"" is the final showdown between Linc and the serial killer. As usual, the over-confident adversary prefers the sound of his own voice to that of his scalpel rending flesh.A fine ensemble cast, featuring Ed O'Neil as a tough-minded NYPD detective and Queen Latifah as Linc's stalwart nurse, bring a modicum of humor to this grim account of a serial killer at large. Moviegoers that crave whodunits like ""Silence of the Lambs,"" ""Copycat,"" ""Seven,"" and ""Rear Window"" will relish ""The Bone Collector.""",The Bone Collector
18,Boba_Fett1138,"Not bad, just too formulaic all.",6,24 June 2008,"Basically this is a movie that offers nothing new. It's a typical genre movie with all of the typical elements and twists. It's not a bad movie, it's just not original and surprising enough.""The Bone Collector"" is your typical average thriller. Whenever I have to mention an average and typical thriller, ""The Bone Collector"" always springs to mind. It's an average movie in basically every way thinkable and is only made interesting and worthwhile to watch thanks to the presence of Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie.Phillip Noyce is not really a favorite actor of mine. His movies always seem to lack in style and they are well made but yet in a very simplistic manner. He's a director that hardly takes any risks with his movies, with as a result that all of his works are typical and average movies, that often add very little new to the genre. But I think still the biggest problem with this movie is its story. It's just too standard and formulaic. Basically when you've seen only a couple of thrillers before in your life, you've also already seen ""The Bone Collector"", since it adds so little new to the genre. The story progresses in a predictable manner and the story also features the usual expected twists and turns in it. On top of that some story elements and characters just don't work out in the movie.It's the type of thriller in which basically every male character is a suspect but yet the movie doesn't mange to become truly suspenseful or surprising. Therefor it as a thriller also just isn't the most effective movie around.Luckily the movie still has a good cast. I can't imaging how this movie would had been like with a different cast filled with unknowns. Denzel Washington plays a good role, even though he plays a character that is bound to his bed and has lost almost all of his body functions. The movie is an early Angelina Jolie movie, or at least its from the time period before her real glory days but she obviously already shows her talent in this movie, although I think that her character isn't always handled well but this was perhaps more the director fault. The love story between Washington and Jolie also doesn't really feel credible and perhaps the movie would had been better off without it. Besides them two, the movie also features some other fine actors in supporting roles such as the always surprising great Queen Latifah, Michael Rooker, Luis Guzmán, Leland Orser and Ed O'Neill in an early serious movie role from him.It's an average movie and therefor nothing too bad but just don't expect anything brilliant or original either.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Bone Collector
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Worth a single viewing at best, but not all bad",7,14 November 2004,"I will not beat around the bush; I saw the movie because I had nothing better to do, and because I knew that Ed O'Neill was playing a cop, which I know is his favorite kind of role. After seeing most of the episodes of ""Married... With Children"" TV series, and loving just about every scene involving Ed in the role of Al Bundy, I was interested in seeing a role that he would enjoy even more... and I can say, that based on that, the film was not a disappointment. It's obvious from every line of dialog delivered, every movement, every second he's on-screen, that he loves it. He's really enjoying playing a cop, much like he did for the short amount of screen-time he had in K9, and it makes the film that much more enjoyable. The film itself is the standard run-of-the-mill, dime-a-dozen mystery thriller with the psychotic killer who desperately wants to get caught(meaning, he leaves all kinds of clues to his whereabouts, his intentions and his identity on purpose). It holds few(if any) surprises, really, and adds nothing new to the genre. However, it's not all bad; apart from Ed's enjoyment of his character, there are a few good things about the movie. Jolie and Washington have somewhat good on-screen chemistry, and the film does have its share of disturbing imagery(which is a requirement by now, for a film like this) and scares. Personally, I found the twist at the end to be so unlikely and far-fetched that it was ridiculous, but some might like it. Not to say that I had figured it out, the film does a pretty good job of keeping you guessing to the end(which is more than what can be said about several other recent films with twists). The visuals are pretty good, and the editing(though at times overly stylish) looks quite good. The plot is OK, but it's not particularly original. The pacing is OK. All in all, a pretty standard film, but not all bad. I recommend it to fans of any of the actors and fans of the mystery/thriller genre. Fans of Ed O'Neill(such as myself) might also enjoy it, just to see old Ed doing what he loves to do; portray a cop. 7/10",The Bone Collector
20,view_and_review,C Grade,6,18 December 2020,"Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is a premier NYPD forensics guy who is paralyzed. He is thrust into the middle of an active investigation when Officer Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) properly preserved a crime scene. Rhyme was so impressed with her briefly displayed abilities that he insisted upon her being his eyes, ears, and body on each crime scene thereafter. The only problem is she didn't want to do it. He was Obi Wan and she was Luke Skywalker if Luke Skywalker was insulted by the very thought of becoming a Jedi and argued with Obi Wan each chance he got.I didn't understand the motivation of this movie. As a murder mystery it was fine, but the character choices were less than ideal. No... they were bad. The concept of immobile sage using a mobile apprentice makes sense, but this pairing didn't. Why was Rhyme so insistent upon a beat cop becoming a forensics analyst in a case where evidence was so crucial, especially when she was so extremely reluctant? It wasn't like she removed the sword from the stone, or she had a lightning bolt tattooed on her forehead. Wasn't there an experienced forensics person already on the force? Why would he take the risk of an inexperienced person possibly ruining the crime scene? It was obvious that Amelia wanted no part of forensics, and it was equally obvious that Rhyme had his eyes set on her. It was beyond annoying, and I would think it also violated protocol, but everyone went along with it like Rhyme was the boss.
Of course, it wouldn't be a movie if Amelia continued to refuse to be Rhyme's apprentice. So, she played the role she was going to eventually play anyway.The killer in all this remained faceless and anonymous, yet he intentionally left clues to indicate his intentions. It was a murder mystery style race to find out who the killer was before he claimed his next victim. The movie wasn't devoid of any good, despite my complaints. It was a C grade mystery thriller that I will only remember because Denzel and Angelina starred together.",The Bone Collector

Jeffrey Deaver's novels involving quadriplegic forensic expert Lincoln Rhyme and his ""grid walker"" Amelia are excellent and gripping crime dramas and this movie, which adapts the first novel (in which they first meet) is also very good.It does rather downplay the novel's subplot concerning Lincoln's wish to bring his life to an end, but the crime story itself is told entertainingly and grippingly.Denzel Washington is excellent as Rhyme (I don't recall Rhyme's race being explicitly stated in the novel, although I had always assumed he was white: Washington's performance renders my speculation moot). Anjelina Jolie is good as Amelia, although the character's debilitating arthritis is only infrequently obvious.

Do we really need to see this? He is a taxi driver known as the Bone Collector. Instead of collecting stamps or parking tickets like normal people, he collects bones, and details are not needed as to how he achieves this hobby. Denzel Washington plays a cop shackled to a bed due to an injury that left him paralyzed from the shoulders down. Angelina Jolie plays a young policewoman who discovers a hand containing a skinned finger with a wedding ring emerged from the ground. One poor sap is eaten alive by rats. The killer's identity is left to the pointlessly graphic conclusion. Director Phillip Noyce achieves a certain level of tension but locations are drab. He previously made another bullshit film called The Saint. Washington does well in a role that is mainly bed ridden but his climatic survival is pathetically violent. Jolie completes the duo playing off Washington's physical demands while investigating the crime. Then she does the hero rescue scene just in time.

26,JamesHitchcock,Just Another Routine Serial Killing,4,13 February 2004,"Possible SpoilersSub-genres of crime fiction have a tendency to become predictable and bound by convention. Like its predecessors the country-house murder mysteries of the 1930s and the `hardboiled' private eye stories of the 1940s, the serial killer movie has evolved its own set of rules and conventions. `The Bone Collector' follows the pattern set by its predecessors `The Silence of the Lambs' and `Seven' (or `Se7en' as we are supposed to spell it). A dedicated older cop with an inexperienced but keen younger partner battles against an evil but intellectually brilliant murderer who delights in teasing his adversaries with mind games and deliberate clues.In the real world murder, including serial murder, is not simply an elegant game of chess between killer and detective. Apart from their crimes, the main distinguishing feature of serial killers is their ability to hide evidence from the police. (That, of course, is why they survive to become serial killers; those who do not possess such an ability are generally arrested and imprisoned after their first or second murder). Thus Harold Shipman was able to evade detection for so long because he managed to persuade the world that at least a hundred murders were in fact deaths from natural causes, and a number of other notorious mass-murderers (such as John Christie, Dennis Nilsen and Frederick West) were only caught because bodies were discovered by accident in their homes before the police were even aware that a serial killer was at work. When the police do receive taunting communications (such as the notorious `Yorkshire Ripper' tape) these generally prove to have come from someone other than the killer himself.
Serial killer films may bill themselves as `psychological crime thrillers', but they have as little to do with real crime or real psychology as do those old Agatha Christie stories where the detective solves the murder like a crossword puzzle and then in the final scene announces to the assembled house-guests that the culprit is the butler. Cut off from reality and bound by a number of formulaic rules, they need a gimmick which will enable the audience to distinguish one from another. Thus in `The Silence of the Lambs' (well enough made in its way) the gimmick was the fact that one murderer was helping the FBI catch another, and in `Se7en' (overrated, although it had a genuinely shocking ending) the pattern of killing was based on the concept of the seven deadly sins.The gimmick in `The Bone Collector' that it gives us a disabled detective. This is not a new concept after James Stewart's character in `Rear Window' and the `Ironside' TV series, but Denzel Washington's Lincoln Rhyme is more seriously disabled than either of those after being injured in the line of duty. Rhyme is completely paralysed from the neck down, apart from one finger which he uses to spell out messages on a computer. The actual investigatory work is done by his able-bodied colleague Amelia Donaghy (played by Angelina Jolie).The plot, as is normal in films of this type, is a complex one, and the general look of the film is dark and gloomy. Washington and Jolie play their roles reasonably well, but there is none of the `chemistry' (to use an overused word) that existed between Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster in `The Silence of the Lambs and which helped that film rise above the mundane. The worst thing about the film is that one never gets the impression that one is watching a real-life crime investigation; the whole thing is simply a gruesome intellectual puzzle, concocted for our routine entertainment. And serial killing, even if fictional, should not be something that we find either routine or entertaining. 4/10.",The Bone Collector
27,DKosty123,Not Every Killer Can Silence Lambs,6,22 March 2009,"The cast and the mood in this film are what make it entertaining. Washington & Jolie perform well. Queen Latifa is very good and this is really one of the few films I have seen with her in. Ed O'Nneil gets away from Peg Bundy and the shoe store to become a serious cop in this one.While the plot seems to dig upon a lot of details, the killer motives seem to be a little strange. This serial killer starts off seeming to have a motive for killing, but then seems to veer off totally randomly choosing victims because they are there and killing a cop just for sport at one point in the film.This is one of the least sexy roles I have seen for Jolie. She is obviously attractive in this movie, but not a real sex symbol. This film gives her a more cerebral edge as her love for Washington's character is presented more as an intelligence driven thing rather than being anything physical. Thank goodness her uniforms fit properly as I hate those movies which exploit a woman playing this kind of character by squeezing them into something they can't even bend over in.While this film is not perfect, there are worse ones.

29,sddavis63,Great Suspense Thriller Marred A Bit By A Weak Ending,9,24 July 2008,"Almost the entire way through, ""The Bone Collector"" is a great ride, with a taut story, a great cast and a completely unexpected murderer. Denzel Washington was very strong in a difficult performance as Lincoln Rhyme, an NYPD Crime Scene detective who's paralyzed during an investigation and confined to bed. Even paralyzed, he's still immeasurably more competent than the boob who replaced him as head of the CSU (Cheney, played by Michael Rooker) and he gets involved from his bed in investigating a series of brutal and sadistic murders. I was hesitant at first about Angelina Jolie as Amelia Donaghy, the street cop who discovers the first murder scene, and who Rhyme takes under his wing as his protégé, because he sees something in her suited to forensics. Jolie seemed miscast at first, but then it dawned on me - that's the point. She wanted to work in the Youth Division (which would have been the stereotypical cop role played by an actress like Jolie) but Rhyme sees something in her that no one else sees. Once you realize (pretty quickly) that she's deliberately acting against type, she works brilliantly in the role.In some respects it's a typical whodunit sort of story as Rhyme and Donaghy struggle to put the pieces of the puzzle together, and it's a very good one. When the killer was finally revealed, it took me completely by surprise. I hadn't even suspected. The movie includes a bit of a psychological study of both Rhyme as he deals with his paralysis and Donaghy as she struggles with what she slowly begins to recognize as her calling - one she'd really rather not have.My only quibbles are with one line near the beginning of the movie, when Donaghy is leaving for work and her boyfriend says to her ""my therapist doesn't think this relationship is working for me."" Aside from laughing at the ridiculousness of the line, I wondered throughout the movie why it was even necessary to have the boyfriend included at the start. Then the end of the movie falls into totally unnecessary romanticism. It should have ended with the solving of the murders and with Rhyme realizing that he's still productive in spite of his handicap. Everything in between those two quibbles worked very well, though. 9/10",The Bone Collector

Four years later, and confined to a hospital bed in an incapacitated state that will eventually see him become vegitated, his expertise is called on once more to solve the mystery of a serial killer who's been driving around New York in a taxi cab selecting random victims. He finds a new protégé in Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) and they must work together to catch the killer before he strikes again.Denzel Washington is easily one of my favourite actors, so why I've waited six years to see this fairly acclaimed thriller is beyond me. It's a role that's well suited to him and he commands it naturally, spending the majority of the film in one location, and he has a good co-star in Jolie, who, 24 when the film was made, is catching in a role that was quite advanced for her. The film is weighed down by a knawingly standard (like the film itself) supporting cast, from Michael Rooker as the arrogant a$$hole police captain to character actor favourite Luis Guzman as one of the special team.The film itself works okay as a thriller, but just as that. It's a very ordinary feeling sort of film, and there is nothing that really makes it stand out from many other films of it's type. There are no other faults, other than a plot hole in the shape of none of the victims seeming to possess a cell phone they could call the police on to alert them of their scary predicament, and there are some nice over-shots of the Big Apple to savour, but just don't go expecting anything more than what you've settled down to see. ***",The Bone Collector

34,The-Sarkologist,A twisted psychological thriller,7,28 October 2011,"This movie is a psychological thriller in which a serial killer pits his mind up against a great investigator. The investigator, Lincoln Rymhe, was injured seriously when a girder fell on him, leaving him bedridden and suffering from seizures. At the beginning on the movie he is fed up with his condition and simply wants to die.Then a murder is uncovered by a rather perceptive street cop, who picks up some interesting clues. From here it slowing unravels that the serial killer is actually leaving clues for the police to follow, but the police will have to use all of their intelligence to catch them as the killer is rather devious.There are numerous conflicts in this movie, but it is the conflict that makes a movie. There is the main one in chasing the serial killer, but we also have one between Rhyme and the female officer, as Rhyme attempts to harness her natural ability at investigating while she wishes to work with the youth. Then there is the stupid lieutenant that is trying to work the case himself thinking everybody else is incompetent. The killer is quite smart though because the obvious clue that he plants leads the police down a completely different track.In the end, the movie tries to lead us to think that the lieutenant is actually the killer, but it is obvious that he is not. First of all it is clear that the lieutenant does not think through matters clearly and acts on the first piece of evidence that he gets, even though it might lead him the wrong way. That is probably the ploy of the killer, but the problem here is that the killer is purposefully leaving clues while the lieutenant is openly trying to destroy them. This is illogical for the killer to act in this way, unless he has a split personality, which is pretty lame anyway.All in all, this was a pretty good movie.

Only Angelina and Denzel's performance can be saved.,2,22 September 2019,"This film focuses on Lincoln Rhyme, a prestigious former forensic investigator who withdrew after an accident in service that left him quadriplegic. Sick but far from invalid, he remains a valuable ally of the New York Police, who seek him in more difficult cases. This happened when beat cop Amelia Donaghy found a body in an unusual crime scene, carefully staged to leave messages about a murder yet to be carried out. Unable to move, Rhyme will use Donaghy's eyes, ears and police skills to investigate the crime without leaving home.Okay, we've seen a lot of similar things since there are literally a lot of movies focused on police investigating killers who want to be discovered and leave messages on their crimes. But the problem with this movie is not the lack of originality but the laziness, sloppiness and illogicality of the whole story. Never could a former police officer conduct an ongoing investigation, and even if that were possible he would never do so from home (to give an example of the illogic I referred to). The whole investigation, including Jolie's crime scenes, sounds fake and forced, with evidence coming out of sheer luck or because the character happened to recall a fact that later becomes relevant. But if we are able to ignore or lessen this the movie will roll all the way to the end... that's when things really get off track, for one of the worst endings I've ever seen in a thriller movie. Pure non-sense!Ultimately, its the satisfying work of Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie that saves the movie from being truly bad.

Yes, Se7en and Silence of the Lambs absolutely annihilate this, but for a 90's detective case it's rather compelling. This is what happens when you cast two great leads, a decent film is produced. Much like any other serial killer story, our main characters must find out who the homicidal maniac is before they kill again. The difference is, the forensic expert is paralysed and so he trains an unwilling rookie to solve the case. Murder case aside, it's all about passing on knowledge and skills to another peer in order to complete a task. Rhyme is unable to do anything, so he envisages his own image within Amelia. Turning her from a rookie cop to the perfect forensic investigator. Highlighting the importance of communication and trust. Fortunately Washington and Jolie have decent on screen chemistry. Both their talents put together to create an explosion of raw acting. Jolie plays a tough yet vulnerable officer, Washington juxtaposes this with an experienced performance. The two amalgamate to create the perfect crime solving entity. The crime scenes themselves were visceral and not easy watches, particularly being scolded to death by oncoming steam. I loved the gritty realism that is sustained throughout. It evokes a sense of mystery, we are attempting to solve the case with the characters. Supporting cast were good, nothing outstanding. Although I wanted more Queen Latifah! The killer's reveal was a letdown unfortunately. The final twenty minutes were rushed to what was an intelligently paced thriller.

Only this time our ex hotshot cop/novelist Denzel is a quadriplegic, and we see how he became that way, in it's opening, if cruely illustrated or shown, where the stable beep of a monitor heralds the next scene. Also, our killer, who you won't make out (trust me) has a special weapon, a taxi, with some special, deadly modifications, and as the title says, our nutter collects bone parts, taunting and playing mind games with the NYPD. Enter Jolie, who kicks arse, in her first big starring role, as a uniformed cop, her character, Amelia, once a model too. She's brought in to work with Denzel, who sees promise in her, for slickly handling a near miss of evidence, found on a train track, where she abruptly halts an approaching loco. TBC has a good and likeable pool of actors, a lot of them, really giving good performances, most notably Jolie, and Latifah, who really impresses, as Denzel's carer.

Move over James Patterson. The killer's motive was freshly interesting, a throw off, as you'll see. Denzel and Jolie make a great team, and it's final scene, after story is inspiring, and well appreciated, also unexpected.

He continues to advise forensic police and becomes actively involved in investigating a series of killings where the killer leaves clues deliberately. Angelina Jolie plays a young cop who deals well with a crime scene and is then roped in by Washington to be his eyes and ears at subsequent crime scenes.The whole plot is so incredibly hard to believe. The cliched cops pulling in different directions with some acting outside guidelines and others trying to wrestle control of the case away from Lincoln do not quite ring true as a realistic way a police investigation could be carried out but that is a tiny criticism compared to the more glaring issues:Why does Lincoln entrust, and even force, a young inexperienced cop to carry out forensic investigations of crime scenes alone? She did what he thought was the right thing in her initial treatment of a crime scene but that is not remotely convincing as a reason for Lincoln or commanding officers to let this untrained cop loose on crime scenes alone. Not only that but she proves time and time again to be totally inadequate for this role as she is extremely scared and disturbed by the crime scenes and does numerous things which are bizarrely not shown as problems but would, in reality, totally destroy all forensic evidence. She shoots a rat which would spatter rat remains all over the forensic scene, she handles objects before taking any forensic precautions, photos, prints etc. She is slow and reluctant at all times wasting precious time. She does not show any great insight at all until, predictably, discovering the killer is aiming to kill Lincoln. Something Lincoln in his wisdom, fails to spot. Lincoln even pressures her to saw off the hands of a recently killed victim to remove the handcuffs for evidence without ANY forensic treatment of the scene whatsoever. Nobody has photographed the scene, taken prints, searched for evidence in any way yet he wants her to saw through the victim, covering all the evidence with blood just to get the cuffs!! And she is totally unwilling to do it anyway as she is too squeamish. It is totally bizarre!In addition to all the crazily unconvincing police work we have to try to believe the killer is another former forensics guy motivated by revenge against Lincoln for 'ruining his career' and causing him to go to jail for previously mishandling evidence. I guessed thew guy was the killer as soon as I saw him so it was predictable but it is totally unconvincing that motivated by revenge on Lincoln he carries out an incredibly risky and convoluted series of murders going to exceptional trouble to kill innocent people in bizarre ways just so he can leave a trail of clues which, if Lincoln succeeded in unpicking, would stop him from getting his revenge at all!! Indeed Lincoln fails to spot the clues lead to him being the final victim and the killer makes an attempt on Lincoln's life so what was the point of all the murders and clues?!! It lead nowhere and, in fact, the killer had access to Lincoln numerous occasions in his fake role of helping Lincoln so he could have killed him at any time!! If there was a point to the killings, either leading to an otherwise unavailable opportunity to confront Lincoln or in some way disgracing Lincoln that would be good but there is absolutely no point to all the murders and clues at all. The killer just breaks in and attempts to kill Lincoln as he could have done at any point since his release from jail.Washington then manages to fight the killer off despite being a paraplegic which is hard to believe and Angelina Jolie arrives in the nick of time to rescue him in a predictable, cliched anticlimax. Finally, just to top it all off, Lincoln is then shown in a closing scene up and about in a wheelchair seeming inexplicably healthier, stronger and more independent. There is no mention of the seizures that have blighted his recent life or any explanation given for his incredible improvement in ability to be out of the bed he had been confined to. Then Jolie is revealed to be romantically involved with Lincoln in a final, insultingly cliched and unconvincing happy ending.The good things about the film were that it was well filmed visually, the acting of Washington was engaging and high quality as usual, other acting was not bad and there was brainless entertainment from it all if you just completely do not bother to think about any of it. As a result it would be unfair to rate this 1 or 2 out of 10 as there are worse films around but it cannot be higher than a 3 out of 10 really as it is just so badly thought through and unbelievable.",The Bone Collector

As the city lies in fear, a gifted but disabled detective (Washington) teams with a rookie street cop (Jolie) to go inside the mind of this terrifying madman and defeat him at his own game.Adapted from Jeffrey Deaver's novel, The Bone Collector is a Seven -like thriller , a little morbid, and a bit grisly a psychotic that leaves his victims dead and without their bones. The intriguing element is the fact that the hero, like James Stewart in Rear Window, is confined to bed and has to use someone else to do the legwork, literally.Washington and Jolie are very good here. Jolie gets some background characterization, which helps explain her bitterness, and it takes her a while to warm up to Washington. Washington is also good in a physically limited role, using his facial expressions to relate to the audience. Phillip Noyce does an excellent job of direction and works brilliantly with cinematographer to create an eerie mood , and most audiences will be on the edges of their seats as the climax draws near. A thriller that also manages to focus on the art of mentoring. This film is a very entertaining psychological thriller .",The Bone Collector

In my opinion this is a decent film which is backed by strong acting and crisp screenplay.The acting is superb and both the leads Denzel and Angelina was superb and in my opinion i would tilt my liking little toward Angelina for her impeccably perfect acting.

49,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Slick and grisly serial killer fare,6,11 May 2016,"Philip Noyce's The Bone Collector augments it's atmosphere in the obvious hopes of evoking memories of David Fincher's Sev7n (It's even got an actor who also appeared in that film) which for the most part it nicely does. Story wise, however, it's got entirely it's own thing going on and follows the ever popular path of the serial killer whodunit. In this almost audience interactive sub-genre, we are routinely presented with a host of different characters, some following archetype and others not so much. The identity of the killer could literally be anyone we see on screen at any time, even down to a tiny character who maybe shows up in one small scene. Then it's up to the viewer to race the protagonist towards a correct conclusion, a game which I've never been all that good at lol. This time it's Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie who step up to the batters's plate, hunting a very nasty individual who kidnaps people in locked taxi cabs and leaves them to die in various sadistic ways. Washington plays renowned criminal profiler and ex cop Lincoln Rhyme, left paralyzed from the neck down and bereft of any will to live following an accident. When his old cop buddy (Ed O Neil) shows up and pleads him to take a gander at the case files of the new killer, he reluctantly dusts off the old instincts and goes on the hunt. Problem is, he's a turnip from the neck down and needs an avatar with whom he has a rapport with and can carry out the leg work, so to speak. He takes a shine to young patrol woman Amelia Donaghy (Jolie) who is showing early signs of the same forensic brilliance after she responds to the scene of one of the murders. She becomes an extension of him, and together they work to smoke out the killer and put a stop to his crimes, also bringing some kind of peace to Rhyme's restless mind in the same stroke. They are hassled by the world's most belligerent and obnoxious Police Captain (Michael Rooker in full on asshole mode) and helped by Rhyme's kindly nurse assistant (a very good Queen Latifah). There's also work from Bobby Cannavle, Leland Orser, Luis Guzman, Mike Mcglone and David Warshofsky too. Noyce is a solid and very slick director (he did wonderful work in the Jack Ryan franchise, as well as the very underrated The Saint), gamely shunting his aesthetic into the serial killer vs. Detective corner. It's a decidedly grisly affair, despite the glossy sheen and big names, and almost veers into outright horror in places, but is always kept in line by the excellent chemistry and friendship between Jolie and Washington, who are both great on their own and as a team. Good stuff.",The Bone Collector
50,drownnnsoda,"Chilling, Above-Average Crime Thriller.",8,29 April 2007,"""The Bone Collector"" centers around a Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie), a New York city cop who is assigned to the case of a brutal serial killer who is picking off citizens and collecting the bones of their fingers. Teamed with a quadriplegic retired detective who is familiar with the killer, Lincoln (Denzel Washington), Amelia begins a desperate search to find the killer, linked to the paralyzed Lincoln through sound and video equipment, before another person falls victim to the brutal serial killer.An above-average crime thriller, ""The Bone Collector"" is a chilling and nicely done film. I saw this movie when I was fairly young (my grandmother had read the novel the film was based upon, decided to rent it, and I was in the room as she watched it), and it really petrified me. The image of that partial finger sticking up out of the gravel pit in the beginning of the film never left my mind, and the movie as a whole creeped me out. Now, years later, I've seen the film a few other times and while it wasn't nearly as scary to me (it's really not a 'scary' film), it is still a very well done crime film that is above most others. The plot is nicely tied together, and while I'm not sure how this compares to the book, the storyline this film is constructed around is nicely done.Angelina Jolie leads the cast with a fairly well-rooted role, and plays it very well. Denzel Washington is like her mentor, and while he has hardly any motion or body language throughout the film, his performance is really great. Queen Latifah plays Washington's caregiver, and I was surprised to see her acting in a serious role - she was good as well. Character development and motivation is a little lacking here (a lot is left unexplained), but I didn't see too much of a problem with this. The direction here is nice as well, lots of gloomy atmosphere, dark sets, and moody camera angles. There are some pretty chilling scenes in this movie as well, all of the unfortunate people who fall in the hands of the killer meet gruesome fates, and some of these scenes were really cringe-worthy and scary. The killer in this movie is menacing, and is presented well throughout until his identity is revealed.Overall, ""The Bone Collector"" is a really nicely done, eerie crime thriller that is worth watching. People who enjoy crime movies and/or thrillers will want to check this one out, it's well above-average and is surprisingly chilling. While it may be no ""Silence of the Lambs"", it's still worthy. 8/10.",The Bone Collector

54,Spleen,"Silly, tiresome and distasteful.",3,29 March 2000,"I'll start by saying why it's silly.I don't think it's giving anything away to say that when the killer is unveiled it turns out to be someone we've met.  But of course, you say. One expects no less of a detective story.  Fine: but this isn't a detective story, and to the extent that it thinks it is, it labours under a delusion. This is a story about the tracking down of a serial killer, and serial killers are like wild animals.  In a story about the hunting down of a tiger there's no requirement that we meet a tiger in scene two who turns out - surprise! - to be the same tiger who has secretly been killing people ever since.  Imagine how silly ""Silence of the Lambs"" would have looked if the man Starling was tracking had turned out to be her hairdresser, or something of that kind.This failure of tone, culminating in an utterly ridiculous confrontation with a killer who kindly explains his motives to the audience, is the main problem, but many subsidiary problems help make it impossible to take anything seriously.  When Amelia discovers the ""first"" body she takes photos of everything on a disposable Kodak camera.  Then we see the photos, and they have a level of resolution you wouldn't believe - at any rate, I didn't believe it.  Lincoln Rhyme and pores over the microscopic forensic evidence in order to make rather fantastic deductions from the presence of, say, petrol, or oyster shell particles - but there is a ruddy great big lead staring them in the face all the time: the fact that the killer owns and drives a taxi.  Why doesn't someone try to trace THAT?  But nooo, they'd rather peer at the ground through their magnifying glasses and do the Sherlock Holmes routine: ""These footprints were made by a six-foot red-headed man who smokes a pipe and was born in February.""  And when everything is revealed at the end, it just makes no sense.  The killer has been trying to attract Lincoln's attention - yet, quite apart from the fact that he seems to be generally omniscient, he KNOWS that Lincoln was confined to a bed, out of touch with the outside world, and, for some of the time, in a coma.As for ""tiresome"" and ""distasteful"" ... first of all it needs to be said that none of the emotional keyboard-playing really worked.  Amelia and Lincoln seemed likeable enough people, but we were no reason to believe in ANY feelings they might have felt for each other: love, lust, friendship, mutual respect, mild affection - all are unexplained bolts from the blue. And the anti-euthanasia preaching was sickening.  Lincoln's problem (we are told) is that he suffers from a seizure every few days, any one of which could turn him into a vegetable; and, not unreasonably, he would rather die than be a vegetable.  At the end of the film he STILL has this problem. Nothing has changed.  Yet he has mysteriously decided not to kill himself after all.  (Surprise, surprise.)  What makes it more mysterious is that otherwise this is a standard last-case-before-retirement movie.  There's nothing dramatically wrong with a policeman who has just completed his last case before retirement, to retire.  It's what we expect.  But somehow I can't see a mainstream film, certainly not THIS craven film, allowing its central character it say, ""Well, I've had a good innings, but I HAD decided it was time to die, and so it is.""  Bah!  It would be fine if he'd changed his mind for some reason or other, but no reason is given.Apart from this it's hard to analyse the feeling of nastiness that pervades this film.  The comparison with ""Silence of the Lambs"" suggests something to me.  Despite its gruesome moments, the earlier film had a warmth that ""The Bone Collector"" conspicuously lacks.  ""Silence of the Lambs"" felt for its characters.  ""The Bone Collector"" couldn't care less.  There's a telling moment when the killer's umpteenth victim turns out to be a small girl: everyone gasps in horror and says, ""Oh, no - he's got a child!"" - as if it would have been perfectly all right for him to have captured and tortured another adult.",The Bone Collector

People are being mysteriously murdered; Denzel Washington's and Jolie's characters become friends and try to understand the clues the murder is leaving, but it may be not that easy. Be prepared to see investigations like they happen in ""CSI""; many of the deductions used here and in that series are impossible to be thought in real life, so it sadly screams ""Hollywood"" in some scenes. Directing is one thing to be appreciated here, as well as the acting; my main problem is with the script full of clichés and things that are only possible in Hollywood. Also, I found quite lame the excuse for the murder to kill all these people; I was actually expecting to see a big twist in the end, with the murder being someone from the current police team.

57,eric262003,Too Much Coincidence To Hold One's Interest,6,8 February 2016,"It never seems to amaze me, but even through the most contrived films out there, Denzel Washington could still pull off an amazing thriller. His body language in his comfort zone which is why he more often gets cast as an athlete or a military personnel. He truly has the gift of the gab and ""The Bone Collector' clearly exemplifies that. It's a bit shameful that Washington is for most of the film quadriplegic. In ""The Bone Collector"", Washington is a forensics specialist named Lincoln Rhyme who works for the NYPD. In the opening scene at the lower depths of the subway station, he's hit by a beam which was the cause for his immobility. As a result, the only joints that are still in tact are a finger, his shoulders and his brain. In order for this film to work, requires someone extraordinary to equally match Mr. Washington's talents. In one of her earlier starring roles Angelina Jolie steps up to the plate as a rookie detective Amelia Donaghy who's been assigned to fill in his running fieldwork for him. And even though she's drenched in sex appeal, backed by a upbeat soundtrack and a tantalizing view of the Manhattan skyline, ""The Bone Collector"" could still be a potential dust collector.The plot involving a methodical, macabre sadistic killer with clues scattered around is unoriginal of a story, and it reminds us all of the 1995 film ""Se7en"", but at least in the aforementioned story, it is executed more subliminally. Some of Rhyme's conclusions are illogical and implausible. Spending most of the film planted flat on his back, Mr. Rhyme is able to unravel esoteric clues with pieces of bones and skin particles situated overhead, like Velma of ""Scooby Doo"" fame, he can easily trace these small clue fragments towards the murderer being a NYC cab driver committing sadistic acts from over a hundred years ago. Rhyme is able to track down the killer's next whereabouts located to what appears to be a old slaughterhouse. Rhyme is able to know exactly which one it is. Based on the best-selling novel by Jeffrey Deaver, the script by Jeremy Iacone, ""The Bone Collector"" had the potential to be a very intriguing mystery thriller in the same vein like Sherlock Holmes, the only problem that makes this film too unbelievable was that Rhyme was never once wrong about all his fragmented evidence. And to top it all off, wasn't it just coincidental that Queen Latifah as Nurse Thelma who seems very savvy at putting pieces together almost like it was a hobby to her. And another reason this film is not mind-numbing brain work can be found in the cab itself. If you look closely on the rear-view mirror, you will see a doll with a noose tied around his neck. I mean would you hop into a New York cab seeing something like that? To all cabbies watching this movie I'd advise you to avoid this one, unless you want your clients to fear you that you might drive them to a slaughterhouse. Even though this film's genre is billed as a psychological thriller, it actually work better as a romantic drama. It might not look that way, but through watchful eyes I can see the connection. We can see through the character of Jolie's character Amelia Donaghy. From her evidence she unraveled from the killer's first victim, Rhyme narrowly believes that Donaghy has the talent for forensic science, but it's clearly obvious she is still very green in experience. He also believes that she is the only one who is capable of digging up evidence to clue-searching. I'm sure the NYPD can find more experienced people than her. I think he's hiring her because he loves her company. Director Philip Noyce's close-ups of Rhyme looking over his inexperienced cohort. Sure she's nice on the eyes and the way they look at each other, it shows they have feelings for one another.The performances are what makes this story at least not a complete letdown. Second-generation performer Jolie bears a striking resemblance towards her father Jon Voight in the classic film ""Midnight Cowboy."" Knowing her dominance and charisma, she really can out-perform her cohorts whether she's playing leading or supporting roles. Washington lets his eyes metaphorically do the talking, his intelligence is what carries the movie quite well. Next to Morgan Freeman, Washington is able to embody an infallible detective none the better.",The Bone Collector
58,philip_vanderveken,"It is a good movie, but not excellent.",6,27 September 2004,"The Bone Collector is a good movie, but it is far from excellent. There were too many things that annoyed me to make it perfect. The actors' performances were good. Denzel Washington is a great actor as he shows in this movie and Angelina Jolie did a good job as well. But good actors alone isn't enough to support an entire movie. There needs to be a good script as well.The first 30 minutes were just too mixed up to keep me completely focused. I always had the feeling the director didn't already know where he wanted to go with his movie during the first half hour. Afterwards the movie was more straightforward and became a lot better. What bothered me as well were the cliché's used in this movie. You've got the good cop versus the bad cop, the good cop that solves all the problems while the bad one that tries to stop him in his investigations... It's all done so many times before but you can find it again in this movie.Denzel Washington is Lincoln Rhyme, the former head of forensics in New York City who got cripled at a crime scene. 'Former' because he isn't able to move anything except for his shoulders, his head and one finger. Even though he is almost entirely paralyzed, he remains a valuable consultant to the police. Angelina Jolie is Amelia Donaghy, a former model who has become a street cop, and Rhymes's protege.Overall I would say this is a good movie, which would have got a 7,5/10 from me, if the start was a lot better and if there weren't as many cliché's in it.

Angelina Jolie plays the young cop who finds the body and collects the forensic details. Washington's character is so impressed that he makes her secondment a condition of his assistance with the crime. At first she begrudges the idea; she had a nice safe desk-job lined up.But - it's a movie. She quickly gets a taste for the criminally exotic and a bit of a crush upon our hero.We join our dynamic duo as they pursue a series of clues in an attempt to anticipate each subsequent crime and save the victims from very gruesome deaths.This is a pretty formulaic thriller which carries a hint of de-ja-vu because there are so many in the genre. Helicopter flights around night-lit sky-scrapers? No CSI would be complete without them. The ambiance in particular reminds me of 'Silence Of The Lambs'; the murders are about as diabolical, there's a lot of Gothic imagery; even the theme and incidental music sounds like it might have been cloned from the earlier movie. The ending smacks of 'Rear Window'. That said; it's extremely intelligently filmed with some very nice set pieces. The leads give good turns with some excellent support from the likes of Queen Latifah and Luis Guzman. There's a solid sound-effects/incidental music track with plenty of deep, visceral tones.I found the denouement a little confusing. Washington's character accuses the villain of deliberately planting evidence in criminal investigations. The villain insists that isn't so. It is not made clear exactly who is telling the truth, and there was scope for an interesting little twist here that was never taken up. There's a cheesy and not very believable epilogue.When you see how much money is to be made in media and fashion, a good-looking woman like Ms Jolie's character would hardly seek out the uncertainties of a police career when she might otherwise 'not get out of bed for less than £10,000'. Anybody know any gorgeous cops? Jolie's just too pretty to be true.This movie would score more highly but that there is so much competition in the crime-thriller genre. Definitely worth a watch - but then most of them are. They remind me of new cars; all very competent but so much alike.",The Bone Collector

The new communication technologies allow the detective to run and orient the investigation and the action outside in the field for the policewoman and the other assistants while he stays bedridden at home. This is all presented in a sequence of images, sequences and dialogues that keep the viewer very interested till the end. The story (as it is fully revealed in the end) is however weak and rather unbelievable in what concerns the investigation developments chiefly by the too quick way our super-detective runs into definitive conclusions and follows successfully clues based on very weak material elements of evidence.

Its plot, which was adapted from Jeffery Deaver's novel of the same name, features a cat and mouse game that involves a brilliant forensics expert and a sadistic serial killer who takes pleasure in taunting his pursuers by leaving clues at the scenes of his crimes As these clues provide leads to where and when the next murder will take place, the police find themselves in a constant race against time as they desperately try to discover the identity of the killer and bring his reign of terror to an end before any more people are needlessly killed.Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is the forensics expert who, during his career with the NYPD, became highly respected for his ability to solve cases by using his exceptional skills. Having been bedridden for four years (since he was crippled by a beam that accidentally fell on him), his depression has grown so deep that he's started to arrange his own ""final transition"" with the aid of a friend who's agreed to assist with his suicide. Rhyme regularly suffers seizures and his greatest fear is that one of these will leave him in a vegetative state.Although he says that he only has the use of one finger, his shoulders and his brain, he also has some sophisticated computer equipment which he puts to good use in his work. Because of the high esteem in which he's held by the NYPD, he's been kept on the payroll and is regularly asked to help out on their more challenging cases. Just such a case arises when a patrol cop called Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) discovers a dead body buried under gravel beside some train tracks and collects various pieces of evidence that are lying nearby.When the evidence and Amelia are brought to Rhyme's Manhattan apartment, he's very impressed by the young street cop's work and insists that she should help him with his further investigations because she obviously has a natural instinct for forensics work. After overcoming her initial reluctance to pass up on the desk job that she's due to transfer to imminently, Rhyme and Amelia start to work together. Rhyme quickly deduces from the available evidence, the identity of the killer's next victim and the likely location of the murder. Amelia then assists by examining the site and acting as Rhyme's eyes and ears as he gives her instructions through her headset. Rhyme's deductions are proved to be correct and the evidence that Amelia collects at the crime scene, makes it evident that they're dealing with a serial killer and that he's following a set modus operandi. This continues until, chillingly, the evidence found at one of the crime scenes points to Rhyme being the next victim.""The Bone Collector"" is an entertaining psychological thriller that's particularly enjoyable because of its two main stars and the way in which they work together so well. Denzel Washington overcomes the problem of his character being permanently immobile by the sheer quality of his performance and Angelina Jolie, in her first starring role, makes the changes that Amelia goes through in her work and her relationship with Rhyme seem very natural and convincing. The supporting cast is also good with Luis Guzman providing most of the humour.",The Bone Collector
65,TheUnknown837-1,"my opinion may not be shared with most critics, but I liked this movie",7,18 October 2008,"I am fully aware of the fact that most film critics here in the United States did not approve very highly of the 1999 Denzel Washington film ""The Bone Collector"". But despite the fact that only twenty-eight percent of them would agree with me, I think that ""The Bone Collector"" is a well-made mystery thriller with solid performances, especially toward Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie, a good plot, great tension, and a well-executed story.Academy Award-winner Denzel Washington plays a quadriplegic detective who is asked to help with an investigation dealing with a serial killer operating in New York. He appoints a rather reluctant female detective played by Angelina Jolie to lead the investigation outside his hospital room since he cannot walk himself. He communicates with her through radio, giving her hints and tactics as they try to figure out who the killer is, who he will strike next, and how they can stop him.Yes, this plot is one that has been reused many times and this yet another case. But just because you reuse a plot does not mean the end product is going to be horrible and not entertaining. I myself enjoyed ""The Bone Collector"" and did not find one scene where I was bored, even though I had a pretty good idea on what was going to happen next. It gets a strong rating for its performances, action scenes, and good general entertainment value.",The Bone Collector

It deals with amateur cop and amateur police actions, and immovable man. Everything is so shallow, predictable, negative, and too much talk. Also presence of hot girl makes everything even more typical and negative because it inflames feelings of desperation in us, showing us how the guy has no chance for the girl, both in real life including personal life, and in this movie, as in most movies. TV series like CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000) are much better and filled with more surprises and emotions for crime scene and police work lovers.

Most of part consumed only in collecting evidence, getting clues from it and solved the puzzle. Actual capturing the killer is not done even till the end. The killer presents himself to Denzel and we can saw him only then. This is drawback of such thriller and we missed real thrill of tracing and capturing the serial killer. Denzel and Angelina done well acting but not impressive. Climax is well but end is expected and not much twisted. We remember that this movie is from 1999 when typical movies were made. There are many unbelievable thing in the movie like investigation by handicapped Denzel, leaving clues by killer, his final appearance in the hospital, using book to kill innocent people etc and many.

70,jhclues,Some Chilling Moments,7,13 September 2000,"**May Contain Spoilers**  Director Phillip Noyce delivers an atmospheric thriller with `The Bone Collector,' a somewhat grisly tale of a serial killer in New York City.  Homicide detective Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is an expert in the field of forensics; he has also been a quadriplegic for four years, the result of an accident sustained during the investigation of a crime scene.  From the neck down he has the use of only a single finger, with which he controls a computer and monitor from his bed. Useless though his body may be, his mind is still sharp, and circumstances bring him together with a young NYPD officer, Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie), who has just received a long sought after transfer to the Youth Services Division.  Destiny takes her elsewhere, however.  		When she is the first officer to arrive at a crime scene, Donaghy proceeds to secure the area and take the appropriate measures to insure that any evidence is not compromised.  Rhyme is consulted on the case (a murder), and takes note of the precision employed  by Donaghy in handling the crime scene.  When he meets her, he learns that while at the academy she had read one of his books on the subject (He has written a dozen, on forensics and related issues). Rhyme then presses her into service as his eyes and ears, to physically do at a crime scene what he cannot, by talking her through each step via radio. Reluctant initially, Donaghy soon exhibits an affinity for forensics and becomes much more than merely the physical extension of Rhyme; they become partners, and continue with the case accordingly. 	`The Bone Collector' offers some chilling moments, especially in two scenes, one of which involves a steam pipe, the other, lots of rats.  In each case, it is all the more horrifying because the victims can see exactly what is about to happen to them, they have time to think about it, and there is absolutely nothing they can do about it.  It makes for an eerie, disconcerting story, and though inherently dark it never descends to the appalling level of a predecessor in the genre, `Seven.'  Washington gives a top notch performance, keeping Rhyme interesting though confined to bed for the entire movie, and Jolie takes Amelia to a believable level that far surpasses the typical ingenue rendering of such characters.  Unfortunately, character development, on the whole, is sacrificed for sensationalism; with the exception of Rhyme, whose character is readily established, we are offered mere glimpses of the rest.  We have hints as to what motivates Amelia, but we are left guessing as to the agenda of Captain Cheney (Michael Rooker).  Along the way, some characters are used like obstacles thrown into the path of a race track (Cheney is one, a bookstore clerk is another), with the sole intent of manipulating the audience.  With a little more depth, this could have been a remarkable movie.  												The supporting cast includes Queen Latifah, who brings a welcome presence to the film as Rhyme's nurse, Thelma; Ed O'Neill (Detective Sellitto); Leland Orser (Richard Thompson); Mike McGlone (Detective Solomon), Luis Guzman (Eddie Ortiz); and Arthur Holden (Bookstore clerk).  While this film provides for some real gut wrenching reactions, it is not `The Silence of the Lambs.'  On a dark night, however, when you're alone in your living room with nothing but the flickering of the television and the wind howling outside, it'll do.  I rate this one 7/10.",The Bone Collector

The shame is his leading lady in this film,not known for her acting ability but for her gormless expressions and lip pouting and she certaily does a lot of it in this film. The Bone collector is about a serial Killer who kidnaps people from the back of his taxi and leaves the minutist forensic clues for the rookie cop,Angelina Jolie( and rookie actress by the look of it) to find out who the killer is. Although this film does leave a lot of questions unanswered it is also very clever and very scary too.

73,TOMASBBloodhound,Good acting makes contrived thriller watchable.,6,23 January 2011,"Just imagine the time, luck, and unlimited resources these serial killers in today's thrillers must have. Though not as ridiculous as the Saw films, The Bone Collector is yet another of these contemporary movies in which it isn't enough for a killer to simply be a homicidal maniac. He must also set up elaborate death scenes in some of the most Gothic old places, and leave clues for the police to keep them interested. This script is preposterous on many, many levels, yet the film is acted and photographed well enough that we don't turn the channel. As long as its over by the kickoff of the NFC Championship game, which luckily it was.The film stars Denzel Washington is a criminal forensics expert who is paralyzed and lives in his bed with a myriad of computer and medical equipment all around him. An accident on a crime scene years ago caused his current situation. But once this current case heats up, his apartment is big enough for an entire investigative team to set up an operations center inside it. The NYPD must have a hell of a disability pension available for someone like him to have such a huge place. He even has his own live-in nurse played by Queen Latifah! Angelia Jolie arrives on the scene as a beat cop(!) who impresses Washinton with her evidence gathering instincts at an early crime scene left by our killer. Washington soon has her off the beat and working as his main person on each fresh crime scene. This killer leaves plenty of victims with cryptic clues nearby. He is trying to tell us something. But what??? Maybe if we piece it all together, we can figure out who he is!!!Well, we the audience would have no chance. The conclusions that Washington comes up with seem to be pulled out of thin air. Or the deep recesses of his encyclopedic mind. There is just no way these clues could be pieced together so quickly by real cops. Jolie helps him out here and there, but she is mostly there to look at. And she was a looker back then! Ever since she hooked up with Brad Pitt, she has looked anorexic. Michael Rooker is on hand as the obvious suspect Capt. Chaney. He is hostile to all the good cops for no logical reason except to make us think he's the killer. And obviously he cannot be since the conclusion could never be so obvious. Why would he as the killer leave clues, and then forbid the only cops who can solve them from working the scene? So obviously we are being set up for someone out of left field to be the killer. Actually this person came from out in the parking lot if we are to use baseball stadium references. Maybe never before has there been a more arbitrary killer. Why did they even let him have a ""talking killer moment""? We don't know anything about the events he's talking about, so why should we care? The acting is generally very good, even from supporting players. The cast is populated with several familiar faces. Their dialog is good enough, and said with conviction. But many scenes don't add up in how they are blocked. How can one woman with little forensic training waltz into a cavernous and dirty old slaughterhouse and locate not only the victim, but also some tiny clues so quickly in all that debris? How can the killer (who also drives a taxi) happen to know exactly where and when the kinds of victims he needs will be so he can conveniently give them the last ride of their lives? Did he wait in front of Union Station for hours until an older man and a little girl walked out alone together? Wouldn't that hold up the taxi line? At least the city looked good in one of the last major films made before 9/11/2001 when its skyline was changed forever. 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.",The Bone Collector

There isn't much more that this film has to offer outside violence - and Angelina Jolie. I definitely won't be putting this film into my collection.

The Bone Collector is about a young, female NYPD Officer who uses the help of a very intelligent but paralyzed detective to find a serial killer. It's safe to say The Bone Collector took a page out of Lambs' book. Probably the biggest difference between the two is that one is vastly inferior.I will say this much, that the film certainly had its aspirations. It tried to be a mysterious and clever film that led you through a dark and twisty path. Only it didn't. It has no atmosphere or style and nothing it presents is that convincing. The film's most impactful moment is the reveal of the killer's identity. However, most intuitive viewers will probably find it fairly easy to guess who it is.

Everybody is too familiar with the plot. ** (out of four).",5,8 January 2001,"THE BONE COLLECTOR / (1999) ** (out of four)By Blake French:	Everybody has seen it, the notorious suspense thriller in which a serial killer madman plays cat and mouse games with a distressed cop; seldom are movies as predictable, dispensable, or formulaic. One of the most recent in this generation's trend of serial killer movies is called ""The Bone Collector,"" and stars Golden Globe winning actor Denzel Washington and the sexy actress, Angelina Jolie. As often true, the production is well acted, directed with focus and precision by Philip Noyce (""The Saint,"" ""Patriot Games""), and creates an appropriate mood for its characters. But even big stars and a appropriate atmosphere cannot save a movie this familiar and predictable. 	Denzel Washington plays a heroic cop named Lincoln Rhyme. He is an underdeveloped character, however, the screenplay supplies him with a vast reputation and experiences as a cop; he has written a dozen books on crime scene tactics and his mind in an encyclopedia of crime solving methods. As the movie opens, he is paralyzed at a crime site, leaving him bedridden in his Manhattan apartment with control of only a single index finger. His headquarters  is decorated with all sorts of high-tech gadgets and a kind nurse named Thelma (Queen Latifah), who is always there for him when he goes into violent seizures.	A few gruesome murders transpire, leaving a rookie cop, Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie), whose assistance is selected by the paralyzed but smart cop who uses her as his body to stop the psychopathic serial killer. The killer uses a taxi cap to lure his victims to their final and disturbing death. What is most bothersome about this production is that it teases us with intriguing implications of the graphic murders instead of portraying guts and irony by exploiting the supposedly grotesque images.	The production consists mainly of sequences in which various characters loom in dark hallways, allies, rooms, or sets designed specifically for the killer to lurk around in. Of course there is plenty of suspenseful music and a few surprising moments, but the actual story greatly lacks imagination and edge. Angelina Jolie is the movie's standout performance, but she is mainly used as a plot device to explore such areas as listed above. 
	""The Bone Collector"" is not a horrible movie, just a recycled one. The material has been experienced so many times before we can never become too involved in the story or too interested with the characters. What bothers me most is how this kind of story has no cause or purpose; the serial killer's motive, as always, is explained during the climax sequence, and is disposable and contrived. Why do screenwriters create killers with disturbing motives, but no reasoning behind them? Kind of defeats the purpose of rationalism, doesn't it.",The Bone Collector
82,FlickJunkie-2,Excellent detective story,9,18 March 2000,"This intelligent crime story is an excellent addition to the genre.  It combines some time honored plot elements with some nuances and twists to provide an effective and intriguing story that has viewers wracking their brains along with the characters to figure out ""who done it"".I was prepared to dislike this film when I rented it because I've increasingly felt that the politically correct crowd in Hollywood has gone overboard lately in their use of films as diversity training for the masses. I was expecting preachy subtext about how the handicapped can be heroes too.   Though that message was inherent in the fact that the hero was a quadriplegic,  I came away feeling that the disability was an essential plot element and was not used for shameless sermonizing.The quadriplegic element was actually an effective novelty in a genre that is often criticized (as was this film) for its lack of originality.  The story's calculating serial killer with a very specific motive was a welcome change from oft used psychopath on the rampage.  So, unlike many who have excoriated this script for lacking freshness, I felt it had a lot of good angles that distinguished it in a genre that has been greatly over plowed. Though a novel murder mystery is as hard to come by as a novel romance, that doesn't mean that such familiar themes can no longer be entertaining.Director Phillip Noyce combines mystery, suspense, and graphic violence and delivers the total package with great impact.  He is extremely effective in his use of the camera to heighten the effect of scenes through extreme close ups, top down shots and interesting perspective shots.  His use of sound is also very compelling as on numerous occasions I found myself startled right out of my seat (having the DTS version of the DVD probably enhanced this effect). The underground sets were fantastic and lent an eerie reality to the historic broken down locations where the crimes were set.The acting by Denzel Washington was first rate.  He is particularly effective in thoughtful, intelligent roles where his character has to think his way through the film while dealing with emotional baggage.  This was a particularly difficult role because he had to deliver the impact of the character without the use of his body, making his facial expressions and voice his only dramatic weapons.  Given these constraints, he did an outstanding job of presenting a dynamic and powerful portrayal.Angelina Jolie has proven once again that she is a serious dramatic talent. She consistently eschews the fluffy girlie roles to take on difficult characters.  She was hard as nails and convincing as the intuitive forensics cop.  It was she who made the chemistry work between Lincoln and Amelia by creating an emotional barrier of spiteful cynicism and then slowly letting it down as Lincoln gained her respect.  She has the range to effectively portray grit and vulnerability in the same character which is no small order.I gave this film a 9/10.  As crime dramas go, it was terrific.  The graphic violence is not for everyone, but if you enjoy a good taut murder mystery, you can't go wrong with this film.",The Bone Collector

OK, suspend any reality around about now.The stunning Angelina Jolie is excellent as his rookie sidekick, and the story works well all the way through.

So here is a rarity; a thriller with brains, and one that is unpredictable and manages to give a good few thrills. Unfortunately it doesn't live up to its full potential.After an accident on the job left Lincoln Rhyme almost completely paralyzed and living with seizures. Rhyme is not a happy person. Enter a killer whose grisly crime is photographed by a street cop named Amelia (Angelina Jolie) who actually read the textbook he wrote, and together they are trying to solve the killer's puzzles before the next victim dies.""The Bone Collector"" is not your average serial killer movie. Apart from being pretty smart and unpredictable, it doesn't go to formula. This isn't a ""whodunit"" (although that question is always at the back of everyone's mind). It's more of a race against time, and it comes in short bursts, and not in one long stretch. It's an effective approach, and director Philip Noyce knows what he's doing; he's done this kind of a movie before.There are two problems with ""The Bone Collector,"" and they are big ones: stiff characters and lack of depth. First off, the characterization is poor. One can't really blame this on any one factor; the actors don't make the characters likable, the director keeps them at an arm's distance, and the writing leaves everyone underdeveloped. It's hard to care about someone when you don't know (or even like) them. The second problem lies mainly with the director. Philip Noyce uses wide, expansive shots everywhere, and while the shot choices make for a unique experience, it doesn't really suit the material, and it makes the viewer feel detached from the characters and the story. Worse, it makes the film seem like a hollow shell that touches all the bases without having the guts to really get into the story.Still, ""The Bone Collector"" works. It's a unique thriller, and one that manages to live up to its genre name. Imperfect, but there's enough good stuff here to warrant a viewing.",The Bone Collector

87,bregund,Doesn't really work,3,14 February 2007,"I'm sure this movie was a fairly enjoyable book, but as a film it doesn't quite come together.The biggest flaw in the film is that there is no incentive for Rhyme to recruit Amelia, who has zero forensic or detective experience. She's a beat cop, with no qualifications whatsoever. His motive for wanting her on the case is never clearly defined; what can she offer other than be a newcomer that he can mold in his image? I could possibly accept that scenario, but not when the clock is ticking on all the victims, and an experienced person would be better suited to the task.I'll echo the sentiment of other reviewers who said the end was weak. The killer's elaborate explanation was ridiculous; what it all amounts to is that he was just playing with Rhyme's head, for a slight that happened years earlier.You won't miss much if you don't see this movie, unless you like Angelina Jolie, or you want to see Queen Latifah's caveman-style acting.",The Bone Collector

The plot was definitely gripping and had you on the edge of your seat. Wondering who the killer is or will they catch them? The intensity and suspense is built throughout really well and is just overall a really interesting watch.I will say that the ending wasn't so much of a ""twist"" as I had imagined and I could kind of see where the killer was heading around the midway region. However, the build up to the end and the overall plot more than makes up for it. It's the journey. Jolie's character the first hour or so is a proper pain in the ass as well, keeps whining and I was sat there thinking I don't want to deal with her for 2 hours, but her arc was really good and in the end you love her.Overall I really enjoyed this.

A great cast is of course one of the reasons why the film works: Denzel Washington is one of the finest American actors working right now, and he does a great job here, and Angelina Jolie was okay. I also liked Michael Rooker's performance, and one can only hope that he gets more leads in the future, he is brilliant here and he was fantastic in ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,"" he's also been good in e.g. ""Bastard Out of Carolina"".Where ""The Bone Collector"" is successful, apart from the acting, is in the suspense. Many thrillers are better in that area than this film, of course, but I thought it was quite suspenseful. However, it tries to be ""Seven"" and here is where it fails miserably, and I say that not even being a fan of ""Seven"". However, it's quite suspenseful, the acting works, and as entertainment it's an okay film. (6/10)",The Bone Collector
91,chrisbrown6453,"I must admit, I had my doubts about seeing The Bone Collector.",7,15 May 2002,"The fact that I knew for the entire movie, Denzel Washington would be sitting in a bed, made me think that this couldn't be that good a film. I figured that Angelina Jolie would then become the entire focus, and I wasn't sure she could carry this type of movie. But I was mistaken. Yes Denzel was in bed the entire movie, but he had all these cool computer gadgets to help him out, and this way Jolie didn't have to become the focal point of the film, she could still ride shotgun to the amazing acting ability of Denzel.
Denzel plays Lincoln Rhymes, a forensics detective who was paralyzed while on a case. For 4 years he has been in bed knowing that at any moment he could have a seizure that would kill him, and he decides to go out on his own terms. But before he can do that, a serial killer is found to be on the loose in New York, and Rhymes is the only one who can stop him. But since he is bed ridden, he needs the eyes and ears of someone else to help him out. Those eyes and ears (and lips) come in the form of Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie). She was supposed to go into the Youth Crime department, but gets chosen to help with forensics because Rhymes feels she has the instincts to do the job right. The killer leaves clues as to who he is, and who the next victim will be. Brutal death after brutal death until the next victim is a cop. This movie felt that same as The General's Daughter. In that movie, you had a murder that had a lot of suspects. When they finally revealed who the killer was, I kept thinking that the way the movie was set up, it could have been anybody, and all they had to do was give the killer a reason. But there was nothing that I could see that would have led me to guess who the actual killer was. It's the same way in The Bone Collector. When the killer was finally revealed, there was just a simple reason given as to why he killed all those people. And there was nothing shown in the film, no clues or anything, that would have led you to figure it out. I haven't figured out if I like this kind of ending. I suppose if there were clues and I had figured it out before the end, I would be complaining about how the movie gave too much away. So either way I'd complain. But besides the quick ending, I thought the rest of the movie was pretty good. Denzel gave yet another great performance. Even from a bed, he has the ability to command the screen and everyone on it. Angelina Jolie was able to hold her own against Denzel and even give some back to him at times. Although it bothered me that for the first hour she mostly just yelled and cried. The supporting cast was just that, it supported the main stars. Queen Latifah, Michael Rooker, and Ed O'Neill stayed in the back, coming out to help Denzel and Angelina when they needed it, but mostly staying out of the way. I liked the brutality of the killings. Nothing glamorized here. I liked the fact that the cops weren't able to save everyone, the director actually let people die instead of making the cops heroes all the time. From one of the commercials to the film, it has been compared to both Silence of the Lambs and Seven. I thought that The Bone Collector wasn't as good as Silence of the Lambs or as brutal and dark as Seven but it was good in its own right. Strong performances from the lead stars and a dark and mysterious script helped make this a good movie to see. The ending I felt was a little too rushed and easy, but it didn't take away from the film. So overall I thought The Bone Collector was an enjoyable movie.",The Bone Collector
92,bat-5,Not bad.,7,10 November 1999,"As the thriller genre goes, The Bone Collector is a fairaddition.  It doesn't rise to the level of Seven or The Silenceof the Lambs, but it also doesn't fall into the depths ofSliver, which was also directed by Phillip Noyce.  Noyce doeshandle the subject matter well and what we have is a slick pillthat goes down easy.  Denzel Washington is confined to a bed forthe film, and in the scenes with him, we are always drawn to hisnatural charisma.  Angelina Jolie is fine in her role, and Ithink that we shall see her in far better roles in the future. The movie has all the requisite twists and turns and grislyimages, but what it doesn't have is that far more sinisterundertone.  Silence and Seven both had that.

And it wasn't too bad! Especially as they nailed the casting with Denzel as Rhyme! Perfect! It's weird that they changed so many of the characters names, and they way that they did it - some had different first names, some different last names. Not sure why. And the Michael Rooker character was just terrible, and hard to watch. But the movie held true and was pretty darn good!Now, what I'd love to see, is Denzel take on this character again, now, at his current age and acting level. I think he'd totally kill it this time!

The on screen chemistry between Denzil Washington and Angelina Jolie is superb, both play their parts very well. Jolie seems a very fine actress with Washington managing to convey much emotion and stress despite his condition. The story is very well created, not the usual happiness and light, this is dark and gloomy, and it keeps you guessing right up until the final minutes. Unfortunately it feels like the ending lets most of the rest of the story down, it's still well worth the watch, even if it's only for the scenes where Washington coaches Jolie. It builds suspense extremely well and the puzzles are skilfully weaved and picked apart. Good writing and casting.",The Bone Collector

96,EthanBJones_03,Don't Recommend,3,18 August 2017,"THE BONE COLLECTOR - 1999Directed by Phillip NoyceStarring ​Denzel Washington, Angelina Jolie and Michael RookerPlot Overview: ​Policewoman Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) is in hot pursuit of a serial murderer whose calling card is a small shard of bone extracted from each of his victims. Unable to decipher the cryptic clues the killer leaves behind at the scene of the crime, Amelia calls upon quadriplegic forensic criminology expert Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) to help. With Amelia acting as Rhyme's able-bodied go-between, the pair piece together disparate clues, hoping they will learn who the next victim is.For me, the very worst sin a serial killer movie can pull is thinking it is smarter than it is. A movie that thinks that its solutions are 'mind blowing' and 'genius' when they are in reality just average or below that are the worst type of serial killer film due to the horrible pretentious nature of it. And that is exactly what this mess is. Pretentious, boring, messy - three words that no film should have the burden of bearing but three words this film claims.Good movies that are 'intelligent' give enough wiggle room for the audience to figure out the solution for themselves. This film, on the other hand, combines myriads of obscure, stupidly insignificant pieces of information into one impossible to solve, obscene solution. I am 100% down with an intelligent lead, but when your lead is omniscient, I have a problem with it. The conclusion for this movie is both lazy and infuriating. I kinda guessed who it was shortly after the film began so the grand reveal meant nothing for me. As for the people I watched this with, it meant nothing for them because the reveal itself was worthless. No hints. No ideal motive. They even do the horribly cliché method of trying to convince the audience that X is the Y, when in fact it is Z. What I mean by that is that they try to convince you it is someone when it is CLEARLY not them. They used this technique with SCOOBY DOO! I would like to think that PROFESSIONAL FILM WRITERS can do a LITTLE bit better than that. Credit where credit is due, Denzel Washington was pretty darn good in this movie, considering he couldn't use 90% of his body. His co- star, in the form of Angelina Jolie was very weak and so annoying to watch on screen. The 'chemistry' between the two in the film is literally non-existent and the romance sub plot more shoehorned in than Wonder Woman in Batman V Superman.Michael Rooker wasn't that good in this movie, as much as I like him as an actor. Queen Latifa was fine in this movie. She gave a perfectly passable and average performance.Personally, I am not a huge fan of the cinematography in this movie. Some of the transitions irked me but there was nothing offensively bad about it so I can't criticise it THAT much.​ Pretentious films like this are just the worst. I can't recommend this hunk of junk. It is a bland, forgettable, generic serial killer flick that tried to act better than it really was. I'll rate it 3 Flying Rats out of 10.",The Bone Collector
97,Rammstein-2,Baked in the same ol' oven,4,23 August 2000,"(spoiler warning!)Déja vu. Nothing new in this lacklustre, format-written and overlong movie - we've seen it all before: the characters are so stereotypical it hurts, the gruesomeness of the murders feels, however imaginative, invented purely in order to shock and disgust (at which they mostly fail). What shocks me the most are the characters. Angelina Jolie is miscast as the standard-issue hostile-police-woman-who's-lost-her-daddy, overly aggressive and needlessly fond of the wooden stick Washington, paralyzed and confined in a bed throughout the movie. As he lacks any kind of radiance to pull that stunt, he turns out rather flat and uninteresting.Another see-before is the ol' police-chief-angry-at-his-crew-for-no-apparent-reason bit, a self-satisfied and pathetic little careerist whose inaptitude would never have gotten him there in the first place. Boring and unimaginative.The same goes for the ending which really shows how the writers had only one thing in mind: to spook people. Letting some almost unknown character be the antagonist is evidence of a profound lack of narrative ability, and feels stupid, uncalled-for and most of all it effectively kills the only suspense one can hang onto to get through this slow flick: who's the killer?I can recommend many other movies than this one, notably Se7en and The Silence of the Lambs, who are players in the same genre (gruesome, spooky detective yarns) but infinitely more interesting and nerve-wracking.",The Bone Collector
98,tastyhotdogs,Damn good thriller,8,26 December 2005,"This is one of the best drama/thriller movies I've ever seen.The movie revolves around Amelia (Angelina Jolie), a beat cop who comes across a gruesome dead body. Looking at the evidence it becomes clear we have a serial killer on our hands. The best serial killer expert just happens to be Linc Rhyme (Denzel Washington) a bedridden quadriplegic who has given up on this type of work since his accident. Amelia pushes him for help and eventually convinces him to help out. As they work together the murders keep coming and the stakes get higher and it becomes clear they're dealing with a nutbag.The movie does get a tad disturbing in scenes, probably not a good one to watch with the kiddies. The movie is brilliant though- a great story played out well, a very solid cast and it's shot well. Besides when was the last time you walked out of a Denzel Washington movie unsatisfied (I can only think of one- Fallen)",The Bone Collector
99,random_avenger,The Bone Collector,5,4 September 2010,"There is a serial killer at large in New York City, and like many movie murderers like to do, he is leaving clues for the detectives, toying with them and apparently conducting some sort of a personal vendetta against the police force. To capture him, a quadriplegic forensics expert Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) needs an inexperienced street cop Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) to be his eyes and hands when investigating the grisly murder scenes.The visuals look nice; the urban street views, rusty, run-down crime scenes and the old infrastructure of the city's forgotten industrial areas suit the style and mood of the story very well. In the beginning the character of Amelia also shows potential of becoming an interesting person with many traits of vulnerability and commitment issues, making a good pairing for the cold and logical Rhyme, but ultimately the story doesn't really pay enough attention to the character development to make it worthwhile to see. Donaghy and Rhyme do grow closer to each other, but it's all so predictable that it's hard to care about them. Washington handles his almost entirely bed-ridden role at ease, but I wished the character had been even more bitter about his situation – it could have helped to heighten the necessary tensions of the plot.The lack of decent drama would be acceptable if the thriller aspects of the story would be really good, but sadly, they are not. The elaborate murder methods are morbidly amusing, but in a world where the Saw movies are mainstream, they look very tame when it comes to graphic exploitation of the victims' horror. As the suspense never tightens enough to make up for the lack of gore, we aren't really left with much to enjoy (or be appalled by). The finale where the killer's identity is finally revealed is also disappointing; the scene is so lame and clichéd that it can be called a borderline anti-climax for the whole movie.All in all, there is little originality or element of surprise in The Bone Collector, but nowadays that can rarely be expected from mainstream movies anyway. Technically the film is competently directed, the music is clearly above average and some supporting actors do a good job (namely Luis Guzmán as a forensics technology expert), so the movie can be comfortably watched if nothing better is on; I wouldn't go out of my way to seek it out though. For crime movie fans only; that is my verdict.",The Bone Collector
100,barberoux,Boneheaded,2,17 May 2000,A waste of talent.  There was so much talent in this movie and it was all wasted on a boneheaded script.  Seems the writers sat around a hat and pulled cliches out of it and strung them together to make a movie.  The only suspenseful part was waiting to see which Hollywood cliche they would use for an ending.  They opted for the total unknown character showing up as the killer.  Denzel Washington tried to bring life to the character but was hampered by boneheaded dialogue.  Angelina Jolie tried pouting her way through but her character had no substance.

101,rollernerd,Ending comes up too short,6,19 April 2021,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! Queue in intro music**Today movie review is the thriller The Bone Collector (1999) starring Angelina Jolie who plays a street smart police officer who discovers a badly mutilated corpse and soon is partnered with a paralysed forensic detective played by my man Denzel Washington to catch a New York City serial killer who preys his victims by posing as a taxi driver. In simple terms the movie is about two cops on the trail of a brutal serial killer who must see as one, act as one and think as one before the next victim falls. With Denzel's keen eye for detail and nose for clues and Angelina's eyes and ears for the paralysed detective soon find the murders resemble a homage to old 1900s mystery murder novel. The murderer sets up a series of labour contrived complicated set-ups.Verdict?? A competent, recycled and cliched movie where the murderer leaves clues for the detectives, toying with them and apparently conducting some sort of a personal vendetta against the police force. The story progresses in a predictable manner and the story also features the usual expected twists and turns in it. On top of that some story elements and characters just don't work out in the movie. Denzel's performance feels constrained due to an underwritten role and this is not due to his character is bedridden. He does have good chemistry with Angelina which feels more like mentor-mentee chemistry than romantic chemistry which the director chose the latter at the end of the movie. Australian director Phillip Noyce does well with the production and suspenseful music with a few surprising moments however the development of the story lacks imagination and edge. And seriously the cliched pitch of when the killer reveals his generic motive at the during the climax sequence - epic fail and it feels like the writers and filmmakers chose the killer's motivations ridiculously cheap.Now this is a question, imagine how this movie would had been like with a different cast filled with unknowns, would have it been a direct-to-video?? It's an average movie and had a premise of a B-grade flick.. The ending to The Bone Collector is seriously lacking in creativity and is nothing more than the result of a poor setup. Overall the movie comes up way too short in the story department by lacking any originality to keep the investigation of the story engaging; 5.9/10.",The Bone Collector

And although it can be quite tricky in certain areas, the film's puzzle isn't psychotic enough to fully engage. So The Bone Collector is pretty satisfactory, but is at least watchable.So you can expect The Bone Collector to contain the usual decent performances of Washington and Jolie, but the cast saves the story from being completely flat. Compared to most mystery-thrillers and whodunnits, there isn't too much to expect other than some suspense. This movie will have your attention but is mainly just dull in a watchable kind of way.Yes, the pace is decent, but the film itself is just a bland and unexciting idea.

113,Jakealope,"Over Complicated, Very Scientific But Really Dumb",5,11 October 2006,"This movie is a genre movie: a master detective follows the trail of a really clever serial killers who plots complicated murders based on a 1900's murder mystery novel. This only happens in the movies, of course, but we can buy some of that. But without revealing too much of the plot, this killer is doing this as a revenge on the master detective, Lincoln Rhymes played byDenzel Washington, who is a quadriplegic from an accident he suffered on a crime site. But the killer, who is seeking revenge, is totally a phony savant character ala Hannibal, who has everything calculated to the last nano-gram of the victims' emotions. He had plenty of chances to do in Detective Lincoln Rhyme in a more conventional manner, but he plots these complicated but empty murders just to mess with our Sherlock's head. That is why this is just another unreal techno killer movie. Funny, Mike Rooker appeared in this one, as a pompous careerist cop named Cheney, get it, when he carried the classic ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"". That creepy low budget film worked because he was plausible as just a quick, clever loner who enjoyed killing random people in random uncomplicated ways which never alerted the police. It was 10x as frightening and real as this over produced star studded turkey. Even ""Copycat"" was more real than this one. For all the techno CSI geekiness, the motivation of the killer and the plot were really primitive. But none of that was germaine in the story, it was all a red herring.Angelie Jolie plays Patrolwoman Amelia Donaghy, who discovers the first victim on the Amtrak tracks and stops a train, then photographs the whole scene, impressing Sherlock. Like all special types of movie detectives, he gets called in as a special assistant by the pompous NYPD suit, Cheney, as the NYPD's conventional methods fail. Queen Latifah makes her obnoxious presence felt as Sherlock's home health aid/nurse, giving up her usual stereotypical loud ghetto-fabulous schtick. Then they throw Ed O'Neill in as an amiable detective funny-straight-dumb guy, and you have a real three ring circus. Angelina Jolie is the only one who earned her pay, she did a good job in her overly complicated role. Denzel was a mannequin and then they throw in Luiz Guzman as a friendly CSI scientist Pete Gomez, great match! Ed O'Neill would be more believable as a scientist, but they have the smart people of color versus uptight and stupid white folks angle. The subplot of the suit detective, Cheney aka Rooker, harassing our hard working bedridden Sherlock and his female Holmes, was way over done. It's simply amazing that such money and talent be employed for such paltry results, it almost ranks down there with ""Striking Distance"" as far as high priced mediocrity goes.",The Bone Collector

Rhyme is an academic cop, a forensics expert who's life has been reduced to what he can manage from his bed, with the help of his assistant and nurse. Angelina Jolie is perfect in the role of the young police officer who has talent and is convinced it may lead her toward the same path as her police father. Micheal Rooker plays the Captain, once Rhyme's understudy and now uncomfortable with living in his shadow. Ed O'Neill and Mike McGlone are add the right tone as the more experienced detectives, and Luiz Guzman shines as the talented forensics scientist who analyzes and assesses the physical clues. The film is fluid and never pauses, and the ensemble cast is a testament to both director and casting agent. Definitely not a film for the kiddies, since there is graphic violence and some images that might even disturb adults. If you are a fan of who-dun-its, this film is for you.",The Bone Collector
115,danielll_rs,Good thriller; didn't understand the bad reviews,5,4 February 2000,"One time, when I was about 11 years old, I rented a film called ""The Silence of the Lambs"", and... Wow! I can't describe the the feelings I had. It was the best film I had seen till that moment, and it is on my mind until today.In my opinion, this was the inspiration for all the other thrillers which came out after 1991, specially those ones with a serial killer. Some time after that, I rented ""Se7en"", which was for me wicked, claustrophobic (in the good way), brilliant, almost as good as ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Taking those two films, almost all the other serial killer thrillers were a big waste, specially ""Kiss the Girls"". However, ""The Bone Collector"" was released in 1999. But, for some reason, it received many bad reviews. I really don't agree with them.The theme of ""The Bone Collector"", despite the fact that it has already been used in many other films, is really interesting. I won't say much about it to preserve your entertaining, but I can say it is very suspenseful, dark, well-written, well-directed and well-acted. Denzel Washington gives another great performance as the paralitic detective, but the big star is really Angelina Jolie. She's very, very pretty and talented, and has a GREAT future. She has been keeping my attention since the TV movie ""Gia"", and surprised me last year in the wonderful ""Playing By Heart"". I'm very glad that she won the Golden Globe for ""Girl, Interrupted"", and I hope she wins the Oscar for that part. Angelina deserves it for walk one more step on her brilliant career. Her acting in ""The Bone Collector"" is not different. Her dialogues with Denzel Washington in the film are intense and provoking, and without her the film would have been a little lost.So, when you see ""The Bone Collector"", try to forget the bad reviews and have fun. It is not ""The Silence of the Lambs"". It is not ""Se7en"". But it is a fine film if you want to feel your hands cold and your heart beating fast. And appreciate Angelina's beauty.7/10",The Bone Collector
116,cofemug,Yuck,3,16 October 1999,"This one rates right up there with ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer."" It is another movie that tries to be suspenseful by using weird camera angles, and tried and tired situations.  However, much like ISKWYDLS, I laughed extremely hard.  I mean, I almost died laughing.  See this movie with a crowd, and you will laugh too.  I was not shocked by the move and could spot every single inspiration.Plot:  ""Copycat"" meets video games.  The movie has a shut-in parapelegic ex-dectective pulled into another case of somebody imitating old murders. (Sound familiar?)  Then he controls a young dectective by head sets.  (RPG video games).  Tired, and mundane.  Luckily, this movie was free, or else I would have kicked somebody.  However, I do have to give it to the writer, he seems to be overly kept up in current events.  He has a man who is just out of jail for manipulating evidence (as seen in 60 minutes) and takes on the Kevorkian issue.  Why are these sensitive topics in such a trashy movie?Acting:  Jolie was good.  I kind of liked everybody else, but Jolie, O'Niell, and Orser, all do very good jobs.  They create the effect of a movie that is extremely bad, but doesn't quite know it. 
Inspirations:  Well, they stole the plot from Copycat, and made it into an RPG.  Then they decided to add scenes from specific movies.  Although sewer lines blowing up from the street have been in several different movies, the most similar was ""Ghostbusters.""  They took the idea for the book from Seven, by saying that this would be the last murder.  There is the typical everything else.  Another inspiration ""Graveyard Shift"" with rats and even the shooting of them.Presentation:  **** SPOILER SECTION: SPOILERS LACED THROUGHOUT THE SECTION SKIP DOWN TO THE FINALE ****  Once again, gypped from the gore.  The movie is not that gory.  It is slightly sadistic.   We do not get to see the lady get steamed, or her hands get sawed off.  The rats are a little gross, but we do not get to see too much.  I wish they laced the movie with more gore. We needed more gore and violence to keep the interest up.  The sex appeal was there (Jolie), but we do not get to see anything.  This is a disappointment, but I can live with it, I guess.  Everything else is hokey, and overdone.  Although I did not realize who the killer was, I knew who it wasn't, and that was the chief.  We all know that the person whom they try to make fairly obvious is the killer, isn't.  They should have given us more clues to who was the killer.  How were we supposed to know that Orser had something against Washington?  Finale:  Overall this was one of the most unbelievable movies this year.  I also laughed so hard I split a gut and cried.  I was in tears.  However, most of it was from the audience reaction.  I was laughing at them rather than the movie.  If you want to semi-enjoy this movie see it with a big crowd, especially with easily-scared people.  However, I cannot recommend this movie to anybody.  It sucked beyond normal standards of suckiness. But, it made me laugh-----------3",The Bone Collector
117,Panterken,"Very entertaining murder-mystery that resembles Se7en, with two strong leads. Recommended !.",7,8 September 2007,"The Bone Collector is a very good genre-movie. As a murder-mystery it prevails gloriously: it's well put together, well acted and exciting to follow every step of the way. TBC is based on a book and I've noticed most book-based films are more intelligent, have a thicker plot and are just plain better than films with screenplays written from scratch.( Just look at the recent Zodiac...). The Bone Collector follows quadriplegic forensic expert Lincoln Rhyme(Washington) and rookie cop Amelia Donaghy(Jolie) in their pursuit of a serial killer. The killer leaves clues at each murder-scene concerning the time and place where his next victim will die. Amelia, haunted by her father's suicide and Linc, who has a strong death-wish since his accident 4 years ago, have to overcome their fears and deal with their issues in order to focus on the investigation, save the victim before her/his death and catch the killer before he strikes again. Linc guides Amelia through the crime scene investigations (through radio contact) and she becomes his eyes and legs on the scene...The Bone Collector reminded me a lot of Se7en and though it is inferior it's certainly as entertaining. It may not have Se7en's brilliance( though it is brilliant at times) but I can't help but love it too. The main leads are in top form: Denzel Washington's always exceptional but Angelina Jolie is surprisingly good in this too. She's a good actress but I've seen mediocre performances of her too. There's a lot of controversy about the ending but I found it to be very satisfying, though I can see why some people didn't like it. I don't mind putting aside a little believability for excitement. The rest of the cast is decent, though the two leads steal all of their thunder.The dialog is OK, though no one-liners come to mind. The music and sound were very fitting: it aided in building up the right mood and it was never too explicitly present( which can break the mood too...see Notes On A Scandal). The Bone Collector isn't as harsh or brutal as Se7en but it's definitely disturbing. It's probably not for very sensitive viewers, there are some close-ups but they're essential to the story (the gore is functional, if you will).I've seen the film multiple times and I've never been able to turn it off when I come across it flipping through the channels on TV. There's some charm to the film I can't describe. It's definitely worth a look and will give mystery-thriller fans what they need...I highly recommend this very entertaining film.7.5/10 (rounded up to a vote of 8, since you can't vote half's on IMDb...)>C.",The Bone Collector

I hated the fact that the serial killer was leaving clues on who and where he would kill next. i would much prefer a straight out killer who had to be caught like in Seven. I've heard that the book was much better and a  lot of sequences from the novel were left out of the movie which were great parts in the novel. The story follows a serial killer who is a taxi driver. He is kidnapping people and killing them, copy-cat a serial killer immortilized in a book called the bone collector. And a paralised Denzel Washington and a young street cop Angelina Jolie have to stop him. I also hated the fact that in some scenes were he would go ""well there this and this and then there this so that mean he going to kill here and kill this person"" that is total BS.",The Bone Collector
120,mattrochman,Fair good film ruined by two major pitfalls,7,14 August 2006,"The film making, suspense, horror and general build up of this film is terrific. It was engaging and had me on the edge of my seat. Furthermore, I really enjoy murder mystery films where the killer leaves cryptic clues that a only a gifted cop can unravel. OK... it's a done to death formula. But I still enjoy the ""genre"" and individual creativity within this formula.But there are two major pitfalls. First, the background of Angelina Jolie's character is absurd. A supermodel who became a street cop? Come on!!! You don't have to explain why these everyday characters are so beautiful. None of my doctors look as good as the ones in ER, but I will hold it against them if they start inserting the ""I was going to be a model but I decided to go to med school instead"" explanations.Second, when the killer is revealed, the whole thing seems a bit convenient or co-incidental. One thing I appreciated about seven and copycat was that the killer was simply the killer - he wasn't someone we encountered earlier in the film.Much like kiss the girls, where the killer turned out to be one of the homicide detectives, it feels that we need to have a ""shock"" ending by revealing that the killer was an unsuspecting character that kept popping up throughout the film; one who ""we never would have guessed."" Lame! But a good film nonetheless",The Bone Collector

A really neat way to see New York, a nice change from the ""glitz"" of Godzilla (god forbid).A cab driver commits grisly murders and torture, this is yet another of those who-done-it flicks. I found it was a bit slow in places and not much seemed to happen, but there was enough action to make up for the slowness. How would YOU respond, being the first to a horrifying murder scene, and being forced to do the forensics on it?Denzel Washington didn't do too much, bedridden and a quadraplegic. He did get the chance to do some action at the end... there were also one too many irritating scenes of that rookie cop's face up close. Her lips!!

123,jdhb-768-61234,Not at all bad.,8,12 August 2018,"The Bone Collector is a decent film. A good story, if not terribly original in many ways, but with an excellent central performance from Denzel Washington and fine support from Angelina Jolie, not the best of actresses but not at all bad here.The action is well constructed and elements of suspense are well handled. Washington, as a quadraplegic forensics expert, does a pretty good job from his bed, never moving anything other than his head and a finger, while Jolie plays his amanuensis with some aplomb; Washington's nurse, Queen Latifah as Thelma, plays an excellent understated supporting role, though with a rather shocking end. If there's a criticism, it's the speed with which Jolie moves from being a hater of forensics to a lover of not only forensics but of Washington's expert.The film does rather drag on a bit a and might have been better if it was 10 minutes shorter, though that's a small issue. There's an absence of loud and intrusive background noise for much of the time - Hurrah ! - and the actors' voices are largely audible throughout, which can't be said for many modern films. It may be a bit predictable but then what modern films aren't ? They're all based on 'Cowboys and Indians' one way or another.Overall, it's a good 7.5 which isn't allowed, so 8 it has to be.",The Bone Collector
124,poem,"Al is always funny, but the rest ?",1,20 January 2000,"Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill) and Queen Latifah have some smaller roles in this movie. They where funny, and maybe the only little reason to watch this one. Most of the rest of the cast was not that good.Anything else to notice ? No. The story is just boring. A very average crime story, with some nice ideas, but a very weak implementation.The main character had to lie in bed because he had an serious accident. I didn't understand why he could live at home this way. Everyone with at least a little bit reason would have put him into a hospital, where he can get better help.And what do you think about a killer which leaves hint where, when and how he would kill someone the next time ?!?That all made the movie look absurd. It was not really bad, but it was lifeless. You could have leaved it in the middle and you would never worry that you don't know the end.But I liked the following effect: at the end of a scene on the street the camera is going backward very fast some hundreds of meters until we're in a room of a house, where a totally different scene starts. That was nice. If I remember it correctly, it was already in the trailer.Well if you like crime stories you might like this one, but even then you won't get exited. It really has no suspense at all, instead it was lifeless and sometimes even foreseeable. On the other hand it was very brutal. But even that was without any style.",The Bone Collector
125,Jim-500,"Good, moody thriller gradually falls flat",3,19 March 2000,"The Bone Collector is a dark, foreboding movie filled with suspense, intrigue and a touching romance between its two leads.   Unfortunately, all of these elements can't make up for the fact that it doesn't play fair with the audience.Denzel Washington plays Linc Rhyme, a New York city detective who, due to an on-the-job accident, is a quadriplegic, able to move only his facial muscles.   Oh, and one other: his right index finger, which controls a mouse hooked up to his computer, enabling him to investigate a mysterious and disgusting murder.   Through an impressive system of voice hookups, Washington can communicate with the outside world, instructing his cohorts on what to look for at the scene of the crime, and more.   His body may be dead, but his mind is as brilliant and malleable as ever.Enter Angelina Jolie, who plays Amelia Donaghy, a rookie New York cop. Linc takes her under his wing, coaxing her to lead the case.  He sees in her an innate ability for forensics.  He also sees a beautiful woman.The investigation continues, the murders pile up, each ghastly and grisly. Tiny clues left by the murderer are gathered by Amelia and examined by Rhyme until his genius and years of experience unravel the murderer's plot.   A final tussle at the end of the movie seems to doom Linc, but once again we witness how the mind can overcome any obstacles.I think this could have been a great movie if it wasn't so unbelievable. Jolie is constantly being put in harm's way for no logical reason. Washington sends her alone, into dark and dank places where the murderer may very well be hiding, because he is afraid that her fellow officers will disturb the crime scene.  That silly concern alone is worth endangering a person's life?  Give me a break.  (Obviously Linc hadn't seen any of the Scream movies, where this very issue of never going into a place where the killer may be by yourself is bandied about at length!)A sequence in which an old man dies by the hands of the killer and his little girl is saved is supposed to make us feel good, because at least someone lived, and she was saved by Jolie's wiles, grit and determination; the implication being that an innocent man's death is worth Jolie's moving up in the forensics world.  The clues left by the killer are so tiny and minute that it is hard to believe that the killer really expects the detectives to follow them to their logical conclusion.  The last clue, having to do with the numbers on a subway train and a corresponding police badge, leaves so much left to coincidence to have any meaning, that it strains the limits of credulity. Instead of an ""Aha!"" feeling, I was left with a ""Huh?""But the part that left me the most frustrated was the end, in which the killer's identity is revealed.    Sure, it was unexpected (as all killer's unmaskings should be), but it is someone who, according to the information given the audience, had no right to be the killer.  We had seen this character only for a few brief, fleeting instances in the picture, and there was no reason to suspect this person.   In the final battle, the killer spills the beans as to why he had been committing these murders, and why he wants to kill Washington.  But my reaction was, So what?    For me, there was no surprise for having incorrectly guessed the killer's i.d., because it was someone that I could never have suspected for any reason, based on what I knew at the time.  This is not playing fair,Just after seeing The Bone Collector, I was able to look back on it and think about how much I enjoyed it, for the most part.  But then I realized how much better it could have been if it had been fair to its audience.",The Bone Collector

Quaintly claustrophobic, the film gives an overall impression of uncomfortable tight spaces, no more so than Lincoln's dwelling which can get cramped when his whole team pack the place out during the middle portion of the film. The whole film is made to make you feel uneasy and uncomfortable, something that a lot of other films in this bracket fail to do, but ""The Bone Collector"" is gritty, slimy and very unpleasant..., the cinematographer and the whole production team did a marvellous job of visually personifying the desired feeling and bringing it perfectly onto the screen.Almost top marks for a very fine film, I'd certainly watch it again.",The Bone Collector

It was a stretch for believing he would send a Rookie Cop into those Crime scenes with Backup hundreds of feet or floors away and no idea who was waiting in the dark. Angelina was great. She can act but didn't look quite physical enough to carry the part let alone the equipment. Still you root for both of them to find the killer before the next victim becomes a victim.

They gave you several to choose from but if you pay attention, it can be done.A somewhat bittersweet ending knowing there was a price for the outcome.

129,Mark-129,Not Bad!,7,14 August 2004,"Lincoln Rhyme, head of forensics in New York City is crippled at a crime scene and though paralyzed, remains a valuable consultant to the police. Although author Jeffery Deaver had Tom Cruise in mind, Denzel Washington makes the character his own, having the necessary gravitas to hold the screen with only the use of his eyes and voice to connect with the audience. Angelina Jolie is perfectly cast as Rhymes's protégé, Amelia Donaghy. A former model turned street cop.The story involves Rhyme's investigation of a series of grisly murders that ultimately threaten his own life. Suspenseful and intelligent, the narrative fails only at the unmasking of the killer, whose motivations are unclear and unsatisfying at best. The casting of an actor who has made his living playing psycho killers makes the murderers identity rather obvious.Since The Bone Collector was not a smash, it's unlikely any of Deaver's other ""Lincoln Rhyme"" novels on the big screen, but hopefully an enterprising producer will give us television adaptations of ""The Vanished Man"" or ""The Empty Chair"" someday.",The Bone Collector
130,Blackace,Will Give You Chill Right To The Bones,7,11 November 1999,"This was a decent movie with a very good plot. I thought Denzel and Angelina did a great acting job in this movie. Even though Denzel played most of his part in a bed, he still delivered a powerful performance. Having a killer act out murders from a book isn't anything original, but having a female juvenile official do fuerensics to help solve a murder is unique. Angelina did an outstanding job showing her discomfort with the task at hand. The type of murders were also very chilling and will make people in New York think before jumping into their next cab. The only really bad thing about the movie was knowing who the killer was halfway through the movie. I was able to narrow it down to 2 people and I figured it out that one was probably a decoy. It wasn't too hard. Ed O'neil and Queen Latifah also supplied a nice supporting cast. An overall a well done movie that's worth seeing.",The Bone Collector
131,el_monty_BCN,Just when you thought Noyce couldn't do any worse...,1,17 January 2002,"Bad directors are generally a lot more reliable than good directors, in the sense that even the greatest of directors can make a poor movie every once in a while, but bad directors hardly ever let you down: They keep churning out turkey after turkey without ever a trace of intrusive talent or inventiveness seeping into their works. Phillip Noyce is a prime example of this. In my opinion, he is one of the very worst directors, not only working today, but in the whole history of Hollywood cinema (he's got Ed Wood beaten by a mile); and this view is reinforced every time I watch (or, more appropriately, endure) one of his ""films"" (I would call them something else, but bad language will prevent this review from being posted I'm afraid). I'm not sure if the problem lies in his limited capabilities for the art of storytelling, or in his appalling penchant for choosing wretched screenplays, but the truth is that all of them (and I regret to admit I have seen no less than six) have made me wonder whether to laugh or cry at their incompetence, or simply go to sleep from the boredom. The Bone Collector is, of course, no exception. In fact, I think Noyce has outdone himself with it, as it is an exceptionally terrible movie. I cannot find a single redeeming feature in it. For one, Jolie is quite obviously miscast, and even the usually solid Washington takes this as an opportunity to overact (Well, It's not like there's any actor's director around on set to restrain him, is there?). The storyline is absurd from its very inception, and I find it extremely hilarious that it pretends to be about the elusive science of evidence-gathering, when this kind of left-there-on-purpose evidence that only a movie killer would leave, is precisely the one kind that requires no talent at all to find. BECAUSE IT IS RIGHT THERE. And then the investigations made from this evidence seems to follow little logic other than Rhyme's whims and *intuitions*, or risible strokes of luck. The film keeps throwing one-or-two-line characters at you so that you wonder which one the killer might be (oh how very exciting), but still the ending won't fail to underwhelm you. I have to admit one thing: this pathetic excuse for a film kept me hooked not because it was interesting, but because I was morbidly curious to find out how dire it could become as it went on. But of course, that's because I saw it on TV, and I didn't have to pay a ticket; I swore years ago (more precisely, after I saw the narcolepsy-inducing Clear and Present Danger) that they would only take me to the cinema to watch a Phillip Noyce movie if I was WRAPPED IN CHAINS.Note: This review was written before Noyce directed Rabbitproof Fence. OK, so it turns out he IS able to make a decent film. But it doesn't change the fact that the rest of his output is awful.",The Bone Collector
132,hofnarr,I really tried to like this but . . . (Spoilers),3,13 October 1999,"This film had enough going for it (acting, set design, lighting) that I was able to overlook some minor script problems that threatened suspension of disbelief. It's a convention in the horror genre that if a woman hears some strange noise on a rainy night, of *course* she is going to go out and investigate it - otherwise the story might not continue.But I'm sorry - a NYPD police officer is NOT going to leave her apartment on a rainy night without her gun. Ain't gonna happen. Someone at the screening I saw yelled out incredulously ""And you're a *police* officer??!!"" Audience reaction indicated that for Jeremy Iacone to write the script that way undermines not only Amelia's believability but also the story line.Unfortunately, two much more serious faux paus totally trashed this film for me and although I think the first I could reveal without a spoiler warning, I want to err on the side of caution and say don't read any further until you have seen the film.One: Lincoln is a master at forensics - the film is set up that way;it's established he's written the Academy manual on field technique. It's evident that he has amassed a lot of data over the years in forensics and any overlapping fields. If this is the case, it's a major cheat by screenwriter Jeremy Iacone to have Amelia ""stumble over"" a historical book of murders in a bookstore - murders that parallel those she and Lincoln have been working on. It would be bad enough if this was just happenstance, but no - after collecting fragments of paper found at crime scenes, Lincoln determines that the face seen is the logo of a publishing company dealing with true crimes.He knows this because he *read* all these books when he was a kid. OK - so Amelia goes to a bookstore, tries to get a book from a top shelf and a number of books fall down. Including one entitled ""The Bone Collector"" - a collection of true-life murders.I'm sorry - if we are to believe that Lincoln is the expert that he is, there is NO WAY he would not recognize the details of the murders as being historically based when he first sees them - he would know that history. The man does not forget what he reads.Two: I don't care WHAT you do to a medical monitor hooked to someone whether they're a quadriplegic or not - you will not turn that person into a carrot, a zucchini, a squash, a pumpkin, or whatever. It's a MONITOR, not a ventilator, not a pacemaker.We know Lincoln's big fear is being a vegetable. His big fear is not really some wacko who thinks he can turn Lincoln into a vegetable via ranting & raving over his medical monitor.Too bad Jeremy Iacone didn't keep that in mind.",The Bone Collector

You're expected to believe that Denzel Washington, as a quadriplegic former cop, is the sort of genius that puts Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes to shame; he's read (and apparently memorized) ""thousands"" of books, has written twelve, has a vaster-than-encyclopedic knowledge of New York City history, whips opponents at computer chess, and is so superhumanly adept at solving crimes that the NYPD lets him direct an entire serial-killer case from his bedside. Except for jealous captain Michael Rooker (cast because of his own Henry the Serial Killer connections), the guy appears to have the entire police bureaucracy under his command! You're also supposed to believe that doe-eyed, puffy-lipped Angelina Jolie -- whose New York accent fades early in the film -- is a respected street cop with a preternatural crime-fighting talent to rival Washington's own, and that Luis Guzman -- admittedly, always a delight, even in this nonsensical role -- is a brilliant forensic chemist. It's the sort of movie where, when Washington asks for the locations of local asbestos-removal sites, within 30 seconds someone comes up with a map on the computer, complete with two or three red dots that blink on and off and actually go beep-beep-beep! The murders themselves are gruesome, needlessly sadistic, and quite ridiculous in their intricacy and supposed motive.

The ending is a little too neat and a little too formulaic.  However the acting is excellent and is what saves The Bone Collector from being another Copycat or last year's horrible In Dreams.

She continues to be one of the most underrated actors around.Everything was well-done in the movie, and it's hard to find any weaknesses. The ONLY weakness is miscasting of Jolie.  Although she does a fine job, her physique and personality don't match the desired traits of the character.

Looking at it a second time, a viewer should see what he/she missed and how it all makes sense at the end. But it, alas, doesn't here at all. our murderer has had to have had time for two jobs that would have been impossible to unite....in his role as a skilled and important doctor, he has had to have worked for years and earned key scrutiny by Police and agencies. With his important position, how would he have had time to sit in a taxi, for long periods, to find the right 'next victim'? And to be at Grand Central Station and Kennedy Airport to execute the pick-up and follow-up. Since he has had a six year stint in jail, he could never have been vetted for the job...and the six year's imprisonment would have made it impossible for him to have been schooled in the difficult training that helps him reach his professional standing. So a fine mystery thriller leaves us with a solution that doesn't fit with all that has gone before it...and I have not forgotten how and where the century-old book was found, used, returned(?) and torn up. Was it a best seller???",The Bone Collector
143,reve-2,"Good film, no wasted time",9,11 October 2000,"I am one of those older folks who doesn't care for the kind of movies that are made these days. As such, my movie watching is generally confined to old classic films ala TCM and AMC. But, I do subscribe to all of the premium channels via DirecTV and, occasionally, watch a newer film if the plot synopsis appears to be one that I may be able to tolerate. I have read all of the previous reviews of this film on the IMDB and find them very interesting. Many of the reviews mention a movie titled ""Seven"". I have never heard of, much less seen, ""Seven"". I consider this fact to be a fortunate one because I was able to watch ""The Bone Collector"" without having to constantly compare it to a previous film. In short, I liked this movie. I was entertained royally precisely because I didn't take the story line too seriously. There was not much time wasted on character development. GOOD !! I don't need to know why the characters became the persons that they are. I simply want them to get on with whatever they must do. Another thing that I liked was the lack of sex scenes, which seem to be almost a necessity it today's movies. The two leads did a great job and their chemistry was excellent. Mr. Washington and Ms. Jolie were very believable. The killer? No big deal. I couldn't have cared less who did the killings. I simply waited for justice to be done. In short, I don't agree with any of the harsh criticism that I have read on this forum. I guess that's because I am a rather down to earth person who has no need to turn watching a movie into an academic exercise, complete with thorough analysis of character motivation, etc.",The Bone Collector

Everyone must have one movie that raises their ire every time someone even mentions it, and for me, that movie is ""The Bone Collector."" I've seen plenty of bad movies, but this is in a whole other category, because not only is it bad - it is literally SICKENING. I've probably become immune to a certain level of violence in films (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" didn't bother me much), but there are several scenes in this film (one in particular, and anyone who had the grave misfortune of seeing this will know what I mean) which literally made me sick to my stomach and angry at the filmmakers' lack of restraint. There is absolutely nothing I can recommend in this film - NOTHING!! This is the first movie in which I can make that statement. Even the worst movies usually have some kind of cheap entertainment value, no matter how slim, but not here. It is as if the filmmakers stole ideas from every other idea from popular films from recent years, cheapened them, put them in this movie, and topped them off with the most grisly violence I've ever seen. Watching this was about as much fun as getting a root canal without anasthetic, and I really wonder whether the director Philip Noyce is some kind of covert sicko. I really hope the studio buries this one for good.",The Bone Collector

I doubt if anybody in the world could figure all that stuff out based on what little he had to go with and do it so quickly.However the biggest disappointment of this movie is there is no way you can figure out who the murderer is or his motive because all that stuff has little relationship to the story and there are not really any clues in the movie to tell you.This movie is like spending time trying to put a puzzle together and when you are done you realize that 90% of the pieces are missing and all the rest of the pieces have nothing to do with the puzzle.Basically you'll feel cheated after you realized you wasted all that time trying to solve a mystery when the mystery has nothing to do with what is going on in the movie.  The ending comes out of nowhere.  You could almost put a stupid endling like that on any murder movie.  You have to know a bunch of stuff that happened years before the movie takes place and has nothing to do with the movie.  If you are psychic you might like this movie. If you like intelligent thrillers then don't waste your time on this dud.Now if you are planning to see this junk then I think you may want to know how it ends so you can determine if you want to waste your time watching it. Warning SPOILER ahead -- the murder will be revealed:At the end of the movie we find out the murderer is some guy who the detective sent to jail 5 years ago and that subplot is totally separate from the movie.  The guy was just angry at the detective and his main motive was to try and show he was smarter than the detective by killing people.  This guy and his background and what happened 5 years ago comes out of nowhere and there really is no way you could have known this crap and no way to solve this who-dunit movie. It's almost like they ran out of time to create an intelligent ending and throw this junk in to wrap it up in a hurry. Stupid ending.",The Bone Collector
146,nightwishouge,The definition of mediocrity,5,16 April 2018,"The Bone Collector isn't bad. It's not boring, insulting, stupid, or cynically made. But it's not good, either. It's competent. It's uninspired. Everything about it rises exactly to the level of mere ""adequacy"". In the wake of Silence of the Lambs, there was a barrage of cat-and-mouse serial killer movies and techno-thrillers. The Bone Collector does nothing to distinguish itself from the glut.Probably the only thing worth commenting on is the cast. I watched this movie after watching Gia and remembering what a brilliant and promising actress Angelina Jolie was at the dawn of her career. (I still like her. But she hasn't been acting much lately.) She does what she can with the role, believably haunted when she needs to be, intelligent and determined throughout. But there's just not much to the character. The same is true for Denzel Washington, unquestionably a great actor but constrained by an underwritten role. The two leads have good chemistry, but it felt more like mentor-mentee chemistry than romantic chemistry. Still, the movie wants us to think they need to fall in love. Michael Rooker, a solid character actor by anyone's measure, is given an entirely one-note character to play, a detective or something who is higher up on the food chain who blocks Lincoln Rhyme at every turn for no better reason than that every techno-thriller needs one of these guys. He decides he doesn't like Angie because early on in the film she stops a train to preserve a crime scene positioned on the subway tracks. No attempt is ever made by the screenwriters to justify his behavior. Luis Guzman is fun in an unspectacular ""quirky tech guy"" part.There's nothing in The Bone Collector you haven't seen before, but if you're writing a textbook on the cliches of late-90s filmmaking, a viewing of this one will provide all the material you need.",The Bone Collector
147,puttputtk,"starts off good, ends badly",7,22 September 2010,"The Bone Collector (1999)5 word summaryQuadriplegic detective helps track killerThe Bone Collector starts off as a great new kind of police thriller. It takes a lot of clichéd ideas but turns them into something original and fresh. A quadriplegic detective helps a cop track down a killer who is leaving clues to the next victim, victims who have been put in situations that will kill them by a certain time. A lot of the murders reminded me a little of Saw, a pipe that will blow steam, cuts all over in rat infested areas. The only difference is the police need to save you before you die instead of you saving yourself. it's creative and disturbing and very entertaining. A lot of very tense moments as people are about to die horrible deaths and the police are close to saving them. It keeps the movie very exciting. However, the film loses a lot of my respect when the ending comes. It's a very clichéd, obvious, boring ending and even more so, a disappointing ending. though who the killer is was a bit of a surprise, why he is doing it and what follows after he admits what he's done is a cop out and frankly, a little stupid. It definitely changed my rating but overall did not ruin the film, just made it not as good as it could have been. The acting is good by Denzel Washington but not better than usual for him, just an average performance (which isn't a bad thing.) Angelina Jolie's performance was better than usual but overall nothing special. The rest of the cast was mediocre at best, no one really stands out. I would suggest the Bone Collector to anyone who enjoys crime thrillers. For the most part it is great, it was just slightly ruined by the ending.

148,Dkish,A gruesome thriller compared to movie heavyweights like `Seven' and `Silence of the Lambs'. How does it stack up?,6,7 November 1999,"The Bone Collector By Dean KishA gruesome thriller compared to movie heavyweights like `Seven' and `Silence of the Lambs'. How does it stack up? Well first here's the premise. Paraplegic Forensics Officer Lincoln `Link' Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is asked to help in solving a series of gruesome cases. Where something is always surgically removed and linked back to the turn of the century. Rhyme obviously can't enter the crime scenes and uncover the clues so he enlists in rookie detective Amelia Donaghy (Angelie Jolie) to examine the evidence and bring it back him. The Bone Collector is directed by Phillip Noyce who directed other Hollywood ventures like `The Saint', `Patriot Games', `Sliver'. The story on paper sounds like `Rear Window' meets `Silence of the Lambs' but what we get isn't a moody noir film laced with grueling shocks but a very textbook thriller with mildly grueling overtones. What made `Seven' and Silence of the Lambs' so amazing and shocking was their endings and their look. The Bone Collector has no moody look except for a couple strenuous scenes which I credit to relative new comer Jolie. Its in her performance that I believed we had a movie. She is going to be a draw sooner than Hollywood thinks. Because Hollywood didn't want her in this picture saying she wasn't attractive enough. Do all actresses have to be beautiful to be shocked by gruesome bodeis? The films title flaw has to be the director who doesn't really deliver us into the mind of the madman but except focuses on the strains of a paraplegic policeman. Aren't these kinds of thrillers supposed to see into the villain's mind? Coupled with this failure is a non-shock ending which is so cliched it made me shake my head and yearn to see `Seven' again. If you are looking to jump and cringe some then see the `Bone Collector' but be sure to watch `Seven' afterwards to get the full effect. (3 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.",The Bone Collector

Strangely enough however, on a whim, I viewed this film as a rented video and found it somewhat enjoyable.  The perplexing question this brings about is, why?  The answer, Denzel Washington's performance.   From every other aspect however, the film is a compilation of cinematic writing flaws. It almost seems as though it was put together by several writing teams, each working in it's own vacuum. The end effect is best described by the age old quote - ""a camel is a horse designed by a committee"" and seems to fit this production like a glove.  Quite simply, there is also a feel about this film that begs comparison to the key plot element of 70's Raymond Burr television crime series ""Ironside"", sans the gore and overt sadism.   In addition, one has to point to the many interesting avenues for characterization that are opened, but never followed through. And although Denzel Washington's performance is excellent, but the choice of Angelina Jolie as his costar was a glaring lesson in mis-casting. Never for a second could I imagine her as a policewoman, even though I don't fault her acting ability.   Still in all, the film does manage to grab your attention as a mystery and hold it until the preposterous ending when the murderer is revealed by means of outlandish plotting.

157,littlesb,"Entertaining, but not outstanding",7,13 November 1999,"They say that when the economy is good and the world is at peace that we have an urge to indulge in the darker side in our fantasies.  Thus, 1999 has been one terrific year for spooky movies. It all started with ""Sixth Sense"" and will end with a bang with ""End of Days"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"". Poor ""Bone Collector"" kind of gets lost in the shuffle, a mediocre attempt at horror that entertains, but lasts in memory just about the  length of time that it takes the hero to solve a murder mystery (and that is not too long).The hero is played by Denzel Washington and he is the bright ray of sunshine in an otherwise dim bulb of a movie.  He plays a quadraplegic who was formerly the top homicide detective in the NYPD.  He is in a state of deep depression about his condition and has lost the will to live.  But then a prominent couple is kidnapped and a lady streetcop happen upon the murder scene of the husband and Denzel is suddenly back on the job, his curiousity piqued once more. When he gets a full forensic team in his apartment to aid him and he is solving murders on a moment-to-moment basis, the movie gets exciting.I had a friend who would not go to this movie, because he said he figured it would be too gory.  In my opinion it was not gory enough when you consider the bizarre way that some of these murders took place.  If I had been the makeup artist, there would have been some horrific corpses, but here I think it was toned down so as not to offend.  (Think of ""Seven"" as an example of how it SHOULD be handled.)  As for the acting, I think that Queen Latifah did a great job as the nurse, but that Angelica Jolie was woefully miscast as the lady cop.  (At least they tried to explain her beauty a little bit, but it still did not equate that a girl that looks like that would give up modeling to become a street cop, even if her father HAD been on the force.)To sum it up, I would say to go see this movie if you have seen everything out there that's better or better still, wait till you can rent it.",The Bone Collector

It quickly went downhill after those three, spawning absurdities like 10+ seasons of Criminal Minds and basically most of the thriller genre clichés. Still, some of their strange fruits were brought quite near to ripeness, including this one.Considering, as it is a rule here, that everyone reading this have seen it or might experience a pleasant surprise either enjoying or deriding the movie, one will not recap much of the action (this is reserved for very, very bad oldies). Just know that Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington, good as good can be even though, or because, he's basically a talking head) a quadriplegic forensic expert, teams with rookie Amelia Dinghy (Angelina Jolie, better at expressing rebellion than emotion at that early stage of her career) to solve a puzzle created by the titular vicious killer, even though no one calls him such during the movie and he's not really collecting bones. Oh well.Queen Latifah does a terrific job at incarnating beloved nurse Thelma. Watch her doing nothing but receiving information but oh so well. Lord, the woman is gifted. She swallows the scenes she has nothing to do into, only acting normal and empathetic. If a movie has to be judged by the characters it creates, her performance only is worth your time. She meets a gruesome and undignified end, though, considering she's black and stuff. Fat, one thinks is the word. One has a secret version of the movie in which the villain is killed when Thelma saves the day, and one thinks it's a better version because it would spare us a corny ending which does all it can to ruin everything that preceded it. And that's too bad, because what preceded is far from bad.Incongruously enshrined in a majestic Craig Armstrong score, The Bone Collector is visually fluid, courtesy of Phillip Noyce, its director. Grue, more left to the imagination than depicted, is vague but merciless. The wagon loses its wheels around the 1:30 mark, because time is not kind to technology and/or twist endings, and there is this embarrassing Christmas finale that no serial killer movie of one's knowledge has ever attempted, and never will again, one hopes. No one wants a thriller to end like The Cosby Show, with a tie in lieu of a sweater.As usual, if one takes the killer's point of view and rewinds, it's all smoke and mirrors and the writing does not hold water. But still, the thing is quite good for 90mn, and that is more that one can say of most movies of the same vein.

OK, I was really impressed by its intriguing name but as I'm not a big fan of suspense and action, Angelina was always the main reason to watch it. ""The Bone Collector"" is a good movie. It's mysterious, thrilling, well-done but I'm not sure if I should write that it's realist or not. In fact, at the same time it is and it isn't. Almost all the victims of the killer died although they were always very closer to save them, for minutes. This is truly realist. BUT the way they find the places where the victims were is completely unrealistic. In seconds Rhyme (Denzel Washington) was solving the clues given by the killer. You may not believe but it was like this:
Clue: a green card. Rhyme : ""Well, he gave us a green card. Green - forest. Forest - trees. Threes need sun light. Sun - sky. Sky - clouds. Clouds - rain. So, he's gonna kill in the park (green) in a rainy day (rain) near the shop (card).  No, I'm not exaggerating and I'm sure you'll fell that while you're watching the movie. You're intrigued by some strange clues and signals given by the killer and Rhyme, in seconds, resolve everything breaking all the mystery and taking from us some good moments of suspense. But even with that little-big problem, the movie was running  greatly. Angelina was amazing (both in performance and beauty), Denzel was very good, the killer was very bad (not in bad performance, he had bad behaviour), the final answer to the clues is interesting, the movie had some dramatic parts... But the end is pathetic. Some dramatic moments are good but romance? Romance in a suspense movie named ""The Bone Collector""? Super-extra-happy ending? Oh, no.

""He's a cop, and he's in a WHEELCHAIR!"" was, I guess, the original pitch - an echo back to ""Ironside"", if you will - only Washington evidently vetoed this on the grounds that being quadriplegic wasn't quite disabled enough.""Wheelchair-bound cops are ten a penny,"" he probably told his agent. ""I want to be bed-ridden, on the verge of merciful euthanasia and only able to communicate with wistful eye-rolling and the occasional dignified grunt. Who needs to be an action hero? I'll win the Oscar through facial expressions alone."" His character is Lincoln Rhyme, a genius crime-scene investigator crippled by a falling girder but retained by the police as a consultant due to his encyclopaedic knowledge of all New York's grizzly murders.And when a devious serial killer with a penchant for mutilation and historical copycatting runs amok, rookie cop Angelina Jolie (forensics experience: zero) is brought in to act as Rhyme's eyes and ears, before those pesky professional crime scene teams get in there and contaminate the evidence. Meanwhile, much of the New York Police Department ups sticks and relocates to Denzel's bedroom.At this point, all plausibility has officially left the building. Washington smooth-talks Jolie into a little light amateur amputation, along with several other flagrant breaches of forensics protocol. I can't claim to be an expert, but I've seen enough CSI to know that William Petersen et al would not tolerate an uninitiated beat cop zooming in and cutting up their corpses, before they've had time to seal off the area, remove their aviator shades and stare quizzically into the middle distance.Hey ho.Jolie is almost as constricted in her role as Washington is in his, shorn, as she is, of any kind of sexuality. Indeed, she spends most of her time covered up in either clunky body armour or an unflattering blue boiler suit with only those famous bee-stung lips betraying any hint of trademark glamour. Her modest appearance would make sense if the institutionalised sexism storyline (implied by the early quips at Jolie's unsuitability for the case and the barefaced recruitment of Michael Rooker as the brash police captain) was fully thought through, but the director (Phillip Noyce) seems reluctant to make it an issue, so the rest of an impressive male cast (including Ed O'Brien, Mike McGlone and the genius Luis Guizman) are frustratingly underused.Surprisingly, what little empathy there is, comes from Queen Latifah's no-nonsense nursemaid who dabs Washington's brow tenderly and provides pithy asides to the masculine posturing of the police officers.Any Se7en-influenced cleverness accumulated during the intricately planned trail of clues at the murder scenes, is immediately ruined by a shockingly lazy ending, and, though Washington manages a melancholic smile during final fade-out, all dreams of Oscar-winning pathos have been long since banished.5/10",The Bone Collector

The only thing I liked more or less about this film are the fairly original methods the perpetrator uses to end his victims. Technical details are worse than the most far-stretched CSI 'knowledge' and gizmos and halfway the movie one wonders if the director even cared about detail credibility. (Some Spoilers hereafter!) I mean, an EKG machine with a pure sinus wave reflecting a man's heartbeat, a quadriplegic with full body muscle spasms and one working index finger, sure. A killer gutting a man's bowels whilst keeping him alive to allow the rats to feast on him followed by a rat aiming for the guy's FACE! What's with all that stupidity?

He was still very good and very effective in the role. The most praise goes to Angelina Jolie. She was very good in the film and i hope to see her in more films.

173,sailor-28,This film has the Boogieman written all over it.,6,16 November 1999,"As with most suspense/crime films, this one follows a long bloodline of brutal murder films that entertain a small minority of the population with calculated heinous brutality.    The film actually does have some good character acting though.  Denzel Washington did a good job from a bed through the entire film.  Ed O'Neill, shook off his typecast role as disfunctional father from ""Married with Children"".  Ed can actually act pretty good.  Angelina Jolie, performed as the central character, that was mostly believable. A shy and feminine cop in the NYPD, is well...an unlikely resource for solving brutal homicides, but this is one of the charms of the plot.    Although the film could have went farther into the ugliness of humanity, it went as far as it needed, to make a point.  There were a couple of gruesome scenes of disfigured victims, that may satisfy a youth's curiosity, but I would be very careful about letting tender-minded youths see this. Seeing the face of the disfigured victim has some usefulness.          Bloody murder films will never go away, just like murder, itself, will never go away.  They are a part of the American Cinema Scene, since they accurately reflect the reality of savage behavior that takes place all over America.

174,nutolm,A novel became great on the big screen,8,11 September 2012,"I read the novel of Jeffrey Deaver about a year before this movie was released on the theatres, and I was really looking forward to see the film adaption. It was not a disappointment, it may seem like the movie followed the standard formula, but that's no drawback, it was something different about it anyway. I loved the movie immediately, and based on a novel, it did very well at the theatre too. Denzel Washington has for a long time been one of my favourite actors (Glory 1989), and his chemistry with Angelina Jolie came out very good. That developed in a positive way through the entire story, absolutely something good.I found it very strange with all the negative response to this movie from professional critics, I thought it had good nerve and great excitement, and I was satisfied with its pace. I liked the concept, it had mixed elements of good drama and thriller - even scenes with a touch of horror, I really fell for this movie.Of course there is some changes from the book - most noticeably that Rhymes' nurse was a man, Amelias last name was Sachs, Rhyme was an irish-American white male, and there was a sexual moment between Rhyme and Amelia, but this these details had no importance for the story, or for me as a viewer.For me this movie provided great entertainment and excitement, it had several highlights that got all my attention, it had me on the edge of my seat - I had two thrilling hours!",The Bone Collector
175,Kilroy-17,It's Copycat all over again...,6,10 November 1999,"But that doesn't mean it's not a good flick.  The first and foremost goal of a movie is to entertain, and this film succeeds in all the right ways.  As with any picture, there are some things that may be a little on the thin side, but all in all, it's going to be hard to walk away from the Bone Collector without having had a good time.I imagine that there will be plenty of ""I've seen this all before..."" kinds of comments, but luckily for me, I almost never have a movie experience spoiled by that type of thing.  In reality, how many movies do you see that are completely original ideas?  Not too many, so you have to evaluate them individually, or you'll never be happy.I mentioned Copycat earlier, and if you think about it, this picture could almost qualify as plagiarism.  All that's missing is Harry Connick Jr. asking for someone's ""SQUIRREL COVERS"".  Denzel Washington is the shut-in this time, playing Lincoln Rhyme who's bed-ridden because he's been paralyzed in the line of duty.  He's a forensics expert in an almost psychic way.  He sees what no one else can see.  That's why they come to him after Angelina Jolie, who plays Amelia Donaghy, photographs a grisly murder scene.  Sounds like Copycat was copied, for lack of a better term, you think?Anyway, Rhyme looks at the evidence that Amelia has photographed and gathered and feels that she has a gift for forensics work, even though she's just a beat-cop.  So he decides that she'll be his eyes and ears at the scene of the next murder.  They know that there will be another one because the evidence tells them so.The story goes on from there, time after time they examine the evidence and find the right places to be, but they are just one step behind the killer. Of course you know that after about 2 hours they will have caught him/her, or killed him/her.From an entertainment standpoint, this an excellent film.  It pushes all the right buttons.  The characters are generally believable, but Amelia's initial indifference towards Rhyme seems written in as opposed to genuine to the script.  The same is true for the character Capt. Howard Cheney played by Michael Rooker.  His complete lack of respect for Rhyme seemed phony because it was just there, it was never explained.  At least with Amelia, you could see that she was supposed to be cool towards Rhyme because he was trying to get her to do things she didn't want to do.Denzel is excellent as usual, Ed O'Neil is good, and in general, this is a great movie.",The Bone Collector
176,Tyler-Durden,Here is what I think about this movie.,9,22 April 2000,"What in the world comes to your mind when you see a title like ""The Bone Collector? I personally thought it was some guy who killed people and collected their bones. But it's nothing like that. This movie is very interesting.Something the makers of this movie did that is different from most of the other movies of this type, is putting a woman (Angelina Jolie) to make a cop's performance, and allow me to say, she did a great job.One of things I didn't like about this movie is watching Denzel Washington all the time in the same position, in a bed!! But good actors always make good jobs, and even though he was laying down in a bed all the time, he did a great job (as in all of his movies). Denzel is, no doubt about it, one of the best actors if his era.The idea of making all the murders based on a book is fantastic, and the way Denzel Washington discovers that the killer is leading him (them, the police) to a book is great. It's also a little bit hard to believe that the cops (Jolie) always found a tiny piece of paper in every crime scene.I also think they (the writters) exaggerated a little in some scenes, for example: When Washington remembers something about some company (or something like that) of the year 1910 (or something like that) .. What was he? A ""Human Encyclopedia"" ?? Oh well, movies are movies..Anyway, this movie is pretty good and really worth watching. I'll give it a 9/10 score.",The Bone Collector

The acting is quite good and the filmmakers understand it to build a 'scary' atmosphere. Of course, this is no masterpiece like Se7en, but its okay... What I did not liked at all, was the ending. It was so (!!!) predictable. Some people even made bets à la ""5 bucks she will save him"". Moreover it was really stupid, that the killer's motive had nothing to do with the entire film. And maybe the worst about the film was this completely ridiculous christmas scene where both lead characters seem to be a couple. It seemed to me like the writer thought ""Oh s**t, I forgot the two have to fall in love"" and so he wrote this scene.Bottom line: Quite entertaining but too predictable to be good.

Denzel Washington, Queen Latifah, Louis Guzman, Michael Rooker, Leland Orser and, without any reference to a shoe store, Ed O'Neill. Love 'em, hate 'em...all actors who, in the past, consistently turned in solid performances. Overall and in general, I was fairly well entertained...mostly. Then, into the mix stepped ANGELINA JOLIE! I guess, at that point, I was supposed to ""OOOHH"" and ""AAAHH"", but I didn't. In fact, I found myself distracted by her contrast to the other characters. She sure didn't LOOK the part, and as the movie went on, she kept proving she sure couldn't ACT the part, either. Finally, I hit the point where I had JUST ONE QUESTION. Does she have any acting ability at all? If I were to base the answer on this movie, alone, the answer would be, ""NO""! I point this out, because her presence, and her contrast to the other characters, had a huge influence on the overall quality of the movie. With another actor, the movie would have demanded a much higher rating and, in turn, much larger numbers in the box office as well.",The Bone Collector

Rather, no role is a challenge, no character illiciting any degree of love or hate out of the viewer.Where this film suffers the greatest is at the root of the plot. A twisted, murderous psychopath is one thing; one with mission and purpose is another. There lies the difference between a slasher flick (Friday the 13th, Halloween) and a psychological thriller (Seven, Silence of the Lambs). The Bone Collector instead lies somewhere between. The villain here is twisted, calculated and smart, yet for all his plotting and planning they have no effect whatsoever on his ultimate goal.By the time the credits roll we care nothing one way or the other about any of the characters that died, regardless of  whatever amount of plot development they received.

For the most part, thanks to another great performance by charismatic Denzel Washington, and stylish, dark depictions of grisly murders sprinkled throughout the film, I was not disappointed.Like almost any cops-chase-the-psycho-killer-to-save-the-victim-in-time movie(see ""silence of the lambs,) a suspension of disbelief on the part of the audience is a necessity.  Take, for instance, the willingness of the NYPD to outfit the bed-ridden Washington's apartment with a staff of perhaps 30 pathologists, scientists and detectives complete with appropriate computers, lab equipment and state-of-the-art telecommunications center. Once these excesses are overlooked, ""Collector"" moves at an extremely fast pace, and delivers the chills and action as promised.Several graphic, realistic mutilations are performed during the film, so the viewer should be advised in advance.

People like serial killer stuff. It'll sell... 2.The killer needs to adopt some sort of pattern. I know; he'll copy it out of a serial killer mystery novel. That hasn't been done yet, at least not exactly like that. 3.Now, we need some kind of way to make this movie unique; of course, the good guy can be bedridden like in Rear Window. 4.Lastly, we need a twist ending that will give this movie the success of The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects.Okay, now that you know these things, you know the whole movie, so don't waste your money. One thing I really hate about moviemakers is that they take a perfectly good concept for movies and completely run them into the ground. I wrote better stories than this when I was in Junior High. I just kept checking my watch every five minutes. When the twist ending finally came, I wasn't shocked, I just said, ""Oh. Who cares?!"" The characters are two-dimensional. They have your typical movie personalities. This movie is just proof that stealing the elements of other successful movies is no excuse for a bad script. I give this movie 1 out of 10.

Angelina Jolie portrays a New York city cop who starts out as a youth cop and turns to detective. Throughout the Film she maintains a fantastic accent, good looks and a thoroughly good performance, the best of hers that i have seen to date.The Story unfolds with Denzil Washington's character befalling upon an accident leaving him severely handicapped and virtually crippled from the neck down. It is in this Role Washington steals the show portraying a severely disabled character with solidity, courage and in places light humour. The bone collector really struck me back as to how good it became, with the murders and crime scenes become better as the film proceeds. I feel the Bone collector however lacks a truly fantastic script docking it 2 points from the full marks. However in saying this I highly recommend this film to many people but not for the daytime.

They do the best they can, but the plot details are so utterly contrived that it is ridiculous.  Why is Jolie (or any police officer, for that matter) sent into underground, deserted crime scenes to investigate, when the killer is obviously still at large?  I am not overly familiar with police work, but this made absolutely no sense to me.  With such a horrific killer at work, why would any officer, female or male, be sent out alone purposely?  Another problem I had with it was the pseudo-romantic relationship that was hinted at...at least that's how I took the later interactions between the main characters.  Must EVERY film with a male and female lead end in the requisite romantic connection?  Is it impossible for them to remain simply respected colleagues and friends?

He proved he was not talented in telling a story by cameras again.This script was not bad initially, but director had no gift in dealing with his resources.",The Bone Collector
202,F6Pilot,"A Creepy, Spooky Crime Drama ...",9,26 March 2000,"I just saw this movie a few hours ago for free, since it just came to my college's theater. I remember wanting to see this flick when it came out, but I never got around to it. I honestly don't know what all the criticism is about. I liked the movie a lot.Why? Well, here's a short list.1. Denzel Washington was his usual excellent self, playing the quadriplegic New York forensic investigator. His quiet kind of determination and humor, considering his condition, was really part of the heart and soul of this movie.2. I'm a sucker for most movies that have Angelina Jolie in them. Her character swung between tough as nails and vulnerable, and she made it look very believable. My only beef is her job on the story. More on this later.3. The villain is a brutal, sadistic, macabre, and utterly ruthless bad guy, who is excellent, lacking in only one quality - surprise. More on this later as well.4. Excellent shots of the New York City landscape.The movie has two major downsides, but in my case they were easy to overlook.1. The NYPD has a LOT of Forensic investigators on it's staff. There was never any excuse for sending an untrained patrol officer (like Angelina Jolie) as the first one into every crime scene. Lincoln Rhyme can't do it? Fine. Send one of the other dozen or so forensic teams. Talented or not, possessing great instincts or not, Amelia needed a lot more training before she could be trusted to be the first one on a crime scene, with or without Lincoln's endorsement.2. SPOILER ALERT.  The producers and directors apparently wanted to keep the killer's identity a secret, showing no hint of either his inspiration or motivation behind the crimes (much less the killer's identity) until it's close to the end. That was while they were filming. Then, to promote the movie, they do what? GIVE THE KILLER AN IMPORTANT LINE IN THE TRAILER!! Think back to a sentence that went something like this: ""I gave you so many clues and you still failed! "" C'mon, folks! I couldn't be the only one in the whole country who recognized that voice as Lieutenant DeWindt the glider pilot in ""Saving Private Ryan"", or that poor guy from the massage parlor in ""Se7en"". All I had to do was look for Leland Orser (yes, that actor has a name) and bingo! The killer's ID was no longer a surprise.2. Even if I haven't seen those movies, The Bone Collector goes out of it's way to give it away. All of the victim's have surgical cuts in their bodies.. Hmmmmm. How many characters that we know about have a medical background? In this movie the killer was supposed to be a surprise. But it wasn't.Also, a mini-beef. I guess there was some sort of semi-romantic subplot with Amelia and Lincoln, but the scriptwriters thought it would be best to wait until the flick's almost over to introduce it. Why? I dunno. Didn't like that part. I mean, c'mon. If they're gonna pair off, pair off! If not, don't try to make the story more interesting with half-baked love plots.I call it 8/10 for the Bone Collector, an excellent suspense thriller in the tradition of ""Se7en"" and ""Copycat"" that drops the ball in some very easy places.",The Bone Collector

However, aside from that, the scenes of the crimes were really good and nail-biting. Those urban scenes of New York city, underground places, lost subways to the final waterfront were very good.

The other problem with this film is the script, which does not play fair with the viewer. The killer turns out to be someone totally unexpected, which would be fine if any clues to his or her identity had been given somewhere in the movie.

208,88keyz,Chills you to the bone!,9,5 November 1999,"Universal has a given us one of the best suspense thrillers to come down the pipe in a long time. The Bone Collector is a fantastic crime thriller about a killer that wants to be caught. Angelina Jolie plays Amelia Donaghy, a NYPD beat cop that discovers a grisly murder one day. A man buried beside the train tracks with only his hand sticking out of the ground. His index finger has been stripped of its skin right down to the bone and his wife's wedding band placed on it. The clues to finding the wife are there and Donaghy knows it. Thinking quickly Donaghy gets pictures of all evidence that she believes is important, even going as far as to stop a train travelling through the crime scene. When Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington), NYPD's best forensic scientist and a recent paraplegic, hears of what Donaghy did at the crime scene he makes her a proposition that she can't refuse, as much as she wants to. She is to be Rhyme's eyes and ears on the crime scene while he offers her the tutelage and knowledge that is needed to solve this weird case. You see the murderer in question has gone to difficult lengths to make sure that the forensic team finds out where his next victim is going to be found. Director Phillip Noyce (The Saint, Patriot Games) has given us another winner! Washington gives a powerful performance even though he is a confined to a hospital bed for 99% of his scenes. Jolie blossoms as an actress right before your eyes, destroying any doubt that she is one of the most talented young actresses in the business today. This film pulls no punches at the crime scenes, in the same way that Seven shocked audiences a few years back. Definitely not one for the squeamish, but if you enjoy a little well placed gore in your movies then this is right up your ally. So do whatever you can to see this film while its in theatres, just don't take a cab!",The Bone Collector

I didn't understand why Washington and Jolie liked each other, it seemed they were at each other's thoats, and then suddenly she was molesting him!  Isn't there some kind of law against this.

The serial killer leaving clues, the ""twists"" along the way, and especially the ""climax"" that was so predictable you literally know exactly what is going to happen at each moment - not to mention the sickly sweet ending.
It has a good look thanks to director Philip Noyce, and Denzel Washington is excellent as always, although he may very well have mailed in this performance. I guess Hollywood just can't help themselves - they followed a tried and true (and overdone) formula, and test marketed the ending to make sure everyone felt warm and fuzzy after 2 hours of watching brutal murders. No wonder Noyce recently felt like he had to get off the Hollywood treadmill/production-line and come back to Australia to make one from the heart (Rabbit Proof Fence).",The Bone Collector

Angelina Jolie is very good as Amelia and Denzel Washington is wonderful as always. It's a nice change to have cop who was paralyzed from the neck down. The character of Eddie Ortiz was hilarious, and Queen Latifah was also brilliant although her role wasn't very big.However, the ending was very cliché. Keep in mind that the killer's true identity was VERY hard to predict. But his REASONS for killing Linkin were pretty lame. Another serial killer out on a revenge path? Geez, where have I seen that before? Also, it doesn't really make sense that if the Linkin's doctor was the killer, then that means they were in the room together countless times since Linkin's accident. Not to mention that there's one line that clearly states, ""Jesus, he was trying to send messages even then."" So he would have had plenty of opportunities when Linkin was alone in his apartment with just Thelma, who the doc killed anyway. Amelia coming up behind him and shooting him in the back JUST in time was incredibly predictable as well.One last thing.

Only the quality acting (laboring under a completely inadequate script) attempts to keep this boneheaded exercise in celluloid waste management afloat.  I felt cheated never having a hope of figuring out what the mystery was and doubly so when, after the film was over, there wasn't any clues that I missed... in fact there were no clues at all as to the identity of the killer.View it if you must as long as there's nothing else more challenging... like, say, watching your underwear spin in the clothes dryer.3 out of 10 (and that only because I feel charitable today!)",The Bone Collector

So, discovering the DVD in the $5.50 bin at the store, I picked it up. I now know why the film didn't stay in the cinema long enough for me to see it. There's not much to it. There is definitely no chemistry between the main characters (Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie), nor is there much depth to the characters, though there are many, many attempts at eliciting our ""sympathy"" toward them rather than letting us discover who they are. The look of the film is mostly okay, though its glossiness doesn't create that dark, horror effect/feel (except at certain moments). The plot/story is probably the film's strongest point, and as a police/suspense/mystery, I never guessed who the killer was. However, I never got the feeling, either, that there was a legitimate, people-bonding police investigation going on.

The reviews of this movie were less than spectacular from our local paper, so I was a little scared that she would not live up to the potential set forth by her performances in Playing by Heart and Gia.  Luckily, her, as well as Washington, delivered spectacular performances.

Adding to the cast is Angelina Jolie who shows that she can act as well as look great too.   The storyline revolves around a serial killer who is taking his MO (modus operandi) from a gothic book called ""The Bone Collecter"".  The forensic technology used to try to catch this killer is intriguing.  Ed O'Neill as always a good character actor, plays a helpful cop also in pursuit of the killer.  The three main players interact well and the chemistry between Denzel and Angelina's characters is obvious.  There are some gruesome scenes depicted but works well with the storyline.

It somehow feels like the plot is somwehat unfinished. Quite early in the movie you find out that Angelina Jolie's father was a police officer who committed suicide when she was young and that she was the one who found him. After this you expect this to have some kind of impact on the rest of the movie, but it doesn't. The murderer is someone that the ""hero"" knows, but it doesn't really matter since he's not playing an active part in the movie anyway. The way I feel about this is that there are things in this movie that are just in it, without really having any meaning. Bone Collector seems to me like a movie the writers haven't put too much effort in.
The story isn't unique either. A serial kille giving the cops clues, basing his acts on some old stories... Haven't we all seen that before?? And of course, in the end it turns out that the serial killer is an old enemy of the ""hero"", on a personal crusade against him.Well folks, although I'm not too impressed by this movie it is at least worth watching if you have a couple of hours to spend!

I don't much care for movies where people are supposed to be super smart but act dumb (such as Jolie's going to one crime site with no back up).  Guys from Law & Order woulda caught this guy in 35 minutes of screen time tops.  Plus if we've learned anything about the serial killer genre it is the old horror movie cliche...got to care about the characters before we care they are in danger.  Since the film starts out with characters who are, at best, ambivalent about their own existence, I found it hard to worry for them.

But even with Denzel Washington leading the way this is so far from what actually happens. This ""thriller"" isn't thrilling at all.To start off with, Angelina Jolie's character is used to collect forensic evidence throughout the film, despite being unexperienced, but for serious murder cases you'd think they'd go for an expert rather than use the situation as training. Guided by a paraplegic detective (Denzel) they have to solve a series of murders by someone using the signature described above. Later on in the film it seems that the murderer is copying all of his acts from a book, down to the finest detail for each. With all this build-up I was there hoping it would lead to something that would actually make this film memorable for a good reason.However, the ending is such a massive disappointment, involving someone you only saw once in the film. He reveals his reasons for the murders which all in all makes the vast majority of the rest of the movie utterly utterly pointless. The whole ""bone collector"" persona was crap. All it did was link the murders, nothing more. The ending is just pasted on to a fairly dull and unrelated storyline, which is so far from thrilling. The murderer is simply looking for revenge on Denzel, so why does he go through all this extra effort of murdering innocent people when he could simply walk into this guys room and kill him? I've heard people say he wanted to make him suffer, but he's already paralysed and was soon wanting to end his life, so that simply doesn't make sense. He even fails at killing him in the end with the unbelievably predictable scenario in which Jolie saves the day in the nick of time with a gunshot just before Denzel would have been killed.There's much much more but I'm already disappointed that I've gone through the whole ending.

From Glory to Malcom X and especially Devil in a Blue Dress he has never ceased to impress me. He does have some moments as this know-it-all parapalegic, and I understand that the fellow can only move his index finger, but for the most part his character of Lincoln Rhyme lacks depth and interest.

The now-Oscar winner is perfect as the hard-boiled rookie who is (in yet another gross stretch of verisimilitude) picked by Rhyme to work the crime scenes. Queen Latifah is surprisingly tolerable. And why the hell Ed O'Neil was cast is beyond me. He was funny as Al Bundy, but he is so pathetic as an detective that there wasn't even a smile on my face. And you thought he could get no lower than a shoe salesman.The thing that did impress me was the forensics aspect. Having taken two classes in investigation, I noticed how technical the knowledge was in this movie. Most of this comes from the Jeffrey Deaver book from which it is adapted, but Jeremy Iacone also had to know a good bit to script this. Still, when Jolie's character (Amelia Donaghy) moves one of the clues, then sits it back down and photographs it, I had to cringe. I think the French would call that tainted a la O.J.. Ouch. Still, as technically correct as this film was, it was equally improbable.Deaver's book of the same title was lackluster at best, yet far better than the movie. Yet another of Iacone's intolerable offenses were his changes in the plot. For starters, there was no heat in the book between Officer Donaghy and Rhyme. But I suppose your typical Hollywood screenwriter knows that there has to be some sort of sparks flying for the masses to keep interested (as if the grisly images of tortured bodies weren't enough). On top of that,(and this is a spoiler for the movie and the book, so if you have not seen it, skip to the next paragraph) though Iacone decided to add Rhyme's mentioning a desire for euthanasia, he ends the movie with a horridly sappy Yuletide reunion with Rhyme and his estranged sister. However, Deaver ends on a much darker note, leading the reader to believe that Rhyme went through with his plans. A much more credible ending, but we all know how Hollywood has to have that feel-good uplifting BS at the end.With a twisted plot, a less-than-terrifying villain, and one bloody disgusting image after another, this movie is your average run-of-the-mill serial killer flick. Silence of the Lambs and Seven were both brilliant, but I've seen them. Why not scrap this equation for movies and plug in some different numbers. Why? Because serial killers sell, and the average moviegoer is not bright enough to figure out he is watching the same movie with a different cast. Though it is almost worth the watch just to see Jolie's tough chick performance, I would recommend those serious movie fans pass this one up.My verdict: Make it a dust collector on the rental shelves.",The Bone Collector

Denzel Washington does a good turn in leading us to believe he is a bedridden quadraplegic who can only move his head and two fingers on his left hand which are seemingly permanently attached to a computer mouse.

But I could tell who the killer was WAY too early into the movie, and though there was gore aplenty in the movie, the suspense required to make it frightening was sadly lacking.

245,jlevin1937,"90 Minutes of Thrill, 30 minutes of idiocy",6,2 February 2002,"It seems as if the consensus here is that ""The Bone Collector"" is a pretty awful movie.  While it has some very nice qualities, I have to agree that this film was overall a failure.  Like many have said, Denzel Washington is fantastic.  He plays the role of a quadriplegic perfectly: depressed and suicidal at times, focused and brilliant at others.  Angelina Jolie is interesting as tough cop with great forensic skills.  I don't think she is miscast as much as unsure with how her character is motivated and driven; the script points her in a few interesting directions, like the pre-film suicide of her policeman father, but we are not allowed to see much further into her life.  I would have liked to see more of what makes her character ""tick,"" but the movie chooses to take a much different path.  Ed O'Neill has fun in a serious role here, but I wish he had more screen time.The script is creepy, presenting a cabbie killer who leaves his victims to die in gruesome, unpleasant ways, leaving clues leading to the next crime he will commit.  Washington must guide Jolie through investigating these crimes from his bed (adding a new twist to the tired ""buddy-cop"" movie).  The plot holes, while often apparent and gaping, don't detract much from the overall thrill of watching the movie.  Unfortunately, the ending does.  The unmasking of the cabbie killer is so unsatisfying that it nearly ruins the whole of the film. I'd suggest renting the DVD so you can hear Phillip Noyce's commentary, describing how he would have changed the ending (it would have made the film much more successful).  Jeremy Iacone, clearly a talented (though inexperienced) screenwriter, really should have had some help with the climax.

Angelina is my inspiration and is beautiful in all her movies. This was a different role for her since she is more of a wounded bird. But I liked it just the same. She is emotional and closed off, but still retains the wantonness she embodies.Denzel is good and interesting as an invalid injured on the job. My favorite those is Queen Latifah.

I wonder if Christopher Reeve auditioned for this film?  The suspense was there, along with the unnecessarily gory shots of the victims, which I found to be a bit much.

This is one of those movies where the clues were all-important and where, had it been better written, everything would have meant something.  What interested me from the very beginning was the presence of that dangling monkey in the killer's taxi.  I kept thinking: there must be a reason.  And there was.The dangling monkey is a clue for the audience of what's to come.  I won't give away the ending of the movie, but the monkey does represent what happens.  Note:  the following is a vague spoiler, so skip it if you don't want to know anything:
One of the final scenes from the film is borrowed - okay, stolen - from another movie featuring an individual with quadriplegia and a monkey.

251,DrStrangelove114,Just another red herring driven dark thriller,7,26 April 2000,"There is a disturbing trend in murder mysteries these days. They keep you guessing who the killer is until the very end and then make it a person that had no significance to the plot and was only  in the movie for three minutes before their unveiling. THE BONE COLLECTOR is a perfect example of this.
The saddest thing is that the concept of THE BONE COLLECTOR is very good, but in the end they use this dues ex machina-like plot device to end  the movie. The story is that, an ingenius forensic cop who has been paralyzed from the neck down(Washington) takes a  rookie (Jolie) under his wing to be his eyes, ears and legs in a complex string of murders.
The most frustrating thing is that the man you suspect to be the killer, until the end, is uncredited as the masked killer, just to make you think the killer is this red herring character. IT IS A CHEAT. At least with the films it is compared  to (THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and SEVEN) do not deceive the viewer so maliciously, or at all for that matter.The only slightly positive thing  about this movie for me was the always-compelling Angelina Jolie.",The Bone Collector

And the suspense is nonexsistent. The film breaks no new ground, the acting is sub-par, and the characters are never fully explored. The only character you feel anything for is the on played By Queen Latefa, not because of her acting but because you can almost see the bordem of her characters job and because of her overly small roll.

I won't spoil it, but basically the most over-used set of movie cliches get done badly and half heartedly for the most disappointing last five minutes to any film, ever.The movie also includes the most cringe inducing scene ever, the attempt at on-screen chemistry between the two lead roles when we're presented with a close up of Angela Jolie stroking Denzel Washington's finger lovingly. It may be the only thing he could move, but quite why the viewer is treated to a zoom of Washington's finger getting stroked amidst the kind of dimmed lights and music appropriate for a sex scene is beyond me. I laughed out loud and shook my head.The direction of the storyline borrows heavily from Se7en, but here it is executed far more simplistically, and far too obviously. To call it a poor-mans Se7en would be an understatement, this really is nothing more than a made for TV movie and even Jolie and Washington's best efforts can't convince that this is a box office film.",The Bone Collector
254,nhawman,When will Hollywood stop Insulting our intelligence ?,4,6 January 2002,"This has to be one of the daftest police procedure thrillers of recent times:Absurd point 1:  A crippled former policeman, prone to life-threatening seizures, is somehow put in charge of an investigation into a serial killer.Absurd point 2:  On his say-so alone, a rookie cop with no formal training is made scene-of-crime officer.   This is apparently because he thinks she has a good ""eye"" for forensic details.Most absurd bit of the movie:  The rookie cop is sent alone into a crime scene, not knowing whether the perpetrator is still there.   Despite having no medical training and the victim not even having been officially declared dead, she is told to cut the victim's hands off in order to get the handcuffs which might have fingerprints on them.  Of course, by cutting the victims hands off, our heroine would actually be destroying post-mortem evidence but er..we'll gloss over that point. Sensibly, she refuses.Is this some sort of conspiracy been the police and Hollywood ?  Are the police fed up of movies acting as self-help manuals for criminals, so the film-makers have been told to make new storylines as far from accepted police procedure as possible ?  I think that any real detective watching this movie would be in severe danger of dying from a rupture caused by excess laughter.At no point do the investigators seem to do anything other than follow the leads laid down for them by the criminal himself.  No wonder he gets away with it for so long.  For example, an obvious line of enquiry would be the taxi the murderer uses to transport his victims but this anyone think of pursuing that ?  No.I don't mind daft storylines if the film has something else to offer, but this didn't.

256,MissTofu,Another average crime movie...,7,15 December 2002,"*Warning: spoilers in this review*The acting of Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie was not bad and the acting by the rest of the cast was not bad too.The failing point of the movie was the plot. There was too much emphasis on gore and not enough emphasis on certain aspects of the film like the ideas, etc. so the audience were not able to interpret nor understand certain aspects of the plot.Also, some parts of the plot were not very believable. Like: the part towards the ending where Amelie escaped from arrest. I can't believe that the officers were not smart enough to keep an eye on her.Also, I don't believe how evidence could just be left lying around on the desk. It's plain obvious that if you should lose the evidence, you're partly to blame and a Captain isn't supposed to do that at all.Other not-so convincing parts were how some of the victims could not be strong enough to try and smash their way out. Normally, when faced with a crisis, the victim will try his best to escape and not let the killer get to him or even suddenly possess an incredible amount of will and do something that's totally unexpected of him.Another rather weird issue was that the film was made in 1999. So, how come there's a lack of cellphones/handphones, even? It's obvious a lot of people owned cellphones or handphones by 1999, so it was kinda weird how none of the victims owned one and therefore, be able to call for help.A last point was the lack of realism in this movie concerning how the victims were picked. It seems that the killer managed to get his victims, by coincidence and not by selecting the victims. If I'm not wrong, he drove the cab only when he wanted to kill so as to avoid getting caught by the police. Therefore, it was odd how he didn't manage to get injured if say, he had chosen a victim who was stronger than him.The pacing of the movie was all right. It was intense at some points but in other parts, the pacing falls flat.Maybe some of today's film directors should take a lesson from the directors who made great films in the past like Alfred Hitchock: that no matter how much money you have, it isn't just the visual aspect that counts. It's the plot that ties everything together and makes the audience believe what they see on the screen.

I thought that The Bone Collector was a great thriller with plenty of nerve racking suspense that is guaranteed to have you on the edge of your seat. The acting is good and the methods of murder that the killer uses in this film are creative and interesting. The Bone Collecter may not be the best thriller of the nineties but it definitely is one of them. Partly because of its classic and smart ending and its creative and originally good plot that involves a young female cop who is trying to catch a serial killer, using the help of paraplegic cop Lincholn Rhyme.What I admire most about The Bone Collector is the way in which it is so original. It does not steal ideas from other movies and everything in The Bone Collector is totally original and scary. What The Bone Collector could use though is a little bit of a better ending. In the ending, some of the things that happen appear to be really stupid. But it still has a decent ending despite some of the things that happen in it.The acting in The Bone Collector is good, but not great. Apart from the brilliant performance from Leland Orser. Although he only appears in two scenes, he still does really well.Overall, The Bone Collector does not reach the brilliance of some other 1990's thriller films like Seven, Pulp Fiction and The Sixth Sense.

I guess I never expected to see Queen Latifah in the same movie as Ed O'Neill.  As I said, it was a pleasant surprise.Then I saw Leland Orser's name come up.  Unfortunately for him, he's one of the most type-cast actors out there.  I've seen too many movies that have him playing the skittish/high-strung/totally insane loser who never has a good fate.  Watch Se7en, Alien Resurrection, and Very Bad Things to see what I mean.  Anyway, from that moment onward, I could guess what would happen. I won't give any details here, but suffice to say that the plot degenerated into a straightforward chase-down-that-psycho-killer, rehashed and unoriginal.  There were a few situational twists to change it up, but ultimately it borrowed heavily from other movies in this genre, most blatantly Se7en.Hmmm.

Now, granted I am not going to deny that I fall asleep easily, however, falling asleep during this movie had no influence on my decision that I found this film to be crap. First lets talk about the acting... I was only slightly impressed by Angelina's attempt at a new york accent. Other than that, I thought it was a less than stellar performance on all fronts. Come on, Dezel what the heck were you thinking? Hmm, maybe he thought he had already payed his dues making movies where he actually had to walk, and felt he owed it to himself to take it easy on this one. I felt he over acted throughout the whole picture. And that has got to be hard to do when you are stuck in a bed the entire time. Angelina was so skinny it was uncomfortable to watch. Aside from that, the whole melodramatic feel to the movie took away from it's coolness. It just seemed that the relationship between Denzel and Angie was forced and fake and totally romanticized, forcing it into something it wasn't at all. And what was the whole relationship thing they tried to throw in there? Complete nonsense. Then the killer. He was the dude form Very Bad Things and to me, played the same character but with more words. He was so over the top it, again, made the coolness of the movie turn into a piece of packaged string cheese. Don't get me wrong, I love cheese. Cheese like cabin fever is good. Cheese like Saved by the Bell is good. But Cheese like this picture just wasn't my brand of cheese. Laslty, Queen Latifa. I don't know about anyone else here, but I love this woman. I will watch anything she is in, just cuz she is in it. Now I know what you are thinking.... How can this person be a reliable source on this film, when she is an admitted ""teef"" fan. I loves me some Teefs, and I thought that she could've played a bigger part in this picture.

Since ""Seven"" -I think- there is no need for another film, because I can't imagine a film better then Finchers 1995-masterpiece.Phillip Noyce is a good director. I liked his thrillers, because he is able to give momentum to his films. Not many directors of the second line in Hollywood are that good. Even in ""Bone Collector"" you can see, what he wants to do. But it is very difficult to feel it. The script is not able to captivate some interest for the characters. The dialogues are terrible, the whole story predictable. You can bring it down to a usual mentor-scholar story, with all the standard-problems, for example the uneffective, but very loud speaking counterpart to the old mentor.Without the very good cast -fabulous Denzel Washington in lead- the film would have been worse. Washington is able to make the silly lines he has to utter seem like reliable dialogue.I think we can thank Noyce and his cast. The film is slightly above average, not because of the story. I would have been more satisfied with another script. The film would have worked much better, it would have had atmosphere and maybe I would have felt something like suspense.

Going into this, all indications and rumors described this movie as ""Seven; but with a chick"", and I wish that were the truth. Seven had plot. Seven had a serial killer with a motive. Seven had acting.For two long, slow, and gory hours I sat watching this movie, hoping from the start that it would end so I would not have to put up with it any longer. But alas, the ending did not come soon enough. Instead you are subjected to needless gore and blood which was painfully unneeded, and in the end, when you finally see the killer, you discover his motive; or general lack thereof. When you ponder the motive, it is discovered that the whole movie is basically pointless and without reason.Avoid it. Go out and rent Seven.",The Bone Collector

271,Dennis-63,"A great suspense-thriller in the genre of ""Rear Window""",9,26 November 1999,"Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie combine wonderfully in a formula for suspense that omits the expected startling elements designed to scare you our of your seat. In a style similar to ""Rear Window"" and ""Wait Until Dark"", ""The Bone Collector"" pits intellectual savvy against criminal genius, and youthful courage against the terror of a madman.  There is a fair share of high-tech gadgetry, but not beyond believability.Queen Latifah adds a wonderful character as Washington's nurse and ""girl Friday.""""The Bone Collector"" is good entertainment.  While it could be argued that there is a lack of character depth, and take-away value, ""The Bone Collector"" is a great mystery and worth the price of admission.",The Bone Collector

And the amazing thing to me is how someone could possibly think that the ending of this movie in any way was intelligent or even good for that matter.The serial killer aspect of this movie was going in a decent direction right up to the end.  But like so many other movies of this genre, it took a STUPID turn at the end to wrap things up in a nice neat little package and basically made a really crummy movie out of something that could have been decent.  I had no real expectations for this flick at all.  But was enjoying the pace and plot for the most part.  But with an ending like this, the rest of the movie ends up looking really lame.  All the wonderful setup in the world couldn't make up for what I perceived to be a predictable, uninspired turn.Too bad too.  Denzel is so much better than this.  He deserves better roles in much better movies.  My dog could have written a better movie than this. Ok, maybe I exaggerate, but not much.The only redeeming quality of this movie is Michael Rooker's character.  I love watching him play this kind of role and doesn't disappoint in this performance.Too bad.  Guess I'll go see the Insider and hope for some real movie making.",The Bone Collector

Maniacally brutal, yes!...but it is a tale of the finding of a brutal maniac. Angelina Jolie shows that she really has it as a film actress, as does Queen Latifah, in a lesser role.  The film is very slickly lensed and certainly well edited.  The pulsating and driving music is not only well composed but extremely well scored.  We should all keep an ear out for Craig Armstrong's next film score. While the story is extreme, to say the least, and does get somewhat ""stretched"" in the last reel, this is a movie that will be of interest to anyone who wants to see what Hollywood is up to today with suspense thrillers. CAVEAT!....If brutality interferes with your appreciation of good film making, stay away from this picture.",The Bone Collector

But that might be because it would only be five minutes long.I don't really even know where to start with my criticisms of this film.  I guess I'll start with the premise: a paralyzed detective is the ONLY person in the world who can solve a string of murders.  Even if we suspend our disbelief and pretend that he really is THAT good, there's still the totally unreal logic he uses throughout the film (you know the kind: the one in a million shot that is always right).  Let's pretend that that too is possible.  There's still the fact that Jon Voight's daughter's character, who has as much detective training as I do, is the only police officer in the city who can help Denzel solve the murders.I won't tell you the ending, but I will say that you'll be very disappointed.Please do not watch this movie.",The Bone Collector

281,Clint_Movie_Maniac,Average storyline but great in many other ways!!!,7,12 August 2007,"I had barely heard of this movie before when a friend of mine recommended it to me and i watched it. and in may ways, i was impressed.first off, i haven't read Jeffery Deaver's book so i cannot judge whether this movie was a good adaptation or not. what i can say is that the script is nothing out of the ordinary and merely consists of police trying to track a serial killer and trying to stop him from doing his next crime, which is quite simple. I, for one, would have liked to see more action scenes.The characters, however, is what kept the plot afloat and the actors portraying them pulled off wonderful performances: 1)Rhyme (Washington)is a brilliant near-paralyzed detective who is often asked assistance with some cases despite his condition. Washington's performance continued to confirm that he is a marvelous actor. i say this since during the whole movie, he only got to move his face and finger, but still managed to make the character believable and intriguing 2)Donaghy (Jolie) is a doubtful but brilliant officer whose character develops marvelously during the story. Donaghy was not that seductive tantalizing super-hot woman that Jolie is usually casted in most of her movies. her character is deeper and she portrays it beautifully. 3)Thelma (Latifah) is a helpful and caring nurse. It is not a big character in the movie but Latifah seems to make the most of it and gives, as usual, a strong performance 4)Cheney (Rooker) is a meddling officer who helps to create a certain tension to the story.The soundtrack and sound effects were OK and it did not interfere with the action on screen.Over all, i think this movie is worth watching as it keeps you entertained and interested. The Directing and screenplay are also very well done. If I were you, I would not miss this movie. I give it 7/10. It is not a masterpiece but it is worth praising.",The Bone Collector
282,JB Martin,Watched It Because Denzel Washington Was in It,9,3 April 2002,"Being a fan of Denzel Washington, I had wanted to see ""The Bone Collector"" when it came to theatres in November 1999.When the STARZ! Channel had their ""free preview"" in early March, I found out that ""The Bone Collector"" would be on.  So I stayed up late, expecting a good film, maybe for the fact that Denzel Washington can ""competently walk through"" any role that he takes, whether it be an FBI agent (""The Siege""), an angel (""The Preacher's Wife""), a lieutenant colonel (""Courage Under Fire"") or a quadriplegic forensic officer (""The Bone Collector"").I was right... Denzel's acting was great, but the movie itself was horrible.I was surprised to learn that ""The Bone Collector"" opened at No. 1 at the box office.  This film is possibly one of the worst films I've ever seen, up there with the Christian Slater/Val Kilmer film ""Run for the Money"" (which never made it to theatres or was a direct-to-video flick).""The Bone Collector"" is like ""Fallen"" and ""Virtuosity"": two Denzel Washington movies with great performances, but flopped like a fish out of water.",The Bone Collector

I do have to comment on the fact that the killer could not have been guessed, although the movie itself concluded with you believing you should have been able to.  The killer was out of the blue and as I reviewed the movie the 2nd time through was convinced that the book would have been a better bet. (maybe)",The Bone Collector
285,manucan,Another professional run-of-the-mill blockbuster,5,20 January 2000,"A so-so Hollywood pulp film.  The initial scenes were thrillingly gripping and the atmosphere creepily filled with a sense of horror/dread. The viewer's interest is immediately perked and made expectant of a first-class film experience.What is wrong in short with this movie is that the serial killer plot becomes a repetitive series of generally the same sequence of events, with deserts of close-up portrait boredom of the 2 main stars. After the second 'episode', any half-decent brain can deduce what is to happen next.Unfortunately, consistency remains only with the serial-gore episodes. Frankly one dimensional 'comic book' characterisation of even the 2 main hero(ine)s, simplified to 5sec/one-liner side references to their respective histories leaves one looking only to how good-looking the stars are, as a means of empathy for them. The 'co-stars' are generally lost in the background, as they usually have the same mood/expression in every scene.The inability of the movie-telling to engage/involve the viewer to participate in trying to solve the clues leaves anyone who tries bewildered. I doubt even a native New Yorker with a good grasp of his city's history can identify with the 'problem- solving' scenes. Hence, we are left to simply accept the solutions and marvel at the IQ and 'database memory' of the Bone- Collector's mind. Oohh.. we are all in awe of his mental prowess!Even when Washington's medic sidekick joins in the 'puzzle solving', she was earlier shown fiddling with a jigsaw puzzle, hence qualifying her expertise. Canny film-making indeed!As I approached dozing-off point, unnecessarily loud 'bangs' of opening doors occur. Trying to find a reason for the director to choose to cause heart failure among the audience, I can only conclude that these may be calculated to wake us up from our slumber.When the culprit is finally revealed, one is not hit by the realisation of who the killer is, but rather by ""The Killer is... Who?"" Here, the movie tries to get out of jail by having the baddie ramble on in a classic pulp film-noir ""spill-the-beans in the end"" scene. No 'Sixth Sense' confluence of clues for the audience to enjoy here. More so, a resigned acceptance of ""Ooh so he has a grudge... ooh"" and then ""Git on with the gore"" by the viewer.The technical professionalism with which the movie is prepared is expected of any mainstream Hollywood production. So the ability of the script, direction and editing makes a really good movie stand out from any run-of-the-mill technically competent one. The Bone-Collector is firmly in the latter camp.I dare say that if you swap ANY of the actors with any equally competent one (and there are many in Hollywood), the script/plot and direction will render them in the same one-dimensional 'pulp fiction' characterisation as seen here. I can't see how such characters can provide a platform for any actor (the acting here doesn't require the likes of Denzel Washington to excel too much) to win an Oscar.The profusion of close-up scenes a-la 60 Minutes means Washington's character as a paraplegic is of little consequence. He might as well be fit and healthy, dressed in a feathered cape and sitting at Gotham City's hi-tech Police HQ, directing Jolie's model-cop star character and not need to put in any more acting effort.For me: 8/10 for looks, 5/10 as a movie.",The Bone Collector
286,Goddess-12,What Was Denzel Thinking?,3,8 November 1999,"This film is about an hour too long.  Unlike Silence of the Lambs, Seven, or even Copycat, this does not invite us into the mind of a killer.  There is no suspense, no tension, and the characters are less than unbelievable. A waste of good talent.",The Bone Collector
287,ambi,Great creepy film,10,9 November 1999,"This was a creepy, atmospheric and well-made thriller that showcases Denzel's acting abilities as well as show us that Jolie is an up-and-comer. Actually the acting is great all around especially from the supporting cast (Ed O'Neill, Queen Latifah, Luis Guzman). The murders were inventive and truly sick and the tension that led up to their discovery was fabulous. Jolie was totally believable as anyone would be when placed into situations like hers for the first time. Sure, it's not SEVEN or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, but I doubt we will ever see films in this genre that can match up to that calibre.",The Bone Collector
288,loosen,A good thriller thats only downfall is that it is too gruesome.,7,1 November 1999,"I went into this movie with no knowledge of what it was going to be, but relying on Denzel Washington's acting skill to at least keep the movie decent.All in all, the Bone Collector uses quite a lot of gore to convey it's point and because of that it will turn off most audiences.  Had it not been for the excessive amount of gore, it would have beaten the Blair Witch Project as most thrilling movie to appear this year for me.Washington does an excellent job playing his character, and the skill that every character is presented in caused this movie to be a well developed horror flick, if nothing else.If you are interested in a movie that will keep you on the edge of your chair until the very end and you aren't turned off by buckets of gore, then perhaps the Bone Collector is your movie, but if you are of the faint of heart -at all-, you will probably leave the theater during the most grotesque parts.",The Bone Collector
289,bowhunter,"Predictable, but a pretty good flick",6,18 November 1999,"I didn't want to write a review for this movie after my first viewing of it because I arrived late and ended up sitting on the first row.  So, after seeing it again tonight, I've decided that this is a pretty good movie.  The few flaws I did find were majorly overshadowed by Denzel Washington's performance as Lincoln Rhyme, a quadriplegic former forensic crime scene investigator.  Also, Angelina Jolie did surprisingly well with what little she was given to work with, as her character was uninteresting for the most part.  The scene with her boyfriend was completely unnecessary, but in her first meeting with Rhyme she revealed just a glimpse of what she is capable of.  Unfortunately, we only see that part of her in that one scene.Like I said, there were definitely some glaring flaws in this movie, and being a criminal justice student I usually pick these movies all apart.  But I really did enjoy Washington's performance quite a bit.  It reminded me of his work in ""Glory"", for which he won an Oscar, if I'm not mistaken.With just a little alteration to the script, slightly different direction and a bit more character development, this could have been a real block buster.  As it is, Washington, Jolie, and (to an extent) O'Neill carry the movie.  Am I sorry I saw it twice?  Not at all.  Would I see it again in the theater?  Probably not.  Will I rent it on video?  Most likely.  I give it 6/10.",The Bone Collector

The movie did its job of entertaining me for 2 hours, but not much more than that.  It followed a pretty stereotypical plot line of the serial thriller, and didn't surprise me one bit.  The movie wasn't even good for a scare, when it had plenty of opportunities to do so.  My advice??  Wait until you have a free rental, then rent this.

This movie is an insult to anyone's intelligence, and the coup d'etat was an ending that NO ONE could have solved.

Although I am biased, I have never seen Angelina Jolie in a movie that I didn't like. I think that her alone could carry the movie. But she didn't need too.I had read the book before seeing the movie and found it very well written. It's the type of book that I like. I found that whoever wrote the screenplay picked out the right things to write about. If you do want more into Angelina Jolie's character you have to read the book. With a story as good as it was, I don't see how you can explain every character's background in full detail as some wanted.I think that Angelina Jolie did the most amazing job portraying her part. She was absolutely amazing. I am not a huge Denzel Washington fan, but I found that I really enjoyed his acting as well.I don't see how this movie can be compared to Silence of the Lambs. Not only is Angelina Jolie 10 times the actress that Jodi Foster is, you also don't have to listen to Anthony Hopkins annoying voice and slirping sounds. Granted Silence of the Lambs was a movie that made you jump. But I felt the story line in The Bone Collector was so much more interesting. It was not made to be that kind of movie. It was a thriller/drama/action movie. And I believe it pulled off all three very well.So that is what my opinion is. I feel that if you enjoyed the movie, read the book also.

I thought this story was very well written and actually has a storyline that makes you think and is intellectually stimulating, which is hard to find in Hollywood these days.  As for Seven, while it was interesting, there wasn't much to solve, and in a choice between the two movies, I would much rather watch the Bone Collector.

(If you don't, as many posters here seem, then why are you watching this movie?) It's the journey (characters, atmosphere, dialogue, psychology), not the end (shocking surprise ending) to me. Thus, I don't care about total uniqueness of plot -- because it's all been written/filmed before.In that vein, and I mean this in a good way, I see some (enjoyable) similarities here with Rear Window. For example, does anyone think that Queen Latifah's character, named Thelma, was a reference to the wonderful Thelma Ritter, who played the nurse assisting Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window? Both of them were caring but sharp and full of zingers.Maybe I'm reading too much into it...but I really enjoyed this movie and especially the main characters and the performances of the actors.

It's terrible. The only thing that's the same as the book is Lincoln Rymes being paraysled every where but his neck up and one finger. And Amelia Donaghy is a police officer that helps him. 
The killer is a completely different person. The murder victims are all wrong. The aid is a woman and not a man. No where does it mention why Amelia was transferring or the fact the two leads start to develop feelings for each other. It's just awful.

Watching this movie was like hitting my head repeatedly against a brick wall.  The transitions kept trying to be cool but failed.  The plot twist at the end, where we find out who the bad guy is was unexpected, but doesn't make much sense until his monologue.  Even then... The amount of gore in this movie doesn't help either.  Are all of those images necessary? My last complaint is about the plausibility of chunks of the movie.  Would the PD really send a lone officer into an unlit warehouse, subway tunnel, or wherever to find a body, when the location of the perp is unknown?  And why does the romance at the end just kind of happen all of a sudden?  It's like the writer was trying to fit in every Hollywood cliche he could.

305,timpc2,Suspense ruined early,5,10 April 2000,"Spoilers follow.Caught this on video.  The comparisons I've read with Seven seem obvious, but there was one significant difference.  Why do most Hollywood scripts always require that in most serial killer flicks the main character has met the killer in the first 15 min. of the film?  Here astute movie watchers had the choices narrowed to two early in the film.I believe this is probably due to the meddling of studio management in making stories more ""commercial.""  What's wrong with serial killers we don't know as the villian?  Does this make them any less scary?

The question was easily answered, and I knew all along:  The premise, the formula, the chain of events--all pointed back to COPYCAT...literally.  From the way the house/bedridden characters [Denzel, Sigourney] react to the first sign of evidence to the use of only ONE vocalized song--both sung by the Police (Well isn't that interesting, you say!).  The bad guys had the same loser qualities; heck they looked the same, acted the same, even carried the same pouch of shiny tools and unfolded then gently as if they were some relic worth millions and should remain in the wall unit under a light for display rather than be used.  Both bad guys get killed the same way--after a similar fight with Denzel/Sigourney.  You have Denzel talking Jolie through the crime scenes at points--just as Weaver did to Hunter.  The bad guy gets inside the door--roughly the same way as well.  There are differences too, don't get me wrong, but the whole jist of the movie was way too similar to Copycat to be enjoyed.  The film had some moments of real rustic/dated set design, similar to what you'd find in Se7en.  The story line, however, was weak; the characters were way underdeveloped; and the plot was held together by the few homicides that were well studied from pictures in a really old book (just like Copycat). Well, it's just another number to the production companies and if you've seen Copycat and enjoyed it, like I did, do not waste your money on the Bone Collector--there's no need to pay for the same movie twice.",The Bone Collector
308,SofaMan,"Ooh, what a giveaway!",5,29 November 1999,"Probably would have been quite a good suspense thriller, if they hadn't given away whodunnit in the first 45 minutes of the film.Nothing happens in a suspense thriller of this kind without a good reason; everything and everyone is there to add to the plot or suspense in some way. When something occurs without a good reason, suspicions are immediately raised.Aside from this really tragically clumsy giveaway, the film had it's moments, but rested a bit too heavily on Washington's attractive charm and Jolie's good looks and ability to blubber.",The Bone Collector
309,evixir,make sure you read the book to get a better overall perspective,6,7 November 1999,"I've been looking forward to this movie ever since I heard they were doing an adaptation of Jeffery Deaver's novel _The Bone Collector_.  Sadly enough, they didn't quite adhere to some of the crucial characteristics of the novel.  They changed a lot of details and tried to gloss over too much in too short of a time.  It was a little too formulaic in terms of good cop/bad cop phenomena, but overall I felt it was a decent cop film that gave some good scares.  However, I do hope that those who saw the film will read the book as well.The addition of Queen Latifah as the nurse's aide to Rhyme was quite a good choice, and Jolie did well as the tough-on-the-surface Amelia.  I wasn't so sure about the casting of Washington as Rhyme, but he did an admirable job with a physically limited part.  I liked O'Neill and McGlone in their portrayals, but thought they were too predictably Bad Cop-esque with Rooker's portrayal of Captain Cheney.  I especially liked Ortiz as the forensic evidence expert.  All in all, enough bright spots in the cast to outweigh the dimmer ones.The #1 thing I wanted to do after leaving the theater was go buy the book and read it again... and make sure to take the bus home, instead of a cab. Just in case.",The Bone Collector
310,longleyandmaloney,Very impressed. As good as the book !!!,10,21 January 2000,I have been waiting for this film to come out ever since I read the book by Jeffery Deaver.  I must say I was most impressed when I finally got to see it yesterday.  The director has managed to capture all the important pieces of the books plot and keeps the moviegoers at the edge of their seats throughout the film.I thought that both Denzel Washington and Angeline Jolie played their parts very well and they made a good plot into a great film.Well worth seeing even if the critics don't rate it too high.,The Bone Collector
311,doris.backshell,Chilling tale of a nutter re-enacting gruesome murders.,7,27 January 2000,This film did not attract much attention when it first came out but has rapidly become a must-see.  Denzel washington plays a genius ex-cop who is now a paraplegic.  He is on the brink of suicide when a string of strange murders start.  His life suddenley takes some meaning and with the help of Amelia (Angelina Jolie) tries to catch the murderer.,The Bone Collector
312,mpbain,Very Disappointing,2,14 March 2000,Like a lot of people I was looking forward to seeing this movie and I was really let down. There must of been a different movie I saw from all the reviews I've read! Denzel Washington was OK BUT Jolie was terrible in this movie and the thriller this movie was supposed to be just about put me to sleep. This movie should not even be talked about in the same breath as Silence of the Lambs or Seven! I gave this movie a 2.,The Bone Collector
313,ffogies,"Bad,bad,bad!",1,25 October 2000,How did this show rate 2 1/2 stars?  It dragged from one shot to another. Totally predictable and boring. Also got tired of looking at Jolie's puffed up lips.If you read the book you would be disgusted with the ending......What a waste of Washington's talent.,The Bone Collector
314,Jay-z,Simply The Best,9,22 August 2000,Simply the best thriler movie i have ever seen in my life.The movie might sound like SEVEN in the book idea but it is way much better than SEVEN.or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS or any other thriller ever made in history.,The Bone Collector
315,murlock,cliched Hollywood schlock,4,26 October 2000,Cliched plot with ridiculous details and an incredibly lame ending. Just short of laughably bad. Watch good (Denzel Washington) to mediocre (Angelina Jolie) actors struggle with bad dialogue. Direction is typical Hollywood c**p.,The Bone Collector
316,mwade-32681,Synergy!!!,8,18 September 2019,"Great movie! Denzel Washington, Angelina Jolie and Queen Latifah achieved a strong synergy that made the movie exceptionally good.",The Bone Collector
317,renanereje,I've never seen a book story adaption so out of tune!,4,30 December 2019,"The Bone Collector is one of the best books written in this subject of serial killers and I was really hoping that this movie would at least keep its well built construction of chacarters and thrilling plot. But all we can see is a ragged script made by poor choices of adaptation of the original material. The only thing palatable in this movie is some ""just ok"" acting skills by Jolie.",The Bone Collector
318,dunc_x,Great performances and a ripping yarn,9,3 June 2001,"This movie is bound to be put up for comparison to Se7en and Silence of the Lambs, but only by idiots.Yes, it shares the common threads of grisly murder, psychoanalysis and a pair of detectives - but then they're the things that make this kind of movie so much fun.In the role of quadriplegic Lincoln Rhyme, Denzel Washington proves again that he is a very talented actor, making a fully rounded character out of ""one finger, a pair of shoulders and a mind"".  Humanly portraying the frustrations of a man unable to come to terms with his disability, Washington's intensity throughout the movie is spellbinding - the scene where he unravels the significance of the evidence from the first crime scene is unmissable.His opposite number in the piece, Angelina Jolie playing Amelia Donaghy, is both determined and stubborn while at the same time vulnerable and uncomfortable with her new role as lead crime scene officer.  I'd love some reasoning about why and how the reviewer who called Mrs Thornton ""miscast"" came to that conclusion.Add to this a couple of cracking underplayed performances from  Ed O'Neill Queen Latifah and and some terrific visuals - and I'm not talking grisly murder scenes - I'm talking the cinematic vision and style of director, Phillip Noyce - and what you have is a very entertaining, very intelligent movie.You may be let down by the finale, but then the finales of Se7en and Silence of the Lambs were let downs as well - maybe we just like to see if we can unravel the clues, too and when the killer's caught there's nothing else to work on.And a final admission that this may be your kind of movie if you're interested in the treatment of physical evidence and psychological reasoning behind staged crime scenes - so if you've read Paul Britten then you should see this.If you like this movie you may also like:Fallen; Manhunter; Cruising; They all have distinctive styles and excellent lead performances - go rent 'em.",The Bone Collector
319,bryanportsmouth,Barely believable!,5,11 March 2021,Acting good but the plot and detail are just too far from reality to make it enjoyable. There are far better movies with worse ratings. It's overrated IMO. Barely a 5.,The Bone Collector
320,giulioxyz,"Good, but not enough",7,5 October 2020,"Good film, but the finale is quite flat and expected as the outcome.",The Bone Collector
321,seanjohnson_5,Great,10,21 November 2006,I think the film was great the way Rhyme went through the case step by step and the way he calculated were the person would be and how he walked Amelia through the crime seen. I love the way that the killer gave clues to were the next victim was going to be and who he was. I though the idea of the book being found amongst the mass of crime books is a bad far-fetched you put anyone else in that library and tell them to get that book it would take them at least an 1 hour and it takes Amelia about 1 minute. I didn't find the film overly scaring or it didn't give me nightmares i was scared to go in yellow taxis for a bit but then i got over that laugh out loud. I think Denzel Washingtno was great for the character Rhyme as you could really see him working the role and enjoying it i also think that Angelina Jolie was great as she grew with the character and went from a unexperienced amateur cop to a great detective all under the influence of Rhyme.,The Bone Collector
322,marc-19413,Nothing to see here...,2,22 September 2021,...except 1000 views of Jolie's pretty face and lips.There is nothing (no thing) credible in this would be crime story. Bombarding a street police officer to a specialist searcher for forensic evidence after one lucky find is so far fetched that the whole credibility of the story falls to pieces. And that is just one of the continuous ludicrous parts on which the whole film is built. What a waste of time.,The Bone Collector
323,DeereGirl,"Great movie - not as good as the book, though",8,25 February 2007,"I enjoyed this movie very much. Although the end is a bit bumpy (I agree with some other writers that you can really tell what's going to happen), the rest of the story is just brilliant and pure suspense. You always wonder what's going to be next and you're stuck to your seat until the end. Anyone who read the book might want to stay away from the movie, though. The book is much better. They should have stuck to the original more which would have left the possibility to make movies of the other Lincoln Rhyme stories by Deaver as well. Denzel Washington was brilliant in THE BONE COLLECTOR. Being tied to the bed does not leave much room for acting, but he can pull it off! Great job I have to say. I also like Angelina Jolie as Amelia, although both of them, Linc and Amelia, are described quite differently in the book. As a stand-alone movie I still think this is one of the best thrillers ever.",The Bone Collector
324,Graham Straughair,Why bother trashing a great story?,3,3 June 2007,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie, and it had nothing to do with the strong ensemble of a cast. I'd previously read Jeffrey Deavers novel, on which the movie is based, and had found it an interesting, tense and page turning book. I was optimistic, it's my own fault, I set myself up for the fall.The story has been tweaked and altered to suit Hollywood as you expect with all novel to big screen adapt ions, but along with the very heavy editing and poor re-writing of sections of the story, they took out the most vital part...the tension and mood. What we are left with is a 'crime by numbers' flick that provokes little emotion or interest. You just know what's going to happen to all of the characters and plot lines throughout the film, a true shame, and you end up not really caring whatever the outcome.Denzels character should have stayed true to the original. He should have been moody, annoying, sarcastic and angry. Giving only glimpses of compassion and humour. He's meant to want out of this world (they do mention this in the film) but he seems as happy as a tellitubby for the most part. His 'brilliant mind' is only used to do a paper jigsaw puzzle of clues, leaving him miles away from the character of the book. The use of camera angles and excessive head shots make you forget that the character is a quadriplegic, so you never get to see if Denzel is playing the part convincingly.Angelina Jolies performance seems to have been sourced directly from an angry spoiled teenager. Snappy and then meek, loud and then quiet, unsure and then confident. It just leaves you quite bored and then frustrated. A crucial character, second only to washingtons portrayal of Rhyme, done with little enthusiasm or apparent commitment to the performance.Queen Latifah. Utterly pointless casting and part as it turns out, What was an almost an essential cameo in the novel, is used for nothing more than more excessive still frames and head shots, as her limited ability shows us her looking on in horror. Oh, and she is an essential cog in unlocking the massive paper jigsaw clues.I wanted to enjoy this movie I really did. But the actors were not on top form for, what is in the most part, their massive ability.The use of 'forensic science' throughout the movie is limp. They pick up a clue, have a bit of scratch and sniff and instantly know where and when it's from. 'On to the next clue crime fighters!'. It's just not believable.The film looks shoddy in so many shots and points of editing. It looks as though it has been made as an afternoon TV movie. Unfortunately, thats all that we've been left with.",The Bone Collector
325,PoopSnoot-682-678630,Good Score,7,10 March 2010,"Since it's release, I'd watched this film once before tonight. This evening there was 'something' that just kept popping up in my thoughts, and I Could Not, for the life of me, bring it to my forebrain... Finally it came to me... The background music (Score) was Almost Exactly the same as in The Silence of the Lambs. Next time you watch this film, pay attention to the background music and you'll hear what I mean. (That's really all I wanted to mention since I'm not a big blogger or 'Poster') As far as reviewing the TV Version of the film for it's entertainment value; it does deserve at least a 7. It has good interpersonal communications between the characters, a few anxious moments, and a well thought of plot. It may be a bit too disturbing for children under 8 or 9 though.",The Bone Collector
326,snaka99,Worst interpretation of a book ever!,2,30 September 2010,"""The Bone Collector"" movie is the worst interpretation of a book that I have ever seen! I read the book before watching the movie, and the book was amazing. Jeffery Deaver's superb ticking bomb suspense writing style was not given justice from this movie claiming that it is based on his book. The director, Phillip Noyce, couldn't direct his way out of an Adam Sandler movie! We all know how Adam Sandler movies are... He's the nice guy/idiot that does something wrong, then does something right, and gets the pretty girl at the end. Phillip Noyce is to a Director as the square block is to the triangle hole... it just doesn't fit! He not only left out huge character developments, but he entirely changed the characters backgrounds. No offense to Denzel Washington, Queen Latifah, or Angelina Jolie, but they just did not fit the roles that they played. I feel a little bit like Phillip Noyce opened the book, breezed through it, then took a crap in the middle of it, closed it, and said you know what... I'm going to do whatever the hell I want! I don't normally get this upset over movies, but I can't believe how bad this was... I almost wanted to turn it off in the first 15 minutes. If you read this far then you must be really bored. lol",The Bone Collector
327,health92g4,"This is a great movie, great acting by Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie. Denzel lights the spark in every movie he acts, I like his charisma and intelligence.",9,9 June 2003,"This film  is underrated, but it is really a great movie to watch. It is 2 hours of suspence and intelligence. The killer is the most intruiging character because he plays mind games with Denzel and Jolie straight through out the movie. Denzel brings a certain charisma, wit and intelligence to every movie he acts. He proves that he is a professional actor by using his facial expressions throughout the movie. I give this movie a thumbs up!!",The Bone Collector
328,joomington,A rookie cop teams up with a crippled detective to catch a serial killer.,7,5 January 2015,"A minor classic with solid performances from both charismatic leads. Washington plays a crippled, embittered detective who recruits a young, troubled Jolie to help him hunt for a murderer who leaves cryptic clues at his crime scenes. Noyce's direction is capable and restrained and the script is fairly taut. Exceptions include the fairly weak ending and a highly questionable CGI squirrel. The real stand outs are the brilliantly conceived, suitably gruesome murder-scene set pieces through, and the accompanying vicarious horror we experience through Jolie's reactions. This is more thriller than horror but has offers of both while tastefully leaving most of the gore to the imagination. Nothing revelatory but well worth the price of admission.",The Bone Collector
329,superflyrononeal,A worthless waste of time and money,3,14 November 2006,"i don't understand why films like this one are produced in the first place. okay, regarding only the handcraft it is a decent, let's say 'building'. but if you're looking for intelligent art, and even entertainment, this is definitely the wrong way. first of all the film tells the same story that has been told a hundred million times, and also it tells it in exactly the same way. an ill-minded serial killer is on the run and a couple of cops have to overcome various obstacles in order to do their work properly and keep up the fight against the evil and the ignorance in mankind. SPOILER: in the end, of course, there will be a showdown after which all questions are answered and the good ones celebrate their victory. the differences are minimal (here, washington plays a handicapped ex-cop and the killer is a cab driver). who needs plots like this? furthermore, what's actually even more annoying, and gives me the feeling of being heavily insulted, is the workout of the characters. they are so flat, one-dimensional, black and white. especially the egocentric, sabotaging police captain (rooker) gained my attention, and actually made me write this comment. that role is so unbelievable, so annoying and so cheap that it makes me wonder what grade of elementary school the scriptwriter might be in. i haven't read the novel, but i'm afraid it wouldn't be much better, since i've read similar books in the past (like 'the relic', for example). finally, what amazes me even more than the people behind the cameras of such sorry films, are the actors. what makes denzel washington as a really good actor do that crap? also queen latifah has made so much better films (set it off, for example). is it really all about money?",The Bone Collector
330,denise_kate,Well worth a look! Both Jolie and Washington are on form,8,9 March 2005,"I've read quite a few comments on this movie and some of them I disagree with and others I don't. Sure, it may be a little predictable and a bit 'all been done before' but there is a certain level of originality and uniqueness to it also.For starters it has a fantastic cast and both lead actors (Jolie and Washington)have won Oscars and thats says something. It can't be easy playing a paralysed man and remaining so still and wooden and he plays the frustrations and emotions so realistically that I would imagine a person actually would be like in real life. Jolie is charming, composed and works well with the camera. Her character is convincing enough and this goes for her performance.The support cast is fantastic too, especially Queen Latifa.The film may have the usual iconographic elements found in the psychological thriller genre but they are necessary for it to firstly conform and also progress. 'The Bone Collector' introduces new techniques and a slightly different angle for the viewer. there has to be a certain amount of repetition with this genre for it to work and this is the case for many others, such as romantic comedies and a couple falling in love or teen flicks with a football jock character.I am currently writing my degree dissertation on sexual subjectivity in psychological thrillers and this film is perfect for that. The changing levels of gendered representations is very interesting and both supports and detracts away from the current representations in society.I say, give it a go! Don't listen to people who have already seen it and didn't like it. If I'd have done that then I wouldn't have given it a go and my dissertation would have been short of argument!",The Bone Collector
331,cravis,I quite liked this...,8,16 March 2005,"Well folks, who's read the book that the film was based on? Anyone? OK, its called ""The Coffin Dancer"" and it's by Geoffrey Deaver. I believe that the film is a well thought out adaptation of this book. It's always hard for producers and directors to screen books, but i am of the opinion that they have done a good job! The stars in this movie represent the characters from the book impressively, and in particular, Denzel stood out. It must be hard for someone to play a quadriplegic detective, simply by studying material from a book never intended for the big screen! To summarise, make sure you read the book, then watch the film. I hope you'll be of the same opinion as myself.",The Bone Collector
332,abstractskulls,I like it,8,13 August 2018,I've always enjoyed this film. First saw it when it came out in 99. Bought it due to my interest in thrillers and crime flicks. I recommend it if that is your thing.,The Bone Collector
333,purplecraze_88,"Good Story, Good Build Up, Poor Casting",5,23 June 2008,"Though I enjoyed the movie because of the intensity it would have been more enjoyable with a better cast. Then entire police force was annoying and came off as corny. Though I enjoyed her presence Queen Latifah would not have been my first choice for the nurse. I was really hoping for an intimidating ""bad guy"" however I was very disappointed with the actor that emerged. An actor who always plays meaningless and pointless characters not to mention nerdy ones. Last but not least Angelina Jolie. Why in the world they picked her to play this role I have know idea. But she did not pull it off, she was annoying, her accent was cheesy and half the time she looked like she didn't know what was going on around her. Denzel Washington as always did a fabulous job, but I just couldn't figure out how he got stuck with the rest of the cast. I'd pin it as a good ""Saturday night popcorn rental"" for Denzel Washington fans.",The Bone Collector
