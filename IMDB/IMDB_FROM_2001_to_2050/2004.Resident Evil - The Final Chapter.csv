0,Leofwine_draca,The franchise comes to a shuddering halt,2,30 December 2018,"Thankfully the last of this interminable series, THE FINAL CHAPTER sees the RESIDENT EVIL franchise coming to a shuddering halt. It's another unwatchable mess of a movie, just the same as the previous two instalments, and even the return of Iain Glen to the film can't save it. A visibly aged Milla Jovovich once again goes around fighting zombies, evil corporation members and anything else that comes close; the confused plot is lost amid an endless parade of stupid action sequences that favour explosive, high-octane stunts and CGI work over anything approaching realism or coherence. The real dud here is Paul W.S. Anderson, who can no longer direct his way out of a paper bag; a shame, as I once enjoyed his films, including EVENT HORIZON and DEATH RACE.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
1,SnoopyStyle,logic and reason,4,23 September 2017,"This starts by recounting the origins of the T-virus. Dr. James Marcus invented it to save his daughter Alicia. Co-owner Dr. Alexander Isaacs (Iain Glen) killed him to take over the Umbrella Corporation. Alice (Milla Jovovich) arrives in Washington, D.C. to find the Red Queen. She is surprised when the evil computer program offers her a way to destroy the T-virus. It tells her that the last 4472 humans on earth are set to be wiped out in 48 hours. It's been 10 years since Isaacs deliberately released the virus setting off the original apocalypse in the first movie. Alice returns to Raccoon City where she's confronted by Isaacs. She finds other survivors Doc (Eoin Macken), Abigail (Ruby Rose), Christian, Cobalt, Razor, and Claire Redfield (Ali Larter).This franchise is marked by its embrace of high grade B-movie tropes, slow motion monster action, and an effective Jovovich heroine. It's not always the best but there are often fun elements. The recounting of the origins is helpful with movie logic although it doesn't strike me as reasonable. I remember the original T-virus release in the first movie was an accident. Essentially, everything is refocused in a different direction. It also puts into question the purpose of Alice in the first place. It all makes movie logic but I can't accept its reasonableness.I also can't totally buy these characters reuniting for a final battle. It may work for a video game but when presented in the real world, it fails the smell test. This pull between movie logic and real world reasoning causes friction in the story telling. There are the big overblown action scenes. It still has its fun but some of it is too reminiscent of the previous movies. I would rather have something unabashed new. At least, it finally wraps up the original story and the franchise can have an ending if it wants it.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
2,Prismark10,Hopefully the final,3,25 October 2017,"The zombie outbreak that was created by the T-virus has a cure which exists in the Hive in the ruins of Raccoon City. Alice (Milla Jovovich) must find and release the cure in order to save what is left of humanity.Standing in her way is the evil Dr Isaacs (Iain Glen) and a hordes of zombies.The film is humourless, incomprehensible, dull but it does have some nice special effects and sometime the action scenes rise above the mediocrity.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
3,claudio_carvalho,Full of Action Sequel,7,16 March 2017,"After fighting to survive in Washington, Alice (Milla Jovovich) is contacted by the Red Queen (Ever Anderson) that warns that The Umbrella Corporation has developed an airborne antivirus to destroy the T-Virus. Alice needs to return to the The Hive in Raccoon City within forty- eight hours to release the antivirus. The Red Queen explains that she cannot violate his program and has to protect The Umbrella and the employees. Alice heads to Raccoon City and fights Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen) and his men in armored vehicles and a horde of zombies. On the arrival she stumbles upon a group of survivors including Claire (Ali Larter), Doc (Eoin Macken), Razor (Fraser James), Abigail (Ruby Rose), Christian (William Levy) and Cobalt (Rola). Alice helps the group to defeat Dr. Isaacs and they go together to The Hive. However Wesker (Shawn Roberts) increases the level of security and the group faces many dangers. Soon Alice learns secrets about her origins and the evil plan plotted by Dr. Isaacs and the executives of the Umbrella Corporation.""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"" is a full of action sequel of the franchise ""Resident Evil"". The film has problems with the editing of the action scenes, especially the fights. There are plot holes and also a huge inconsistency in the story, since Alice has 48 h to release the antivirus to save the four thousand and something survivors that still exists; however in the end it is told that the antivirus would take years to reach the four corners of the world. Anyway the film is highly entertaining despite the use of clones to make the villains reappear. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Resident Evil 6: O Capítulo Final"" (""Resident Evil 6: The Final Chapter"")",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
4,nogodnomasters,Is that all you got?,7,5 August 2017,"Some Plot Points. Not specific Ending.The film opens with a quick recap: Umbrella Company, sick little girl, cure, T-virus, zombie Apocalypse. Nothing about Alice or the gazillion films we have seen her in other than ""they all died."" Within minutes we find out ""It's a trap."" There is an airborne anti-virus"" i.e. a cure. And we quickly enter an action scene of Fast and Furious vs a pterodactyl. When F&F becomes boring we go into Mad Max mode with hordes of zombies with super explosions and plenty of night time fighting. There is a lot of action with the end with film tidying up loose ends with plot points we all suspected from mediocre fan fiction. And of course the final chapter leads the door open should Milla get hungry or some fan comes up with a redundant plot and a second Death Star and Superman dies.The problem I had with this film was the same as all the sequels, is that there appears to be a lack of continuity between the films. A film does not start where the last one leaves off, perhaps my bad being brought up on 5 Ape films.. Seems to be a better game than film.Guide: Violence, no sex or nudity. No swearing.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
5,kosmasp,The end is nigh ...,5,24 June 2017,"When they called one of the Jason Vorhees movies (Friday 13th) the Final Chapter - they didn't keep their word and many more came and a lot more are sure to come in the future. Now this may actually be a Final Chapter related to Milla Jovovich and her involvement. I guess that story is through. But that doesn't mean that sometime in the future we'll see a reboot or whatever they'll call it.This does what the other Resident Evil movies did too. It's here to entertain not to make sense. It's here to give us some characters we've learned over the course of this franchise. The first Resident Evil could've been different of course (George Romero was attached at some point) and some may argue that this removed itself from the games quite a bit (for better or worse). We're here, so let's try to enjoy the one last ride (effects are neat, though for a Final Chapter there wasn't enough closure for my liking)",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
6,jboothmillard,Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,5,1 November 2021,"The first film in the video game-based franchise will always be the best one, the second film Apocalypse is easily the worst, and follow-ups Extinction, Afterlife, and Retribution have all been the same, mixed to below-average standard. This was the sixth and final instalment, and to be honest, I was relieved it would be the last, I wondered if it was possible for it to go out on a high, written and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon, Pompeii). Basically, a flashback reveals that Dr. James Marcus (Mark Simpson), the founder of the Umbrella Corporation, had a daughter, Alicia (Ever Gabo Anderson, daughter of Paul and Jovovich), who was dying of progeria (aka Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome, which cause victims to age faster than usual). Desperate to save her, Marcus used the T-virus on her and others with the disease. Another child treated with the virus died and then reanimated as a rabid zombie, and Marcus tried to shut down the program. His partner, Dr. Alexander Isaacs (Iain Glen), had Marcus killed by Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), then adopted Alicia and took over the Corporation. The opening also shows clips of many events that have happened since the T-virus outbreak and devastation across the world. In the present, after the events in Washington D. C., Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up after being betrayed by Wesker. The Red Queen (Ever Anderson) appears and tells Alice she has 48 hours to infiltrate the Hive, over 400 miles back in Raccoon City. The Umbrella Corporation has developed an airborne anti-virus, which can kill every organism infected by the T-virus, but they are waiting for the last few remaining humans to be wiped out. En route to Raccoon City, Alice is captured by Isaacs, learning the ""Isaacs"" she previously killed was a clone. She escapes his convoy and reaches Raccoon City. There is ambushed by a group of survivors: Doc (Eoin Macken), Abigail (Ruby Rose), Christian (William Levy), Cobalt (model Rola), Razor (Fraser James), and Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), who survived the attack on Arcadia. Isaacs' convoy approaches, followed by a horde of the infected. Alice and the group defeat the convoy, retrieve Isaacs' few human captives, and burn the horde, though Cobalt is killed. Alice and crew find the Hive entrance, at the bottom of the crater from the nuclear bomb previously dropped on the city. Wesker, in control of the Hive, releases mutated guard dogs, killing Christian and a freed captive. The Red Queen appears to Alice and explains that her program is conflicted; she can never hurt an Umbrella employee but also values human life. She plays a video of Isaacs before Umbrella's executives explaining his plan to release the T-virus, cleansing the world of humanity, with rich and powerful people, including the company executives, to be stored in cryogenic capsules in the Hive, with the intention of rebuilding the world following the resulting apocalypse. Alice realises that the initial outbreak of the virus was not an accident, it was deliberate, and The Red Queen warns Alice that someone in her group is helping Umbrella. The group encounters several traps, killing Abigail and Razor. Alice and Doc plant bombs throughout the Hive, using equipment left behind by the original team who investigated the Hive. Alice confronts the real, tech-upgraded, Isaacs. Doc is revealed to be Umbrella's spy, and Claire is captured by Wesker. A cryogenic capsule opens, releasing Alicia Marcus, Umbrella's co-owner, and Marcus' daughter. Isaacs reveals to Alice that she is in fact a clone of Alicia, which explains her memory loss, before going on to explain his plan to eliminate them both and gain control of Umbrella. Alicia fires Wesker, allowing the Red Queen to crush his legs with a security door. Doc tries to shoot Alice, but Alice previously emptied his gun, deducing his treachery, and Claire executes him. After giving Wesker a device which when dropped will explode the primed bombs, Alice and Claire pursue Isaacs while Alicia uploads a copy of her childhood memories. Isaacs, Alice, and Claire fight; Isaacs overpowers Claire and attacks Alice in the Laser Corridor, eventually defeating her, but she is able to activate a grenade in his pocket. She escapes to the surface with the anti-virus, but Isaacs reboots and catches her before she can release it. Before he can kill her, the Isaacs clone (from the convoy) arrives and kills him, believing itself to be the original Isaacs, but the clone is then devoured by the undead. Alice releases the anti-virus, killing all the zombies around her before she passes out. Wesker simultaneously drops the switch, destroying himself, Alicia, the Hive, and the hibernating Umbrella elite. Claire wakes Alice, who survived because the anti-virus killed only the T-virus within her body, not the healthy cells. The Red Queen uploads Alicia's childhood memories into Alice, giving her back her childhood. Alice travels into Manhattan, the anti-virus will be carried by the winds, but will take years to reach all corners of the globe, and until it does, her mission is not finished. Also starring Lee Joon-Gi as Commander Chu. Jovovich as in all previous entries is ready to kick ass, Glen is a bit of a pantomime villain, and it was good to Larter back. The opening recap was helpful, it attempts to add in some twists along the way to make the conclusion all come together, some work but most are predictable, but it doesn't matter. For the fast-speed chases and fights with frantic editing, the tense moments with zombies and mutated dogs, and gory moments, it is certainly more engaging than previous sequels, it feels like the last entry, only until the reboot Welcome to Raccoon City is released, a reasonable concluding science-fiction action horror. Worth watching!",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

8,BA_Harrison,"You shoulda stuck to slo-mo, Paul.",3,2 March 2017,"Alice (Milla Jovovich) emerges from the ruins of Washington DC and is contacted by the Red Queen (Ever Anderson), who tells her of an antidote to the T-Virus that is located under Raccoon City. Alice has only 48 hours to find and release the antidote before the rest of humanity is wiped out by the Umbrella Corporation, whose plan is to repopulate the earth with the rich and the powerful, who are stored in cryogenic suspension in The Hive.I've always been a staunch supporter of the Resident Evil films, finding them to be fun slices of slick action-packed horror, but that support ends with The Final Chapter. Once again directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, this supposed last instalment is an absolute mess, any potential for enjoyment hindered by an extremely slight plot, even by RE standards, and some of the worst direction and editing I have ever experienced.As far as content goes, the film is business as usual, with big monsters, hordes of zombies, evil corporate types running the show, and Milla being bad-ass, but with the camera shaking all over the place and the majority of shots lasting for a fraction of a second, the action is virtually impossible to follow, making the film more likely to result in a headache than a thrill rush. And as if the wobbly cam/ADHD approach wasn't bad enough, much of film takes place in poorly lit locations, making it even harder to keep track of what is happening.Despite being called The Final Chapter, the end of the film inevitably leaves things open for further adventures for Alice. If Anderson does intend to make more Resident Evil films, let us hope that he doesn't continue in the same style.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
9,paul_haakonsen,But this is set in a world overrun with zombies. So where are the zombies?...,5,25 April 2017,"Oh please let this be the end of the movie franchise. Is Paul W.S. Anderson impervious to the death throes and convulsions that the series is in right now?I have stuck with the movies since the first one, and I enjoyed the first one and part two was adequate enough, then it just started to go fast downhill. It became more and more of a parody on the established game franchise with each movie, and yet Paul W.S. Anderson kept on going.And of course I wanted to watch this, hopefully last movie, as well to see just how the saga would be ended. One word, a single word, comes to mind for describing ""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"", and that word is: laughable.Wow! First of all, where did all the zombies go? It used to be about zombies. And for the entire world having succumbed to the T-virus and left in ruin, the world was surprisingly devoid of reanimated corpses. Instead, it had turned into a show about super freaks and mutated corpses and mutated creatures. It was just ridiculous.As for the progression of Alice and how she started out. Well, let's just say that it has been equally laughable with each laughable movie. She started out as a fairly tough woman who could dish out a beating, but not knowing what was going on, but ended up with her having more super powers than all of the X-Men combined. It was just stupid to the point of being idiotic.Was this a fulfilling installment to end up the movie franchise? Well, personally I would say no. Especially since it has just been getting worse and worse as Paul W. S. Anderson kept spewing one movie more ludicrous than the previous after another. But taking a step back and seeing how the movie franchise has progressed, even though I find it laughable and ridiculous, then I think it was a natural way to top it off and end it. I didn't find it fulfilling or satisfying, definitely not.The ending of the movie was just an abrupt slap in the face. It was just such a cheesy way of ending it all. And it was just so predictable.Well, this movie is not all just bad things. There are good things here as well. First of all, the effects and the visuals are quite impressive, as they have been ever since the first movie. And they have evolved alongside with each movie, and the effects have gotten better and better, which is definitely a good thing.And there is also some fair enough acting in the movie, although it does seem that the franchise has been dragged on for a bit too long, and some fatigue is starting to show here and there.All in all, ""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"" turned out to be a very bland and mediocre foray in the ""Resident Evil"" universe, and a very unfulfilled way of ending it all. But hey, it is still a zombie movie, despite having very few zombies actually being any part of the actual story. Yes, there was an army of zombies, but they were just a backdrop to the story, and you didn't really feel that they were any threat to anyone in the movie.I have seen it now, but I doubt that I will ever return to the franchise beyond the first and second movie. Now, the animated movies, now that is a whole different story, one we will venture into at another time...",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

Japan's Red Queen Alicia threatens America AFTER the end credits have finished on the final two seconds of the soundtrack for RESIDENT EVIL: THE FINAL CHAPTER, the latest Revenge Porn Release from Sony, the Propaganda Arm of the Japanese Government. Still sore losers over the World War Two that THEY started by first Raping Nanking, China, and then Sneak-Attacking us at Pearl Harbor, almost EVERY Sony flick permitted into the U.S. this century has been a vicious attack on American Values, Religion, and Culture.

Not content to feed their gluttony by killing all of Planet Earth's whales and dolphins (see THE COVE; scientists have documented that these sea mammals have I.Q.'s 27 points higher that the average Nippon resident, prompting the latter to murder them out of a sense of intellectual jealousy!), they just love it when Sony depicts all of America's Sacred Landmarks (such as the Washington Monument and our Capitol Dome) shattered into ruins, as they do yet again in EVIL. Sony renames Leader Trump as ""Alexander Roland Isaacs"" for EVIL, and perverts his lines of dialogue such as ""God be with you"" and his office props such an ACTUAL Christian Holy Bible to suggest to impressionable American Youth that U.S. Corporations are corrupt and controlling, out to eradicate We 99 Per Centers (presumably by eliminating ObamaCare, Medicare, Planned Parenthood, and Medicaid and THEN releasing the incurably fatal ""T-Virus"" so that only the Frozen One Per Cent Billionaires survive this Apocalypse). Leader Trump MUST meet Sony's perfidious Blasphemy head-on, and get rid of ALL our expiring obsolete H-Bomb stockpile by dropping each warhead on Japan as it's replaced with a newer, better model.

11,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Best or worst: Yes,6,15 July 2017,"The ludicrously over-complicated and self-contradicting plot... is hereby retconned past the point of recognition. These have felt like a new person took over in each installment. This is a new level. We have obvious twists, and ones that are harder to guess, some of the time because they're preposterous. There's a convenient 48 hour countdown, which is vague, yet propels the ""plot"". Major characters are literally the exact opposite of what they were clearly established as. At the end of the previous... ugh, chapter.If you turn off your brain, this is genuinely fun, in a lot of ways, more than the ones leading up to it. Not saying you should, merely putting out there what happens if you go with that option. There are people who will leave this with a headache. Not because of what I've gone into already: no, because it's filmed with hand-held, zoomed in, in the dark, using cuts of 1-2 seconds. To be fair, this is only true of action scenes. And there is a little bit of this that isn't that. The one-liners are pitiful. Ending? Nope, there's still sequel-baiting. If it's followed up on, the next will lack the core identity, which is about the sole thing consistent in these. Outside of Milla Jovovich, who is game as ever. This is a mercifully speedy 102 minutes, or, without credits: 98.I recommend this to those who, as myself, can't resist their curiosity whenever Paul W.S.

13,neil-476,Thank heavens it's over,5,15 May 2018,"Alice has been led a merry dance by the Umbrella Corporation ever since their zombie virus got loose, a dance which finally leads her back to Raccoon City and a chance to bring this whole sorry mess to a halt.This is the 6th - and, it would appear from the title, final - movie in the Resident Evil franchise. This started life as a decent enough movie adaptation of a zombie shoot-'em-up videogame. Films 2 to 5 featured, guess what, running around shooting zombies while assorted cast members survived (or didn't) in locations which gradually strayed further and further from Raccoon City while more details of the Umbrella Corporation's nefarious plans were revealed in dribs and drabs.Film 6 contains further revelations, none of which come as vast surprises. It also contains much running around, being pursued by zombies (and also a zombie/vampire/dragon/pterodactyl thingie, I'm not sure how that fits with zombified humans), shooting, cutting, slicing, squashing, and Blowing Sh!t Up.
There is a ticking clock in the script which seems to have no purpose other than to build up suspense in a completely half-*ssed way: its rationale makes no sense at all.What the film doesn't have is any plot worthy of the name. And what little it does have is incoherent nonsense - I am unsure what the Umbrella Corporation expects to gain from destroying the entire population of the world and replacing it with hordes of mindless ravening cannibals, for instance. These films were never about the story. They were about replicating on screen the adrenaline-laced videogame experience of being pursued by zombies, and blowing them away before they were able to snack on you. And, to that extent, I guess this film is successful even though it is incredibly dark - the underground base at Raccoon City forgot to pay its electricity bill - and most of the action camerawork is so jittery that it is often difficult to follow the geography of what is happening.If you liked the others, then see this one so that you'll know how the saga ends - oh, please let it end! Milla Jovovich deserves to have a lie down. But I can't think of another reason to see it.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

Now, she must return to the Hive in Raccoon City, where the Umbrella Corporation is gathering its forces for a final strike against the only remaining survivors of the T-Virus outbreak......If you haven't seen any of the previous films, watch the first one, forget the other four as they are not intricate the narrative as a whole, and then watch this on the biggest and loudest auditorium, because you get a handy 'previously on' at the beginning of the film.Anderson hasn't really been the greatest director the world has seen, but he has had some flashes of Genius. Shopping was a surprisingly watchable nineties movie, and Event Horizon has dated badly, but it's still quite the chilling space horror.So after fifteen years, The Resident Evil franchise supposedly comes to an end, and to be honest, it's nothing more than a leave your brain at the door because for the next couple of hours, you will see nothing but Jovovich doing some wonderful wire work and destroy every single mode of transport she boards.The film as a whole is a mix of Mad Max: Fury Road, and Land Of The Dead, because Glenn's Dr Issac (the best thing in the film) has his armoured truck, followed by a horde of undead.Then it's the last stand, as you'd expect from a film like this. Alice meets up with characters from older films, and new ones, which you just know will meet some grisly demise.After the fifteen years, the franchise doesn't pretend to give any twists on the story, or offer any surprises come the end, it's more of the greatest hits of the previous films.So all in all, it's a pretty solid closure to an ever decreasing in quality franchise, but take the final chapter subtitle with a pinch of salt.Remember Friday the 13th?

But hey, you want to see how it all ends. And yes, it's an extreme good flick.From the first moment until the last second it's all action. And the way it was shot may remind you of The Matrix (1999) but the editing is really a must see and it's the editing that gives this flick a fast pace.But not only that, the effects, the apocalyptic atmosphere, the color grading and the oustanding performance from Iain Glen (Dr Isaac) makes it worth seeing.If you haven't seen earlier entries, don't worry, Alice (Milla Jovovich) will have a flash back in the beginning so you can pick it up easily. And of course Milla is great too and in fight scene's also gives an above mediocre performance.Simple, but good story makes this the best one for me from the first second until the last.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

Is it zombies? Because Warcraft had some, I think.Anyway, the seven films are all a blur for me. Probably the first was reasonably fun, but the rest have become a mush of confusion in my head. Who are all those characters? Why should I care about any of them? Why are they doing any of the things they are doing? They make no sense!So, in a sense, this film is the best of the series, because it has made no attempt at a story or character development. They introduced a twist and circular story arc that one can see through from the very first minutes. And it has no logic. The rest is just non stop action, evil arrogant psychos and heroic heroes. It is fascistly pure.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
17,Hellmant,Almost nonstop action!,7,3 February 2017,"'RESIDENT EVIL: THE FINAL CHAPTER': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The sixth film in the zombie flick franchise (which began in 2002), based on the popular Capcom horror video game series. Paul W.S. Anderson wrote and directed the movie; as he did the first, fourth and fifth installments. It once again stars Milla Jovovich as Alice (reprising the role for the sixth time); the badass heroine survivor, that's constantly trying to save the remaining world from a zombie apocalypse. In this installment she must make a final stand, with the other remaining human survivors, against the evil Umbrella Corporation; and the zombie outbreak that it created. The movie also costars Ali Larter, Iain Glen and Shawn Roberts (all reprising their roles from the other films). It's gotten mediocre reviews from critics, and it's also performed as it was expected to at the Box Office (so far). I enjoyed it about as much as the other films in the series. The film begins three weeks after the end of the last chapter; when Alice (Jovovich), and other survivors, were betrayed by Albert Wesker (Roberts). Alice is forced to return to Racoon City (where the series began) and join with the other survivors, once more, in a final fight against the Umbrella Corporation. We also learn that the evil company released the T-virus on purpose, in order to 'cleanse the world of the mediocre and poor' (much like Trump, and other Republicans, would like to do now). The survivors must also (of course) once again battle a vicious army of zombies.The movie is almost nonstop action; which is entertaining for a while, but for me it can get a little boring. There's very little actual story in it, and absolutely no character development, but Jovovich does give an awesome action heroin performance once again. In my opinion this film is no better, and no worse, than the others; but it definitely has been done many times before (within this same franchise). The first film was at least a lot more interesting, and gruesome, and somewhat fresh. This installment basically does what you'd expect any sixth (and final) film in a long running franchise to do, and it does it moderately well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_SLO5GYrmps",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
18,cherold,The decline continues ... is it over now?,5,21 May 2017,"Replacing Retribution as the weakest entry in the series, The Final Chapter is eminently forgettable but perfectly watchable. Once again, tough chick Alice is killing zombies and familiar nemeses. This time around there is an option to end the zombie apocalypse once for all and save the 4,000 or so human beings who are still alive.The movie is very heavy on the action, but none of the action sequences are particularly memorable. They are also shot in this choppy style that I suspect may be a budget-saving maneuver, since it's probably cheaper to show quick clips of a knife going into something than to show elaborate choreographed fight sequences. I didn't find it as horrible as some people did, but it was disorientating and often blunted the impact of the scenes. (Some people complain about the jittery camera, but on TV it wasn't so bad.)The story makes very little sense yet is utterly predictable. It is often downright ridiculous, especially something right at the end in which Alice is giving an absolutely inane reason for something that insults the intelligence of every person who has ever watched a movie. Still, I have a certain fondness for the series that means I still kind of enjoyed it. Milla is still a solid action hero, although I wish the movie would acknowledge that she is aging in order to add a little depth. But then, since the movie has absolutely no character development that is perhaps an unreasonable request.Even though this is called the Final Chapter, the movie does leave open the possibility of another sequel. If they do keep the series going, I'll probably keep watching, but I won't be sad if this really is the end. I see no indication that this series can go any direction except down.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
19,lost-in-limbo,"""The bad seed returns"".",3,22 April 2019,"What we do get is the final chapter. That's the final chapter of one story, and probably the beginning of another. No surprises. The story sees Alice returning to where it all began; The Hive at Raccoon City to retrieve the anti-virus. One thing straight-up, it does change the mythology continuity from the earlier films leading to a clumsy twist, religious pandering and an unintentionally humorous climax. Before that happens, it's the same-old heroics, but lazily told, looking cheap and less amusing. This is because of the quick-cutting editing and strained lighting, especially during the cluttered sped-up first half, making it for me a frustrating watch. Paul W.S. Anderson is doing everything possible to make it look exciting, with showy self-indulgent techniques, than actually executing. I got to say it's disappointing, as some of its horror roots show in its best moments, where the always solid Milla Jovovich takes on a few bio-weapon beasties. Also rejoining her again is Ali Carter, as they prepare to take on Iain Glen's egotistical umbrella corporation boss. It does become a little more bearable in the second half. And Anderson does however get the grungy apocalyptic vibe to a tee. I find the franchise to be disposable entertainment at best and ""THE FINAL CHAPTER"" to be the worst of the series. Continuing the trend of me not thinking much of Anderson's latter contributions.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
20,Robert_duder,The big picture comes to a close in a bit of a small way,7,27 February 2017,"The Resident Evil franchise is very interesting for me. It started out good, got REEEEALLY good, and then started to falter. It isn't fair to even compare this to video game films because ideally outside of the same proper nouns from the game (person, places and things) it has literally zero connection to the video game franchise. And that was probably a wise move. Director and creator Paul W.S. Anderson definitely forged his own world using those characters and did very well at it. He also gave us one of thee best female heroes in film history. He choreographed and created some of the best cinematography and action scenes in an action film let alone action horror. Now here is my issue with ""The Final Chapter"" I don't think Anderson had a ""big picture"" in mind. So instead of puzzle pieces sensically falling into place over the course of 15 years and six films, this film felt like it mashed together things to try and make sense of an ""ending."" In concept it was a cool idea but they should have been establishing this all alone with Alicia and Umbrella and the execs etc. Instead the film scrambles to put together pretend pieces that have been there but not all along.Milla Jovovich hasn't had a lot of luck outside of the Resident Evil Franchise but as Alice she has coined an action hero that won't soon be forgotten. And she still looks incredible and carries off this role as well as she ever has. Alice is a tormented and bad ass chick and while her character doesn't have a lot of depth she's remained consistent in her quest to destroy Umbrella. Jovovich gives the role a lot of umph. It was nice to have Iain Glen back as a villain and he does very well in that role and is a great addition and foe for Alice. He should have been more of a staple throughout the series but he has shown up at key moments so there is that. Shawn Roberts has also been a villain staple in the series taking over from the original Wesker and he's important especially from the Video Game perspective. I did love his finale and how that worked and how the red Queen played into that. I also loved the addition of Ever Anderson (Jovovich and Anderson's real life daughter) as the Red Queen. She was fantastic and they used her resemblance to play into the story though that was all new made up information that would have been better served all along rather than suddenly. It was also nice to have Ali Larter return briefly but she felt like she was forced into the story and some of the other cast members were sadly lacking.As a mindless horror/action flick, The Final Chapter works. Anderson doesn't slouch on his usual barrage of amazing special effects and kick ass imagery. The story is okay but feels like one of those shows that just finds out it's final season is here so it scrambles to tie things up. So it's time to bid farewell unless Anderson figures out a way to breathe new life into the franchise. Even though it has gone downhill I would come back for more at the great memories I've had throughout this series and it's 15 years. 7/10",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
21,ThomasDrufke,My Work Isn't Done Here,4,9 February 2017,"""My work isn't done here"", well gosh I hope it is. But all kidding aside, the Resident Evil franchise has run its course. Alice and the Umbrella Corporation have run their relationship into the ground, but really, it was never off the ground in the first place. 'The Final Chapter' adds some validity to certain question marks left unknown through previous films, but ultimately caps the franchise off by giving them more of the same old same old.The saving grace of the franchise thus far has usually been the action and CGI. With the exception of a few of the middle films, they have stayed within their boundaries and provided some silly action sequences that are easily re-watchable. For some reason, director Paul W.S. Anderson decides to reinvigorate the shakiest of shaky cams back into the series. Isn't that era of filmmaking dead and gone? The mid- 2000's became an era obsessed with shaky camera work to add a ""found footage"" quality to it. But really? A 2017 movie reusing that old tactic? I know I was hard on the last few films because of excessive slow motion, but I'll take that any day over unnecessarily rapid editing. Half the time I had no idea what was going on. When it gets to that point, the film has already jumped the shark.I will give 'The Final Chapter' some credit in the sense that it definitely closes Alice's story well. In fact, this may be the strongest story of the series since the original. Milla Jovovich has always excelled as the post-apocalyptic bada**, and I'm glad that they at least gave her a solid sendoff. Of course, they could always come back in a few years and make another one and no one would be surprised. But I hope when they say ""Final Chapter"" they really mean ""Final Chapter"". So the story is far more inventive (in a way) than the previous installments and closes the series in a way that will likely please fans. But where the story exceeds, the sloppy execution glaringly fails.I won't pretend to be a massive fan of the series, but I've always been interested. It's had its moments and 'The Final Chapter' is perhaps the best in a decade, but I was never able to get what I wanted out of this franchise. It certainly could have been more fun, and everyone knows it should have made a whole lot more sense. But in all, it isn't my review or opinion that will shape this series' legacy, as its billion dollar revenue speaks for itself.+Wraps up the story the right way+Milla always kills it-Really sloppy editing-Had no idea what was going on with the action scenes4.8/10",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
22,ericstevenson,So critics liked it more?,7,30 June 2017,"This is actually one of the least bad video game adaptations ever made according to critics, but it seems like most reviewers here are a lot harsher! Here I was thinking it was audiences who were more forgiving on video game movies. I am so glad to say that this is the final installment for Video Game Month. Honestly, it's probably one of the best of its kind. I wouldn't recommend it, because there's still one major flaw. The last movie promised us this massive fight scene against an army of different monsters that we never saw! Well, I'm not that big a fan so maybe I'm messed up with the continuity. It actually has a positive review on Roger Ebert's website!I actually really do enjoy the last part of this movie. It features the original Alice revealing this one to be a fake which makes sense within the rest of the story. I also love this ending where it's been said that even though the virus is on its way to destruction, Alice still needs to be there to stop the remaining zombies. I love how they set up a sequel with the final installment. I guess I'm just biased towards finales. We get some pretty good CGI and a nice representation of the game as far as I know. I guess I just wanted to end this month on a high note especially how next month will be Nostalgia Critic Month to celebrate his ten year anniversary and it might be just as bad. ***",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

However, the virus' creator (Iain Glen) and throngs of the undead stand in her way.The sixth installment in this video game inspired franchise, this concluding chapter is cluttered with the same overly stylized fights, exceptionally bad acting and muddled storytelling that made the original and its successors so unmemorable.Besides, if there really were zombies corporations would just cover them in ads.

24,Reno-Rangan,Time to bring down the remaining of Umb Corp.,4,14 August 2017,"The series never meant to be story based. Well, at the first it was fine, but then it turned out be more a video game style than the normal commercial films. So if you are going to watch it, your expectation from it should be the action-adventures. Of course, nothing happens without a reason, that's where the story was born. This is the sixth film in the series and they are saying it is the final, but have to wait and see in a couple of years, whether another film will be made or they are going for television as hinted out.The main character is long dead, that's what they say to us every time. And then a new sequel with the same character and their explanation is, clone. That's seems okay, but that being a regular thing is what annoying. This film is enjoyable, like I say, watching a game played by someone sitting next to us. But not the best of the series or the year, nor its kind. Just to enjoy the action sequences. All the top, knowing about Olivia Jackson made me almost to cry. She's the real hero, hats off.As I said, the film was not necessary if you go by the story. It was just another mission, a fight to bring down the last remaining Umbrella Corp and possibly to reveal more secrets about it and everything so far happened. I always wondered how this franchise survived this long. Yeah, every time a decent box office pushed the filmmakers and actors to go for another one. The film's main ingredient, graphics were acceptable, and performances too. So, it is only for the selected audience, but you can ignore it if you are not that interested in it.4/10",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

The origin of the Red Queen is better explained, and Dr. Isaacs' character is better explained.The opening sequences plunges us head-on into the abyss of action and improbabilities. Where did the flying dragon come from? This is 'Resident Evil' and last I checked its about zombies; not 'Game of Thrones' with dragons... Is this a mutated zombie, who once were human? Soon after, the Red Queen tells Alice of an airborne antivirus that could end the infection. Why does she reveal this only now after 10 years with only just over 4,000 humans surviving? Now she cares about the human race, when there's only 4,000 survivors? Why not when there were only 4 million?Ok, so the film's beginning left little to be desired when it comes to credibility and believability, but thankfully the film vastly improves from there, becoming an entertaining action adventure horror. The zombies are back - plenty of zombies - millions of zombies! Dr Isaacs (Iain Glen) is back, as well, and again serves as main antagonist.The film presents us with lots of cool ideas, but also oh so many improbabilities and conveniences. Regardless, the film is fast-paced, with some incredible action sequences and good visuals and photography. The editing is sometimes so fast that you'll miss something if you blink.Alice is on a mission back to The Hive, and Claire is also back, along for the ride.

I liked the reunion of all the characters including the Red Queen, but some of the clones were confusing. Some of the action gave me a headache though.

Another similar film franchise, Underworld is suppose to end this year as well. It's strange, both franchises were not the best cinema had to offer, but I'm going to miss the mindless action sci-fi horror adventure with a kick ass female lead that is both film series.But I'm going to miss Resident Evil more. It was my favorite out of the two. though I played the first three games, I was not the biggest fan of them (From what I understand, this is most likely why I like the franchise at all). Resident Evil was clearly the more action packed film out of the both of them and Milla Jovovich was so much more intoxicating as butt whipping Alice (Sorry Kate Benkensale).The final chapter starts out with a montage that clears up a few things you may not have realized about the series with the full origin of the T-virus and the Red Queen.Then, like in the first film (Which this film references a lot along with bits and pieces from the other films), Alice wakes up alone in a deserted place, but it only takes a minute for the action to start this time around. After explaining the video game like plot of Alice having 48 hours to get to Racoon city and find the airborne cure to the virus before humanity is completely wiped out, the action starts and never ends.It was like action sequence upon action sequence. Once one was done another one picks up like going from level to level with very little talk In-between. Reminds me a lot of the first movie, which is not a surprise as Paul WS Anderson who directed the original comes back for the final one, except this time around it's obvious he has a little bigger budget to pump up the action.It's another leave your brain at home, pop corn eating masterpiece. Don't think, just watch and feel the excitement. It's not met to be smart, it's met to be ninety minutes of Guns blazing, cool monster effects and crap blowing up so swiftly that it makes you numb with it.And I seriously will miss this.

I would have to say though that that is the case with the 'Resident Evil' series. Since basically the very first sequel I have been saying this film is in much need of some innovation, creativity and unique ideas. Well we finally got them and not only that, we got them in spades. I would dare to say there is more creativity in this film than the entire rest of the series.FInally, the zombies take a complete back seat. The zombie side of things was a complete cop-out throughout the series and just made for easy and lazy writing on the part of writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson. They still feature obviously, but this time all the fun comes from innovative and fun situations that arise - and there are some good ones.There is still the odd piece of lazy writing. For example, there is a character who has an ability to predict what other characters are going to do next and thus counteract their moves. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the ability just disappears never to be spoken of again. Very conveniently too. There are also some things that directly go against facts presented in earlier additions to the series. I was however very glad to see that Anderson almost entirely scrapped the slow-motion nonsense this time around.I was really happy to see this series end on a high note.

Are a few scares, that will make you jump, and there is a twist involving Alice, which I won't spoil for you in case you want to see it.Now some action scenes are alright, but they go fast to the point where I can hardly see what is going on. And Shawn Roberts as Albert Wesker, could have been something awesome, but he was wasted here, what was the point of having the character if you where gonna hardly use him, at least Jared Leto as The Joker in Suicide Squad was used so much better, I wonder if Wesker was used that way in the game.

Anderson. This is the sixth in the series and supposedly, the last one-it says it right in the title!-and it is based on a video game-the first movie was in 2002. But, of course, I'm sure that it will depend on the box office results. FYI: I have heard that they are thinking of making a TV series based on the video game, but who knows? It is written & directed by Paul W.S. Anderson and the story takes up right after the last one, the 2012 'Retribution'. Milla is in her never ending battle with killing zombies and all sorts of mutated creatures, usually single handedly, but sometimes with friends. Ali is one such compadre that helps Milla in her fight. Iain is the villain that is trying to exterminate humans off the face of the earth-except for a select few, of course, including himself. Ever portrays the Red Queen, a holographic computer image, that pops up and either helps or hinders people. Milla hears about a serum that will destroy the T-virus-the drug that created all the zombies & mutated monsters in the first place-and it just happens to be in the Hive in Raccoon City, in the dirty hands of The Umbrella Corporation. As this is the last one-Yeah right-there are some revelations about Milla's past, you know, before she started killing zombies & mutated creatures. It's rated ""R"" for violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 46 minutes. If you are a fan, you should enjoy this installment-I know I did.

38,kluseba,Sometimes dead is better,6,7 July 2020,"Resident Evil: The Final Chapter is the sixth and last entry in the live action franchise based upon the famous Japanese video games. To be honest, the plug should have been pulled much earlier. While the first movie has been excellent, the four sequels have been average at best with the second film being the worst. This final movie is also a rather average conclusion and one can only hope that the live action franchise has definitely come to an end now.The most exciting element about the predecessor was how it built up to the last scene foreshadowing an intense battle in Washington D.C.. As this movie starts, the battle is however already over. What happened during the battle? What was the fate of Alice's friends and foes? Where did intriguing characters like Ada Wong played by Li Bingbing go? This movie never really answers these questions and the film's start is certainly its weakest point.What follows is a good average dystopian science-fiction movie. At least, the franchise comes full circle as Alice has to return to Raccoon City and The Hive were the deadly T-virus outbreak had started in the first movie released fifteen years earlier. The tough protagonist is looking for an antivirus, planning on eliminating the surviving foes from Umbrella Corporation and trying to save a few survivors on her way.While the movie remains entertaining with a surprisingly long running time of one hundred six minutes by the franchise's standards, its outcome is highly predictable. At least, the action scenes are gripping, the atmosphere is sinister and the special effects look sharp. The movie's conclusion finally answers the most important questions but still leaves room for yet another sequel. The fact that the movie had the worst North American box office gross might foreshadow that a potential reboot isn't going to come around too quickly.In the end, fans of the franchise will certainly appreciate the film that follows the tradition of its four immediate predecessor. This science-fiction action spectacle is certainly entertaining. Milla Jovovich's dedication to her role deserves much praise as well. However, the only truly imaginative, intense and surprising entry in the franchise was the first film.

Whilst the franchise could be viewed as ""pulp"" viewing the films in this series, have, to date, actually proved quite watchable and entertaining. Not so, what is apparently the last offering in the series. This film does not even try in my opinion. Its predictable, formulaic and as one reviewer noted, badly edited. I can but agree. It jumps, in jarring style, from contrived scene to contrived scene, leading to a yawn inducing finale everyone saw coming. The acting is reasonable but sadly it can't make up for this films other conspicuous flaws. Five out of ten from me.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

Not because this film is total garbage but because this franchise really deserves a professional reboot. Anyway, this film is better than most Resident Evil films. Just for the heck of it, I'll rank them all now from best to worst. RE1 > RE2 >>> RE6 > RE4 > RE3 > RE5 So yeah, most of these films are garbage after part 2 but what I like about this one is that there is some what of a plot and a way to genuinely wrap up the series. But ultimately this movie shouldn't be something you pay to watch because we really need them to end and be reboot into something as epic as the games.

43,rgkarim,The Final Chapter Will Shake You Up!,6,27 January 2017,"In 1996, Sony unleashed its survival based horror Resident Evil onto the world, bringing the zombie virus era to the modern age. Then in 2002, Hollywood tried to ride the coattails of success with the first movie starring Milla Jovovich as the special agent Alice. Fifteen years later, and a lot of painstaking story lines, the final chapter has arrived promising action, death, and a whole lot of special effects. Robbie K here, ready to review another movie and give you some insight into what ""horrors"" enter the theater. Let's get started, shall we?LIKES:  Story comes full circle  Nostalgia  ActionSummary: Alright the story isn't the best, but after six installments you hope for a decent ending to all the madness. The Final Chapter delivers on the promise of closing the story and tying up many of the loose ends we've been having for the last decade and a half. What's even more entertaining about the story though is how much nostalgia the directors left in the post- apocalyptic wake. Fans of the first movie will certainly enjoy many of the old rooms and traps laced in the hive, while game fans will enjoy some references to some of the most sinister creatures to inhabit the virtual world. This nostalgia helps add a little more enjoyment to the mix, giving a little complexity to an otherwise simple movie. Hands down though, the action is the selling point of the movie. The Final Chapter is nonstop, over the top, chaos involving a bunch of animated/made up extras getting beaten the nearly unstoppable Alice. Resident Evil's notorious fast martial arts meets guns and chains continues full force, pulling out all the special effects to make it the biggest bang of the bunch. A few of these moments are quite impressive, and most likely amped up in 3-D, and seeing Milla continue to punish the uncredited cast is always thrilling to see. DISLIKES:  Plot holes/Rushed Simplicity  Predictable  Cheesy at Times  The Awful Camera DirectionSummary: Yes, the plot comes full circle, but the writers really botched some of the plot points on this one. The writers must have felt pressured to get the script done, because plot feels very botched together, primarily seen in the random jumping points that often serve as a fast forward. Much of the story is a very diluted tale of vengeance, with a few twists being thrown in to try and mix things up. Unfortunately, these twists are mostly predictable, and the formulaic elimination of characters (commonly seen in this series) is just as linear as they always have been, if not sometimes out of place. Yet we know the story isn't always the strongest aspect of the Resident Evil series. So, let's pick out some of the limitations of the heart pumping, out of control action we've come to love in this series. First off, the stunts get a little cheesy at times, stretching Alice's abilities to superhero qualities. If that weren't enough, a few of these battles, like some of the scenes, again feel out of place, added only to fill as much time with action sequences than necessary. But it's the prolonged, beat someone to a pulp scene that are the most pointless of the mix and gets old after the third reiteration. However, the worst quality of the movie is the camera work. When Alice and company aren't fighting for survival in the post-apocalyptic world, the camera is surprisingly stable. Yet, the minute the action starts, thing go crazy and not in a good way. Imagine giving a five-year-old a camera, giving them caffeine and sugar to work up a frenzy, and then giving that five-year-old editing rights and you get something to describe the work. Resident Evil 7's action sequences involve the camera constantly shifting perspectives, in a dizzying array that really adds little other than annoyance and perhaps nausea. Why they chose this direction? I can't answer this, but this reviewer was not impressed with the cinematography of the film. The Verdict:Resident Evil 7 does the job of wrapping up the series (maybe) by answering many of the questions we've had. While the story is simplistic, and some of the major resolutions anticlimactic, most should be okay with it if it means getting your action on. Those looking to see Alice tear a new one with over the top scenes and CGI will not be disappoint, assuming you can get past the chaotic camera work. I would say this one would be worth a theater trip because for the special effects, however with the cinematography I can't say for certain. However, fans of the series are encouraged to scope it out to get the finish to years long journey. Action/Sci-Fi/Horror: 7.0 Movie Overall: 5.5",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
44,Rob_Taylor,"You didn't really want to SEE the action in an action movie, did you?",5,3 April 2017,"Wow! What can I say? The movie is...serviceable... as a popcorn movie, but the horrendous editing makes most of the action an unwatchable chop fest. Add in the shaky cam footage and it is hard to enjoy any fight scene.It put me in mind of Taken 3, so bad was it. It's as if the people involved in cutting the movie didn't understand what the time code was and thought fractions of a second were more than good enough for each chop. Hint...they aren't! The movie really ought to be re-titled... Resident Evil: Epileptic Fit or perhaps Resident Evil: Aneurysm.Add in the video game layout of the evil headquarters and you have a film that is hard to either take seriously or enjoy.If the action had been enjoyable, I might have gone with Revisionist Evil as a title, since the writers threw away some of the information established in the previous movies and made up some other stuff to fit their ""vision"".Also, what was with the utterly rubbish ending? Oh noes! Alice sacrificed herself for the good of humanity! Sniff, sniff...Oh wait, no, she just had a little nap! They even suggest there might be more to come, God help us all! Not that I really care about the franchise overly much, but the thought of another movie in this series done like this one is too much to bear.Acting varies greatly, but is okay on the whole and well...the story is... a bit rubbish really. Some nonsense about a cure Macguffin that drives the plot forward and leads to the fakeout ending mentioned above.I suppose the best thing that can be said is that there is some pretty decent post-apocalyptic imagery in the film. So that is something to focus on, I guess. Other than that, though...not so much.It also calls itself the Final Chapter, but you know they'll either add another lame movie to the series later on or wait a few years then reboot it with another actress.It's all just a bit sad, really.EDIT: Well, they couldn't even wait a few MONTHS, let alone years, before declaring the franchise is going to be rebooted. Just how desperate are Hollywood these days?SUMMARY: Mindless, unwatchable, nausea-inducing mess. A flimsy excuse of an action film that just gives you a headache.

47,bkrauser-81-311064,Rotten but Bearable in Piecemeal,4,31 January 2017,"Resident Evil (2002-2017) as a film series feels often times like a morose, little rubiks cube. Every time one installment succeeds in building a singularly satisfying story thread, it sputters out and crashes against the realities of its budget. If there happens to be enough gore to appease genre fans, there isn't enough frights, if there's passable character development, there's sloppy editing - and so on, and so on. What results are often singular movies that fail to be in any sense passable but still manage in some form or another to be entertaining.The Final Chapter is certainly no exception to Resident Evil's dubious track record. In a pass/fail sense, the film fails to offer fresh thrills or frights, competent directing, real looking monsters or characters worth rooting for. Instead it offers up the same grimy fretwork fans expect, except shot like the cameraman was in the throws of an epileptic seizure. Haphazardly stapling it all together, is the singular Milla Jovovich whose performance is the only consistently passable linchpin holding this entire series together. Unfortunately after fifteen years in the role of Alice, Jovovich's character has been diluted to that of a Xena-like mannequin with a steely glare and a unique ability to grunt ""why should I trust you?"" Thing is, if taken in piecemeal, there are small segments of Final Chapter that aren't rotten to the zombiefied core. Immediately standing out is a show-stopping action set-piece involving a motorcycle, a tank and an army of the undead. The entire sequence, which had Jovovich and reoccurring baddie Dr. Isaacs (Glen) trading fists, conjured up faint memories of the bizarro 80's disaster Warrior of the Lost World (1983). Considering this entire series is a quilt of faded versions of better movies, it's surprising to see ideas lifted from bad movies suddenly made better.That along with a progression of plot reveals in the last half-hour, make The Final Chapter among the best Resident Evil has to offer. Fans of the long decaying sextet will no doubt rejoice that the movie (despite its loose connection to the game series), finally delivers on all its long-gestating mythology. I'm just glad it's over period.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
48,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter""- Ridiculous, stupid, nonsensical... and so much fun! The 'Resident Evil' film series goes out with a bang in arguably its best entry!",8,20 May 2017,"Looking back at my reviews on the ""Resident Evil"" film series, I can't help but feel I was always a bit harsh on them. Having been aware of and played through a few of the games, I always took some slight offense to the movies for one reason- failing to accurately portray the source material. Yes, the films have always been their own beast, and bear little resemblance to the video-games that inspired their creation. It became clear that writer and frequent director Paul W.S. Anderson had his own agenda to weave a tale taking loose cues from the games while taking the story in a different direction.In preparation for the release of the final entry in the film series, I took the time to recently rewatch the five movies that preceded, and I found something peculiar... In the years that have passed since the release of the fifth film, my feelings have softened. I found myself able to take the films on their own, without the burden of expectation or comparison. And I found myself quite enjoying them for the most part. Well, perhaps except ""Apocalypse"", which is still a very poor film. But the rest of them? Hey... finally taking them strictly as their own thing and not as adaptations? I found them to be a lot of fun. They're harmless over-the-top action flicks. And in that respect, they're entertaining as heck! So I went into ""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"" cautiously optimistic...And I thought it was a darned good finale! Well, maybe not ""good"" in the traditional sense. It's ridiculous. Sometimes silly. Oftentimes completely stupid. And occasionally nonsensical. But so were the others. And this one seemed determined to be the biggest, baddest and craziest one yet... and it succeeded! It's basically the ultimate popcorn movie. It's full of non-stop action, kick-butt babes, gooey zombies, explosions a-plenty, and a lot of wild and crazy twists and turns. That's what I wanted out of it, and that's what it delivered. I don't go into ""Resident Evil"" looking for an avant-garde experience... I go in for entertainment. So I left the film feeling fulfilled. And it's not only a very decent entry in the series... I'd argue it's the best of the bunch!Alice (Milla Jovovich) has been left for dead. Her seeming alliance with arch-enemy Wesker (Shawn Roberts) was merely a ruse. She's been separated from her friends and wanders the wasteland of the world lost and alone. However, she soon enough learns that a dramatic endgame is about to begin. Less than 5,000 free people remain alive and within 48 hours, their numbers will be compromised too greatly, leading to the inevitable extinction of humanity. Beckoned by the Red Queen artificial intelligence, she is instructed to return to underground complex known as ""The Hive"", where an airborne antivirus has been developed- the last hope for humanity. She eventually is joined up by her old friend Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), and together, the two will fight a dramatic final battle against the evil Umbrella Corporation where it all began ten years prior...I've always loved Milla Jovovich and she does a great job as per usual. Alice has always been a relatively stoic character, but Jovovich is a complete joy and is great fun in the role. I also really appreciated the return of Larter, who was sorely missed in the previous film. She's perhaps the best supporting character in the series, so it's a lot of fun having her back. The villains played by the returning Roberts and Iain Glen are also a lot of fun in their slimy roles, and it's a relief that Roberts has finally toned down his incredibly over-the-top performance as Wesker. Though Glen takes the cake when it comes to the baddies in a deliciously vile turn as Dr. Isaacs, last seen in the third film. Just a good, solid villainous performance, even if he's a bit one-dimensional. The rest of the cast is pretty negligible, though nobody gives a poor performance... it's just that the film is about Alice and Claire's struggle, so the others get less screen time.A lot of people have been commenting negatively on writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson's work on the film, but I thought he did a pretty good job. His script is quickly-paced and never boring, with a lot of genuinely unexpected twists that I couldn't see coming. And his frenetic camera-work and lightning fast cutting actually worked quite well for the story. It's a race against time type of film. And I thought his down and dirty visual direction really lent a good deal to the urgency. Not to mention, the production is completely gorgeous thanks to Anderson's work with DP Glen MacPherson and production designer Edward Thomas. It's a very good-looking film.Were I to point out any real flaws, it's that the film does have some real issues in it's first half. An opening prologue sets the stage nicely, but it features a lot of really messy ret-con work that doesn't fit in with some of the previous films. It didn't bother me, but I can see it rubbing some fans the wrong way. And the film speeds along a bit too quickly for its own good in the first half-hour. After a breathlessly action-packed re-introduction to Alice, a bit too much happens a bit too quickly. It almost gave me whiplash. But in all honesty, despite those faults I found this to be the biggest, baddest and craziest ""Resident Evil"" yet. And to me, that makes it the best. This is a series about entertainment first and foremost. And boy, oh boy, does this entertain! And not only that... while I won't spoil anything, I will say that the ""Final Chapter"" definitely ends the series very well.""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"" is big, loud, stupid and ridiculous... and above all fun! And I give it a very good 8 out of 10.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
49,denis888,Sheer Awful Nonsense,1,22 April 2017,"The first and second parts of Resident Evil series were very good, the first being an unsurpassed peak. It had it all - characters, plot, horror, tears, humor, great twists and excellent suspense all through the film. Then, with each newer part all of this started to go away and die down slowly until we reached the total bottom of a well with this sixth and ruefully awful part. The Final Chapter suffers all the traits of a poor movie: tired actors (with Milla, it is all obvious), trite plot, banal and horridly executed dialogues, laughable speeches of pathetic valor, and on top of it all: terrible camera work, which reminds of epileptic seizures and leaves a viewer tired and rubbing their eyes. THere are no deep characters here, no humor, no depth, no Pace, no soul, no irony, which permeated first two parts. All is blatantly sacrificed to fast ad bad editing, silly monsters galore, shaky camera, cringe-worthy lines, idiotic looks and predictable twists. Wait, predictable twists? Yes, nothing is new or fresh here, Milla suffers a vividly clear tiredness of her part, Ali Larter is nothing new as well, even the baddies are a bunch of pathetic clowns... or clones...well, both.

To do this she must travel back to where it all started in the Umbrella facility. Along the way she picks up a new bunch of victims and faces a whole bunch of new and old horrors. The movie is super action packed, it's a bit too much at times. The twists are intriguing and if the film had ended with the first epic finale it would have been a great send off for the series. That being said it's big, dumb fun and is a satisfying if somewhat expected send off to my beloved franchise.Budget: $40m

I expected to see much more positive and emotional ending filled with reactions, humans, colors, sounds. But from the perfect first sequel this has gone only to worse. Nothing better than todays most common boring movies even from Lifetime ones, because at least they are more real. There is like in previous sequels, especially last two, too much action, sci-fi, nonsense story, and too random events, not connected to each other. Too unreal, for example zombies appearing out of nowhere, main character going only to one location which is too predictable. I expected more mystery. Only graphics and action part is good.

53,rockman182,Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2017),5,5 February 2017,"Thank god that its finally over. I hope. Paul W.S. Anderson finally closes out the film series based on the very popular survival video game series. The video game series is actually excellent and tons of fun, the same cannot be said for the film series. I did enjoy Resident Evil and Resident Evil: Apocalypse as far as the films go, but I cannot say that I liked the rest at all. I wasn't very keen on checking this film out but there was a curiosity to watch it be put out of its misery.The film starts off with flashbacks to young Alicia Marcus and the creation of the T-Virus. I think this was necessary for people who may have forgotten how the outbreak and destruction even started. We then see Alice walking the streets of a desolate and ruined D.C. while fighting some monsters along the way. I immediately got annoyed by the headache inducing, rapid, editing. Its awful. It takes so much away from the action sequences as you can't fixate on anything on the screen. You can't even get a good look at the monster designs so its a real downer.The situations are absolutely ridiculous. I know you have to suspend beliefs sometimes for action sequences but my god we get some really ridiculous fight scenes that are not only clichéd to hell but ridiculously improbable. Alice maneuvering her way out of the moving laser beams had me rolling my eyes multiple times. The film introduces a side cast that nobody will ever care about. Ali Larter as Claire Redfield returns but she remains so underdeveloped that you won't care to see her. There are multiple moments where Anderson tries to produce jump scares but they are so horribly predictable and out of place in this type of film. We've seen all of it a million times before and this film basically comes off as cheap. The editing will do your head in.The films passages aren't always interesting. The picture quality is mostly dark, dull and ugly. I don't really rate Paul W.S. Anderson as a filmmaker but this was TV SyFy movie levels in terms of quality. Some questions are answered and I guess some loose ends are solved but its not anything amazing and remains cookie cutter. If you enjoy all the other films you will be satisfied with the film series' conclusion. For me however, this film was the worst of the bunch but the silver lining is that the series has finally closed itself off.5/10",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

Paul W.S. Anderson the original director of this franchise back again to delivery the final installment of the series which happen to be the most epic and disappointed as the same time when he tried to blend many character from the previous movie into a environment that also blend from the previous movie with his high speed jump cut shaky cam action movie style which don't really bother me that much because i see them a lot in movie nowadays so i kinda immune to it but it will be much more better if he decided not to use it this time.All the character in this movie zombie or not they just a throwaway characters with no personality being lead by Alice soon to be killed to raise the body count.Although the production values have some good monster and weapon design plus some spot on performance by Iain Glen as the over the top villain Dr.Issac and Ever Anderson that genuinely give me goosebumps which her voice as The Red Queen.The ending perhaps it would be better if they end the movie in this particular scene but they can't help it without setting up a scene for the new sequels",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
55,bankofmarquis,A VERY disappointing final chapter,4,3 February 2017,"I have a video game playing buddy who talked me into the seeing the first RESIDENT EVIL movie back in 2002.  We, then, would make a point of seeing each one of the ensuing films when they opened.  All of them were pretty good ""popcorn films"", that is, films that are enjoyable enough while watching, but fade in memory as time goes by.  Consequently, I borrowed my friend's copies of the first 5 films in this series to reacquaint myself with the characters and story lines and a funny thing happened...I became a fan of these films.Watching all 5 of the previous RESIDENT EVIL films made me understand what I was watching - a filmed version of a video game - and not a film, per se.  These movies all have the same, basic premise, put a group of people in a situation where they have to fight their way out level by ever-increasing-in-difficulty level until the heroine prevails at the end.The visionary behind these films is Paul W.S. Anderson who wrote and directed a large portion of these films, populating them with intriguing visuals, situations, fight scenes and characters to keep things interesting enough.Which leads me to the 6th (and FINAL, so they say) film in this series - the largest grossing video game film series in history.  Paul W.S. Anderson was back writing the screenplay and directing the film, so I was really looking forward to a fun farewell.Boy, was I disappointed.RESIDENT EVIL:  THE FINAL CHAPTER is a headache inducing melange of choppy fight scenes, thin characters and characterizations that makes little use of the 3D technology that this type of film is begging for all the while giving us closure that we didn't really ask for.Is this film a total trainwreck?  Well, no.  Fans of the film series will like some items in this...Mila Jovovich (Director Anderson's spouse) stars, again, as our heroine, Alice, who pretty much is our ""first person shooter"" in these video games/films.  She's come, once again, to kick butt and Jovovich does a good job looking good and athletic as she kicks butt.  She is joined, again, by Ali Larter as Resident Evil video game heroine Claire Renfield.   In the first RE film that Larter showed up in, I was not all that impressed by her performance, but she has grown into this character and was one of the few performances in this that I enjoyed.The 3rd performance that stood above the rest in this film is ""hot, young"" actress, Ruby Rose (emphasis on the ""hot"" and the ""young"") as one of the rebellious fighters.  She grabs attention in the scene when she shows up and kept drawing my attention during group scenes.  I know she is showing up in JOHN WICK 2, so will be interesting to see her work further.And...that's about all the good things I can say about this film.The rest of the ""good guys"" in this film are there just as ""cannon fodder"", none of them developing a personality or character that stood out.  I wanted to shout to all of them to not get locked in a room with Jovovich, they aren't going to make it out.All of this can be forgiven if the villains are interesting and Anderson makes a curious choice.  He spent the last few films setting up Shawn Roberts' character, Wexler, as the ""big bad"", only to sideline him as a henchman in this film when Iain Glen's character, Dr. Isaacs, shows back up (clearly, the filmmakers were trying to cash in on Glen's popularity from his turn on GAME OF THRONES). .  As the bad guys, Roberts does a poor job imitating Hugo Weaving's ""Agent Smith"" character from The Matrix and when he gets his turn to do battle with Jovovich, it is short and unsatisfying.  Adding to the woes is the OVERACTING of Glen.  I can just hear director Anderson shouting to Glen ""Bigger, BIGGER! Go MORE over the top!!""But, you don't really come to these movies for the characters or acting, you go for the Zombie fighting, weird creatures, kick-butt fight scenes and unique weapons.  Unfortunately, these things never really happened and we are left with warmed-over fight scenes, cut in that choppy, ""cinema-veritae"" style where I wanted to scream to the filmmakers to ""just lock down the camera and let me see what's going on"".Calling this film ""The Final Chapter"" would lead one to believe that we will see some sort of ""greatest hits"" film, with old characters showing up for a final bow (cloning is a very real thing in these films, so even old, dead characters could have come back), but besides Larter, Glen and Roberts, that doesn't happen (I guess Wentworth Miller, Colin Salmon, Michelle Rodriguez, etc. were too expensive - or smart - to return).  I was also looking forward to old monsters and traps (the group was returning to the scene of the first film) and, except for one scene in the ""laser room"" (those who have seen the first film in this series will know what I'm talking about), this film could have been set anywhere.A very, very disappointing FINAL CHAPTER for what was, up to now, a pretty good ""popcorn"" series.Letter Grade C (and that's taking into account all the ""goodwill"" I have for this from the first 5 films).4 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (OfMarquis)",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
56,fernandoschiavi,"RE 6 manages to end this long saga of Alice. The problem is that everything (the script itself, to its frantic cuts especially) make this a tiring experience",6,10 June 2021,"Probably, the director Paul W. S. Anderson doesn't expect anyone to see previous movies before seeing this one. Not only for the summaries, but also for the pornographic use of retcons to alter concepts established in previous films, such as the creation of the T-Virus and the origin of the Red Queen. It also pushes new concepts down our throats, which had never been discussed before, but as we arrived here full of rough edges to be smoothed out, the script's solution was to erase and rewrite facts so that the narrative would fit. Following the format of the dreadful Restart and Retribution, Resident Evil 6 starts from a premise so simple that it's ridiculous: Alice has 48 hours to return to Raccoon City, more specifically to Hive, Umbrella's installation where the epidemic began to spread, to rescue the cure capable of wiping out the T-Virus forever. If she fails, the fewer than five thousand remaining humans will, once and for all, be wiped out. Don't ask yourself why the 48-hour timeframe or Umbrella simply doesn't finish off what's left of Humanity at once. Just move on.Here, Leon, Jill, Ada and Alice's ""daughter"" who tried to humanize the character in the previous chapter do not show up (nor are their fates explained) and Alice was betrayed by Wesker (none of that appearing on screen, by the way). Powerless, she tries to survive in the apocalyptic world infested by dangerous creatures, when she is contacted by the Red Queen (Ever Anderson, the newcomer daughter of Jovovich and Anderson) with the proposal to rid the world of the T-Virus for good, through an antivirus transmitted through the air. After a long prologue establishing the confusing background of this ""Final Chapter"", we have an extremely repetitive first act where Alice is knocked out three times and waking up in dangerous situations. Isaacs' actions take on religious biases (an unprecedented feature in the character so far) and Ian Glen's ham acting seems to make sense within the plot at a given time, but it turns out to be just bad acting. Shawn Roberts' Wesker remains just a pathetic villain, now inexplicably reduced to Isaacs' underling.Listing all the contradictions and inconsistencies of the film in relation to its predecessors would be an endless text. Suffice it to say that the ""origin"" of Alice and the T-Virus itself presented here contradicts everything previously established by the series, which would not be such a problem if the film itself did not constantly remind us of this when presenting flashbacks from the tape. Original and even visual references in the action scenes of the third act. Said cure appears all of a sudden and sounds just like an artifice in the script to end the saga. The impression we have is that it was created at the last minute right now. The worst thing is that the work's McGuffin is so badly introduced that it makes us wonder why the hell hadn't it been brought up earlier? Thus, we began to question the need for the four middle films to get to this point, as everything could have been easily resolved in the first film if they had simply inserted such information into that film.Even those who manage to dodge such issues with a lot of willpower will most likely be disappointed by the easy solutions presented by the ceiling. As always, Alice manages to get out of any situation through her infinite abilities and Jovovich continues with the charisma of a door, giving us the impression that the actress really is more than tired of this role and the same goes for all those who share the screen with her. The only one who manages to stand out a bit is Iain Glen, like Dr. Isaacs, despite his overly dramatic acting, which is only marred by the countless unnecessary plot-twists, some of which last less than a minute and don't affect the plot. Not at all, and I won't even comment on Albert Wesker's fate in this film, because it's too disgusting for one person to define in words.Fortunately, not everything is completely disposable in this film, we have a great production design here, although a lot has been done in CG. Some of these elements even remind us of Aliens and the whole atmosphere of Raccoon City manages to remain threatening even all these years after the first two films. For better or worse, we ended up feeling a bond with this devastated city, whether because of our memories of great games, or because of the nostalgia provoked by this return to our origins. On the other hand, many of the creatures look like just shapeless masses, with the exception of one particular flying being that appears in the opening minutes of the projection. There was an opportunity for them to bring many creatures from the games, but it was all wasted.The ending cycle brings back not only the horror feel of the series' beginning - with predictable scares in the dark, out in the open, for all tastes - but also a ""dirt"" in the way Anderson speeds up action and duration of the plans to make RE6 more violent and radical, which in comparison makes RE5 seem the height of contemplation and elegance. Editing not only speeds up the shots, the number of shots itself is smaller and compresses continuity; at an interval of four or five shots, for example, which in total might not last a second, Alice can point a pistol to the right, notice an enemy at his back, turn and dodge a blow, unload the magazine, save the pistol. It's an excess of cuts, which leads us to a film with shots that last a maximum of two seconds for the most part. It gets to the absurd that even in quieter sequences we have this characteristic.Added to that, we have a dark photograph where you see practically nothing, a 3D that boils down to throwing things in your face and a trail that repeatedly induces a gratuitous scare. This is the ""atmosphere"" of the movie. There is no breath between one action scene and another, which ends up tiring the viewer. But, in the rare moments when some dialogue develops, we even miss the monsters. Dr. Isaacs, who did not die in the third film, but rather one of his clones (many clones die in this film), reveals that the zombie apocalypse was engineered by Umbrella from the beginning, with the goal of ""cleaning the planet"" to start over from scratch, in the best Noah's Ark style. Even the idea of a religious sect appears in the film, but is immediately forgotten. Here is the question whether we should commend the director for abandoning such a bad idea or whether we blame him for leaving it in the final editing.What makes RE6 very particular, and especially bold, is that Anderson does it all after choosing, halfway through the film, that everything else will be staged at night or in dimly lit closed chambers. The combination of low light and action acceleration with Anderson's care for 3D ends up making some RE6 set pieces, frankly, small masterpieces of visual catharsis. The main one is the Resistance Building in Raccoon City, an architectural skeleton worthy of Expressionism, full of beams and barricades that create open spaces for the light, which passes full of drama.In addition to bringing together the close-up horror of the first Resident Evil with its architectural sense debugged up to RE5, Anderson takes new thematic steps. Here, the eternal villain of all his films, the soulless capitalist megacorporation that oppresses individuals in claustrophobic spaces. And while formal detachment has become the norm on the series, RE6 can even be seen as a very confessional film, in that Anderson gives it to her family (Milla Jovovich enters the picture accompanied by her daughter with Anderson, Ever, who plays the Red Queen only in this film) a very particular importance.Again referring to the Alien saga - if the first Resident Evil (2002), in the situation in which it places its characters, and the fifth, in the focus given to Alice's maternal instinct (Milla Jovovich), they target Aliens (1986), the sixth recovers the theme of the heroine's sacrifice present in Alien³ (1992) - Anderson manages to be efficient in what he proposes to do: a grandiose and engaging action film that concludes (?) with dignity the story he started to tell 15 years old. By worthy conclusion, we mean a narrative with betrayals and twisted twists, which does not deprive itself, for example, of ignoring a key element of one of the previous chapters - Resident Evil 2: Apocalypse (2004) to create a more interesting origin for its protagonist. Resident Evil 6: The Final Chapter, yes, manages to end this long saga of Alice, betting heavily on nostalgia. The big problem is everything that surrounds this notion, from the script itself, to its frantic cuts, which make this a tiring experience, which makes us question the need for this franchise to have been so long.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
57,spookyrat1,An Ill-Fitting End to the Franchise!,6,6 February 2019,"I've never been a player of the games, but have generally liked the movies for their well executed action sequences and the lead character of Alice. I liked the set-up of The Final Chapter's storyline and appreciated that we were given a couple of recaps throughout the film, that did pretty much tie everything together.But like many of the other reviewers here, I ended up being disappointed with much of the format of this finale. Gone were a lot of the slow-motion well lit action sequences from the earlier movies. In their place were substituted huge amounts of shaky hand held camera footage in dark surroundings, combined with close-up after close-up of heads and faces and lightening fast editing. Why Paul Anderson would choose to embrace these ideas, I've no idea. But it had the effect for me of reducing what should have been a really epic conclusion to the series, to being merely a pretty ordinary one. Time after time good to great set-ups to action set pieces were handicapped by one, or all of the above techniques being employed.by Anderson. Things seemed to be marginally better towards the end of the film, but by then the damage had been well and truly done.It was pleasing to see some of the series' earlier characters re-introduced into this film, but again to a person, they were just so reactive and passive, as to the way in which the story moved forward. Essentially they just seemed to be cannon fodder! Take the character of Clare for instance and ask yourself, what did she actually do to assist Alice in the end, aside from stopping her being shot, when Alice initially meets up with them? The answer of course is pretty much nothing. The exception of course was The Red Queen, who was arguably the best surprise element in the movie and apparently had the largest speaking part, which I personally found amusing.At any length, all good or OK things come to an end and I really think judged on this effort, that Paul Anderson and Resident Evil have clearly run their races to an obvious finishing line. Let's hope for no more re-boots.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
58,dave-mcclain,"""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"" is a satisfying conclusion to the franchise... or is it?",5,28 January 2017,"In the 1989 romcom ""When Harry Met Sally"" Billy Crystal's character had the habit of reading the end of a book first. He said that he did it so he would know how the book ended just in case he died before he finished it. But maybe he also found it helpful in recognizing when he had reached the final chapter. After all, it can be hard to tell. In 1984, the fourth installment of the ""Friday the 13th"" horror franchise was subtitled ""The Final Chapter"", but the very next year, there was ""A New Beginning"", followed by ""Jason Lives"" and ""The New Blood"". Then we had ""Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday"" but then Jason came back for a 10th film, and for an 11th to do battle with Freddy from the ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" series. And then it was ""Friday the 13th"" reboot time. After all that (and other examples in American cinematic history), skeptical Movie Fans can be forgiven if they're not convinced that ""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"" (R, 1:46) will live up to its billing. But either way, I'm here to tell you that the sixth movie in this particular franchise keeps the action intense and ties up the loose ends in the 15-year-long saga.After the longest gap between movies in the series (over four years), this film begins with a 5-minute narrated summary of how its dystopian version of earth got to this point – with innumerable zombies roaming the planet and mankind on the verge of extinction. If you weren't aware, a company known as the Umbrella Corporation took a new cure for a mysterious illness and turned it into a biological weapon that they could use to eliminate the threats to the existence of the human race by eliminating the human race itself – except for a bunch of rich people who would be placed in hibernation until the apocalypse had run its course and then awakened to remake the earth in their image. It's basically an updated version of the biblical tale of Noah's Ark – with a twist. This particular Resident Evil is being battled (and has been through five previous movies) by a tough and very special woman named Alice.After narrating that overview of the world's current situation, Alice (Milla Jovovich) spends the next 15 minutes of screen time in the remains of Washington D.C. battling zombies and other mutant creatures – and learning a secret that could save the last few thousand people who are left. It seems that there is a secret anti-virus that can counteract the deadly T-Virus, but saving humanity won't be easy. (Is it ever?) Someone (Alice, of course) is going to have to go back to Raccoon City (where this whole mess began), infiltrate The Hive, find the anti-virus and release it into the atmosphere – within 48 hours.Alice spends the rest of the film trying to get past the varied, numerous and seemingly insurmountable literal, human and no-longer-human roadblocks that stand between her and her ultimate goal. She soon falls back into the clutches of the Umbrella Corporation's Dr. Alexander Isaacs (Iain Glen) who, it turns out, isn't dead, as Alice thought. After escaping from Isaacs and his army of zombies, she comes across a group of human survivors in Raccoon City. Among them are some old friends whom Alice recruits to help her fight Isaacs and save humanity. The plot ties together the previous movies, incorporates some shocking reveals and brings the story to a kind of conclusion, but leaves the door open for more sequels.Fans of the series will likely find ""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"" to be a satisfying conclusion to the saga, but newcomers may have trouble enjoying it. The extreme violence may be a turn-off to some Movie Fans, while the shaky camera work and the overuse of close-ups and quick edits in the fight sequences make following the action difficult. This movie certainly doesn't skimp on the action, but includes plenty of sensory overload. The plot line feels overly contrived, but it does bring a sense of closure. This movie is interesting, twisted and entertaining, but a little too much of a good thing. ""B-""",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
59,swilliky,A middling ending to the overlong zombie video game adaptation franchise,4,29 January 2017,"he video game adaptation franchise finally concludes but not on a high not, just another mediocre film that has not succeeded at the domestic box office. Alice (Milla Jovovich) survived the war in Washington D.C. and roams the streets. She hasn't seemed to learn from her five other movies, still walking into traps and finding herself in trouble. Alice ducks, flips, and shoots her way out of dire circumstances on more than one occasion. The action would be a lot more fun to watch if there weren't some many cuts that make for confusing action and hurts the narrative, a signature of Paul W.S. Anderson's directing style.The story revolves around the mission the Red Queen gives Alice to cure the T-Virus infection with an airborne antivirus that remains in the bottom of the hive from the original film. The movie, like the others, insists on filing the information from the beginning and adding to the story. In this past, Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen) conspired to orchestrate the outbreak in a biblical delusion hoping to bring about a figurative flood from the story of Noah's Ark. Alice is kidnapped by Dr. Isaacs, who claims that she only killed a clone back in the third film. The doctor is also heading back to Raccoon City in an armored truck trailed by an army of undead.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
60,abisio,Best of the series (and still accept one more),9,13 March 2017,"I was really surprised; I went to see LOGAN, KONG and THE GREAT WALL movies with a budget at least 3 times bigger than this one and believe me this was the best by far.Resident Evil never did good money in USA but the franchise was highly successful abroad and I have to accept that the tandem Anderson (director) and Milla Jovovich (Alice) know a lot of tricks to make an action movie entertaining without a pause.There could be lots of thing you usually criticize in this kind of movies; particularly when 5 previous movies had already been made; but Anderson is able to keep the things fresh. Using some old and some new characters; casting a good villain (or two) adding a couple of twists and staging a few action pieces that will make hold our breath for minutes.None of the recent blockbusters comes close as entertaining.In brief; do not let it pass. It deserves to be seen if you like good action / horror movies.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
61,kuarinofu,Hilarous,4,16 May 2021,"RE: The Final Chapter is bad, but if you've seen any of the installments beyond the third one, you already know that.What is good about this particular one is hilarity. It's so incredibly stupid at times I thought the screenwriters had reverse progeria. As the movies were made they felt like they were written by a 15 y.o., then by a 12 y.o., this one is...you get the point. There is no such thing as too stupid for the RE series. It can always get more silly, as proven by this one.The formula is the same, everything just happens, and when the writers didn't know how to transition a scene they would just cut to a random scene, they never bothered with anything at all, not continuity only.I'd actually enjoy the silly action if I would be able to see it. The problem was probably mentioned a hundred times in the reviews - insane shaky cam and from 3 to 6 cuts per second during the action scenes. And since 70% of the film takes place in the dark, there were a couple of these when I legitimately couldn't see what was going on at all, this is not an exaggeration, I just couldn't. I tested it and it looks better at x0.5 speed, but for some action scenes, I'd recommend 100% brightness and x0.25 speed.I'd endorse this kind of do whatever we want attitude, but they never got beyond the basic formula, we have seen this many times already.At least the dialogue is funnier than in most modern comedies, you will laugh a lot as I did.The only actually positive thing about this one was...a tiny bit of character that Alice has finally received after 14 years of being a blank slate. These 20 seconds in the end made me believe that she probably could've been a real character if they wanted her to be.I don't think someone would just stumble upon this film, so if you're doing a marathon of all RE films, you're ready for this hilarious buffoonery.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

63,Darkside-Reviewer,The Final Letdown,5,20 July 2019,In the first two minutes of the movie all the backstory of the previous movies is changed and now Alice has to go back to Raccoon City and the Hive to cure the outbreak after five movies of bad writing and acting they decided to just go all out and make the final chapter the biggest let down of them all and a middle finger to any fans they had of the previous movies.The movie follows Alice (Milla Jovovich) the only survivor of Humanity's last stand against the undead in Washington now with all of her friends dead she is contacted by the AI computer known as the Red Queen and told she can still stop the world from ending by releasing the Antivirus which is being kept in Raccoon City in the Hive guarded by the Umbrella Cooperations lacky Wesker (Shawn Roberts) Alice travels back to where it all began Raccoon City where she finds a small group of survivors led by Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) together they storm the Hive in search of the Antivirus and answers from the Red Queen herself.The movie looks ok still heavy on the CGI backgrounds and flashy action scenes that are yet again over the top and amounts to nothing interesting visually coupled with bad acting and lazy script writing its about what you'd expect from a Resident Evil movie at this point.If your looking for a continuation from the previous movie you will be let down as the movie skips over everything and kills off all the characters from the previous movie except Alice and Claire and that's because (Ali Larter) was the only one they could convince to return the rest did the smart thing and stayed miles away from this disaster of a movie.I recommend watching this movie if your bored and there's nothing better to watch just don't expect anything mind blowing.,Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

68,destroyerwod,Where to start with this atrocity of a movie?,2,7 February 2017,"I think this is the first time i give less than a 3 on IMDb. And i really had a hard time not giving it a 1. Lets start by the obvious, the editing and shaky cam. Shaky cam has been plaguing the movie industry for years. If used right by a very competent director, it can enhance the action but the fact is for years its used by directors to cover either there lack of skills for filming or there actor's lack of talent at action scenes. Sadly its not the only problem, add a very shaky cam with some very terrible editing, with jump cuts every 0.5 seconds or less and you have some action scenes where you can't barely see anything and they give you a headache. This technique is use for the recent Steven Seagal movies cause the guy can barely move anymore, he is overweight, old and his body double do pretty much everything yet they have to conceal this. The difference is, Seagal have reasons to to do this and his budget for movies are much lower.What about the story? Well we all know by now it completely spit in the face of the video game franchise. So its no surprise it keep going in this route and throw random names from the game without any similarity to the actual video game characters. But whats worst is that it even retcon its own cannon. Story established in previous movies is completely ignored and changed for something new that barely makes any sense. From characters to even locations.I really want to keep this review spoiler free so i will not elaborate more, do NOT watch this movie unless you really have to.This movie should not be call The Final Chapter but The Final Insult. I just hope that its indeed over and that either Resident Evil never get adapted again on the big screen, or that Capcom make sure that next time the movies do the games justice.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
69,PyroSikTh,Completely Disregards Continuity,6,8 February 2017,"I admit I'm a fan of the Resident Evil movie franchise. I've played some of the games and loved them too, albeit for completely different reasons. But the movies I've always had a little bit of a soft spot for. As a franchise, let me get this out there, Resident Evil is awful; simply atrocious. Every movie is bridled with silly story elements, terrible acting, cheesy dialogue, and a complete disregard for continuity. And yet they remain good fun, and I do genuinely get a kick out of watching them.The Final Chapter is no different. Just like with every movie since Extinction, it starts out by dealing with the tantalising cliffhanger from the last movie off-screen, which makes no less of a disappointment, but in retrospect is hardly surprising. Retribution left off with a camaraderie of fan-favourite characters going to Washington D.C. to aid in humanity's last stand against the undead. It promised a massive war for the next movie. And yet The Final Chapter opens in the aftermath. Alice crawls out from some rubble, dirty and exhausted, and Jill, Ada, Chris, Leon, and Becky are nowhere to be seen (and in fact, never appear). Alice is contacted by the Red Queen (played by the fourth young actress in as many movies), and told she has 48 hours to return to The Hive underneath Racoon City before the last vestiges of humanity are wiped out once and for all (why 48 hours? I haven no idea, but time limits are suspenseful, right?). Along the way she's pursued by a new Dr. Isaacs, and bumps into Claire once again, while Wesker waits for her inside The Hive.As far as continuity goes, dealing with Retribution's cliffhanger off-screen is The Final Chapter's lesser sin. There's a lot here that doesn't make a whole lot of sense when cast against the (admittedly nonsensical) tapestry of the franchise. Worst of all is completely rewriting the history of the T-Virus. Apocalypse laid it out that the virus was created by Dr. Ashford in order to give his daughter, Angela, the ability to walk again. The Final Chapter opens by explaining that Dr. Marcus created the T-Virus in order to stop his daughter, Alicia, from ageing at an accelerated rate. Maybe they were two doctors who worked on the same virus, who both used it to save their daughters from different ailments, but this is never established (all it would've taken is a single line in the monologue). Then there's ""Wesker lied, it was a trap"" to explain why Alice still doesn't have powers and why Wesker is still evil (although now he's an employee rather than a chairman). Wesker also seems to have misplaced the T-Virus bonded to his cells as well (no idea).I admit, even though the story throughout the entire franchise has been terrible, contradicting itself, never settling on a singular narrative, going full cartoon silliness at times, it's what keeps me interested. The Final Chapter also has a terrible story (evidently), but it's not all bad. The big, final twist to cap off the entire franchise is pretty good. I mean I pegged it in the first half hour, but it was still an entertaining narrative decision that puts the whole franchise into a slightly new light.The action is hit and miss as well though. On one hand, there are some fantastic fight sequences, between Alice and a flying creature, between Alice and Dr. Isaacs (on a number of occasions), between Alice and a Chimera (I think?), and between Racoon City survivors and a horde of undead led by Umbrella tanks. The fights between Alice and Dr. Isaacs in particular are really well choreographed, oozing with style and flurry, and showing Dr. Isaacs enhancements really well. However, it's difficult to see any of it. The entire film is riddled with about two or three times the amount of cuts as your average movie, and the fight sequences suffer the most. There's about five cuts every two seconds, making it hard to really grasp what's going on. Thankfully shaky-cam is brought down to a minimum, and close-ups are clear enough to tell what they're a close-up of, but the frenetic editing makes it hard to keep up.Talking of editing, my single biggest bug-bear was the overabundance of cheap jump- scares. Visually there isn't really anything too scary, but each jump is accentuated by an extended period of silence followed by a horrifically loud noise, so loud that you'd have to be deaf to not jump out of your skin. In all, I cannot say with any conviction that The Final Chapter is a good movie, it's not even the best Resident Evil movie. It almost completely ignores the previous five movies in regards to continuity, it's rife with over-editing, and it's scares are just obnoxious and annoying. The soundtrack suffers without Tomandandy, although Paul Haslinger is a satisfactory replacement, and while it's not the best looking movie of the franchise, it's still a pleasure to watch, and has the best CGI of the franchise. I admit though, I did enjoy The Final Chapter. It was a good, fun time at the cinema, and nothing more, but I may just be saying all this because I wasn't exactly expecting much after the atrocity of Retribution. I give The Final Chapter an enjoyable despite awfulness 6/10.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
70,ethanbresnett,A disappointing final chapter...,6,21 December 2020,"I had quite high hopes for this film after the tantalising cliff hanger of the last instalment, but this just didn't pan out how I hoped.The story wasn't awful. It had some good elements, but it was pretty lazy in parts, and kind of obvious what was going to happen. It felt like they were going through the motions, just trying to wrap things up and cash out with a decent box office.I was also disappointed with the action. The franchise has always been pretty up and down with its action, flipping between some pretty slick stuff and horribly shot set pieces. Unfortunately this fell into the latter category. This is such a shame because the stunt work actually looked quite decent in places. This was ruined by the constant cuts and horrible camera work. There were a couple of scenes where I genuinely had no idea what I was watching.The effects were decent in areas, and we were treated to a pretty cool zombie set piece around the midway mark, but other than that it was pretty bland.Not a great end to the franchise but it still managed to entertain me, so there is that.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

I think that's all I can really say. There are a couple of twists,, but in all honesty, I've never really understood these movies completely.

72,nikola17,I Am only person who likes Movie Franchise this is great final chapter,8,5 February 2017,"for game lovers who hates movie franchise, are so happy because the movie franchise has ended. for me i wanted to be more sequels, but anyway this ended pretty good i never played the games, i have but not as many of them first time i heard of Resident evil (2002)i have watched movie i never knew about games after i played games so i became fan of movie franchise it's still great, fun worth watching franchise to watch still i am only saying for my own opinion but i like franchise now in this final chapter it's fun as always story still continues brings back everything from previous films of Resident evil but you can't prove that Jill, Leon Wong, Bucky died because they weren't part of this movie, but they say they died but how ?? they aren't dead but they weren't part of this final chapter as always with action and Milla Jovovich is Always part of it kicking ass, and always surviving Impossible in every situation but everyone really expects to have a final showdown in white house from Resident Evil Retribution ending i wanted that to happen but showdown and final thing is in same place, where it takes to end showdown from First (2002) Resident evil laser defense system room where another Umbrella Corporation has been killed form first film, that's where it takes place and going back to Raccoon City where it got destroyed and Nuked from Resident Evil: Apocalypse.Plot Dr. James Marcus, the original founder of the Umbrella Corporation, had a daughter the Red Queen (Ever Gabo Anderson) who was dying of premature aging. Desperate to save her, Marcus developed the T-virus as a way to cure all diseases on Earth. After having had his creation taken away from him, Marcus' business partner Dr. Alexander Isaacs (Iain Glen) who wants to end the world and tried to convince Marcus to use the T-virus for military purposes. When he refused, Isaacs ordered Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) to kill Marcus. because Issacs wants to take over Marcus business and toke his antivirus is the cure to kill all inflections. Alice (Milla Jovovich) who awakes from past 3 weeks from destroyed white house after events from Resident Evil Retribution after being betrayed once again by Wesker. the Red Queen appears and tells Alice that she must return to the Hive in Raccoon City within 48 hours, where the Umbrella Corporation has developed an airborne antivirus, which will kill every organism infected by the T-virus, before the remainder of humankind is wiped out. When asked why she's betraying her creators, the Red Queen simply says that she will tell Alice once she arrives at The Hive. Alice takes risk to go back to Raccoon City where it all ended from Resident Evil Apocalypse the thing It's Very Confusing when Resident evil Apocalypse ended and it's gonna be nuked ? how is it still their there is gonna be a lot of questions for that i thought it's Apocalypse end of world all that end of Raccoon city but anyway she goes back to city she had to trust Red Queen she request Alice to get T-virus because over Red Queen wanted Revenge.it's so good that they bought back Claire Redfield (Ali Larter)from Resident Evil Extinction, Resident Evil Afterlife and K-Mart who was in these Another 2 Previous movies is not even mention in movie again there is no proof that she is dead or not but anyway she is not part of movie franchise anymore and Chris Redfield is not Mention in movie too so the character is only thing is back is Claire Redfield that's all you have another characters (Ruby Rose) Abigail she was a chop shop worker, Eoin Macken, William Levy, Rola are new characters but there weren't noting special characters you have a lot of great action scenes a lot of fun action when Alice escape's from Motorbike BMW Motorrad a lot of fight scenes and she kills a lot of Zombies a lot of Creatures and action was so fun, Claire is still kicking ass in movie as always with Alice teams up as usually when group went underground where Raccoon city is been destroyed they go underground in tunnels where Alice has to find the real Isaacs cool staff some cool traps, cool fight scenes Wesker doesn't do much in movie. expect he fights with Alice that's all he doesn't do much but he is in it, a lot of great stunts witch i can tell there is a lot of stunt work in film. I Never Wanted to Spoil the movieI liked the movie there is some plot holes aside, it was a thrilling and intense wrap up great worth seeing movie in a final chapter the game haters must be happy but for another people is different their never played games before, another people that includes me can't compare with all another games of Resident evil game franchise. it's a An Awesome end to the series with lots of exciting action but they were gonna make 2 more after Paul W.S Anderson ended to 6th movie but i expect 2 more movies to be made i am saying it in my opinion. CGI were just as talented expect, don't let anyone let you hate the movie franchise just because the games were a lot better then movie franchise the movie is complete different to games they can compare it. i don't and never will understand why everyone hated this movie franchise this is still worth seeing it very fun and fast Pacing 8.10 still worth watching",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
73,stevenrotherforth,So Paul I see you liked the new Mad Max too?,1,14 November 2017,"Resident Evil: The final Chapter I suppose that if a movie makes money than there will be a sequel no matter how bad it was. But come on! How many of these dire pieces of movie excrement has there been now? I will admit that the first one was mildly entertaining even though it failed to capture what makes the actual video game that it is based on so great.I would explain the plot of this latest instalment to you but I don't think there is one. Either that or it just went unnoticed due to the irritating way the film bombards your senses. The editing, direction and general camera work make this film unfathomable. So much so that I actually gave up and turned the movie off after the dude out of Game of Thrones (Iain Glen) gets his hand chopped off. The camera skits from one view to another with more cuts than a butchers chopping board. Bloody annoying! Stop it!Paul W.S. Anderson is capable of directing a decent movie. Event Horizon and Death race were enjoyable even if they borrowed ideas from better movies. This movie seems as if the director has thrown all creativity out of the window. Instead here we are subjected to a mash up of inferior Mad Max and The Matrix imitations all strung together like a really bad music video. Come on Paul, move with the times will you! The Matrix came out in 1999! The film is so devoid of originality that Anderson tries to ply you with a jump scare at every opportunity. Its not scary, once again It's just bloody annoying! Stop it!The special effects are frightening, and I don't mean intentionally. They're frighteningly bad. Milla Jovovich's career takes a punch to the groin every time she stars in one of these piles of dog dirt . She's capable of so much more. The only redeeming positive is that this is the final chapter. Thank goodness. Please hand the franchise over to someone who could give us a movie we and the video game deserves.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
74,p-jonsson,Good action feast. Script? That's nitpicking.,6,21 June 2017,"I would say that my expectations for this movie was pretty much spot on. I expected a visual action feast with a fair amount of gore in it and that is pretty much what I got. Things like a well developed script and stuff like that, well obviously the producer thought asking for such things would be nitpicking.It currently holds a 5.6 rating at IMDb and 60% user score on TMDb which is fairly well deserved. Of course there are always reviewers giving it single star ratings and saying it is the worst film ever. That is just bullshit. These people have obviously never seen a really bad movie.Milla Jovovich is again playing the hot zombie killing chick from the previous movies and although she tragically lost her superior T- virus strength in one of the previous installments her capacity for dealing death and mayhem as well as absorbing hits still borders on being super hero stuff. Unrealistic but fun to watch.Despite my comments on the script earlier there is actually one with a paper thin thread intended just to bring the story from point A to B with a maximum of violence and special effects in between. I do think the tanks that they had cooked up looked cool although they were just visual candy a'la Mad Max. I mean come one, a tank with ventilation shafts all over the place so all you had to do was pour some gazoline over it and light a match? Stupid to say the least.There were a few other things was more designed for looks than realism. For instance a certain ventilation fan that were used to drag out some of the events. Who the f designs a ventilation fan with a dozen or so rings of blades? It is a ventilation fan for Christ sake, not a jet engine turbine. Oh, yes of course, stupid me, otherwise they would not have to spend so much time crawling through it.I did like the various mutated zombies as well by the way. The flying thing at the beginning and the end was quite cool. Some people seems to have had an issue with the fast, sometimes very fast, clipping of scenes. I have to say that it did not disturb me that much. Not that it added much either though.Speaking of the end. Well, I guess it was okay. The end itself was not too surprising. It was dragged down by the stupid nonsense with Dr. Isaacs though. The only time an exploding grenade resulted in anything less than a semi-atomic eruption of flames was of course when the director had decided that he needed the bad guy for a few more scenes. Lazy and stupid script writing.On the whole I enjoyed the movie as much as I expected to. It was an okay movie. Good for a evening fix of zombie splattering and Milla Jovovich (okay so what, I am a male of traditional sexual orientation you know). It could have been a lot better but it was not really horrendously bad either.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
75,dcarsonhagy,The Final Chapter - R. E.,5,18 May 2017,"Based on one of the most popular zombie games ever, R. E. - The Final Chapter supposedly lets Claire Redfield, er, Alice, try and tie up all loose ends and stop the spread of the horrible T-Virus, which turns all people into flesh-eating zombies.People who have followed this series should know that, save for some of the monsters, those involved with these films have not stayed too close to the games...and that didn't really bother me. After all the turds (and believe me, there have been plenty) produced in the same vein, anyone who thought they were going to get another ""Gone with the Wind,"" really needs to step back and reevaluate! I have stated several times that all I ask ANY movie to do is entertain me. Anyone who reads my reviews should also realize I am not easily entertained. R. E. The Final Chapter at least MOVED. The action was practically non-stop, and I like that in a movie which is basically ""fluff."" The acting was also decent enough; everyone knew they were not doing ""King Lear."" Paul Anderson, the director, said this was going to be the final installment in the series, yet left a little opening should he change his mind.Rated ""R"" for non-stop violence and language, R.E. The Final Chapter may not be the best movie you'll ever see, but it will be FAR from the worst one.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
76,xamtaro,The Anderson Family's Fan Fiction Franchise comes to its overdue end,5,12 February 2017,"Paul WS Anderson's fan fiction family film borrowing a video game title comes to its overdue end. The previous movie RESIDENT EVIL RETRIBUTION ended just as a massive battle against Monster our hordes of undead and mutants was about to begin right at The White House. Epic right? Well we never get to see that as our Mary Sue protagonist Alice awakens in rubble after the battle. Mimicking the video game experience, she gets a Mission to return to Raccoon City, the place where it all began, to try and find a new cure for the global zombie virus outbreak. With her special powers (supposedly returned to her in the last movie) now gone, Alice must rally the last survivors on earth, which conveniently include a few familiar faces, to storm the Hive, umbrella corporation's secret underground lair from the first movie. Make no mistake, Resident Evil as a movie franchise has Long since severed ties with the video games it is based on. It is now essentially multi million dollar fan fiction which uses some of the creatures from the games, some homages and supporting characters that do happen to share their names with the main characters from the games. The movies craft their own lore apart from the games and it was fairly intriguing with the twists and revelations, the cloning sub plot, the mystery of who Alice really is, the virus granting special powers, all of it. That is until they went and retconned stuff on a whim. The revelation that there was a cure to the virus? There was already a cure in the first movie. Funny how everyone forgot that. The revelation of the virus' true creator? Contradicts RESIDENT EVIL APOCALYPSE. The retellings of the origins of the outbreak? contradicts the first movie. It is almost as if this second trilogy (Afterlife, Retribution, Final chapter) is a reboot of the franchise or a wholly separate franchise from the first trilogy (RE, Apocalypse and Extinction).The story wraps itself up nicely bringing multiple sub plots to a satisfactory end but the execution is disappointing and the journey is almost laughable. Alice as a character is as devoid of personality as a raw chicken wing. Her delivery of dialogue alters between bored angry, bored upset and bored surprise as if actress Milla Jovovich is tired of all the narrative loopholes that the franchise has dug for itself. Every line from her can be punctuated with a sarcastic ""seriously?"" and it would not feel out of place. Despite having no special powers, she still kicks a lot of Monster butt while maintaining her ageless good looks. The look of RE: THE FINAL CHAPTER lacks the visual polish of the previous native 3D movie. This one is shot in traditional 2D replacing the surreal slow motion with close up frantic camera-work and flat, dingy cinematography that reminds me of a direct to video movie. Surprisingly this actually works in the movie's favour, bringing it back to the grittier aesthetic which attracted me to the first 3 movies. It is grim, it is claustrophobic, it is perfect for a horror action movie. My only gripe is that the director falls back on way too many cuts during action scenes giving that choppy jittery feel that too many modern blockbusters are known for.I am torn when it comes to this franchise. It is cheap guilty pleasure of a shallow 80s action movie which this film makes no excuses for. But on the other hand it has so much potential to be a little smarter and tackle themes a little deeper. The cloning subplot could give rise to a plot thread exploring individuality and the nature vs nurture debate. The Umbrella Corporation had potential to be a compelling protagonist with the amount of resources and influence we had seen in past films, but alas they are no better than something out of a 1990s anime, all ""wipe out the world and recreate in our image"" and stuff. Any compelling motive? No, just because they are the villain and must be evil. As a movie franchise, RESIDENT EVIL had overstayed its welcome by 3 movies. Its needlessly convoluted story which literally hits the reset button at the start of every movie does little justice to its simplistic narrative, cheap thrills and shallow themes. If it is any consolation, the franchise is consistent in that regard so we only have the action, special effects and camera-work to fall back on. Sadly even those aspects, whole an improvement over past installments, are still mediocre, leaving this final RESIDENT EVIL movie as neither the best Nor the worst of the bunch.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
77,akshatmahajan,Enough,7,9 November 2020,"Now after watching whole RE franchise, I have come to realise that the creator of this franchise doesn't know how to create sequels. I mean, beginning of every movie is different from where previous one ended and then there was some childish reason for this. The casting also changed so fast and some characters disappeared without any reason. Overall, you can watch it if you love zombie movies otherwise do give it a try only if you have a lot of time.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
78,coreyjdenford,The Final Pointless Shrug,4,3 February 2017,"This review of Resident Evil: The Final Chapter is spoiler free** (2/5)""MY NAME IS Alice,"" Milla Jovovich's super soldier Alice says near to the beginning of Resident Evil: The Final Chapter ""And this is my story, the end of my story."" It starts with the same standard narration of the previous instalments in the series that has now been dwindling on for nearly fifteen years, and for a while we all thought that the series would end years ago but after the climaxes of the films have ending with a lot of cliff-hangers we are finally at the end. However for a while after Alice who is now tired from fighting for six movies straight, it feels like it's never going to reach that final battle, that final moment when the film ends climaxing the story to an abrupt close without anything left open-ended, when it finally does come to that end it feels like it's been left short.Kicking off just a few days after Alice's visit to Washington at the climax of Resident Evil: Retribution, she has been stripped of her psychic powers so that she can no longer predict anything or climb into other player's heads by staring until their eyes bleed. She is tired of this fighting and just wants it to end, at this point Alice, is attacked by Umbrella's new bio-weapon (anyone who's played Resident Evil 5 will immediately recognise it). She is given a final task by the Red Queen (Ever Anderson) who helps Alice by giving her one final task to find a cure, at this point the title pays-off. She must go back to Raccoon City to find a cure in the hive, along the way she is caught in one final fight, but soon sees that she can't keep up she doesn't feel super powered.Naturally writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson adds something new to the series, this one is no exception. He adds an armoured vehicle run by Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen) while hinting at Mad Max Fury Road. At that moment the film should be running better but due to poor editing, left-short cutting and hand-held camera shaking, it's hard to know what's going on. That's the big problem. There are many small problems along the way to Raccoon City. You'd think that after all this time of problems mixed with practically non-stop action the film would run slightly better, well sort of after all that travelling she has time to relax to meet with allies lead by Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) while waiting for the climactic battle. At other points Alice no longer feels like the heroine as she spends most of the film's runtime either getting captured, suspended through the air or even unconscious, in addition Anderson tries hard to add important information that's squashed due to the film's runtime. Yes, there are many problems but to give Anderson points he also gives the film a spectacle, unfortunately Resident Evil: The Final Chapter is riddled with a lot of problems and not enough story to deal with them. This reduces the final moments to an incomprehensible messy blur. After fifteen years of the same standard pacing issues, the poor editing and the same old story, it's fair to say that the sixth film ends on a pointless shrug rather than a bang. VERDICT: Shaky camera-pans, poor editing, left-short cutting make for a shorter film that with the standard practically non-stop action it reduces the final moments to an incomprehensible messy blur.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
79,jayjaycee,Anderson hurt himself in confusion,4,16 April 2020,"""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"" is a 2017 action horror film written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson starring Milla Jovovich and Iain Glen. So ... I've seen this franchise going in all directions now, all highs and lows, at its best and at its worst. I've seen terrible CGI villains and sequences, pointless plots and stories and dozens of random side characters or main characters degraded to such. I've seen it all. It has never changed. Was I still hooked for how Anderson would round up his abominable creation? Oh, yes and again, it's trash at its finest. At least, though, it's that kind of trash with the entertainment factor that happens to appear occasionally in this franchise. Is it still a good film though? Not really. First of all, it was more than outrageous to see how Alice is the lone survivor of the ultimate battle that was teased at the end of ""Retribution"". I mean, come on! You had Jill, Leon and Ada in the story, some original game characters the audience could at least partially connect with. Then, in the next sequel, you kill them off without mentioning them ever again. There's not even a chance for ambiguity, as the novelization of this film revealed that Jill was killed by Wesker and Ada and Leon were eaten by some super mutant. Excuse me, what? Not only is it absolutely disrespectful to kill off such characters between the movies, to make it canon via the novelization is even more of a kick to the teeth for fans. Has Anderson graduated in and received a diploma for""Disgracing Source Material"" and ""Incensing Fans""? Slowly, I'm beginning to believe he's doing it on purpose, I swear! One cannot be so stupid, right? Right? If this was a competition, he would win the first price in all disciplines. Well, that wasn't even the worst, but before we come to that I'd like to point out some surprisingly pleasant aspects. The premise for instance gave me some weird nostalgia for the franchise I wasn't expecting to feel in the slightest. Believe it or not, having Alice going back to The Hive after all this time was the absolute strangest walk down memory lane ever, considering I've watched the whole series in less than one week. Also, I thought that the film eventually featured mildly improved stunts in the fights one might even daringly call choreography. It was definitely less monotonous than before. What went wrong then? Well, let's put it like this: Who ever was in charge of the cinematography and editing needs to be banned from filmmaking forever. Forever! Not only is the shaky camera absolutely amateurish and simply doesn't fit into the film, the frantic editing makes it even more dreadful. It felt like I was watching a cheap film by junior high school students who wanted to use it as a cheap trick to trick the people into thinking they were watching masterful action rather than mediocre fights. The thing is, while it might be possible to create this effect, it backfired miserably here. Instead of enhancing the action and making it more tense, the film was almost unwatchable thanks to it. I had to take my eyes off the screen dozens of times, because it simply hurt and gave me motion sickness. If I was an epileptic, I would relinquish watching it at all. Seriously, the chance of having an epileptic seizure is dangerously high with this one. The film doesn't even profit from it, so it's nothing but unnecessarily stupid. It's actually such a pity, because in terms of plot and story the film is not even that terrible ... in an Anderson standard, of course. I mean, we have a tight story and finally a minimum of pointless scenes. In some way, awful or not, it made some strange sense and wasn't as abstruse as some previous films. Alice has to go back to The Hive to receive a cure for the virus and to stop Umbrella once and for all. Basically, it sounds plausible and somewhat interesting. The fact that it was not completly brain cell bashing doesn't mean it still didn't have the typical Anderson flaws and plot holes. Like, who in this series stays dead or is at least not a clone of someone? Feels like Anderson was asked how many clones he wanted to include and he just said ""Yes"". Dr. Isaacs not dead? How random. Wesker another survivor of Washington and all of the sudden nothing but a minion? Oh, the disrespect. As if that wasn't already enough, he even brought Claire back from out of nowhere, accompanied by a bunch of other irrelevant side characters that are nothing more than cannon fodder. I mean, it's a series about zombies, but who stays dead in this universe? No one? Ugh. Furthermore, the film creates some massive plot holes and continuity errors of the stupidest kind. James Marcus developed the T-Virus to save his daughter from a terminal illness? Wasn't Dr. Ashford the creator literally a few films ago? The Red Queen again somehow survived all the events and is now on the good side after all the things she did? Who's the traitor, Wesker or her? What gave me the rest though, is one little detail: In this film, the Red Queen isn't able to kill Umbrella employees. Who did she kill and who has she tried to kill in all the previous movies then? Umbrella employees? Ugh, once more. It's obvious things like this that approve my opinion that Anderson has zero conception of writing and directing a film. I mean, he dumbly rewrites all the rules he's established and isn't even capable of understanding his own freaking creation.
Also, the plot convenience is ridiculously dumb in here. The ending is so hilariously unrealistic and uninspired it's funny again. It would have been even worse if it wasn't for the extreme fun factor. Come on, it was the ultimate sacrifice?! The only thing I'm terrified of is how the open ending doesn't exclude future sequels completly. I'm hoping for the best, but I'm prepared for the worst. All in all, this film concludes the terrible series in an equally awful manner and offers a mess of the best kind. From confusing plot decisions, over lifeless side characters and terrible editing to Wesker pretending to be in ""Home Alone"" you get all of it. It's almost hilarious how this film is seemingly confused with its predecessors. But what to expect from Paul W.S. Anderson, lord of the game adaptations? Well, at least the series finally ended with this installment. Did we get decent film at last? Haha, think again.
Was it enjoyable? On a low level, yeah. Do I hate this franchise? Totally. Will I ever rewatch it? As strange as it sounds, I would, only because it's that kind of absolute trash you like to watch with friends or when you want to remind yourself of your good taste in films. Well, hopefully Anderson learned from his mistakes and will keep his hands off game adaptations ... Wait ... you wanna tell me he created an adaptation of ""Monster Hunter"" that also stars his wife? Oh no ... Here we go again...",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

81,jackmeat,Solid action flick dragged down by editing issues,6,12 February 2017,"My quick rating - 6,1/10. Another all out action fest as the T-Virus is at critical mass, and the world population is about to be wiped out. This time Alice (Milla Jovovich) reunites with many former game members to venture back into the hive,where the whole thing started, in an attempt to stop the umbrella corporation once and for all. Great visuals in this one but one flaw is some seriously confusing camera work for the fight scenes. Really quick editing is used that often makes it tough to tell what is going on. Other than that, this is an enjoyable ride that has a seriously misleading name (at least by the ending they give). You'll see that once you check out the film. A pretty solid flick for what it is meant to be.

However it was good to see Claire back in action again, I will say what was great about the film was that it finally gave an explanation of how the t virus was created and was intended for good before umbrella corporation.

It's still not a cinematic masterpiece, but it does exactly what a Resident Evil movie is meant to do: entertain you with fun and ridiculous action, and a few twists and turns along the way.If there's one thing that makes this movie as entertaining (and at times even more so) than the first two movies, then it's the action. Pretty relentless from start to finish, The Final Chapter is such an entertaining watch, hopping from action scene to action scene at a rapid pace, and very rarely letting up with too much planning, dialogue and character development that the series' weakest entries tried to pull off.Of course, the heavy emphasis on mad, and at times utterly preposterous action (Alice's ability to survive everything is way beyond Die Hard levels), means that it's not a particularly intriguing or memorable watch, and director Paul W.S. Anderson's insistence on dizzying quick cuts and shaky cam is frustrating to see. However, this movie knows you want Milla Jovovich doing backflips and killing zombies, and it thankfully provides that in bucketloads, making for a properly entertaining and fast-paced action movie.One of the more surprising elements of The Final Chapter, however, is the last-ditch twists within the series' overall story arc. Sometimes, this film does a great job at tying up some loose ends from previous movies, and at others, it's a little contradictory of the past events. Still, as the film goes on, we begin to learn more and more about the true reason that the world was plunged into chaos, as well as a whole host of other hugely entertaining, albeit ridiculous, twists that actually give this film some genuine stakes.I'm not going to say I was engrossed by the story, because it's incredibly thin, and wouldn't stand up at all if it weren't for all the action going on around it, but I will say that this does have some of the best ideas and plot twists since the first two movies, yet another reason why this might just be my favourite of the whole franchise.And at the end of a six movie streak, you'd expect lead actress Milla Jovovich to be phoning it in with a bored and generic performance, but that's not the case. Her character has never been the most fascinating, but you can't deny that Jovovich really goes for it in this final outing, reaffirming how good an action hero she can be.Whilst the same isn't necessarily true of many of her co-stars, most of whom are just another set of expendable extras, the rivalry that we see reignite between Jovovich's Alice and Iain Glen's Dr. Isaacs for one last time is pretty entertaining, all building towards a hugely fun finale that marks itself as some of the best action of the series.Overall, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter is all you want from this series. Harking back to the strongest instalments with its no-holds- barred action and ridiculous twists, it's a properly entertaining and action-packed blockbuster that's a lot of fun to watch, even if it's not a film of the highest quality.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
85,ritera1,Entertaining.,7,24 December 2017,"I find Paul WS Anderson a talented guy in the action field, but lacking in ambition and depth to his films. He's found a business niche that is very global (and not really very American in storytelling). But he does little to bring new and original material to the genre.He's doing B and even C films, by and large, but does end up keeping up the pace for a very long time and bringing a quality look to the films. The twist of Alice being a clone at the end was good, though.Jovovich sells the action throughout but not sure about the casting for the rest of these films. Would have no idea of they're good actors or not being that they are given next to nothing to work with. Glen is a good nemesis but still really doesn't have much more to work with. Has a prolific career but is not very memorable.I've watched all the films and generally like them all, even though they are not really that notable beyond the look and the pace. Something to learn from, but not much. Good action details in such but few and far between. Sure it's very difficult to cut such sequence so heavily and quickly but I more like a flow that Chinese action is more proficient at.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
86,srdjan_veljkovic,"The wrap-up story is OK, otherwise it's actually worse than other Resident Evil",4,30 January 2017,"The story is a little better than most Resident Evil movies. Not much better, but, better. The wrap-up of the franchise is OK. Of course, the whole franchise is silly, so, don't expect too much, but, in its silly world, the wrap-up makes sense... mostly.But, that's about it. It's not very interesting or fun. There's only one funny line, near the end. It's very dark. But, literally. Most of the movie is in darkness, being very hard to see anything. Maybe the idea was to project some fearful situation, but, it doesn't work.The fights are with too much cuts. Instead of ""wow, what did just happen!"", you're left feeling ""what the hell just happened?"".Mila Jovovich and Ali Larter also don't look so good. Maybe it's also that the story is getting old, but, they are not appealing at all. Maybe producers should have called Sienna Guillory... then again, maybe this would ruin Jill Valentine, too.At long last, its ""feminism in your face"" is too much. Previous installments had a little feminism. Alice was the most powerful person in this universe, but, it's by chance, not because she's a woman. There were plenty of good men. But, in this final chapter, all men are evil or expendable, women are good and triumph over them, including Ali Larter killing her lover (which Mila Jovovich gives her the pleasure to).It's not the worst in the franchise and certainly not the worst of its genre, but, it's not good.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
87,darkreignn,A fitting end to a heroine's story,8,12 February 2017,"""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"" is the last entry in the premier franchise of video game movies. Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson and starring Milla Jovovich, ""Resident Evil"" is a frantic and fitting conclusion to the series, if a bit nonsensical and nausea inducing.I should say that I absolutely love this movie series; these films are straight up entertaining and a ton of fun. But more than that, these movies actually have an interesting storyline that employs likable characters and deep characterization, especially with Alice. She's a fantastic heroine with real depth, mystery, and humanity. And she kicks ass. And I'm not ashamed to say that I emotionally connected with Alice and with her story, and I've been wanting her to succeed ever since she went against the Red Queen. So of course I was looking forward to the supposedly ""final"" entry of the ""Resident Evil"" cinematic universe. Let's get this out of the way: if you hated the other ""Resident Evil"" films, then don't go see this. Why would you? You'll obviously hate this, too. But if you are in any way a fan of the previous installments and are invested in the storyline, then you have to go watch this. Believe me when I tell you that this film will satisfy you if you are a fan. It's non-stop action from start to finish, filled to the brim with set piece after set piece. And it's a total blast.The beginning was like a mixture of ""Mad Max"" and ""Fallout"" with epic action scenes and sumptuous set design and cinematography. From Alice fighting on top of a fast moving vehicle, to planning a strategic attack on a zombie hoard from on top of a crumbling building, the first half of this movie goes all out in its attempt to give you the apocalyptic action you crave. And once Alice gets to the Hive, the action kicks up twenty more notches as her and her crew try to survive a deadly game of cat-and-mouse where the wrong move can mean getting sucked into a trap that will make you free fall to your death. There are traps, monsters, and Albert Wesker; what more can you ask for, honestly? It was just so much fun, and it really was a white-knuckle thrill ride. I can't deny that I was on the edge of my seat, literally, for a lot of scenes during this film, especially during the fan scene (you'll know it when you see it). The action in this movie is truly breathtaking; I only wish I could've seen it a little more clearly.By now you've heard of the so-called atrocious editing this film has, and I agree in some respects, and very much disagree in others. Yes, this film has very rapid editing, sometimes having 4 or 5 cuts per second during the combat scenes. But, to be completely honest, even with the breakneck pace of the editing, the action really wasn't that hard to follow. Why? Because, unlike ""Taken 3,"" ""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"" didn't have a lot of shaky camera. It had very fast, split-second editing, but it was stable; it wasn't obnoxiously shaky like in ""Jack Reacher: Never Go back,"" or like in ""Jason Bourne."" I hated those two movies because the shaky camera made it impossible to know what was happening. Luckily, this movie's action was much easier to decipher and enjoy, even with the fast editing.Of course I would've loved this movie to by edited in the slick and clean manner the previous two ""Resident Evil"" films were edited in, but I respect the change of tone and direction Paul W.S. Anderson went. He obviously wanted to go for a grittier, horror-thriller vibe with this movie, and I can't deny that it worked. The editing did enhance the intensity of a lot of scenes, especially the scene where Alice and her team are getting chased by the monstrosities knows as the ""Cerberus dogs."" When this scene was going on and the drum beat was getting louder and louder and was in synchronization with the cuts, I couldn't help but think to myself, ""Now this is how you make quick cuts work."" It was downright effective. But even so, I still would have greatly preferred for this film to be edited in a more coherent manner because by the end of the movie I felt nauseous and carsick and I had to drink some ginger ale to make sure I didn't vomit. And speaking of vomit, the scenery in this film is gorgeous. It's so visually pleasing, from the remnants of Washington D.C., to the dirty and grimy Hive, to Raccoon City, everything is beautiful to look at. This is probably the prettiest looking ""Resident Evil"" film, and having Milla Jovovich in the lead helps as well. She's absolutely stunning, and a fantastic actress. She plays Alice to perfection and her character will be missed.""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"" is a blast from start to finish. Sure, it rewrites the storyline that was established in the previous films (don't even get me started on this; it really takes some mental gymnastics to make sense of this movie, as it goes against a lot of previously constructed lore), and it may put you in an epileptic seizure, but it's a rush of adrenaline and pure unadulterated entertainment that you will not find anywhere else. If you are a fan of the series, than you know what you have to do. At the very least, go show your support for Paul W.S. Anderson, for Milla Jovovich, for the cinematic world that they have created, and, most importantly, for Alice.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
88,ivanmessimilos,Awfull movie,2,31 August 2021,"The story in this film is almost non-existent, but not only that but some things have changed compared to previous films. There is no logic, there are no characters from the last movie, there is no connection. I wonder how it's possible for someone to make a franchise where along the way they change things that are established through sequels. I also have to emphasize the montage in this film. In the first ten minutes, I literally felt physically sick, I almost got sick because of the quick editing in the action scenes. After a while, though, I recovered because I guess my body got used to such visual efforts because such a montage is repeated throughout the rest of the film. In such action scenes, I could not understand at all who with whom, how and how much. The guns fire, I hear the blows, but I am unable to explain what exactly is going on. The characters in the film exist for only one purpose, and that is to die a violent death, mostly from the zombies that eat them. I don't know what anyone's name is, nor do I know absolutely anything about a particular character other than that it's a matter of time before he dies and that I don't care at all when that happens. In the end we have some kind of twist that I raised an eyebrow at because I had a feeling that they were writing the script all the time while they were making the film and that they didn't follow what they had written before at all. Nothing makes sense. The only logical explanation is that this movie about zombies was made for zombies because they don't have brains.Extremely bad ending to one bad franchise with a steep drop in quality in the last 3 films. The only positive thing for this film I can say is that I have watched bigger garbage in my life.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
89,fung0,Another Great Paul WS Anderson Thrill-ride,8,29 May 2017,"Anyone who has stuck around through the previous films will know, we're not talking subtlety and depth here. The Resident Evil series is a ludicrous brew of non-stop action, terse dialog, fierce martial arts and exaggerated horror tropes. In the course of the Final Chapter, Alice (Milla Jovovich) will:* do battle with human, canine and airborne zombies* engage in road chases in both 2- and 4-wheeled vehicles* fight a siege against an army of human zombies* jump off a cliff* fight arch-villain Iain Glen multiple times* solve the ultimate mysteries of her own existence* and a lot moreIt's almost too much for one movie. Each sequence is a hoot, but the best moments, for me, came as Alice nostalgically recapped some of the very first film, again threading the ridiculously complicated security systems in the Hive. Also, the ending was entirely satisfying, a perfect finale for the series.A lot of reviews complain about the fast editing. I found it exhilarating. This isn't a Fred Astaire film, where the camera stands still so you can appreciate the actor's moves. (Bear in mind that Milla Jovovich is now in her 40s.) Rather, it's a seamless visual whole - CG effects, pyrotechnics, stunts and editing all blended together. I wouldn't want every movie to be done this way, but I think there's room for a few. Especially when they're done this well. It's a style of movie unique to our times.And nobody does it better than Paul WS Anderson. I put him in the same pantheon with Luc Besson, Roland Emmerich, Sam Raimi, Jaume Collet-Serra and the granddaddy of them all, Roger Corman - writer/directors who compulsively crank out films (and scripts) at a pace reminiscent of the old Hollywood studio system days. Their work is slick, stylish, entertaining, and never insultingly dumb. They don't force your brain to switch off - they just put it in Neutral, like the cars on any roller-coaster.The Resident Evil series isn't for all tastes. But it works well, in its own terms. And this Final Chapter is a good one.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
90,Eddie_weinbauer,Do you remember,1,18 March 2017,"Back in the 80s when you could watch a movie fight unfold,with gracious movement and camera filming from distance. With wide angle lens,So you could watch it all unfold and take it all in.Sometimes they had the really cool moves,shot in slow motion. Well,those days are gone.Instead you have people hopped up on coke and red bull.Filming and editing the whole thing,so badly that you lucky if you don't get epilepsy,even if you didn't have it from beforeI really wish I could tell you what this movie was about,I really do. But I can't.Simply cause I don't have a clue. The story is impossible to follow.The bad shaky camera work in every scene,that suppose to drive forward the plot,just make you confused,and leaves you wondering what happened and who died.Most of the movie is shot in the dark,so a few flash lights here and there and shaky camera work,doesn't really help. The use of dramatic pauses are overwhelming. And the actions of the hero are quite questionable at best.AVOID AT ALL COST",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
91,PetarNeo,They finally ended it right?,6,1 March 2017,"After long 15 years they decided it was enough and ended a series that wasn't even so good but made some money so they kept pushing it around in hope of finding some ground to hold onto. Considering previous movies this one wan't as horrible as other but it gave us some story to work with and to get us deep in it which was a quite different approach and provided few tricks. And you would think it will be good but it is not, as predecessors it lack good directing that isn't choppy and that keeps jumping from scene to scene and even fight scenes are either dark so you're unable to follow or so quick that it's impossible to have some reaction. CGI was nothing special even bad as it didn't quite fit in surrounding. Easiest way to end disease is of course to find cure but with everything that is going on and how Alice (Milla Jovovich) always manages to get in some trouble it will give us some story that is too short and could be very interesting but kills all interest from the beginning with cheap tricks and very dull horror. Best parts are at Hive where you are provided with much more intense and interesting story which tries to balance with lousy dialogue and directing. There are some visually very impressive scenes which look like they are from some other movie and they look really nice. Mostly movie tries to work with so many and it ends that way because from start it was really bad and now there is not so much room to fix that. Paul W. S. Anderson director/writer of Death Race franchise and Resident Evil franchise tries to put visually nice movies to screen but with so many story and character development and there could be much more from him maybe one day. 2/4",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

93,dormesher-21565,The Final Chapter...... Really Surprised Me,8,16 November 2018,"Resident Evil The Final Chapter the last entry in the live action franchise movies loosely based on the video game series.
This is a great end to this Franchise and it raps up the story very nicely with some Interesting twists along the way.This is a fun entry into this franchise and honestly it's the one that surprised me the most because of how much I liked it this is my third my favourite entry to this franchise and I enjoy it slightly more than the first one.
It's a great ending and great resolution to the character of Alice.Although I'm not a massive fan of the twist with Alice i do think it's an interesting way to end her character and works well for the franchise.
However there some things that bother me about this one the action goes by a little to quick sometimes and on the odd occasion you can't really make out what's happening and it can be annoying sometimes but it doesn't ruin the story.Also you do can't off miss old characters and wish they would be resolved like Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine but that's just my opinion being a fan of the game Series.The ending is cool and a great way to finish this franchise I also like the fact it revealed that Umbrella released the T Virus on purpose showing how evil they where from the start and being a fan of the game series that's awesome.Like I said this movie surprised me and I really enjoyed it just a fun entry and a fun franchise overall I've really enjoyed marathoning these movies and I've had a blast with them all.Verdict 8.1/10 very enjoyable and my third favourite in the series and has a decent conclusion.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

I get not having them in the movie but their fates shouldn't have been so ambiguous. That aside, this one might be my third favorite installment. The first two being, well, the first two. For the most part gone from this one is terrible CGI; the zombie dogs were mediocre in some parts but thanks to the darker lighting and grittier tonality of the movie, resemblant of the third film, it worked out. The humanoid creature Alice fights in the second half was really cool but, like other scenes throughout, crippled by choppy editing and in painfully flickering lights. Characters are pretty lackluster all around, with the exception of a wittily malicious Dr. Isaacs. That said, this iteration of Alice might be my second favorite in the series. Unfortunately, the action sequences and plot really devolve by the ending, although I personally thought it was a nice touch to revisit the Hive from the first movie, and use Milla's actual daughter as the Red Queen. Ultimately a high 6, low 7.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
96,jdollak,I don't know why I like these!,7,20 July 2017,"I saw the first two Resident Evil movies in the theater. I thought the first was okay. The second one seemed really pretty bad. Then I forgot about the movies until the fourth one. I decided, on a whim, to watch it. And I was very entertained. It was terrible, but not even terrible in The Room sense of the word.Since then, I've found a strange affection for these movies. I'm not an apologist though. All of the complaints about the series are completely valid. The editing is mostly annoying. The plots seem to be either nonsensical or impenetrable. Characters are mostly disposable.And still... I like them.Why am I talking about the series, rather than this movie in particular? Since this one ties it all up. As I was watching this, it was the first time I felt like the plot was well-defined. Maybe it conflicts with earlier movies, but here, I felt like I knew what they were trying to do, and I knew that each step of the story moved them forward toward their goal.Action sequences vary. Some of them are enjoyable, well lit, and easy to follow. Others are a dark mess, and get dull because of it.One detail that made me feel especially pleased was that whenever there was an opportunity for a witty comeback when the heroine beats someone, her responses are appropriate. They're mildly witty, but they aren't silly.I still don't recommend these movies to anyone. They're a particular taste that appeals to a specific audience.When the reviews for this one were fairly negative, I was concerned. But nope - it fits perfectly with the rest of the family, and I'll be adding it to my collection. And I think I'll go back and watch the others again.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

We got people that wanted those cuts back. Now, this movie you really low rate it, and done same here as that movie. Only, difference with this movie I hate is, and I do agree, the shaky camera. Not enought to drop the high rating from me.I should give the raters that low rated, a low rating. Was not as bad as the complainers say it is. Ratings here are still not forced, to make this rating system right. None of you guys that give no stars, makes no change to the ratings at all. So, you can keep putting no stars, and it will never go up or down. Not smart, if you want the ratings to change. This is why this site sucks for ratings but still kind of sucks for reviews too. Do not trust any of these ratings because of this.This rating system has been messed up the whole time, and never ever will work right.

99,mmcgee282,About this movie,9,9 February 2017,"Lets make one thing clear,unlike the rumors claim that it was shot in 2 camera 3D,they were wrong.It was converted to 3d as the end titles credits mention it .It was too fluid in its camera movement to be shot in a two camera set.The camera was so shaking and quick moving that it threw off the three Dee. The camera was wiggling a lot.Now the good side.Back in 2003 or 4 I saw the first version.The way it was written looked like it was promoting conservative propaganda of our regime.The big corporations and the police were the government and every citizen was serving them.I was very uncomfortable about the story.What did not dawn on me was that it was written that way on purpose cause it was suppose to take place in big brother.Now years and years later.The greedy wealthy and evil doctor Isaacs,played by Iain Glen ,for that corporation had decide to destroy the whole wold except for the building and infrastructure and re populate the world in their vision.Which has resulted in human and animal zombies mutations .Alicia played by Milla has to go back to Raccoon city to find the anti virus to stop all this disaster.She is attacked by an under water Zombie ,a zombie pterodactyl you name it.I got my popcorn butter smudged on my glasses and my 3D glasses .I missed some part.Had to go to the bathroom and clean my glasses.When I came back she found some people still alive.Every one thought she was a bad guy until one friend recognized her.It seems like she has to give up her life in return to stopping the zombies.It seems that she is a created humans for a real women who got cured of her old age when disease she had when she was a little girl,but, there are side affects,Its turn everyone into zombie,except a few.Everyone follows her to find that formula that the evil doctor has. I clapped when that mean Asian man ,Commander Choo,played by Joon Gi Lee got shot for beating Alice up,sent him to be eaten by the zombies.In the beginning as she was chasing the evil d.r.,who reminded me of a corrupt politician, on a tank ,she fight him and cuts his hands off.What confused me was that when she confronts him again was that he had his hand back on.It turned out to have been a double in the earlier one When she finally kills the doctor and throws the anti virus to kill the zombies,the next day she discovers that she did not have to die,that she became a human,I swear it looked exactly the same way as in the ending of Gayracula.Did the film maker or screen play writer saw metal storm or did they base some of the aspects of the story on Mad Max?this story seem to be the opposite of the first one. This one had anti establishments stance.but this was a part of the story .If this was only shot in true 3D and did not have that shaking camera quick shots it would of been 10.It's still good .02/9/17",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
100,Wililjam,Wasted,4,18 March 2017,"This movie added NOTHING except the Alice/Alicia thing. It's really a shame, I think they added a lot of great cinematography in this movie compared to the previous movies. The fight scenes are, however, atrocious. I got a lazy eye because of the cutting in the fighting scenes. Too much happened and I couldn't keep an eye on what was happening until the fight was over. The story is basically: ""I need to find the anti-virus, but there are zombies in the way."" They added a few characters, which I didn't care about at all. Every new character were used as a ""Hi I'm here, and this is my 2 second backstory, ops I died."". Do not get me started on the plot holes. This whole movie is a mess. It's enjoyable at least ONCE. I've seen the others more than once, but I will not be watching this one over and over.Two things that made me angry was that this movie literally has ""The Final Chapter"" in it, and it didn't resolve ANYTHING. Also, the ending made no sense. It was *supposedly* the LAST movie, yet it ended on pretty much ""This is not over."". If you want to end a story, END IT.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

102,TheNabOwnzz,Seizure inducing garbage,1,26 August 2018,"And here i thought that Taken 3 had the worst editing in the history of film. However, as It turns out there is even one that manages to outclass it in this regard, and that is obviously Resident Evil: The Final ChapterLike all previous Resident Evil entries, it is a film that consists of absolutely no storytelling, character development, or any other form of substance. Thus, we are once again subjected to an hour and 46 minutes of non stop violence & gore. It is a brainless piece of work by itself, but if you do intend to create a film such as this, at least make sure the action scenes, which is basically what the entire film consists of, are PROPERLY FILMED. Some of the earlier entries in the series such as Resident Evil (2002) & Apocalypse (2004) also feature mediocre editing & a lot of shakycam resulting in unclear footage. However, The Final Chapter is by far the worst of them all. One particular scene in which Milla Jovovich fights some asian guy is 59 seconds long and features 118(!) cuts. Not once in this fight does the viewer have an actual insight as to what exactly is going on. There is also a fight with a 'Bioweapon' which uses a similar amount of cuts, but also features horrid lighting due to its already severely lacking cinematography, resulting in one of the most eye damaging scenes ever created.It is a colorless, bleak, bloated & ugly mess in its cinematography. Ofcourse it is supposed to be set in a post apocalyptic world, but even some previous entries such as Extinction manage to at least create some kind of visual mood ( Even though that was too severely lacking ). Nearly every character from Retribution is discarded without even being told what happened to them except that they are probably all dead. It features a bunch of new characters. Most of which are unable to act, especially the one white guy that wanted to shoot Alice even after they knew they could trust her. These characters are only there so they can be slaughtered, so by this point the audience will just start thinking: 'Just die already'. Like in previous entries, there are numerous examples of the so called 'Brainless' undead somehow being extremely silent so they can sneak up on the main character like some stealthy assassin leading into an extremely predictable jumpscare. Not to mention all the times a friendly taps our main character on the shoulder without making clear first that they were there, which ofcourse makes no sense other than making up cheap jump scares. I do not believe that even the people that are easily startled will jump one single time during this film as every single jumpscare comes at the most absurdly predictable moment.The acting is sub par to bad, the screenplay is horrid ( Especially the way a villain that was killed off in an earlier film is written back in ), the choreography is non existent or at least not visible due to its extremely quick jump cutting in which nothing is really shown. Even the simplest of actions require an enormous amount of cutting. The cinematography as stated before is colorless & ugly, although anything that might have been visually impressive would probably automatically be negated due to the absurd editing.

104,politehere,"My name is Alice and this is my ""illogical"" story, the end",8,1 April 2017,"The first thing that attracted my attention was that the little girl (the one the Red Queen was modeled after) looked like the one we remember from Resident Evil Apocalypse. It was also interesting to learn that the T-virus had transformed a few individuals ""before"" the virus escaped the Hive. Dr. Isaacs's role in the outbreak of the disease appeared to be an afterthought, which was a bit hard to reconcile with the events of the original RE, but not completely impossible.The scenes of the ruined Washington DC were fantastic and reminded me of Fallout 3 (I hope they would make a movie based on Fallout games). The bio-weapons could have been rendered much better and more life-like. While very well-designed, they all looked computerized. It could be that the director deliberately wanted to remind us that the movie was based on a video game. I liked all the vehicles used in the movie, particularly the armored vehicle carrying Dr. Isaacs, very well-designed indeed.Some new bits of the story seemed illogical. If the T-virus cured thousands of diseases, where did its side-effects suddenly come from? Wasn't it tested on guinea-pigs before it was tested on humans? According to the Red Queen, soon after the T-virus was released, a secret file was uploaded to her data-stream, which caused her to turn against Umbrella. The question is why didn't she turn against Umbrella then? Why did she have to wait for 10 years to co-operate with Alice when she could've done that from the beginning? Other illogical aspects of the story include a 25-year-old Alicia (who looked like a 90-year-old woman due to progeria) being one of the main decision-makers of the Umbrella corporation (just because her father owned 50% of the company?!), as is shown in the secret video file. Why? What did she possibly specialize in at that age?! Why did the Umbrella corporation develop only one vile of anti-virus if it was so essential to ""reboot the earth"" by cleansing the undead?Why was Wesker so stupid? If he didn't want Alice and her crew to get to the Hive, why did he close the gates ""after"" they had reached the Hive? Why did he stop the blade when it was successfully sucking in and killing the crew? In the laser chamber, why didn't the grid-like pattern of lasers form to kill Alice? How did Alice pour gasoline inside an ""armored"" vehicle?! How can one bottle of air-borne anti-virus kill a horde of zombies in a fraction of a second? Magic? If you shut your brain down, you can enjoy Resident Evil: The Final Chapter for what it is: An action-packed movie with wonderful special effects and a likable protagonist that closes the loose-ends and gives you a happy ending.

105,urthpainter,Most Misunderstood Film of the Year,4,31 January 2017,"Paul W.S. Anderson had a vision. Could it be done? For years the best video game designers alive have been incorporating film ideas into video games, with great effect. Games like Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear Solid franchise have evolved from pixilated eight bit graphics to the stunning story and character presentation on full display in MGS4. But what if you went the other way? How about taking video game ideas and bringing them to the mainstream movie going crowd?Resident Evil: The Final Chapter begins with an obvious homage to roguish sandbox games like the fallout series. We are quickly accelerated into a vehicular combat experience, which itself transitions into the next video game genre. Action adventure, fighting game, 3rd person action, first person shooter, strategic team ops, stealth recon, real time strategy, platforming... stunning really! To cram all these gaming concepts into this film. Anderson really set the bar high, and jumped with great ambition.So, did it work? Does this light bulb above the head translate into a good movie? A stunning and resounding NO!!! It failed miserably!!! I do believe this type of film making can work, but there has to be open admission to what is happening. Which is hilarious, because every other story element - whether character death, action trope, or plot twist... is blatantly telegraphed, or spoon fed to the seasoned viewer. The one good idea in this film was disguised, and unless you are a die hard gamer - this convention not only doesn't help - it actually muddies an already confused script.Once again, the only good qualities in this PWS Anderson film is the cast. Maybe the one reason I've gone to all of these movies in the theater. I love watching these people, and they (again) look fantastic in this movie! Design and production (less camera work) is solid.The camera work varies from average to horrific. The more activity in front of the camera, the worse the cinematography becomes. The close up, choppy fight scenes are especially hard to watch. Literally hard to watch, because of the nonsensical nature of of shots... and editing! The editing may be the worst quality of this film. Who knows? There may actually have been a film there - probably not - but the editor did not give the viewer a chance of following the nonsense story, or even moment to moment action.Paul W.S. Anderson has made a business out of making profitable bad movies. It is based entirely upon screen talent, and the ability to finish projects, which is no small thing. It really is a shame that these movies started off average, and descended in quality sequel by sequel. This is especially annoying as a fan of Mila, Glen, Larter... anyone else wonder what happened to Chris Redfield? So this is the end? For the best, but an unfortunate exit none the less. 4 out of 10",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

108,Martinito_08183,"It may be very famous and financially successful these days, but as a whole - the series missed it's opportunity to be something great.",2,10 August 2019,"Resident Evil is one of the most famous video game series of all time, it's one of those that i'm a huge fan and the one i love so much. Even though i haven't played all of the games, i do have a clear knowledge of what is happening in all of the stories. The first game that i've played and experienced was Resident Evil 4 (i've played the original PC port with the awful keyboard controls and i died more than 64 times... on easy mode) back in 2013 and playing it over and over i got better at it, discovering new things; getting used to the controls and having a different enjoyment every time.I knew about the existence of the live-action adaptation of the series and Apocalypse is the first movie that i've watched when i was a kid and saw some scenes of Extinction, but i never seen the rest of them and i was thinking of watching them one day, but there are so many movies that are releasing every year, so i had to delay them every time. Now that Resident Evil: The Final Chapter released in 2017; me being hungry for some Resident Evil stuff this week and after many delays, i had the chance to watch all six movies in the series and after watching them, i'm not surprised that all of them got so many low score from the critics and the fans alike.There are so many things that are executed so poorly, which makes all of them so terrible and one of them is the story, but the way they are written or told are so poorly done and with each movie, it gets worse and worse and there are moments that don't make sense or they defy logic and the other aspects that I will not forget to mention that are horribly done like the unlikable characters; awful dialogue; bad acting (although there are some moments of good acting, but 90% of it is just bland or bad); weird and horrible music; sometimes very weird casting choices; fake-looking visual effects; horrendous editing and bland cinematography. Unfortunately that means for all of them and that's the reason why all of the movies didn't got a separate review, because they all feel the same, except the story and sometimes you can tell why some movies are amazing and others are bad.There are three types of emotions that i have towards this series right now:
1. Anger, because Paul W.S. Anderson, the producers and Sony didn't even care of making something good and Anderson has never made a good movie in his entire career and most of them are either mediocre or terrible. Mortal Kombat may be his best movie out of all of them, but that doesn't mean that it's good.
2. Disappointment, because before they started making the first movie, they originally hired George A. Romero to write the script, which it would have followed more the first game and instead of going with it, they rejected it and went with Anderson's script. They had huge potential to make a great Resident Evil movie and then follow it up with great sequels, but they wasted all of the opportunities for this. That's a real shame.
3. Pity, because there are still many people, who were involved with the series that are really passionate to work in; have talent and wanted to make it good, but everything has gone to waste, thanks to Anderson. Say whatever you want about Milla Jovovich, but at least she is trying and i do believe that she can be a good actress, if you give her the right role, but all of the time, she gets roles that are very weird and questionable and her acting most of the time ranges from bland to wooden and for that reason she can't prove that she can be great. The obvious problem is the direction and the script.Overall the Resident Evil live-action movies is a series that i don't hate, but it's frustrating of what it has become: a generic action movies that are disguised as Resident Evil movies and are disrespectful to the series that is based on. You can still find things that you may like and appreciate the action sequences, but for me - it's impossible, because of how poorly edited they are. Those movies may be bad for many people in different ways, but believe me: it could have been worse. We should be thankful that Uwe Boll didn't got the rights of the series.Even with it's huge flaws, i still recommend it to everyone, who are interested of seeing it, even to people, who are like me that love movies and consider them as art, but if you want to see a decent adaptation of the series, then watch the CGI animated Resident Evil movies. Even though they're not perfect and are still flawed, they are way better and are set within the same universe as the original video game series.There is something that it needs to be clear: i have my very own rating system and usually i add the real ratings in lists of best and worst movies, so that's why i don't write them in reviews, because it mean that i have to write review for every single movie ever made and that can be very exhausting. That's the reason why i don't do it. Just so you know: Resident Evil Apocalypse is the one that stand out the most for me and i do consider it the best in the series, but that doesn't mean that it's good. So here are the ratings of all six movies:
1. Resident Evil (2002) - 2.3/10 (2/10).
2. Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004) - 2.7/10 (3/10).
3. Resident Evil: Extinction (2007) - 2.5/10 (2/10).
4. Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010) - 2.3/10 (2/10).
5. Resident Evil: Retribution (2012) - 2.3/10 (2/10).
6. Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2016-17) - 2.4/10 (2/10).",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
109,RoboRabbit89,Weak finish to the series.,3,22 March 2018,"Where do I begin, well we finally made it to the end of the series.
It's underwhelming at best,but it is the end, and I'm glad it finally
finished.
Milla jovovich is back with Ali Larter, the only other actor from 
the previous films to return for the last film surprisingly.The story, Alice has 48 hrs.to find the anti-virus and save the world
before it's too late to save humanity (Something like that).This film is just OK, but what makes it lack is both the cinematography
and story. First off, there is too much shaky cam, now hand held is OK
but this has a lot of shaky cam which is distracting. But luckily it's mostly
shaky at the beginning and less shaky (still shaky but less around 30 minutes)
so you can actually see what is going on, which is good.Now on to the story, the story is just plain lazy from what I remember
the film completely ignores Extinction by disregarding the plot device
that her blood is the cure to stop the T-virus, but in this film the antivirus
is use to stop the T-virus? Why? This makes no sense at all, and why set
up that Alice's blood is the cure, if Paul Anderson the director/writer was
going to use that plot device why wouldn't he just pay it off in this film?
I don't understand why this was so hard for him to write that in this one,
but this series is full of inconsistency's like that, simply lazy writing that's
why.On to the good news,Milla Jovovich has never looked better she looks
great in her black sports pants and tank top and for the first time she has
boobs and I would say an A-cup and she has nice cleavage but she went
into this one after she gave birth to her second child and her first child plays
The Red Queen, who for some reason is now good? Ali Larter doesn't get
to do very much but I'm glad at least she was in it.Overall a so-so finish to the series, but it cold have been better, manly in writing,
but if I were you I would go into this with caution because many have expressed
dissatisfaction with it including my one of my buddies.I give it a 3/10. I still like it, but it does lack and I'm at least glad it's finally finished.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
110,spmact,What a mess. Basically disregards previous films. Not a fitting end to the series.,6,13 August 2017,"Where do I even start? I was looking forward to this instalment and had hope that this would be a nice farewell for Alice and her story. While the past films were never what I'd call ""quality"" cinema, they were a guilty pleasure and fun to watch. This film undoes much of that.It basically disregards what happens in the previous movies and tries to rewrite the past. What happened to the cool setup at the end of the last movie? Nothing, that's what. What happened to Wesker's powers? Gone. What happened to Alice's powers? She still has the T-virus but it basically does nothing for her. She's the same as she was in the last movie when she didn't have them. It also changes who the creator of the red queen was and what happened to him. It's as if the writer didn't like what was done in the previous movies and wanted his own take on the story instead. But wait a second, it was the same writer!Don't even get me started on the editing. Every action sequence is just a series cuts so fast that can't tell what the heck is happening until it's over. This is a movie you watch for the action sequences. Why butcher them like that?The ending is also disappointment. It tries to be clever with its twists and reveals but you see them coming the whole time. It undoes any of the weight that Alice's sacrifice would have had. Just lazy writing throughout. I wanted to give it a lower than 6 score, but Iain Glen's performance kept me from doing so. He was the best part of the movie - even though his inclusion in the film was just as lazy as the rest of the movie. No doubt they wanted to bring him back because of his success on Game of Thrones, but not even he could save this film.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

112,rchosen-193-5535,Biggest flaw? Editing/Jump cuts. Felt lost! Mind you I am a fan. (SPOILERS),5,31 January 2017,"I always have loved these movies. Yes they aren't like the games and I'm fine with that. I have always rated these movies around a 7. But this one was the worst. Admittedly like the past movies your confused at times at things that are going on since the past movies sort of are all over the place and random. Still a fun movie to see. But what ruined this for me was I couldn't watch/see most of it. In American movies we are used to battle/fight scenes having jump cuts (show a gun punching, switch to another angle of the punch hitting a person, switch to another shot of guy falling down...etc). But I think this movie has the MOST ridiculous amount of jump cuts. So many so that the you couldn't really tell what was going on because your brain is yelling ""ERROR"". For example early on there is a outdoor fight scene by a bridge when Alice is walking to a motorcycle. People appear and every 10th of a second there is a new jump cut to a different angle. There had to be about 100 cuts within less then 30 seconds. Sure you see the end result but its so overly cut that you cannot see what happen in your head because the cuts were so fast. And since about 80% of this movie is action, you cannot see most of what is going on. Its very frustrating. So for me that was the biggest reason for my score. The others were based on the TERRIBLE ending. While there was a great twist close to the end, the way the final ""bad guys"" of this movie die are lame and make you feel like you wasted your time since you expected some big spectacular deaths. On top of that the whole (massive spoiler) thing with Alice not dying from the antivirus was BEYOND stupid.I mean these movies always had silly plot holes that left you confused. But there is a line between ""I can ignore that stupid plot hole!"" and ""This is SO stupid that even a little kid would notice!"". How did it not kill her? I mean seriously. Red Queen tries some silly line like ""Oh well you just got better cells!"". Really?!? Which brings me to the next problem with the anti-virus. How come in the last scene there are the t-virus dragon things still flying around?!? Apparently the t-virus is picky about who it kills. Also why does she say shes not done yet? Thay say its the last movie and killing all the t- virus on the planet would make you assume so. Heck even umbrella is now totally gone. So what does she have left to do?I mean I am fine with another movie. But I really feel, as the kids say today, trolled. Was this just a fake title to the movie to get people to see it? Ugh. If your a fan go see it with caution. Or maybe just rent it so you can use slomo on the action scenes to see what happens.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
113,StregaAsuka,Is it really the final Resident Evil?,5,18 February 2017,"Why should we watch this movie? Because it is (hopefully) the final chapter!!? I still don't believe it though, the cash machine wants to keep getting money. Plink! Plink! Plink! I must confess that I don't remember what happened on the previous movie, or the one before that.. Really sad, I know, but if they were not good, but entertaining our brain should be able to remember them, right? The same would happen to this one if it wasn't the final installment of the saga, which will make us remember how the story ends.Through many movies we have witnessed the fight of Alice against the zombies and in this one the fight comes to an end, or is it? The plot is better than the two previous ones, as there is (finally!) and objective that the heroine has to reach, but while in all the previous movies there wasn't a final aim, a final reason why all this has happened, only vague information or information enough for us, in this one we are explained everything. And I mean everything. And by learning everything, everything gets disappointing, because it's not something special or something stunning, it's something really boring and not original at all.So the story has been going on and on, and the fighting sequences have become more spectacular, and bigger, and louder, and now that we are reaching the final point, they are still good, but at some point they might seem too normal for our liking; even though that there is a recall to some fight scenes from the very first movie (which was the best by the way).A film for fans who want to see how it ends (does it?) and expect to see old characters return, which is always a plus, and who expect to be given a proper explanation for all that the Umbrella Corporation did, although it might differ of what they were provided on the previous installments of the saga.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
114,cheighlee,"Last two movies were bad, this one is somehow worse",1,19 March 2017,"Right of the bat, movie doesn't show that huge Washington battle from the end of the previous movie. Then it retcons so much, that it basically erases second movie's plot from existence. T-Virus origins, and all that, simply retold in crappy flashbacks and too much narration are substantially changed. Plot is stupid, complicated and all over the place, characters are horrible, action is garbage, everything is censored and not gory, acting is sub par on most occasions. ""Twist"" is also whatever. Effects are also crappy. Well everything is. I've managed to watch this from the third try. It was that dumb and dull. I almost feel sorry for the actors in this, but then again, bills gotta get paid, people have to eat, pay rent, provide for their families.Supposedly this is the last movie in this production, franchise and all. I really, really hope it is because this last movie was just awful. One before this movie, Retribution, was horrible, but this one is just sad and empty garbage of a movie.But then again, I'm afraid that we're not seen the last of this yet. Because here's the thing - Resident Evil movies have this knack that they somehow cost less and less or about the same to make but earn more and more as they get churned out. Apparently this movie's cost was around 40 million $, but it grossed worldwide around 300 million. That's about eight times the initial investment, and SONY (Screen Gems) and Capcom are not gonna throw that money away just like that. Now listen, I actually liked the first movie, it wasn't like the games, just copy and pasted one those. It was an original movie set in RE world. And that was cool. Second movie expanded a bit on that but wasn't that good of a movie. Third one did some things better (characterization), some not (plot and story mainly). But after that, it's tasteless wasteland.Would I like to see another Resident Evil movie? Not really, like ever. But if I must, at least make it a complete reboot and do it competently and with some more purpose than just to make money, everything else be damned.Do i I recommend RE: The Final Chapter?

This movie is that bad and is an insult to fans of the previous movies. Were you hoping for the big battle teased at the end of the last film? Well sorry to tell you, they do NOTHING with it in this. All of the characters Leon, Jill, Ada and Becky are not in this film. And nothing is mentioned at all as to what happened to them. Did they die? Or are they missing? Well you don't find out. Alice doesn't even mention them in the film.The retconning which happens in this movie is absolutely garbage and makes no sense to the previous movies. It's like Paul WS Anderson forgot he was involved in the storyline for all the movies and disregarded most of the plots from the other films. Not only does it make no sense it leaves open that many plot holes, you cannot make sense of any of it in you head. Try as you might you cannot make the storyline work. And no explanation is given.The editing on the movie is the worst I have ever seen. You cannot tell what is happening in any of the action scenes as it is cut so fast using multiple angles it just ends up as a blur and you have no idea what is going on. The editor should never be allowed near another film again.Alice returns for her last battle against Umbrella. Some previous characters from other movies return. Wesker and Claire. Claire went missing with her brother at the end of the fourth film. Nothing is mentioned about her brother Chris. Or they're friend K-Mart. This is the final film and we get no closure on the characters Chris, K-Mart, Leon, Ada, Jill and Becky. So six characters in total we don't get to find out there fates. Piss poor writing by Paul W.S. Anderson.The Red Queen A.I from the first film makes its return. And this is another example where a retcon happens with no explanation. The whole truth about Umbrella comes out in this film, but don't try and make any sense of it. This is another major retcon of the previous films and is explained really badly in the film.It is just an awful film all round and is a travesty of a film. No loose ends are tied up except for Alice. And even that makes no sense. And other characters in the film are pointless and are not memorable in any way shape or form.They should have not made this movie or they should have waited another year or so to write a decent coherent script and try to get the previous actors from the films back. As it is, this movie was rushed in every way.A highly disappointing film and is one of the worst finales ever to end a film series.

123,pedroquintaoo,The fans will love it,7,28 January 2017,"I'm a big fan of the Resident Evil's films, so I decided to see this movie but I was with low expectations because I didn't like the trailers and the idea of kill almost all the characters of the previous installments.Resident Evil: The Final Chapter opens with Alice telling what happened in the last films and then we see a good action scene between the main character and a monster, in the ending of that scene, the red queen shows how to save the world.Finally, we can see a perfect mix between action and horror, there are a LOT of good and thrilling action scenes, a lot of jump scares and some violence. RE Extinction was great in that too, but in my opinion Final Chapter does it better. I can say Alice is the worthy successor of any action character of the 80s films, she's like a daughter between John Rambo and the Terminator. The plot is good, has some intense scenes (the ventilation/blower scene is my favorite) and there are no boring moments, although we an find some little plot holes, the editing is a bit messy and neither the all good action sequences or can help us to forget the absence of the previous characters.Good points: The epic action scenes; The scary moments; The ending is great;Bad points: The zombies aren't charismatic or even scary. There are some plot holes; The editing could be better; The lack of some characters;Final opinion: This new Resident Evil film is one of the best movies based in video games, but has some defects as the editing, some plot holes and the lack of characters such as Chris Redfield, Leon S. Kennedy, Jill Valentine and Ada Wong. However, we have a good story, epic action scenes, jump scares, some mystery and Milla Jovovich. Paul W.S.

124,UnderworldRocks,Thank goodness it is finally over!,1,10 January 2017,"Undoubtedly, Paul W S Anderson made this franchise for his wife, who plays the Mary Sue character.This explains everything. This is why the story is getting weaker and weaker, and why Mary Sue Alice is the only character that does anything, and the others just follow her around like idiots. This is why Rola bites the dust after one line. This is why the Korean guy can't beat Alice, because she is played by the director's wife. This is why Wesker is reduced to a retard wearing sunglasses, etc, etc.Forget about storytelling. Focus on mindless actions, and you might get mildly entertained. Personally, I yawn at the action scenes. They are boring. Of course, Mary Sue never dies. The Umbrella soldiers, the Korean guy, the guy who played Gawain in Merlin, Wesker, Isaacs... all those who mess with the director's wife will bite the dust.And of course, Anderson and Jovovich lied through their f...king teeth. The movie is NOT scary.Such a betrayal of the original games. Watch Capcom CG movies, Degeneration and Damnation, and the upcoming Vendetta. They are the real Resident Evil movies, unlike Paul W S Anderson's abomination franchise that bears the game series' title and possesses none of its spirit.PS: Anderson should make BloodRayne movies, because then there would be a competition to see who is the worst director on earth, Anderson or Uwe Boll.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

126,SteveResin,A Biohazard For The Brain,4,26 March 2017,"The Resident Evil film franchise got off to a terrible start as far as I'm concerned way back with the first in 2002, when for some inexplicable reason they decided that the protagonist would be a ""new"" character that doesn't even exist in the games. Who the hell thought this was a good idea? They then hired and sacked George Romero, so after these two dreadful decisions the only way was down.To be fair, the first 5 films are not terrible, just decidedly average. The kind of films you've completely forgotten about a few days after seeing them. But a pleasant enough way to pass 90 minutes on a boring night. I even thought the 5th instalment was the best of the series, so I was quite looking forward to seeing how they would wrap it up with this closing chapter.I wish I hadn't bothered. Aside from the absurd storyline, terrible hammy acting and appalling dialogue the directing and editing is just painful. The action scenes (and 95% of the film is action scenes, to the detriment of storytelling and character building) are cut so manically that I was convinced at one point I was having a seizure. I'm not sure if the director and editor have ADHD but they should get themselves checked out just in case, because this was the worst overload of the senses I've ever experienced.The storyline is so thin you could roll it and smoke it. Alice returns to The Hive at Raccoon City to release an anti-virus to destroy the T-virus and save the world. Hot on her heels is the evil Dr Isaacs, who is now a cyborg or bionic clone or something equally as absurd. There's an awful, awful scene where he uses his er, um, ""implants"" to calculate whether a bullet shot from close range will hit him or not. You know, as the bullet is traveling towards him. He calculates his chances are good and DODGES THE BULLET. I wish I'd dodged this bullet, that's all I can say. Iain Glen is just terrible here. He keeps cracking his neck to the side every time he does something evil, because you know, that's what evil types do. Speaking of awful scenes, there's also the hilarious sight of an aged Milla Jovovich in a wheelchair trying to act wizened and frail It's absolutely hilarious and the worst acting and scene from the entire franchise, including the games and those terrible voice actors from 1996's RE. Half the character didn't even return for this movie, there's no Jill, no Chris, no Ada Wong. They probably sacrificed themselves to a licker rather than appear in this crap. It's so crap one character even dies at the hands of a fan. Fanned to death, imagine that.Dreadful stuff, and not even in a ""so bad it's good"" way. Let's hope this really is the end of the franchise now, because like Wesker and the zombie horde it just needs putting out of its horrible misery.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

However, I've watched every single one of them.For RE: The Final Chapter though, I couldn't stand it. I haven't watched the entire movie. The editing is a bit on the strange side and makes it hard to actually watch the movie. It moves to flash, too many cuts, too many changes of perspective. From a stylistically perspective, it makes perfect sense but from a movie making one, it is just hard to follow.After 45 minutes, I couldn't actually understand the plot and while there are nods to the other movies, the movie did a poor job of actually explaining who is what and why they are doing what they are doing.Look ... Resident Evil was never a masterpiece in the scenario department. It was mindless fun.

It cause nausea and confusion for viewers. No one really know what really happen during the action scene until either the good guy or bad guy dies. Man it is just so stupid. If you want to make it a spectacular action scene, then just follow the camera style in ""300"" movie or ""Matrix"" movie.The plot itself is so out of context. It has no relation to the previous movie. Many viewers are hoping to see the final war between humans and zombies in Washington D.C, as it was in the ending scene in the previous movie. But somehow, someone had the most idiotic idea and make an entirely new one. That person should be fired as well.On the other hand, the environment and monsters are great. The prologue is great.

They're silly, OTT fun, and personally I get a kick out of them. Story-wise The Final Chapter isn't bad at all. It kicks in and becomes more interesting in its second half, and is a reasonable conclusion to the series. Sure, the movie isn't going to win any awards for the story, but it's action adventure fun!Having said that, somebody, Paul especially, should have chucked out the editor and started from scratch. Paul's previous films have been some of the best 3D films going (Musketeers especially stands out), and he can create great action scenes (Soldier, for example, is an underrated classic). The Final Chapter, however, has been edited to the point of death. The 3D is rendered pointless due to the hyper-quick editing used here. It's so pointless, that even as a fan of 3D movies, I'm only getting the 2D version for home (and I own the previous two in 3D). Even the 2D version is going to be annoying enough in the action scenes, and I have little doubt I'll end up only watching The Final Chapter to finish off things when I have the occasional RE marathon. Not because there's anything wrong with the story or acting. Just the damn editing!Please, please, Paul, for the sake of the fans who enjoy the RE movies, do a special edition edit for Blu Ray release! The footage is obviously there, it's just been butchered in the editing room! Re-edit the film, so that we can actually tell what's going on in the action scenes.

The decision to throw in all the excess grunting by Milla was just bad. I was getting a hernia just listening to her. It has been in all the Resident Evil movies but this one seems like it was even more than the rest. I get trying to make something sound realistic but this was tiring listening to all the loud grunting in every movement she made. Was just unnecessary and took away from the movie. She is supposed to be a bad ass in the movie but her sounds of anguish at every blow made her sound like a wuss. I know it's Hollywood and all, but c'mon.

The first by far is still the best and superior bringing elements of action, sci-fi, and horror along with a good story to follow. Whether this is truly the Final Chapter or not I doubt it.

A couple of them are actually below average, looking at you Apocalypse. There is no reason to think that Resident Evil: The Final Chapter would be any different. It's not a bad movie, it's just that they stray too far away from the ideal storyline way too much. The main thing with this movie is that they strayed too far away from the source material. There's only two characters in the movie from the book. Granted, Iain Glen's character is based off Spencer from the games, but still. There was no reason for the lack of game characters. Then add in the fact the movie had a major dark undertone. There were a couple of times I was having trouble seeing what was happening. I would get a few flashes of light then it would go dark again. The acting was okay for a zombie, because that's what this movie is. Just a zombie movie. You can't get anywhere with limited direction of what to do. Nothing new, but nothing really that old either. Paul Anderson needs to move on from the series. Rumor going around is that someone is in the wings waiting to make a more faithful adaptation. Anderson needs to let it happen. He took the series as far as he could. If you've watched the rest of the movies go ahead and watch this one. If you haven't, but you like zombie movies, start watching now.

138,terrorfirmer-ie,Absolute dreadful ending to an entertaining franchise,3,9 February 2017,"I've always felt that since 2004's Resident Evil: Apocalypse, the franchise has been slipping badly, but I enjoyed Afterlife and Retribution at face value - brainless, but highly entertaining high-octane action. Sadly, nothing could have prepared me for how awful 'The Final Chapter' is. Firstly, the film is edited just unspeakably badly, which makes following action scenes nigh-on impossible. Some scenes, quite literally, have a dozen cuts in a single second and as a result it's often impossible to tell what's going on, who's getting shot, punched, stabbed or bitten. It honestly is criminally bad, I hope whoever is responsible is blacklisted from the industry for this garbage. The real crime however is the story line. Paul WS Anderson did not direct all the movies granted, but he certainly wrote them all. The films have never been great for continuity in some of the milder aspects of the plot across the franchise, but this one takes the biscuit. Paul has decided that he wants to tie the film up a certain way for the sake of convenience and big plot twists, and in the process takes a steaming dump over the canon established in 1 through 5, particular the first three movies. Yes, the movies he himself penned. Resident Evil: Apocalypse explains where the T-Virus originated, who created it, why, and for whom it was developed. 'The Final Chapter' ignores this and creates an entirely new story. The origin of The Red Queen, also explained in the second movie, is also retconned and given a new backstory. The first movie explains how the T-Virus escaped, the second chronicles Umbrella's attempt to contain it, and the third, their efforts to develop a cure. 'The Final Chapter' ignores all of that and declares that Umbrella deliberately released the virus, a motion expressed in a laughable scene where the board of directors casually get on board with this very strange sales pitch - ""The worlds screwed. Let's pull a Noah's Ark and start again."" SERIOUSLY, Paul WS Anderson?Oh, I almost forgot, apparently the 'new world order' is hiding beneath The Hive in Raccoon City in cryogenic suspension, waiting for the reboot of the world - so I guess it made perfect sense in Apocalypse to fire a GOD DAMN NUCLEAR MISSLE DIRECTLY ON TOP OF IT. The whole thing renders the narrative of the other movies largely null and void. It's beyond absurd. It's like someone was given a 30 second synopsis of the Resident Evil franchise and given two days to write the script for a final movie. And they also really screwed Wesker over - in Afterlife he's an almost immortal super soldier, in 'The Final Chapter', he bows out in the most ridiculously convenient, stupid way without putting up any sort of a fight - and his previously seen super-powers courtesy of the T-Virus are neither present nor mentioned. The flow between this and Retribution is also atrocious - remember that epic stand off with the remnants of the US military, the main cast, good guy Wesker and the undead hordes at the end of that movie? This movie picks up in the apparent aftermath of that battle, but fails to explain any of it, why the entire main cast is missing, what Wesker motives were for apparently betraying them (Seriously, Paul, why did Retribution even exist as a movie if Wesker was just gonna change sides again, and off screen I might add?) I could have lived with it if the intro had said something like ""Wesker betrayed us at the White House, and in Washington DC I saw Jill, Chris, Ada and Leon fall with the last remnants of humanity"" - job done, we all understand that actors are unavailable sometimes. But to just sweep it under the carpet like it was done in 'The Final Chapter' like it's no big deal is just utterly lazy! I mean, Claire meets Alice in Raccoon City - yet neither even mention Chris in passing!? You might as well have not seen the first five movies because this film ignores most of them and the plots contained within. It's more like a re-boot, if you could say such a strange thing about the 'Final Chapter' in a six film franchise. This greatly irked me - massively so, in fact, it left me feeling really angry that Mr. Anderson would think so little of the fan base of the movie franchise. This film is more like a 40 million dollar fan-fiction translated to the big screen, it doesn't make any sense in the context of the series up until this point - none whatsoever. I wanted to like it. I love the first two movies, third is decent, Afterlife and Retribution slide a lot but hey, it's Resident Evil. But 'The Final Chapter' is absolute garbage of the highest caliber that Paul WS Anderson should be absolutely ashamed of, it's a disservice to the franchise, to film, to the fans. The only aspects that deserve a nod are 1) Iain Glen, strong performance and 2) Milla....she's still Milla and a kick-ass Alice. I've been angry about the damn movie since I saw it a few days ago, it's like a persistent, niggling itch that simply will not die. Maybe by writing this review it will serve as a purge and I can move on....",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

The tone of this movie was all over the place as well, the rest have a nice blend of action and horror but this one kept shuddering between the two. There was even points where they tried to add suspense but it was Alice in danger.... really? Yeah I can completely see her getting taken out by one surprise zombie after 6 films. Speaking of zombies, they all get defeated with little to no effort. The visuals for them as well the only one I enjoyed was where one looked like it was the size of a bear then went to being the size of a dog, it just shows the editors couldn't be bothered to watch it.

141,rolandjordaan2,Resident Evil: The Final Chapter - Spoiler Free Review,2,14 September 2018,"This movie pissed me off more than I was expecting, and I'll tell you why: because somewhere in this mess, there was actually the potential for a pretty good final chapter; well it's called 'The Final Chapter', but the fact that it leaves itself open for another sequel kind of makes that point moot, doesn't it? Now obviously this is a Resident Evil sequel, so anybody walking into this, has a pretty good idea of what to expect; what I wasn't expecting were some pretty clever twists and writing, which in parts, actually caught me off guard. So then why did this movie still upset me? Because this was one of the hardest movies I have ever had to watch in my life, seriously, whoever the cinematographer and editor was on this film should be blacklisted and forced to make episodes of Teletubbies, because that's how badly they screwed up. Blair Witch, Cloverfield, Paranormal Activity...all a million times easier to follow than this movie; there are scenes where main characters are killed off (and by main character I mean cannon fodder, with a few lines of dialogue; with the exception of the returning characters, there are no main characters in this movie), where it is shown on screen, and I literally wouldn't have noticed, if another character hadn't pointed it out afterwards. This to me was a pity, because I wanted to enjoy this movie, hell even though I knew that they were bad movies, I still enjoyed the previous five, and I guess I still enjoyed this one too, but I wanted more. I wanted 'The Final Chapter' to actually be the final chapter, and I wanted this franchise to go out with a bang - and this movie just didn't give me that.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

145,roblesar99,"""Doobie-us"" Editing Pushes Incomprehensibility to New Heights",2,3 July 2017,"""My name is Alice, and this is my story. The end of my story.""Except it likely isn't. Because writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson doesn't know how to tell how a story. Because Anderson refuses to give Milla Jovovich's Alice the ending she deserves. And because this film made way too much money at the box office for the corporate heads at Screen Gems to call it a day. Going back to the ending, however, the film's final five minutes completely betray everything that comes before, Anderson seeking the easy way out and preventing the film from even providing a modicum of closure. I haven't seen the rest of the installments in this series, and I likely never will, but the ending of this latest entry frustrates, leaving the door wide open for a continuation despite the affirmation of the film's subtitle that this is indeed, the final chapter. Anderson finds himself unable to provide an ending with something substantial and weighty, choosing instead to succumb to triviality.Perhaps my experience of watching Resident Evil: The Final Chapter can best be described as nauseating. Editor Doobie White should be permanently banned from ever entering a Hollywood editing room for the remainder of his career. There are trace elements of impactful action, most notably in a scene early on that features Alice fighting Umbrella Corporation soldiers while hanging upside down, but White's editing completely obfuscates Anderson's footage, wringing the material free of any excitement. Indeed, the action suffers throughout, especially in the second half. Combined with dimly-lit rooms, White's editing allows for the action to attain a level of incomprehensibility so rarely seen in major Hollywood productions that I hope it remains that way. We don't need to see the action of punching someone in the face from four different angles in the span of a second, and yet White indulges in creating a film free of visual panache, refusing to allow the audience the mere pleasure of being able to watch what's on screen.The film plays as a poor imitation of Mad Max: Fury Road, with White attempting to emulate Margaret Sixel's kinetic editing style. But whereas Sixel retained precise control and restraint over her work, complimenting George Miller's visual storytelling in such a masterful way that she was awarded an Oscar, White instead edits in such a way that the film ends up feeling the product of late-night Red Bull cram sessions, White desperately trying to piece together disparate video fragments in an attempt to meet a deadline that has already passed.Additionally, Anderson himself happens to be part of the problem. While he may be passionate about Resident Evil and these characters, none of that shines through in his writing. Instead, we are merely moved from action sequence to action sequence, with nothing but clumsy dialogue and wooden acting to serve as the intermediary between said sequences. Anderson finds himself unable to determine what exactly he wants to emphasize, whether it be action or horror, and so the film falls flat on both fronts. The jump scares of the first act feel cheap and ineffective, while some of the action in the second and third acts relies entirely too much on CGI. Peppered throughout the film itself are baffling inconsistencies that break whatever suspension of disbelief is already necessary to sit through one of these films. Characters appear and disappear seemingly out of their own volition to the degree that when the first of the survivors bit the dust, I had no idea who she was.The characters that Anderson writes to populate his world are so thinly-written that the performers portraying them could be swapped around to little noticeable change. Indeed, when each of these characters eventually meets their end, there is no sense of gravity, no sense of impact. These characters merely serve as plot devices that demonstrate the myriad of ways that someone can be killed, as conjured by Anderson. Even Jovovich falls flat, unconvincing in the role of the heroine. It's a shame too, because the world these characters inhabit is ripe for potential, for the post-apocalyptic landscape of America can be and has been used to explore a variety of rich themes to comment on society. And while some might point that the portrayal of the Umbrella Corporation can be seen as Anderson exhibiting an anti- capitalist stance, he adds nothing to the argument, seemingly content to regurgitate an idea that has grown stale over the course of six films.Now, I'm not saying that action films such as Resident Evil: The Final Chapter cannot and should not be enjoyed. If you enjoy Anderson's latest, more power to you. But an underrated piece of art misunderstood by audiences and critics worldwide this isn't. Any promise that the film might have is snuffed out because of Anderson's listless writing and directing, White's headache-inducing editing, and the plethora of other flaws present. Indeed, The Final Chapter should make good on its promise and truly be the final one.Rating: 2/10 (Painful)",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

147,fjk1138-731-161881,I hope the series is truly dead,2,30 July 2017,"Oh Resident Evil, how you continue to sink to new lows.I don't know who Paul Anderson bribed, begged, or threatened to get financing for these movies, but whoever it was they seem to be content to repeatedly pay for what amounts to utter crap. Any return on investment is better than nothing, apparently.Having played almost all of the RE games over the past 20 years, I will say that I liked 1-3 the best. Everything else after that becomes more impossible, disconnected from reality, and just plain boring. I would say the first two movies in this series follows suit.This series seems to be more action than horror, and that's where it goes completely wrong. Every opportunity in this regard is completely wasted. For example, there is a scene involving an extremely large ventilation fan that a group of people have to sneak through. Instead of making it a moment of high tension through good editing, etc it just becomes a predictable sequence. Spoiler alert: A secondary character dies.The couple of jump scares were so weak that they do nothing other than start a series of pathetically shot action scenes. The migraine-inducing editing and shaky cam style of filming is so quick that it's nearly impossible to follow the action and discern what is happening on screen. I can't even imagine trying to watch something like this in 3D - it would be an absolute puke fest.The story is itself nonsensical. It's completely beyond reality and otherwise irrelevant at this stage in the series. The plot development is extremely weak and almost all characters are killed off in predictable fashion. There is no character development whatsoever, save for only the main characters, and even that was nothing really surprising. There is no humor to be found other than one extremely minor bit involving the words ""thank you"". The last 3rd of the movie seems to be drowning in its own nostalgia along with a completely overused plot device related to cloning technology.The weak plot allows for all kinds of contradictions that exist to serve the story. Guns rarely need to be reloaded, and the amount of available bullets seems to depend on the scene. I also don't understand how a small team of people manage to obtain so many barrels of gasoline in a world where fuel production has completely stopped. At one point, Alice uses a zip line from the top of a building - considering how far she travels, who had time to set that up and what were the logistics involved in such a task? And how does Alice manage to start a car when the battery should most likely be dead?It's all a shame really. Milla Jovovich is very good as Alice, and I have enjoyed watching her kick ass through all of these moves. Too bad she is wasted on such a garbage series. I just hope she was paid very well for all the extreme physicality she has endured.I only watched this movie in hopes that it would be the end of the series once and for all, and because it just sucks so much at this point. But, just like Friday the 13th, with a subtitle of ""Final Chapter"" the door is left open for more. And since there were statements in the news mere days after this was released in theaters that they may reboot the series, it's highly likely that will happen.I, however, will not be watching.Please, please, please....stop making these movies.Goodbye Resident Evil....Rest In Pieces.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

150,darryl-42069,The most enjoyable of all,8,28 January 2017,"DISCLAIMER: I never played any of the Resident Evil video games. This review comes from a simple-minded movie goer who watch movies for funResident Evil's achievement is truly fascinating. 5 movies, very loosely based on the video game series, all poorly received and yet still making over a billion dollars. With the sixth and the supposedly the final entry in the most successful video game-based movie franchise being released, will director Paul W.S. Anderson can recover from the disaster that is ""Retribution"" and bring a worthy end to the series?The answer: Yes he can.""The Final Chapter"" managed to fix some of the series issues, and as the result, it may be the best entry in the entire series (despite I haven't seen ""Apocalypse"" and a half of ""Extinction""). The story revolves on Alice as she has 48 hours to return to The Hive, in order to retrieve a airborne anti-virus, which will kill any organisms infected by the T-virus, before the human race is all lost. Milla Jovovich, as always brings a fine performance as the main heroine. Ali Larter is also back as Claire Redfield, along with some new faces, including Ruby Rose, William Levy, Lee Joon-gi (My mom's favorite), and many others, all delivers a well-done performance. The action sequences are probably the most intense in the series, and thank god there little to none of the scenes involving slow-mo's (Seriously, ""Retribution"" is ruined because of slow-mo's). The set pieces are amazing, and the deaths of several characters might be the most brutal of all. They also didn't forget about adding some easter eggs RE players will definitely notice.What's surprising, is that despite being the last entry, the writers still manage to deliver one last plot twist. I'm not going to spoiler it tho but it involves with Alice's past. In the end, the climax is well structured and truly means that this is indeed the last one (despite the last scene may indicate otherwise)Despite all the improvement, not all the things in the movie were good. I'm disappointed that the previous characters: Jill Valentine, Ada Wong, Leon S. Kennedy, and others were not invited. Although the movie explains why they gone, it's just a cheap excuse. Some of the jump scares don't work anymore, mostly because it has been spoiler-ed in the trailers. The story was also rushed a lot, leaving no room for character development and a proper introduction to the new characters. The CGI is mostly noticeable, *SPOILER ALERT* And my god, Albert Wesker, what happened to you? You used to be so powerful and now you're so weak? Being said that you're fired and you've lost your legs and died miserably? I'm disappointed of you. *SPOILER ENDS HERE*Overall, the last chapter in the franchise is still a mess, but way more superior to it's predecessors. It's a shame that finally a decent RE movie came after 4, average-to-awful installment (I'm looking at you ""Retribution""), but at least it's good that the series will end in a good note, or so it seems. If you ask me about a new Resident Evil movie, I prefer the series being rebooted and make a movie faithful to the original, rather than making another RE inspired story, or even another sequel to a franchise whose story is pretty much done.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

Starting out the movie was good I made it go down a rating though cause it didn't show how it got to that point from the last movie it just talked about it instead which I was not hoping for but the beginning was really good besides that. The middle was the absolute best it showed so many great expectations and how amazing you can get killing zombies and creatures wise in this franchise it was an amazing middle and showing a few people returning which was really strange at first but still made it good. The end starting out was something I didn't expect cause they told Alice what she was and if you watched this you would know what I mean and that caught me off guard it made me feel like this whole series just was not real for the character I mean so it made me make it go three down ratings cause of that and it just made me not want to watch the rest but I did watch the rest and now it comes to the very end the very end made up for that last one a lot and made it seem like it meant something even though what happened last was something I didn't want to happen but the ending was great I didn't expect it to be made up that good but it was. I hope they would make another one but after that one you know there won't be especially cause of the ending but I loved this series it was an amazing showing of the Apocalypse and showing a story about Allice I hope they remake the series and recast her it would be amazing but I recommend watching it its worth the watch I promise and I wish this series a farewell.,Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
155,lancelong777,Take the Money and Run,1,28 January 2017,"There are so many places this episode went wrong. To begin, the cinematography was so dark that I couldn't make out faces or actions. Next, the script or story or lack thereof was just horrible. My dog could accidentally type a story better than that one. Next was the acting or lack thereof which is sad for me to say because I really like Milla Jovovich. But, in the end you have to question the skills of actors whose only roles for the last 10 years have been sequels or remakes of the exact same film. I do not want to be a spoiler but this film was no different than the ones before it and that is sad. The director and script writer are the same person but the producers would have been better served by getting someone with a better ability to write and film action. But in the end the thing that really bothered me was the total darkness of the film. I couldn't see anything and that was really a bother. Please do not make another film in this evil chain of bad films. I will never see another one of these films and I highly recommend to anyone reading this that they do not waste their money like I and the three other people in the opening did.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
156,ryan-44110,Uh did we forget the previous movies before making this one?,2,10 April 2017,"So this review touches on a few key points significant to this movie's story, but also to the other movies before it. If you don't like spoilers, keep moving. This movie seems to be the last chapter/movie in the series, which is good, because it's like a final nail into the coffin of the entertainment these give off. Unfortunately since the third movie or so, the desire to keep up with the story for me as suffered greatly through the crap plot holes, and poor story line/arcs. I understand that they wanted to include their daughter in this movie, but they basically wrote off the entire second movie altogether. Ashcroft is completely forgotten about, the red queen is a completely different girl (you can probably guess who, once you see her face and hear her real name) and they might as well write off the first movie also as the origins of the T-virus are now completely different and the first outbreak was no longer considered an ""accident"" but it was intended, and didn't occur in the hive. It's like the writers completely avoided following the plot the original movies put into motion, got completely blazed on the good good, and wrote a new story, but still included the main character/villain. I expected a conclusion, and all I had were more questions by the end. Thinking of buying this as a box set movies when it releases? Might as well take the first and second movies out and throw them in the garbage.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

160,scott_dunning,Good effects shame about the story-line,5,15 March 2017,"Let's get the positives out of the way first. The special effects were pretty decent (except for the scene were Alice is sliding down a cable from the top of a building to the ground which just looked ridiculous) and the appearance of an apocalyptic future was really well done and made you feel like we're all f**ked. The acting was OK and on par with the other films in the franchise. The zombie make up was good and the CGI zombies were well done also. Lots of explosions which looked really good. Now for the elephant in the room, the story-line was laughable. Each new movie is supposedly a continuation of the one before making it a complete timeline from start to finish but this last movie completely contradicts the second movie so much so that they completely changed the origin story of some of the major franchise characters. Paul W.S. Anderson just ruins movies left right and centre. What he did to AVP was criminal. I mean the final scene has the main character running around Antarctica in a freaking singlet??

I think the 5th was a decent finale and much like Underworld's Blood Wars this was basically a pointless movie. The only point of Blood wars was that Selene became an elder. The only point in Resident Evil the ""final chapter"" was that the anti- virus could become airborne and end the apocalypse. From start to finish I found the movie dull, rushed, and everything from sets, wardrobe, and characters to be mundane. There was no character development, the fight scenes or lack there of were just okay, and what the hell is up with the Umbrella corporation's religious reasoning for releasing the virus?! How lame was that. Ever since the very beginning the release of the T virus was one big accident now all of a sudden they did it on purpose and to ""cleanse"" the world like God's flood? Give me a break. Resident evil meets Noah's arch? Stupid. Now to go girly for a moment Milla's outfits have become as legendary as the character herself so...big let down there. In 1 the infamous red dress, 2 tactical gear, 3 desert chic, 4 black n sleek, 5 tactical n sexy, 6??? Dirty with a bit of rack? What a let down. Its a movie for hell's sake. Dress her sexier and make up some crap as to where she got the outfit like in 5. Stepping up the outfit would have made it more entertaining and I'm a chick! Imagine how dudes felt. No hotties in this one. Dull finale however I do love this franchise. I've been watching these films since I was 16 years old but like all franchises it just went on too long.

163,aniseprakash,Milla impresses but Paul let has let it down,6,3 February 2017,"Enter the zombie's world once again for one last time (Probably the last I believe). Resident Evil the name that has driven horror for the past 15 years has come to end.The final chapter is better than the previous few installments. Paul Anderson has webbed a fantasy end for this billion dollar franchise. Seems he has done with gore and wants to give it a fantasy finish.The first one hour of the movie feels like a drag. Running away from the zombies, escaping some weird animals and off course Alice's stunts. But, the last 40 minutes might save the movie. Once Alice enters the umbrella's hive the movie takes a different shade. The truth that Alice finds out in the hive will shock the fans (Resident Evil fans) for sure.The movie excels in storytelling, especially the last 30 minutes. At least better than few previous parts. Few surprises here and there has kept the audience hooked up. There is enough horror in the first one hour of the movie to deaf our ears.Though it is OK than previous parts, is it enough for a finale? The movie does feel like a never ending video game in the first one hour. Zombie bites, unrecognizable new species and umbrella employees were pouring in. Off course Alice escapes with ease with just a fraction to spare.resident evil 6The story is predictable and has lot of loop holes. When Alice enters the building with human population one would predict that a team will be ready to assist her, so does it. Though the director tried few stylish stunts and actions, it does feel like a mess at times.Milla Jovovich, the only character to survive the whole series excels again. She is great even after so many years of running and killing. She does what she does every time and off course with perfection. Her fans would love her in the action scenes, her looks haven't changed as well. The stylish poses and the actions were a treat to watch.Paul Anderson has done an average job this time. The action sequences, the gores that follows one after another seems like a forced addition. Though he surprises us in the hive scenes, the first one hour would have been tuned.Apart from the side-lines the movie is a must watch for Resident Evil fans and followers.

164,yolibarvueswag,Resident Evil: The Last Straw (The Worst),2,2 April 2021,"All of the Paul W. S. Anderson Resident Evil movies are bad, but this one is definitely the worst. It's unwatchable. Like, did Anderson watch a Micheal Bay movie? At least Bay's movies are watchable, and they're so bad they're enjoyable. Anderson's are not.For a movie based on the video game series of the same name, Anderson's Resident Evil movies aren't Resident Evil at all. There's nothing in these movies that remind you of Resident Evil. Except the characters. Only how they look. Not how they act. They act nothing like they did in the games. The part Anderson really misunderstands is that Resident Evil is about puzzles and horror, not about action. He completely mucks ups the entire franchise and misunderstands what makes Resident Evil Resident Evil.The Resident Evil Anderson movies aren't bad on their own, except the last one, they're okay if you take out the fact it had anything to do with the games. It's the fact Anderson shoves the Resident Evil title in these movies. If Anderson just called his movies something else, nobody would watch them. That's why he shoves the title in there.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
165,rocky_lifter69,Thankfully Putting The Franchise Out Of Its Misery In Terrible Fashion,2,14 August 2018,"I've long had a strange relationship with the Resident Evil movies. The game series has been among my favorites since I first fired up the original on my Playstation over 20 years ago. Despite the movies never really following the games (save for Apocalypse and some characters/monsters throughout the various movies) I always thought they were ok as dumb zombie action movies. But they were clearly out of steam by the time Retribution rolled around and the time was right to end things. Unfortunately, that end is this incomprehensible mess of a movie.The Plot Issues
Oh where do I even start with this? I understand it being difficult to tie together 5 previous movies with numerous characters and plot twists but they clearly didn't care to make things even approaching coherent. For example, they immediately retcon and/or recycle several elements from previous films for no real reason aside from convenience. Remember where we left off the end of Retribution? With Alice being reinfected with the T-Virus by Wesker and seemingly teaming up with Umbrella for humanity's last stand in Washington DC? That's literally wiped away here in the first five minutes. Wesker apparently ""pretended"" to give her the virus before betraying her off screen prior to the start of this. So instead of a last stand in Washington DC we're given a race against time back to Raccoon City because apparently there's an airborne cure which will kill all the zombies and save the human race. Never mind that we've known there's a cure since the original and it's been used in several movies. Suddenly it's the deus ex machine for literally the entire series. But even lazier and most groan inducing is the final twist. Remember Apocalypse (part 2) when we learn the T-Virus was developed by a doctor to help his young daughter walk again, with the girl joining our protagonists? This is actually a nice allusion to the game series as Resident Evil 2's main villain was a mutated doctor who had worked on the virus and had his young daughter as a character helped by the protagonists. So of course they bring it back here... with Alice. Yes, the virus was developed by a father for his ailing daughter, who turns out to be the original Alice. No, not the Alice we've been following for six movies, as we find out *plot twist* she's a clone and has been the entire time. The film series has obviously done a lot with clones in the previous movies but this is such a lame move right at the end of the final movie just for the sake of a supposed big twist. I could continue on about more plot issues but there's no point: this movie is a mess and the good guys win. All you need to know.I'm Sorry, Who Are You?
One nice touch is bringing back several characters for this movie, namely Claire Redfield. But any other character is just there to die. On this front, can someone explain to me why Ruby Rose is such a big thing in Hollywood right now? I don't get it as I have yet to see anything in any of her movies in the way of charisma or on screen magnetism. Granted, her part here was minor at best and could have been played by a million other nameless actors to similar effect. But that is the issue with most characters aside from Alice: we don't care. Even Wesker has nothing much to do in this movie as he plays second fiddle in his little screen time.Can You Focus For A Second?
One frustrating aspect of this movie is the shaky camera work and editing. Segments of this movie feature such rapid fire cutting that it can make it difficult to decipher what is happening in certain action scenes. This isn't an uncommon occurrence in modern action movies but it wasn't present in the previous movies and it needs to stop. Film your action in a way that doesn't confuse the audience and stop having a cut every 1.5 seconds. Even if your movie is garbage at least it won't leave your audience trying to figure out what the hell just happened.Glad It's Over
The Resident Evil film series is better off finished. They always favored more action over horror and while this made some sense when the original came out in 2002, it's course has been run. Despite starting up several years before the recent zombie craze, they quickly faced into the background as loud, dumb, and generic action flicks that managed to not do the series justice (similar to the Transformers movies). The Resident Evil games have their roots in B-movie horror and could easily be rebooted in this vein a few years down the road. As such, it was time for this series to end. As far as this movie goes, it's only really necessary if you want something approaching closure to the film series. Otherwise, this is an easy skip. 2/10",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

But the reason I saw this was because it had higher ratings than the new Underworld movie. What a mistake!I wanted to set aside all my bias towards these movies and just enjoy a dumb/fun popcorn action, scifi, horror, monster movie. Not expecting anything good by any means or to judge, just enjoy for what it probably will be. And I expected the director to go all out with making something better than the last few.But what I went through was utter pain and torture.All dramatics aside, this began by having clichéd jump scares in succession. Just horrible scenes where it becomes quiet, and suddenly something jumps out with loud sounds. Then the action began, which was the absolute worst quick editing I have ever sat through. It was mind boggling how much shaky cam and quick cuts were used. I wanted some action that I could follow logically. But none of it slowed or widened so you could logically follow the chain of events. I made it a point to try and ascertain what was occurring with extra focus and I just could not. It was JARRING! Neurologically painful! And NOT fun or entertaining.And that stupid camera never stopped, even in dramatic scenes. It would pan in a dialogue scene too quickly with it moving and shaking. This whole experience was like being behind the eyes of someone with severe ADHD on a meth binge. And how about the characters! They weren't even trying this time. It was random survival outpost with random post apocalyptic survivors who didn't even have names or characters. Just predictable fodder for zombies and monsters. Then there's Alice, the action hero cliché who can do everything and never dies or slows down, no matter how hurt. Never a sense of being vulnerable, or a empathizing person. I couldn't even focus on the problems with the story over my focus taken by the feeling of being punched in the face repeatedly. I just hated this movie. Everything about it. Every throw away, badly acted line, every scene. Everything. Underworld, as much as I've disliked the last one too, felt like a relief of an action movie by comparison. I respect that there are those who like this series but that can't just be an excuse for something this terrible and jarring.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

-Again the transition between the previous movie and this one is dreadful. They just skip everything. What's the point on leaving a movie on a cliffhanger to then skip what happens in the next movie. It's so dumb

169,Black2White,The Final Chapter... I hope!,5,3 February 2017,"Let's face it. Resident Evil movies have run their course way pass their due. It's two movies away from when it should've already ended.Enough with clones, bad stories, worst plot holes and plot conveniences, and enough with this. End it for good. End Resident Alice. And make a Resident Evil.Nothing actually new is added to this movie. Zombies, Clones, Guns, and Action... Lots and lots of action. The movie can be described in one word. Action!Again we see the return of the infamous AI, that in a really surreal turn of events, possessed the means to save the world from the start. If Alice had been made aware of it, in the first movie, all post movies would never have happened.Which in turn raises the questions... What have the other movies been for? Couldn't they've come up with a more non-creative way of reducing the events of all the previous movies to a series of meaningless events?The movie in the end makes a total 360° turn on the whole franchise and tells the viewer ""Thank you for enduring the ride. Hope you liked being played into a puzzle that lead nowhere else but back to the beginning. Oh!... And you've been punk'd.""I really, REALLY, hope this is the actual end. And not a Rolling Stones move, where they pretend to finally end it, and then they make a comeback when people least expect it.The franchise needs good to great movies. If even the Power Rangers, seem to have been able to make a decent movie, then there's no reason for the Resident Evil franchise to be stuck in this endless loop of ""My name is Alice...""",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

That being said, this poor choice is executed with enough skill that it didn't really bother me. If you can't take the editing, you're not going to be able to enjoy the movie.Other than that, I'd say that this is the best movie in the series since the first one. Some of those ones in the middle were only held together by Milla doing backflips while killing zombies, which never gets old, but this was actually a decent movie. It had a story. The characters had motivations. The acting wasn't half bad. I didn't laugh at any of the zombie monsters.

172,shotgun-69216,The Editing is Murder,4,29 January 2019,"This movie could've been good. Hell, it could've been great. The acting was solid, the writing was perfectly fine, and the CGI was fairly convincing (what you could make out, at least). The biggest problem is how the film can't seem to go ten seconds without cutting to a different angle. Even with dialogue, the cuts are abrupt and fast, making it feel like a fight and artificially increasing the pace of the film instead of relying on good writing and acting to do so. On top of that, it makes the whole thing almost painful to watch.If time had been taken in the editing to have longer shots and better action, with a little improvement on the writing, too, this could've actually been a solid movie. As it is, the editing just ruins it, and the writing, acting, and soundtrack isn't near enough to save it.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
173,wildhunt1-585-849528,A great ending to a great series,9,27 January 2017,"Grade: 9.5/10, AI have to admit, I went into this movie not having a clue what to expect. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. If you liked the other Resident Evil movies, definitely check this one out. If you didn't, you won't get anything new or different here, so don't waste your time.Plot: 8/10 Typical fare. Alice has to stop the Umbrella Corporation. Duh. But at least in this movie, they finally told us what's going on, what's been going on, and why the world had to die. And it makes sense in the world of Resident Evil. We also got more info on Alice, which was a nice bonus.Character Development: 10/10 I was surprised by how well they finally developed the Alice character, turning her into more than just a zombie killing machine. She still pretty much remained that throughout the movie, but getting her backstory really helped flesh her out. We also learned a bit about Dr. Issacs, who we have not seen since the third movie, and how he plays into everything. As for Wesker...well, he was just Wesker. All the other characters were pretty much cannon-fodder, though.Direction: 10/10 Paul W. S. Anderson is probably my favorite director. I know he doesn't make Oscar-winning movies, but that's actually a good thing in my opinion. He makes the types of movies I really like the watch over and over because they're fun and entertaining. I'm glad he came back to finish off the RE series, and he left it on a high note.Casting: 10/10 I liked all the actors in this movie. It was perfectly cast as far as I was concerned. Milla Jovovich and Iain Glen played well off each other.Acting: 9/10 For this type of movie, the acting was about what you would expect from everyone involved. Still wasn't good enough to be a 10, so I knocked it down a bit.Cinematography: 9/10 The movie looked good. I don't know if they didn't use shaky cam or if I'm just getting used to it, but it didn't seem as bad as I've seen in recent years. CGI creatures looked good, too.Music: 10/10 Love the composer. He usually does the Underworld movies, but this was his first RE movie, and he did a good job. Did miss TomandAndy a bit, though.Pacing: 10/10 This movie did not stop or slow down for an instant. When the end came, I could hardly believe it.Sets and Costumes: 9/10 Only reason I really knocked this down a bit was because you could tell they had to rebuild the Hive sets, and everything didn't seems to completely mesh with the first movie. Wasn't terrible, but it was enough to make me take off a point.Enjoyment: 9/10 I love the Resident Evil movies. I do. I can watch all of them, just not repeatedly. I can't wait to add this movie to my collection, though. And I'll probably see it a couple of more times with my free passes.Ranking the Resident Evil movies:Resident Evil: Retribution: 9.7 Resident Evil: The Final Chapter: 9.5 Resident Evil: 8.9 Resident Evil: Extinction: 8.9 Resident Evil: Afterlife: 8.8 Resident Evil: Apocalypse: 8.3",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

The way the movie was cut is awful and the fighting keeps skipping from one shot to the other so fast that you have no clue what is happening. At one point I was sure Clair was dead because of that.I cannot find one good thing about this movie. First of they took the Mutalisks from Starcraft for some reason and put them in this. Secondly, they destroyed any semblance of continuity. If you have watch the others, nothing apply to this. If you are going to finish a series of movies and suck at it at least fallow your own story.Stay away unless, like me, have watch all the other and have a hard time dropping shows and movie series.And even so, this will not give you closure just a bad taste in your mouth and a headache.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

177,Ishaan_Bhatnagar,Waste of Franchise - dissatisfaction and disappointment,2,16 September 2017,The final Chapter can be said to be a story-less and plot-less movie made just to conclude the franchise of Resident Evil.

The performances are ordinary and the movie never seem to bang a great farewell. Total dissatisfaction and disappointment.,Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
178,oaspag-71318,A Decent Resident Evil Conclusion - 75%.,7,14 February 2017,"Hi,I got to see this earlier today at the theater...right from the start I put my hopes and expectations bar at the lowest level so I wouldn't be so disappointed. Resident Evil is a good popcorn movie with potential and a large budget (very evident) but it also suffers from serious problems that make it seem much less than it could be. (I'm Resident Evil fan/been playing it since the RE1 1996 on PSX) or characters. I don't take it badly that the Resident Evil films take creative artistic liberties. The camera suffers from the 'amateur shaky cam' look, in every scene where there is movement or action; the action becomes condensed into very rapid quick cuts to illustrate the 'quickness' and create an effect of 'urgency'; like Mrs.Jovovich attacking someone is shown in ultra-fast cuts in a split-second so we can't make anything of what we see; it's just a blur of quick-cuts that are very jarring and 'saccade-like' very rapidly; it does create a great effect of 'speedyness' and increases the power of the action - true; but it's So Fast that we just can't see anything - and this is at least 50% of the film, that's a large chunk of film that is completely visually obscured. As it is it looks a MTV music video by someone who does not know how to hold a camera (very shaky and wild camera - so much you can actually feel sick/want to barf...that much the camera keeps on zigzagging madly and trembling all over the place on top of the fact that the action sequences at sped up at 15 frames/second (rather than 24 fps cinema standard)..it Looks Ultra Sped Up and Blurry Shaky Mess - in 1 second you can see almost 5 Quick Cuts of a fast action movement, that's how fast it is and how headache-inducing/stomach churning/nauseous it can be). The image itself is beautiful and with a deep constant/rich colors. The sound design is fitting and adequate; but it was not incredible either but it did the job for sure. The actors do a good job overall, Mrs.Jovovich is the best as always, and tries her best to make this final chapter better than it appears. Mrs.Larter (Claire Redfield) is back and that's a plus. The other actors are good but very underdeveloped - many get killed rapidly (thus we don't care much for their fate). Dr.Isaac and Albert Wesker are also nice, Dr.Isaac the Umbrella boss is definitely the best antagonist and does his best to inject some villain touch. The little girl who We get a final ending where Mrs.Jovovich learns she is a clone and sees her real self (old person who has progeria) and blows up the Hive (underground Umbrella complex). the effects are truly good and we have a solid bunch of monsters : Cerberus (scary looking undead dogs), zombies, a mutated Hulk zombie, some other creatures like the nasty looking flying CG devil at the start of the film. The film is not scary but tense with some more gorier/bloody moments, But as an action-horror film it really great and does the job, it's a good ride/exhilarating fun... The film does not end (she finds out about her past through flashbacks and feels liberated to finally know her origin) and Mrs.Jovovich rides on into the sunset on her bike after killing all the last zombies with the T-virus, we know there is going to be another one after this/or let's say the door is open for her (Resident Evil is a franchise that makes millions as such it would be doubtful they stop it; just like Batman or Spiderman or James Bond or Star Wars or Star Trek..., they are Established Franchises since Decades, that have spawn countless sequels (Batman has what 50-some 'Batman' films since the 1960s...it's a story that doesn't die) and from the immense money they make- Resident Evil will come back - it is almost Assured. All in all, it was alright and I did have fun watching it (the most important point) as an action film. I just wished it would have been less action-like (but that is what 'sells'), and more scary/horror-like (there was nothing scary in this film except certain gory images from the monster zombie/mutated creatures and the blood splashing by times...but you need atmosphere to scare, any atmosphere was killed by quick cuts, shaky cam, exaggerated action moves (a woman who kills 50 men in a split second quick cuts, nobody 'buys it'), bad enemies (the enemies shoot at her and can't even touch her with a Gatling gun, that's how poor at aiming they are) and an action-like sound score that kills the frightful-mood to make it a upbeat action flick). Resident Evil 1 game, at the source was a Survival Horror Game, a Terrifying one where the characters did not have endless ammo or big guns (like in the films), they struggles (although Mrs.Jovovich does struggle and is a redeeming character, it's just she is endowed with excessive powers (fighting like a Ninja and beating chumps like it's nothing!), also she gets beaten like a pulp yet she gets back up like it's nothing with some scratches (realism is low)...the Resident EVil films franchise completely departed from the Realism/Terror in the games (just like the game Resident Evil 4 became an action game, it then copied on from that particular game, while the first film was much more like Resident Evil 1 - it featured a very scary mansion where the game's lore starts)...So I would say the best films in the franchise are, in order : Resident Evil 1, 2, 3, 4 and this last one. From the forth on it becomes worse, but this one saves the franchise and is better than the last one. Still better/better production value than other horror/action crap-like films that do come out...I give a solid 7.5/10.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
179,onionbagel,The best Resident Evil movie!,10,30 January 2017,"*****If i could go higher than 10 i would!***** After Resident Evil: Afterlife and Retribution, i was a little worried about this one (especially with it being the last), but...IT WAS THE BEST! I usually don't believe/agree with critics, so when they said ""They saved the best for last"" i was a little skeptical (although i wanted to believe them), but DAMN; they were right! Literally from the start of the movie I knew it was gonna be not only better than the last 2, but a near-perfect (it ended up being perfect) movie! It had more suspense in the first few minutes (after it recapped the previous movies) than all the RE movies combined (that should at least please the fans of the games).The movie was literally non-stop action/suspense, and unlike most such movies, it had a pretty damn good story too. It went into further detail and back-story than previous movies, and overall did a good job at ending the series (on a good note).I can sit here and praise this movie all day, but several things would result: i'd bore you, i'd probably end up spoiling it, and then you probably wouldn't want to see it after all; so i'll leave you with this...FINAL VERDICT: This is hands-down the BEST Resident Evil movie (and I thought nothing would top RE: Extinction)! It'll please fans of the games (me), and fans of action/survival/suspense movies (me & my dad). GO SEE IT!!!!!",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
180,white_fire4,Retcon bonanza,2,27 February 2017,"Four minutes into the film, I counted numerous retcons just from Alice's little monologue that she always does at the start of these things. Then of course there are more retcons or just glaringly ignoring things established in previous films, and by the end of this film, if you paid attention to anything that happened in the last five, you'll be sitting there wondering what in the hell was the point of anything in the last five (yes, even the first one) because they basically ignore EVERYTHING.This movie is an excuse for action, nothing more, and the editing, the atrocious, god awful, 90 cuts for a 30 second fight editing kills any enjoyment you might get from said action.What little plot exists basically boils down to Alice was betrayed by Wesker, the white house was blown up, and she awakens under some rubble. She goes investigating, the Red Queen lures her to Raccoon City, and along her way there she runs into Dr Marcus who is, for some random reason, in a tank directing the undead towards the city.Of course, along the way, Alice runs into random people...again...for the sixth time in a row. Helps them, then drags the survivors along with her to go back into the Hive.Overall, the motivations for what happened in general through these movies end up being very basic (destroy the world to reboot it) and the motivations for anything beyond that make NO. EFFING. SENSE.You see - Umbrella destroyed the world and wanted to ensure a small group survived to establish a new world order. All well and good - these people are all UNDER THE FREAKING HIVE THOUGH.And the Red Queen and her allegiances have been altered and retconned so many times through this whole series, to do it AGAIN is just ridiculous. Also, haven't they destroyed Red Queen several times over by now? Oh yeah - that whole ending from Retribution, where Wesker injected Alice with the virus again to give her powers once more? Where the last of humanity was supposedly making a last stand? Yeah, that was all BS. Apparently? None of the films plots make any sense when you try and put them together. Zero. Nadda. Zilch. Don't even try. And don't watch this piece of garbage, there are far better and superior action/gore fests out there.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
181,bajmba,A Surprisingly Fitting End to the Series,7,27 January 2017,"I have to admit that I went into the theater today with low expectations because of the negativity posted on this site. However, what I am finding out about this movie database is that there are two common scenarios. First, a new release will have a 9 out of 10 or something else that is obviously over-inflated. That means fake reviews are easy to post. The other scenario is people who post reviews and give a rating before they have even seen the movie. It is getting to the point that trying to find a reliable rating is hard to do. But I digress.For this movie, I was pleasantly surprised. Of course Milla Jovovich is a strong female lead and she seems to jump from one movie to the next without falling out of character. I liked how the monsters evolved and there was more involved than running from zombies throughout a city for the entire movie. This movie was made for fans and provided a thoughtful wrap up to the series. Overall, I did enjoy it and had a fun time.

Milla Jovovich's final portrayal as Alice is full of passion and grace, and the film ends full circle, thus wrapping up all the films together satisfyingly. Now of course the film isn't perfect. The action cinematography is sloppy at times, and with the film being very ""point A to point B"" there isn't much left to take in story wise up until the very end, but with its nonstop thrills and epic performance from Milla, the film remains entertaining and nostalgic enough to keep you engaged, and with that, it was a truly enjoyable flick. The Resident Evil film series has finally ended, and for many that's a good thing. In retrospective, it marks the end of an era. Video game movies rarely do well, but this one managed to stick around the longest, and I believe it's because it did what the games chose to do, and that's evolve, for better or for worse.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

It started off quite baron, similar to RE Extinction and then went quite dark.I was also a bit disappointed it completely skipped how the previous movie finished. RE Retribution ends with loads of zombies coming toward her, and I would have loved for the movie to pick it up from there.But those are the only negatives. I did not notice too much CGI like others apparently did. Obviously we need CGI to create the mutants and other ""monsters"" of the T-virus.It has its usual unique ""monsters"" and very nicely crafted action scenes battling against them.I also enjoyed how the story wrapped up.

On the plus side that means I can't judge whether the choreography was good or not (probably not, which may be why it was edited it this way).I'm not sure how you can screw it up this bad, but better to just avoid this movie entirely, especially if you are prone to motion sickness or seizures.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

Just wanted to have some mind numbing fun. But this movie doesn't even let you do that. Because of the constant shaking, nerve damaging ways of switching cameras and nausea inducing editing, you can hardly keep up (with whatever that this movie has to keep up with.)There is no sense in the movie, even for a Sci-Fi one where you shut off critical parts of the brain. The acting was bad, the characters were ridiculous and plot holes so big that the entire Raccoon city could fit in it with the underground hive.Have you or anyone in your family doubts that you might be prone to epileptic seizures?

What?...What is the meaning of watching an ordinary Alice who cant defeat a soldier? And we are supposed to believe she managed to do all those skillful actions and killings in the movies for all ten years period...I dont really understand those script writers. They really despised and degraded Alice character they created...What a stupid movie....,Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
193,stevendedalis,"Not understood, but great!",10,16 August 2018,"The film is great. In fact, the majority of the franchises' movies are spectacular. The reason most people disagree is because the storyline can be hard to follow. The writers and directors understood the direction the films were heading. I watched all six movies consecutively, so it was easy to follow the story. However, most watched as the films came out, which would make for confusing cliffhangers and forgotten backstory.Overall, this specific film is a masterpiece. Being misunderstood is not easy, especially when you are a movie.Also many people complain about the editing and effects. ""Why can't they do simple action packed scenes without shaking he camera?""
First off, I have never seen an action scene without quick camera direction changes or shakiness. Second, I feel this adds to the intensity of the scene. Most people writing these reviews look at one aspect of the film, and then criticize it harshly. Don't read the reviews in the first place. Watch the movie yourself, and judge it for your tastes, not someone else's.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
194,KenJoe,Dark Movie,2,8 February 2019,"What I mean is almost everything is filmed in a dark setting. I guiltily admit that i enjoyed greatly all the other Resident Evil Movies, and in those you can clearly see what is going on. I love watching Milla Jovovich fight and kill zombies, she is so cool and hot doing that, when you can see her doing it clearly. I am not sure if they did not have the budget to have the lights turned on and make the action and CGI clear and believable or what in this last movie of the series, but watching this movie for me resulted only in eye strain and frustration trying to see what was going on.In my opinion this is a sad and dismal final to a series of movies that I enjoyed and still enjoy watching at least once a year, well except for this one. Disappointing way to close the series.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
195,automorphism,Surprisingly good,7,6 January 2021,"Wow, I've been a fan of the Resident Evil series since the first one came out. I did not play the video games either. I also kind of held off watching this one because Afterlife and Retribution let me down a little. In my opinion, the first three movies were fairly strong because they had cohesive theme in mind: the initial release of the T-virus, what happens in Racoon city, and survival of humanity after the T-virus.Afterlife and Retribution didn't have a cohesive theme, except the vague nefarious actions of umbrella. However, Final Chapter actually comes back with a good premise: the conclusion of the T-virus outbreak and settle it once and for all with umbrella.For my expectations, this film is actually way above average for two reasons. First, the story is quite cohesive and advances well. Second, the fight scenes and action were taken up a notch compared to some of the fights in Afterlife, which had too much CGI. Don't get me wrong. The fights are not on the level of Hong Kong martial arts, but they are fairly well-done. Moreover, the action does advance the story as well. It really feels like someone put a lot of effort into making this film.If there is anything wrong with this film (within the realm of what we can expect from Resident Evil, of course), it is that there should have been a little more character development. There was some time wasted at the beginning of the movie that actually would have been better spent in Racoon city as opposed to getting to Racoon city.In my opinion, The Final Chapter is a solid end to the Resident Evil franchise, roughly on the level of the first three films. Recommended.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
196,collegedude-37028,Incredible and Breathtaking Finale,9,26 January 2017,"The end of the long-running Resident Evil film franchise is here. Resident Evil: The Final Chapter brings Alice, the sole survivor of the onslaught in Washington D.C., to the brink of giving up. She has lost so many friends since this war started and the fight seems to be never ending. That is, until she receives a message from the unlikeliest of places. This source informs Alice that there is in fact a cure and she has 48 hours to return to Raccoon City, make it through The Hive's defense systems, retrieve the cure, return to the surface, and release it. With an old enemy close behind and unforeseen danger lying ahead, Alice (Milla Jovovich) must make one final journey to end the apocalypse.The plot to this film and its twists were far better than all the previous entries. Everything came full circle and once the final piece of the puzzle is revealed, it's simply breathtaking. All those times where there seemed to be plot holes weren't plot holes at all. There is a reason for everything, as you'll see for yourself.There are a few disappointing moments though which I do feel obliged to share so if you want to avoid spoilers, skip this paragraph. Okay, for those still here, here's what I didn't like about it. First, Ruby Rose died way too quick. Ruby's known for her ""tough girl"" roles and for her to die so soon after we meet her was a huge let down. Second, Wesker's death was too anti-climactic. He's been around for a few of the films, which led us to believe there would be a huge showdown between him and Alice. That's not the case, however. The final thing that disappointed me was that there was no explanation as to what happened to Leon, Ada, and Chris. It's assumed they were all killed but it would have been nice if they had at least been mentioned.All-in-all, the film was incredible. It was well worth the five year wait. Everyone gave their all and dove head first into their roles which paid off perfectly. I give the film a total of 3.5 out of 4.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

However, (disclosure) I have bought all the previous films' DVDs and I have been a fan of the film franchise from the start.Mr Jovavich's Event Horizon remains his best film by some margin and perhaps there's no coincidence that it's also one he didn't write. The Final Chapter does suffer from too much dialogue when just the visuals would have sufficed. Just one example among many. ""Target her."" (Guns conspicuously target Alice.) ""Fire."" There is also a tendency for the over used cliché where characters put themselves in danger just for the sake of creating an excuse for an action scene or advancing the plot.But that's forgivable because, I really like his action directing. No, really. Those bits of the film were terrific and he pulled the story around just in time and, in the final 20 minutes, turned me from ""it's okay"", to ""I liked it"".I suspect if you haven't seen any of the franchise before, it'll not stand up to scrutiny, but as closure for Ms Jovivich's tenure, I found it thoroughly entertaining.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

Resident Evil was a one of a kind movie when it was released and this ending does justice to the franchise. I watched all the movies in the series for Alice's character and I wasn't disappointed. A strong female lead played by an awesome underrated actress. The bad guys did their part well too, so did Claire.Movies like these seem more relevant especially with what's happening in the world now.

A masterclass in how NOT to edit an action movie together, shaky cam mixed with overly fast sequencing is enough to give you a headache or at the very least go ""wait whats happening right now?"" it was just so unnecessary and only went to further show the lack of directing ability when it comes to actions scenes, if you cannot get a few second shot during a fight and instead have to splice 100 half second shots together just to get 50 seconds worth of a fight scene, then why even bother?2. The whole plot with wesker ""wesker you are fired"" so now the red queen can take you out.... is so ripped off from robocop and has been done to death, lazy writing.3. And at the end... alice is told that they had to know she was willing to give up her life for others, but honestly what a load of nonsense, alice still could have released the antivirus to save others whether she thought she would die or not, pointless plothole for the sake of adding extra tension with the ""oh but if alice does it, she will die"" then at the end ""nope, you wont"" its like the old ""and they woke up and lived happily ever after"" ending so trivial.Honestly, I didn't mind the first movie, but since then it has just dragged on and on limping along with more wounds with each new movie, this new one was purely to make a bit of cash off of those die hard fans that love trash movie franchises, those that don't care about 1000 plot holes and just want to see something explode unrealistically and see the same actress do all the same stuff over and over again that has already been seen and done in the previous films, I would put this franchise now on par with Underworld, just pointless drivel scripted out in about an hour without any care whatsoever, childlike almost, what is worse is that this film adds nothing to the overall series, its just there for the sake of dragging it out further, would love for it to finally just die off and maybe reboot it, different, with better writers and directors but most of all acting, the lead actress almost acts now like she couldn't care less about being there despite it being the only real franchise that keeps her in work.

What was the point of trying to contain the viral outbreak in Raccoon City? In the third film. What was the point of cloning Alice to find a cure for the T-virus? In the fourth film. What was point of keeping thousands of people on the Arcadia? In the fifth film. What was point of that cloning facility?

Don't get me wrong, I was a fan of the first and second films but for me personally, it went downhill from there .Plus the title is The Final Chapter but they hint at the end of more to come, are you kidding me?!

I've always been a huge fan of the Resident Evil movies. While many think they're cheesy or stupid, I think they have been the only great movies that are based off of a video game. Through the years, Resident Evil has offered up some of the strongest, most bad ass female characters that horror has to offer. The characters Alice, Claire and Jill should all be role models for Hollywood to look at. Looking past characters, the movies have strung together a plot than one should not overlook. This movie wraps up that story in the most awesome way, even adding a twist that no one could see coming. I'm glad that this film brought Claire back after her disappearance in the previous film. The most critical thing I could say about this film is that the shaky cam was pretty hardcore and it could give you a headache after a short while. I'm also disappointed that they didn't bring back any of the good guys from Retribution and that they never explained what happened to Chris Redfield. Even after the criticism, the films are really a treasure and I'm happy with the way the story has wrapped up with this movie. Keep in mind, you have to watch all of them in order to truly understand the story. Now I know this film is titled the ""Final Chapter"" but the ending still left the door open for potential sequels.

The plot doesn't have to be all that advanced; but coherent and at least remotely logical.

This does have a strong female (two actually) character, a lot of action and... nothing else of the above. I won't rack up every plot hole because I haven't enough room, but a) WTF happened between this and Retribution? Wesker gave Alice back her super powers and teamed up to save mankind. Now he doesn't seem interested at all in mankind and is back on his old game to kill Alice and no explanation. All of humanity clearly not saved so...? No.2: Where the f--- did everyone else go? Are they dead? No.3: Alice was infected again but where are her powers? Oh, she can fight but the only super power is taking an insanely amount of hurt and still survive. Now the editing. A strong advise to who ever edit this movie: Don't do drugs. Really don't. They should warn people with epilepsy before they see it.

I mean it was just a little dialogue with a long string of action sequences and special effects. That being said, said events are barely visible because of the abjectly horrible lighting design. The special effects design was lackluster as well. There was NO innovation in pretty much anything. It was the same old, same old. I think most people had figured out whom Alice is by now. I know I did. I don't do the games either. So if there was anything there, it would be unknown to a person like me. It was really no surprise in the reveal. I know I was thinking why did it take so long. I suppose after this many chapters in a franchise, there is the assumption of full character development. That being said there wasn't really anything new here. The new characters were just furniture. I mean you don't go to a film like this for a life lesson or some truth to be revealed about human nature. You go to be entertained. This was not entertaining at all. The editing was schizophrenic.

217,martin-alejandro,Resident Evil 6: The FORGETTABLE chapter,2,27 January 2017,"With a film called the final chapter, you definitely expect it to end in a memorable note, but clearly this film only made its chapter end in a forgettable note. This film is written and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson (who has been involved in all the Resident Evil film series) and it has the same producers from almost all the Resident Evil film series, Paul W. S. Anderson, Jeremy Bolt, Robert Kulzer, Samuel Hadidaso what went wrong. The plot of the film is that Alice (played by Milla Jovovich) is given a mission by The Red Queen, who tells her that she only has a certain amount of hours to retrieve an antidote (found in The Hive at Raccoon City) which will allow her to eliminate the entire disease that infected the whole planet as well as her (Alice). Now the plot doesn't sound bad, but it's the horrible editing style, the lack of story development and character development that prove to be its mayor downfall. The plot of the film was way too rushed as everything (in terms of fight scenes, chase and solutions) happen in a blink of an eye. The editor, Niven Howie, who has edited in the previous three Resident Evil films should have never being replaced in this film. Doobie White, who is the editor of this film, is really one of the worst editors I have ever seen. The film was terribly edited as multiple scenes are showed in just one second. It was like if in 1 second you would see 5 different clips from different camera angles changing in a rush which actually hurts the eyes. This editing style happens in the entirety of this film which causes the story to become forgetful.Now I believe that the producers hired the directors of ""Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem,"" because in the whole entire time of the film you can't see anything as it is completely dark. Not even night vision goggles can help you see in the darkness of this film. This gives me the impression that they couldn't afford the lighting so they just shot everything in the dark. Another important note was that in the past Resident Evil series films, they made a great job in developing the characters, the protagonists and the antagonists. This result allowed the characters' roles to have a purpose in their respective films and to be memorable. However, in this film, the characters are just there to either be zombie lunch or just to become another victim for Alice. They appear for no reason and absolutely have zero character development which makes the entire cast (except Alice) forgettable. Another huge criticism were the antagonists as they never felt like a real threat towards the story. The main villain, Dr. Alexander Isaacs (played by Iain Glen), was not given a lot of personality or character development and it felt that he was just there becausewell he is the bad guy. While, Albert Wesker was another disappointment as they made one of the most iconic characters of the Resident Evil games look more like an extra in this film while also showing him incredibly weak and unmemorable.The only thing I can give praise for this film is its ending that leaves a small smile to your face and the small handful of references that remind you from the previous Resident Evil films.

This movie features seizure inducing fight scenes, intern-generated CGI landscape and smart fire which temperature adapts in function of what it's burning. Evil Tony Stark and Leeloo Dallas have gone to the Sherlock Holmes school of fighting, although they probably fell asleep at some point because their moves are neither entertaining nor efficient looking. Also, Kid Jarvis doesn't understand the difference between downloading and uploading, and nobody is ever able to get a grasp on the complicated concept of time (as in, the difference between 60 seconds and 5 minutes). They are surrounded by generic henchmen, not even alphabetically sorted, and generic sidekicks who might have a backstory (we will never know).There are some nice scenes involving monsters, and Jorah Mormont will probably be forgiven my whomever might his liege be now, thanks to his honorable performance. The rest is sub-par, from the story to the acting and is (and this, I am actually serious about) not recommended for anyone who might experience seizures from too much blinking lights/pictures.

Movie starts after war effects and was skimmed down quite a bit. Also in somewhere middle of movie she meets up with old friend who mentions Arcadia and she was captured after meeting it, that was already in last movie and it ended with all of them ending up in white house so why a rollback? I don't even know. Movie itself was unbearably bad. All last movies had story, characters and actions in sync. This movie had one thing, time 48 hours and get there. That was it. Also seeing how last movies budget was 65 million and this ones was mere 40 million? What happen? Could not get enough money so you made it cheap and easy? Camera shakes a lot, action seemed dull, three bitches and joke to Wesker that he should die already (actually laughed about that and was only fun thing about entire movie) was quite boring to watch. Did not enjoy at all. If i would have known that this movie is so bad i might have skipped it altogether. Kinda SAD to see great series ending with this awful movie. This movie was a MISTAKE.

In this day in age with 5 previous movies within the span of 15 years, you'd think Paul W.S. Anderson would finally learn to write a decent script or even the most basic of editing, but nope not even nearly so. I knew before hand it was going to be bad but the worst film I had no idea what I was in store for. Lets begin with the story remember Resident Evil Retribution? Well that's okay cause guess what, all characters in it are scrapped away and never to be seen again except for Alice(the main protagonist). That isn't even the half of it, remember in Resident Evil Apocalypse when it was stated that Dr. Ashford created the T-Virus in order to help his daughter's disease. Well don't worry about that either that idea is also scrapped. This entire movie, with a plot thinner than Calista Flockhart, contradicts it's own series. There were more plot holes than billions worms making holes in the ground. Next Up, the WORST EDITING I HAVE EVER SEEN! Honestly my heart goes out to those who saw this in 3D. I cannot even stress enough how bad it is. Imagine shaky cam but with extra shaky all over it, and the amount of cuts in the film, OH LORDY! Imagine this for Alice to reload her gun it takes about 15 cuts, I KID YOU NOT! It was so bad there was one seen I was told about that the editing was so bad in you couldn't even tell who had just died. When I saw it I can't even believe they had let that ridiculous cut in there. This FILM IS JUST BAD BAD BAD!

One deus ex machina after another. Plot is completely predictable in that some kind of bullshit is gonna happen and Alice is going to come out alive every time. Movie directly steals scenes from old movies which only reminds you of how RE used to _not_ suck few movies ago. Pacing is horrible, early on, faith of the humanity is predicted hours in advance in order to make the ""ticking time bomb"" plot device happen. After that happens, you can safely skip to last 10 minutes when conclusion happens and plot holes from previous movies are somewhat patched. Everything about this movie is awful, from shaky camera, poor acting performances, somehow much worse CGI than in older movies.

""Running and Killing"" and of course acting.Loved Alice since first one. Paul shot carefully this time and avoided all the fan moments and concentrated on ending the story successfully.It has a good twist at the end.

She and I could think of no one.I called her in to play a game with me. We call it the counting game. Every time there is a hard cut start counting one-one thousand, two-one thousand etc. I've never seen a movie with so many scenes shorter than 3 seconds, in my life. It made following the action sequences nearly impossible, took away any semblance of heart or soul the movie might have had, and makes it extraordinarily frustrating to watch.This movie is an insult to cinema and the director should get out of the business.

228,hydrofilic,Horrifying action flick with a bad script,6,28 January 2017,"This movie begins with a rather lengthy introduction, which is mostly unnecessary. However the end of the intro reveals a pixilated Alice which I thought was a nice artistic touch.Several people have complained about the numerous camera cuts and ""shaky"" video. That worried me before I saw it, but this is not a continuous problem in the film; in the first act, several action scenes do have a ridiculous number of angles in a very brief period, but this is not an issue for the remainder of the film. The ""shaky"" video, I agree, is a bit annoying, but (as before) it only happens in the first act.I would say the problem is inconsistency... quick cuts and shaky camera for the first part, but traditional film for the middle and final parts.There were several ""jump out of your seat"" surprises in this film. And lots of horrific monsters and gruesome deaths. I give this one an 8 for horror.Lots of action too: vehicle chases, running from zombies and Cerberuses, gun fights, and hand-to-hand combat. Score 9 for action.The 3D was good in general, and occasionally very good for ""depth"", but there were no scenes (as I recall) that gave a striking ""in your face"" look. Best example I can think of is Alice shining her flashlight... the flashlight seems to pop out of the screen a little, and I would expect the ""light cone"" to be all up in my face, but it is not so...I enjoyed this movie for the most part, but the script is pathetic. At the end, *SPOILER ALERT*, Alice unleashes an airborne anti-virus which kills thousands of zombies (and herself) almost instantly. I mean REALLY? We all know (anti)viruses take hours (or days) to have a real effect... in fact the epilogue of the film tells us that *SPOILER ALERT* the anti-virus will take YEARS to spread! Finally, I want to say that Wesker had considerable screen time before Alice arrived at the Hive, but then his character basically vanished... I wish there had been more to him. Also Claire had little impact on the story... she is certainly important in the video games, and looks beautiful in this film. I wish we could see as much of her as we did in RE:Afterlife, but sadly we get as little as in RE:Extinction.Other plot things that annoyed me: neither Alice nor Claire had anything to say about Chris Redfield; we do not see what happened in Washington, DC after the previous film (there a few lines of dialog that discuss Wesker's betrayal).In summary, a mediocre action/zombie flick with a disappointing script. I don't see these films for drama/script, but for action/horror... In that department I rate it a B (7 stars).",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

It is not that I didn't suppose even before watching it that it would be bad. I had no better expectations. After all, it is a video game movie, I had seen some or all, I can't remember, from the previous installments
and it stars Milla Jovovich, who is as talentless as she is beautiful.
To be honest with you, I wanted to watch a bad movie. I am working the night shift at an internet cafe and I had to watch something that wouldn't require a lot o concentration. Even the video game theme fitted with my job.
My choice, however, was really bad. While there are movies ""so bad they are good"", this is not one of them, it is just plain bad. Unwatchable, perhaps. Jovovich's awful acting, the shaky camera, the plot that doesn't make sense,
the constant pointless violence and pretentious excitement, will bore you to death.
As if all that is not enough, I have more bad news: Mill Jovovich is on a double role. Good news though, the second role is limited to only a few appearances.

First off let me say i am a huge fan of the games and I like the film series. I know there is no comparison between the two besides the mention of a few characters. After waiting 5 years to see the last installment after RE: Retribution I thought this last would have potential of reviving the series. But what was I thinking it came out in January and most of know what that means for most films. Going in, I thought this film was going to be a fun ride and i'm sure it will be for those who love these films no matter what. But for me it just didn't quiet hi the mark for a final chapter for a series. I was hoping that at least the tone of those film was going to be different from the rest of the films like the first RE film. Lets start with the Good- Alice story arch finishes... Some what. Seeing Milla and Paul W. Anderson play a younger Alice/Red Queen. Seeing Ali Lauter back in action, as well as the up and coming star Ruby Rose. The Bad- Shaky cam throughout the film, bad CGI, But dialogue but if you like the previous films dialogue i'm sure you won't mind. Throughout the movie my friend and I would laugh, because of the awkward dialogue that was shared between characters. The plot is muddled and confusing. I feel like Anderson tried to do what Brian Singer did with X men: Days of Future Past and fix every little plot hole, but he failed. Once again characters where thrown out the window with no explanation. I don't want to spoil it so i wont say who...The Ugly- If this film is truly the way this franchise is going to end i will deeply disappointed and i'm sure you will too. Most of the people in the screening were. This film felt very much like RE Afterlife, so if you don't like that one you probably wont like this one. This film tried hard to channel the tone of the first film with the obsessive jump scares and once again going through the hive but it already feels overdone once you get to the end. Once again written by Paul W. S. AndersonOverall the film really did at its core try to make something out of the final chapter I wont say much cause i don't want to spoil anything but i would recommend waiting for red-box unless you really enjoy the series or want to see an action/ horror film for fun.Overall it was kinda enjoyable but disappointing. 5/10",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

I really like the first one, as the best of them all, and so comes the second and forth, fifth , and third. But this one, can't even be considered a sequence of the movies. It throws in the garbage everything built in the fifth movie, it even goes against the word Anderson had given. In the fifth, Anderson asked the fans what they wanted from the game, and many people asked for Leon S. Kennedy. He was supposed to be in this one too. But since he decided to make this terrible joke, he threw off this character as he did to many others. The ending is terrible. The cure in the air. Well, many anti-virus was in the first and second movie, so it could just have been broken in the air. OK, I know, no logic in all of it. But really, why so terrible ? The part he tried to come back with some suspense from the first movie was OK, apart that it was too little. My rate is 1 out of 10. A terrible ending and plot.

The main thing is that in Resident Evil: Apocalypse we learned the T-Virus was created by a man named Dr. Ashford to prevent his daughter Angie from becoming paralyzed by a genetic disorder, but here they say it was made by a man named Dr. James Marcus to cure his daughter Alicia of progeria. Now some people say that Dr. Issacs suddenly being in charge and giving orders to Albert Wesker doesn't make sense since Wesker was always giving him orders before, but I disagree. Here we learned that the Issacs we saw in Apocalypse and Extinction was actually a clone of the real Issacs. So it makes sense that Wesker wouldn't be taking orders from a clone. However for some reason Wesker didn't seem to have any special powers in this one like he did previously.

247,MrPyroGuy,"Unwatchable pile of crap (video review on my new YT channel ""Rami The Critic"")",2,29 January 2017,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDaU-a8-lvgSo this film is supposedly the final chapter in Paul W.S Anderson's poorly reviewed post apocalyptic horror action franchise based on the video game series of the same name. As the wide majority of movie lovers have already uttered to the world ad nauseum, video game films suck ass. Disposable characters galore and flash without the substance are what we have come to expect from such films; they're really quite impermeable to goodness. So when you expect nothing out of the sixth installment of a milked out franchise and still come out of the theater angry and feeling cheated out of your money, then you know you have dealt with one colossal piece of garbage.This movie starts off with a narration by our main character Alice (played by Milla Jovovich) in which she explains the events of the previous films. Cut to her emerging out of the sewers of a totally decimated and barren Washington D.C. After fighting some dragon-like monster thing, she learns that an antidote for the airborne T-virus that has turned the majority of the human race into zombies exists and is hidden in the Hive, which is at the heart of the sinister Umbrella Corporation. This would mean having to make the journey back to Raccoon City where this whole mess started. Oh and another thing, she's only got 48 hours to save the world. Along the way she meets with some familiar and new faces who are among the last survivors.With ""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"", we run into the same problems that we do with almost every goddamn video game film out there. All the shoddy script ever does is find an excuse to give us chaotic action scenes after chaotic action scenes. We get an overload of those followed by occasional robotic plot exposition that obviously fails to engross the audience or make them care about the situation at hand. So hollow were the characters that I couldn't give a rat's ass whether they lived or they died. Thanks to an unpleasant mix of a pointless action force-feeding and disposable characters, the twists on the mythology by the third act made zero impact. Even the performances didn't truly ring for me either, as the entire cast in my honest opinion appeared to have a desire to just get things over with and collect their paycheck.To add insult to injury, I was not even remotely entertained in the action department. Yes, we do want to see Alice kick some ass and mow down zombies, but does everything have to be so poorly edited? Paul W.S Anderson has a way of rendering potentially pleasing scenes intolerable. There were times where there were literally three to four cuts per second. I couldn't make out what was going on, so aside from the fact that there wasn't anything in this film worth giving a hoot about, I was given a headache almost non stop with these unnecessary rapid cuts.So with excessive and poorly done action sequences, hollow characters, and unsatisfying twists, we can only hope ""Resident Evil: The Final Chapter"" is indeed the final nail in the coffin for this over-milked franchise. The ending monologue suggests otherwise, so we may indeed have to suffer through another one of those messes at some point in the future. Just bad, really crap.My score: 2/10 and that's being nice. Not even worth a dog turd on a penny. Avoid like the T-virus.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

249,timelord1970,Resident Evil: The Final Chapter Delivers!,9,28 January 2017,"Resident Evil movies were meant for the fans who enjoyed playing the video game. If you did not like the game or haven't played it then you are in for a disappointment. We're not here to watch an Oscar winning script. The story-line is not meant to be complicated and we are also not interest in side characters that are introduced in each movie. We are here to have fun. We are here to watch the main character, Alice, to kick some zombie and all other creatures asses while saving the world. No different then the video game.The only thing I wish the previous movies did was not to introduce characters from the game. I think that was my only gripe about the whole series. The fact they introduce Alice as the main heroine and is not part of the Resident Evil video games made it way more interesting. When they started adding characters from the game into the movie it was a let down. These characters are so much stronger in the game but in the movie they were pointless. Don't get me wrong. I love Ali Larter playing Claire Redfield but she really had no purpose. What happened to everyone else? This latest movie did not even talk about what happened to Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Leon Kennedy etc. I guess we assumed they died in battle. This is my point, we don't care about the side characters. They are expendable. If any of the game characters were someone else then I wouldn't be wondering what happened to them. This is no different then the video games. We just want to watch the main star. Since this is the last of the movie franchise. I have to say it was pretty awesome. The amount of action alone kept me entertained right to the end of the movie. The movie did what I've been saying all along. It just focused on the main star which is Alice. The story-line was very simple: Save the World. I love the fact it brought Alice back to ground zero where it all began. Loads of action. New creatures. It was a great adventure. The movie does tie up almost everything since the first film in 2002.I am quite sad to know that this is potentially the last in the series. I like to think it is the last of the Alice series. Although, I can't see anyone else playing someone as strong as Milla Jovovich should they reboot the series with a different heroine or hero. However, I'm not convinced this will be the last of Resident Evil. I just think this may be the last we see Alice. I hope not anyway.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
250,sandybear798,OK film,5,30 May 2017,"I've never seen a full budgeted movie get hacked up so poorly that the expensive action scenes are pretty much butchered to the max. This movie needs to be studied in film school for how NOT to edit a movie. Every single action is shot with countless shakes, moves, and camera switches. A simple action of, say, putting away your knife, takes 3- 4 camera edits. I was counting them by 15 minutes in per shot. It was insane. A fight sequence will be nothing but a countless series of quick edits form close up, medium and far away shots mashed together so it's impossible to follow what's going on. Shaky cam is one thing, but this is shaky cam plus strobe effect editing. Every single punch or shot requires 4-6 edits and quick cuts. It will give you a headache to figure out what's happening in any fight or sequence. Even mundane actions like people standing on top of a building looking down takes 5-6 edits and quick cuts?",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
251,wire-100,Sony and Paul W.S Anderson might be more evil than Umbrella,1,5 February 2017,"Sony, the most soulless production company, and Paul W.S. Anderson, the worst director/writer combination, have just given us the worst film of the year, and it's still only January! That's right, the latest Resident Evil is out.Now the franchise has always been a mess, with its stolen ideas, disposable characters, incredibly inconsistent continuity and the need the hit an over the top action beat every 5 minutes, but the new installment takes the franchise to new heights! For a franchise to completely re-write its previous films history in the sake of a new far fetched plot is something we're yet to see. So in a way we should thank Sony, now we don't have to watch most the films in the franchise in order to get to The ""Final"" Chapter. Sadly we do lose something from previously films, and that's the super slow motion. Lucky for us though there's a replacement. After Paul W.S Anderson saw Sherlock Holmes he came up with the brilliant idea of having a lead character almost freeze time and analyse every possible situation, letting us know the probability of the results, before they would act. So thanks Paul, you genius. I will also add, he must have watched The Book of Eli recently too because the opening does feel very similar, even stealing the under the bridge silhouette fight scene. Also stealing a plot point from Blade: Trinity, in the later half of the film. This film is so unoriginal, so convoluted, so sloppily written and edited, with action beat after action beat that there's no room to breathe, I'm surprised this film even made it to the production phase. I only saw this film so I knew how bad it would be, but it's still very surprising to see how lazy and unimaginative the people involved in this franchise are. So please, don't go see this movieIt deserves a 0 rating... but I guess a 1 will have to do.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
252,hurricane_floyd,Worst edited film in history hands down!,1,3 March 2017,Aside from the usual problems with this type of movie and this particular franchise. This movie looks like it was edited by a high school film class on crystal meth. The action scenes are a dizzying mashup of half second cuts each from a different angle. There are dialog scenes where there is a camera a cut on every. single. word. They even left it open for yet another sequel. I wish I could give it negative stars.,Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
253,hantz101,The exact opposite of Shaw Bros cinematography,2,4 April 2021,"For those of you familiar with the old Shaw Bros films of the 70s (and if you aren't, go watch anything they made, I'll wait), you'll remember those beautifully choreographed fight scenes. They went on for several minutes with the same camera angles, rehearsed until the actors were practically dancing. Amazing work.This is nothing like those. Each shot in the fight scenes lasts about half a second, multiple camera angles, sometimes repeating the same actions from different perspectives. If you blink your eyes as fast as possible to get a strobe effect, you *may* be able to understand what's happening, but you'll get a headache, both from the rapid eye movement and trying to figure out what the hell is going on.I thought this franchise had hit rock bottom after Retribution, when she walked away unscathed from a crashed helicopter, but this is actually worse.

You think Taken 3 had the most ridiculous editing of a man jumping over a fence? Ok, that one is still true, but this movie is on a level I did not expect. Every scene, action or not, is edited like the coffee was spilled over the keyboard and somebody wanted to hide the age of its protagonists. There should be a seizure warning.Apart from that the movie is as silly as expected, horribly boring, dark and lazy. Watch it to appreciate average editing of other movies and for Paul Anderson striving to reach the levels of Uwe Boll. 😅",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
255,Purdinator,A Fair Effort in the Final Stretch,5,17 July 2018,"You'd be forgiven for being surprised that the ""Resident Evil"" series has made it through six movies. Ever since the original's debut in 2002, the series has been pumping out zombie horror and breakneck action on a fairly regular schedule, turning a tidy, if unspectacular, profit while doing so. Though, apart from the seemingly endless journey of venerable heroine Milla Jovovich, there's been little development of story across installments. One is much like another, as is the bleak and familiar ground they cover, and that's quite good enough. So, it's actually refreshing to see series progenitor, director and writer Paul W.S. Anderson, seek to bring it to a conclusion.Disregarding a sizable share of previous plot lines, Anderson introduces a detailed backstory that transitions to the blank slate the previous installment left things at. Jovovich is back, and the stakes couldn't be higher. The few remaining humans on the T-virus-ravaged Earth will die in 48 hours, unless Jovovich can make it back to Raccoon City, where the menace began, and release an airborne anti-virus.It's a simple, effective plot, and sets the stage for a rapid pace that does the film credit. Characterization and dialogue have never been strong suits for the series, so it's agreeable that the focus is almost fully on the action. And, you have to admit, it's fun to watch, if not anything particularly original. Before she even reaches the remains of Raccoon City, Jovovich dispatches a flying beastie (looking like something from a Dio album cover) with a claymore mine and, in a scene reminiscent of ""Mad Max"", escapes from a rolling Umbrella Corporation fortress on a pilfered motorbike. That leads in to a series of escalating confrontations that confirm Anderson as a skilled director of action, though far too quick with his cuts, as well as a voracious appropriator of popular cinema. Beyond ""Mad Max"", there are references to touchstones as diverse as ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", Guy Ritchie's ""Sherlock Holmes"" films, and (in a particularly amusing moment) ""RoboCop"".Jovovich performs well, per usual, as the scrappy heroine, dispensing killshots and one-liners with aplomb. She also gets an opportunity to stretch her character out, in a way the series has not previously allowed. Providing support is Ali Larter, an on-again, off-again presence in the series whose impact here is negligible. She's given little interesting to say or do, besides watch Jovovich's back. Her role could have been filled just as easily by Ruby Rose, who appears in a smaller part as another survivor joining the assault on Umbrella's base beneath Raccoon City.And that base is something to see; it's probably the best of the series' numerous callbacks to Resident Evil's video-game house of horrors roots. Chock full of nasty contraptions, esoteric security measures, and horrifying revelations, it's a fantastic playground for any action flick, let alone a film with the minimal ambitions on display here. Better still, it's overseen by the series' best villain, Iain Glen, who has returned following his apparent death in the third installment (which is explained away succinctly). With his gravelly voice and imperious bearing, Glen can lace even the most preposterous dialogue with crawling menace. He well overshadows fellow baddie Shawn Roberts, relegating him to the status of a walking mannequin modeling leather wear from the Keanu Reeves line. The same can often be said of the film's other supporting characters, who mainly serve their limited purposes delivering trite dialogue before bowing out with appropriately gruesome deaths.There's little deviation from the Resident Evil formula established previously, but that formula is executed very effectively here. And while this film's blatant disregard for previous attempts at building a greater continuity will likely turn off longtime fans, or just those who have a thing for continuity, it's perversely admirable that Anderson finds himself so willing to just charge ahead with what works (admittedly, he hasn't got a lot to choose from on that score). All in all, the series is wrapped up with a presentable enough finish in an undemanding hour-and-a-half. If Anderson could rein in those quick cuts (and maybe refrain from writing), he could be on to something.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

I had fun watching it though. Definitely scared me a lot more than the last HHN I went to despite the low ""horror"" factor. Lol.I recommend anyone who follows the series to watch it. The epilogue dialogue can be somewhat misleading and the story itself has the usual supposedly dramatic (yet also rather predictable) turn of events.

So using dynamic shaking and jumping to cover the movie that has no contents in it.Even if I jump on my feet and run in real life, I don't see the world spinning and shaking all over me.A good directing is a still image can create excitement for the audience. Who can recreate a cup of water with ripple when a T-Rex is coming in Jurassic Park? Definitely not from director who doesn't know how to shoot a still scene, not even one.

I think a lot of people were turned off by how much the action sequences evolved in this installment. I wasn't a big fan, but I don't think it was poorly executed at the same time. The burning tower was an amazing visual.The thing I missed in this movie compared to the others was an attachment to the characters. I didn't really care for anybody except the antagonist. All of the other movies had a way of making you care for the side characters in a surprisingly short amount of time.The continuity felt a bit broken from the end of 5 to the beginning of 6. This bothered me until the plot revealed itself towards the end. You can tell the writer poured his heart into this project to finish up the story properly.

Especially with the current high quality of TV shows similar to this one, the filmmakers were probably having a hard time trying to make their movie worthy of asking the viewers to go to a theater rather than just to grab their TV remotes.I loved the first one but I guess I was just curious how the story would end (it does say ""The Final Chapter"", right?). Iaian Glen as Dr. Isaacs just doesn't come across as villainous enough. Its like he's naughty but not bad.

I have 3 kids, work pretty much 7 days/week, and there's enough great TV and movie options out there to pick and choose how I spend my RARE free time. Lately, it seems the studios are hiring henchmen to flood the reviews and ratings with inflated numbers. I don't particularly like the Rotten Tomatoes system, but might have to start looking into it.Boy, was this one a mistake.I enjoy the popcorny-style Resident Evil flicks. Much like the Underworld franchise, I know what I'm getting into. A reliably safe bet that your 90 minutes will not bring you to Enlightenment, but you'll be entertained. Boy, did Paul W(asted) S(pace) Anderson put a stop to that. I know the editing software Final Cut Pro inside and out, and I'm pretty sure my MacBook would interrupt me if I did it the Anderson way and say, ""Um, you might be going a little overboard here...and here...and there, too..."".What a dizzying sh*tshow. All I could think about was how each of those 5 millisecond cuts cost the studio money with no reward to the viewer. I'm writing this review as the movie is still playing and every time I look up some shaky, nonsensical action scene is taking place. As other reviewers put it, it is a Masterclass in how not to edit.Milla and the Game of Thrones dude did their best. They were probably skiing when Paul and his henchmen were in the editing room, though...and would have purposely ran into sharp-branched trees if they knew what he was up to. So sad.How can you have 5 quick edits in a 2 second scene where someone is barely doing anything? After the first 15 minutes, the editing is all you can think about. You obsess on it. You loathe it.Take the money and run, Milla. You played it smart...grab a franchise and run with it, they say. It's a shame this last one played out like a bad TV movie, though.Oh, and there are literally a bazillion plot holes between this movie and the others. Nobody chaperoned this script or the guys running the show at all.

She is the living presence of these movies as she single handedly carried all the movies in the series on her shoulders and it goes the same for this one. It's a high octane action movie right from the start and though a couple of predictable scenes, keeps the ride going throughout the movie with amazingly choreographed stunt sequences and massive stuff blowing up scenes and badass fights.If you are a Milla jovovich fan you will love it. If you are a fan of the movie series, you will enjoy it! Safe to say, ignore the reviews and ratings and all the bullshit being said about this one.

But oh boy, this film managed to be more incompetent than all the others, in almost every aspect: everything happens way too fast without time for any tension build-up (seriously, EVERYBODY speaks too damn fast), and the only excuse for ""terror"" are easily predictable jumpscares. The editing is also awful all throughout the movie, especially the action scenes, when the camera is way too shaky, too zoomed and does too many jumpcuts for them to be enjoyable or even watchable. The music is too cliché and ""cool"" to convey any emotion or excitement, the characters are dumb, typical and not properly developed, the plot has more holes than a Swiss cheese, etc. Also, we all know this is not the ""Last Chapter"".

My partner dragged me to the theater to watch it, I would have never gone myself otherwise as I did not enjoy any of the previous movies either.

Fortunately, this film was exactly what most action film goers are looking for.The action is this film was somewhat on point. The cinematography was a bit frustrating to deal with especially with so much of the panning but overall it was decent. The CGi however had a few strong and weak points. Some parts of the film (no gonna spoil anything) were quite realistic while some were just plain fake. However, if the budget was similar to the rest of the films in the franchise I'd say it's good enough.Mila, again has a stiff but improved performance. I guess all the stunts are hard to deal with but apart from that she is meant to have this emotionless and careless feel to her persona which is what she is actually represented as in the film. Nevertheless the stunts by all the actors were pleasing and a nice watch.The story as usual with the other films in the franchise are very broad and basic. This means that the majority of the population should be able to understand it but it also means that the plot was not a main focus. Of course, the plot is what drives the whole film to life but it wasn't vast and unique enough. Sure it did have some twists but they were somewhat expected. I wouldn't call them twists anymore would you?Overall, the film was an enjoyable action flick with lots and lots of violence.

Predictable outcomes, cliché lines and a serious lack of realism.Whilst we are on the topic of realism, just because this is a film of fiction and the whole Resident Evil franchise is pretty far fetched, it doesn't mean the action has to be unrealistic and they managed to keep things relatively in-check throughout the various films. But some plonker in Hollywood has obviously waded in with their Rambo 3 vision of reality and decided that fire does not give off heat, shock-waves from major explosions do not harm or damage even if only a few metres away - yep, you just go flying across and slam into the ground only to get up without a mark on you.Hollywood really need to up their game and understand that the public are not to be insulted with such stupidity.

I had to check and see if it was the same director, because the direction seems a jump from previous films. In the past, The Resident evil films used all the cliché film jump scares and action fighting sequences. Cliché means that it works, but has been over done. but it works. Paul WS Anderson seems to be trying something new, or just wanting to upset his audience so they stop asking for more of these Resident Evil films. The story, is passable, but it's the editing that is just brutal. This film is like watching a strobe light, while driving on a bumpy, pot-hole filled road. I think he purposely broke all rules of editing. He constantly breaks the 180 rule, where the camera should never jump more then 180 degrees, because it throws the viewer off, and brings them out of the situation. Anderson will have 2 characters fighting, in the next shot they are in the opposite position. He will have 6 cuts for something that should be 2. He has shots that are under 9 frames (it takes 6 frames of film, for the human brain to register what it is seeing). The camera shakes all over during action scenes like it's sitting on a paint mixer. We go from mid-shot, to extreme close up, to an extreme close up of something else, but with a moving camera. Pull outs, followed by a push in. Flashes of random images of gore from previous films. Whip-pans that cut away to a 10 frame shot. Jump-cuts where the camera cuts to a slightly closer and slightly different angle, where it could have been different takes, and someone forgot where the camera was placed. Characters in different positions from one cut to the next.  and more. It's hard to even talk about the story, because the Red-Bull & coffee induced editing just takes you out of the story so harshly, that the acting, special FX, and Action are all irrelevant. Just be sure you are not epileptic before watching this film.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

Where do I begin?So as someone who loved the first 2 films and Retribution... this was kind of rough to watch.Avoiding spoilers, I'll say this...1) Don't expect many previously established characters to return in the for the last film. MAJOR LET DOWN. Matter of fact-- they don't even explain or acknowledge them. We're led to probably assume they dead.2) Continuity from the 2nd film was completely ignored (Angie and her father) to focus on Alice/Milla and to give her daughter a significant role in the film.3) Characters that are from the video games that do make it into the film have their roles & abilities shifted to the made-up characters, despite the fact that they are right standing right there in the scene doing not much...the entire film.The film had faithful outfits from the games and an ending that worked for Alice's character-- but overall, this was VERY weak for 6 movie franchise. This should have been the ending for the last film.Another dumb issue I had a problem with was... WHY WOULD YOU LEAVE THE FINAL CHAPTER WITH A MILD CLIFFHANGER!???? That bothered me.I think this film is a prime example on why fans of the games hate these movies. I think they have sold out-- not by the gamer's standards, but by their own previously established work on other films. What a disappointing end to a pretty good franchise. NEXT TIME RESIDENT EVIL COMES TO FILM-- FOCUS ON THE GAMES AND IT'S CHARACTERS! Not everything needs to be 100% action.

291,ninjamasterzer0,Travesty,3,20 May 2020,"I watched this movie opening day and again recently just to see if it was as bad as I remembered. I'm unfortunately one of the few that didn't hate this series. Some of the movies were enjoyable and they did take scenes straight from the games. However, this was by far the worse entry to the franchise.To start with, W.S. Anderson must have forgot his own scripts because he retcons the entire plot of the franchise from the jump. In RE Apocalypse, it's stated the T-virus was created to cure Dr. Ashford's, a level 6 researcher of Umbrella, daughter from the inability to walk, which Umbrella then steals that cure to weaponize. However, in RE The Final Chapter, Dr. Marcus, the founder of Umbrella, created the virus to reverse his daughter Alicia of premature aging, which was stolen by Dr. Isaacs and Albert Wesker. This is the first scene so you can already tell where this movie is going.The next problem is, this entry also completely ignores what happens at the end of the previous film. Alice gets her powers back from Wesker, Wesker teams up with the rest of the good guys, and they're about to have a ""final stand"" per se at the White House. This movie starts with none of that happening with Alice simply stating that the whole thing was a trap and everyone died off screen is mysterious ways.Now let's talk about Wesker. This man/clone guy took a collective 11 years to kill in the games and that was only after he had a complete mental breakdown, infect himself with the Oroboros virus, get thrown into a volcano and shot with 2 RPGS. RE Final Chapter? Small fight and the dude gets killed by a door. For some reason he has superpowers that lets him regenerate his head from a shotgun blast and can dodge bullets, but a door crushing his ankle that he for some reason couldn't dodge or move 2 inches forward and dying of blood loss is his downfall. He then cries out for help and to be saved because, why not. He doesn't even do anything the entire film. He sits in a lavish Apple control room and has a few lines here and there.I could literally go on about plot holes. This movie dragged on, but felt extremely rushed because W.S. Anderson felt the need to amp up the slow motion, but then do a jump cut every 1/4 second during action scenes so you can't even tell who's hitting who or the environment is too dark to see anyways. Thankfully this was the last movie . Can't wait to see how W. S. Anderson and his wife, Milla Jovovich screw up the Monster Hunter movie next. If you want better movies, watch the CGI films. Leon and Chris' John Wick scene in Vendetta was pretty enjoyable.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

It wasn't scary - it was simply annoying (the guy next to me put ear plugs to tolerate it).Imagine this... normal movie is at volume 5, epic scene in a movie is 7 - The Final Chapters goes like this ALL THE TIME : 1 while they talk, 15 first second of jump scare, 9 half a second later - repeat after 3 seconds...Its too late for the cinema, but PLEASE edit this for the DVD.

Paul Andersson upped his game in my opinion. But maaan the cutting was horrible. I think either the editor just discovered action cuts and sort of short-circuited to the point where he couldn't do anything else, or maybe that Milla Jovovich having just given birth and getting into her mid 40s isn't THAT keen on doing stunts and fight scenes anymore. I don't think I'm exaggerating if I claim this movie died from a thousand cuts. Yes that is indeed more than one cut a second, and as there actually were scenes where Mr. Doobie White must have fallen asleep in the cutting room, he simply had to incorporate even more cuts into the action scenes.

The intro is solid and explains what is happening (even if you didn't see the previous films) and makes a good set-up, but once the real movie starts a lot of things go wrong. The camera is shaky, it changes shots / angles every second and you cannot follow what is going on on screen. Who is in the fight, who picks up objects, who hits whom, even while talking the camera changes so you just cant follow anything that is going on. I hoped that would change, but it just got worse. You cant enjoy the fights against monsters and the action scenes because the camera just doesn't allow it.

297,donduncan69,Great Finale!,9,14 February 2017,"While we miss popular characters and Albert Wesker has limited screen time, this is a very satisfying conclusion to the series. My favorite film franchise series ever.We have enough new characters and circumstances to satisfy our need for something new to revel at. We have enough situations, backgrounds, and scenery to be delighted with. Even though we're back at the Hive -- we see the Hive from different perspectives than in the past.We take the journey we've waited for years for. The journey and genesis of how and why a T virus exists, it's intention, and where Alice fits in to the equation.I constantly find the films berated and given poor reviews but as JK Rowling recently said, ""....I've got your money..."". For those tearing the films down -- you still keep watching. Some of the RE films are better than others but all are worthy. I'm not a gamer and have no idea what the significance of the relationship between the two is. I know that like the Alien franchise, a woman is not a victim. In fact, anything but. It shows the reality of a woman's capabilitiesWe get plenty of action which we've come to expect from these films. We get satisfying explanations for the origin of the story, but best off we get plenty of Bad-Ass Alice. Alice is what has always made this an entertaining franchise.Had Milla Jovovich not been cast in the first film I doubt there would have been a second film. A perfect example of pairing the perfect actor with the perfect part. I haven't seen Milla in many roles where I thought that her participation in the film -- completed the film. In the Resident Evil film franchise -- it's all about Jovovich. Jovovich is Alice. One of the best heroines in screen history.There's a rumor that Resident Evil could become a television series.

It is said to be the final of the Resident evil franchise before someone decides to reboot this series.I'm a big fan of this franchise and this movie would rank as the third best. First of all the theater version of this film is horrible, the editing is just a horrible mess. There were some great action scenes but not all of it was understandable. Now if you watch this movie on sites such as 123 movies or putlocker, the action is better and is understandable because it's not dark as the version I watched in the theater and the pacing is a bit slower making it more understandable.***Spoilers***There were a few plot holes and Albert Wesker's death was a disappointment, a big disappointment. If you're looking for character development there isn't much because a lot of them were killed off quickly. CGI effects, some were great and some were really bad. When the Red Queen told Alice to look behind her, a zombie comes out of nowhere and attacks, Alice kills it of course but it wasn't understandable at all except for the part where she slices the head off. The CGI effects were pretty terrible for that particular scene. I would definitely say the acting for Alice improved from the previous films which was good. For me, most of the action is understandable (not the theater version) but there are some moments when you have to really pay attention to the action. I guess Mr.Anderson was trying to make these high paced action sequences, which he gets in some fighting scenes but for some other it was very terrible. If you're not a fan , you wouldn't like this movie and I suggest if you want to understand the action scenes don't watch in the theater, trust me it is horrible, watch this movie on sites like 123movies or putlocker it's better 100%.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

I could safely say it was by far the best movie of this strong and unforgettable franchise. Minute by minute, scenes were perfectly scripted much like the stunt work and emotion-filled performances by all of the cast. Mean, even the extras and CGI were just as talented. It's certainly left the door open for sequels/prequels, maybe even a re-imagining much like the amazing spiderman movies(which were also ground breaking).Yet again, Mila steals the whole movie with her dynamic and breathtaking acting(or is it storytelling?). I just cannot describe properly the emotions is played through to me. I mean, I thought Extinction was my favourite but no I'm questioning my own ideas!It's been a dark few years since 2007 where Extinction had guided me through life. 10 years later, I feel like I too have been re-imagined and revitalised when it comes to the way I life live in general, down to my voluntary work with the sick cats in Boston. It's spurred me on in so many ways, even my friends have a greater relationship with me and their souls.If you want to see a movie that is both life changing and inspirational, take a few friends and get ready to enjoy life in over drive.

305,veelrosekk,It's time for this franchise to be loved,9,27 August 2020,"I'm a fan of the whole Resident Evil movie franchise. Some would say I'm crazy, I know. But hear me out.This is not Resident Evil as we know it. It's only based on this game franchise, loosely at that. However, as a stand-alone franchise it strikes amazingly. It has its own atmosphere, vibe, style. Something unique per se. The most incredible thing is the desire to keep it going and to bring the story to its logical end, a very brave move by Anderson and in my opinion, it was worth it. A work of passion.I've re-watched all 6 movies hundreds of times. Here's some opinions on the parts.Resident Evil (2002)
Man, this is classic. Creepy, atmospheric, dynamic. A bit weird in the beginning though. But you get sucked into it pretty quickly. And they killed Rain, of course they did. Sad.
Rating: 9/10.Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004)
Horror gets stronger. Creepiness increases. Awesomeness as well. And there were more lickers! My favourite B.O.W.s. We obtain new cool and badass characters, including Jill Valentine. We experience more weirdness in the end. Oh, and it's very very dark movie, literally. But cool. Wish Matt had a better fate...
Rating: 9/10.Resident Evil: Extinction (2007)
The start of an intense, constantly increasing action driving curve till the end of the franchise. The style becomes more ""brutality and fatality"" like, yet it suits it well. I'm not happy with loosing Carlos, but the pace and drama and action were splendid. But I'm not a big fan of deserts, so, to be honest, i've seen it much less times than other movies ;p Oh, and here's when known characters start to go missing (e.g., we don't really get anything about Angie from Apocalypse)
Rating: 9/10Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010)
Uu, this is where things get more interesting. This movie is mind blowing 'cause of its scale. It does get local at some point, but it shows us a lot of the actual collapsed world. The prison location looks dope. And there is also... AN EXECUTIONER BABY! Cool bean, very friendly, can teach you some quick chopped meat meals. The fight with Wesker..oh,man, so cool. Chris and Claire and Alice together against Wesker, very close executed to the game which is a huge plus, one of my most favourite moments in the whole franchise. And guess what... we have a special guest coming in the very open end...Ms. Valentine, alright.
Rating: 9/10Resident Evil: Retribution (2012)
Opening scene is just something. The whole movie pace is so action-driven. And the concept of multiple test locations is very well done. We get new characters: Leon, Ada and Barry (speaking of game characters). Though we don't keep Chris and Claire *x-files theme playing*. Leon has a weird haircut and some very active and physical romantic hunch for Ada which I do NOT appreciate (as a fan of Leon and hater of Ada). Barry was quite cool (but, sadly, doomed). They also resurrected(cloned) my Carlos and Rain though they were doomed too unfortunately. Apart from that - very nice implementation. Oh, and they killed Luther. Stop killing my favourite characters! - she screamed into the void of a completed franchise, ""whatever happened - happened, Jack"". The end scene is...weird, I guess? But very fitting the franchise (in a good way).
Rating: 9/10Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2016)
*x-files theme fades in* Jill? Leon? Ada? Becky? Still missing Angie? Guys, where are you? Oki dokie, let's speak of the movie itself. Among all the movies it brings a logical story end for the franchise, like 90% of main questions were answered in a very logical, step by step way which made me happy. We indeed went to the beginning - the beginning of the story and the initial place that brought chaos on all humanity. A nice touch. Besides missing characters I am fulfilled, franchise was fulfilled, a very descent end which I wish other big franchises had. I also wish other actors besides Ali Larter, Iain Glen and Shawn Roberts would participate, I think they missed out on an opportunity of being in the very last chapter of a well done franchise. I loved it.
Rating: 9/10Guys! This is the franchise I grew up with, alright. It takes a special place in my heart and it hurts me to see so many people hate it. It has its pros! Lots of them! Try to be more open minded. And never forget what an amount of work and effort of the whole crew it is to create a movie.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

Take that what you will.It's like Mad Max Fury Road meets World War Z. There is nonstop action so you will likely never be bored. It is mostly nothing new so if you didn't like the older ones you probably won't like this. The plot is a basic ticking time bomb race to the end and it shows in the editing. There is the standard jump scares, implausible physics and lifeless nothing characters. But if you're looking for a Transformers-style post-apocalyptic action ride with cool music, badass martial arts fight scenes and a dramatic brutal final confrontation, this is probably one of the better ones.

They even threw out the ending of the previous film, and turned Wesker into a blubbering idiot. You don't develop any attachment whatsoever to any of the characters...the acting is horrible, and every scene is grossly predictable.There isn't a single redeeming factor to this piece of garbage.

313,edwordless,Entertaining way to finish off the series.,7,9 April 2018,"This installment ended up being exactly what I expected. Not really what I had hoped for, but my expectations shifted about the time Alice lost her powers. As far as entertainment goes, this was fine! Pacing was good, fight sequences were solid, and Milla was awesome as always. It was a bit of a rehash of previous movies, but each movie has done that some. 
Bottom line: if you go into this with the concept that this is the fifth installment of a movie based off of a video game, then you'll be entertained. Nothing more.
Grab some popcorn, crank up the volume, don't over analyze things, and have a good time!",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
314,GeminiRift,Absolute Tragedy,1,21 October 2019,"This movie is the most poorly written, edited, directed, etc. that I've ever seen.The action scenes (which I don't care for regardless) are so chopped up and jumpy that you legitimately cannot tell what's happening. Another reviewer on here said ""This should be studied in film school to show how NOT to edit a movie"" and I couldn't agree more.However, the most revolting thing to me about this movie is how hard they try to be ""military"". During the shooting scenes and such, you'll hear all the classic lines from terrible movies trying to be edgy and cool, such as:
""RELOADING!!!!""
""MOVE OUT!1!1!!!11""
""My MaGs HaLf EmPtY""
*Typical action movie cliche*Jesus Christ, we get it. Military dialogue and such.Don't waste your time, even if it's free. Even if it's just so you can say you finished the series. Don't bother.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
315,Laygz,The wrong sequel...,4,4 February 2017,"As this is coming from a fan of the series in general, with the first film being the best straight up zombie flick IMO, I take no pleasure in writing how disappointed I was with this film, especially as a so called ""final chapter"".My main gripe is how off track it feels from the ending/set-up of the previous installment. I felt they had another film in mind from the one we got. I wanted to see that film! The epic Washington DC showdown with superhero Alice leading Leon, Ada Wong, a back on side Jill Valentine, and perhaps even Wesker playing ball for a time - Not to mention the emotional possibilities they could of tapped into with the mother daughter relationship they had established between Alice and the Deaf girl... but for some reason, maybe studio interference, budget or casting issues, we got this weak effort.It's like they don't deny those event happened but we just have to take their word for it and move on. Even worse, they don't give us any background on what! actually went down, just that 'people died'. Errm... thanks? This is probably another cynical angle as they still have the option of bringing important characters back if and when needed - They have done this a lot! Finally, the end is total BS, inviting dialogue such as ""why am I still alive?"" and ""there is still work to be done."" Apparently an instantly acting airborne cure is slower than a contact based virus in the world of Paul Anderson? Because of the modern technology and all... Lets just say, for a film with the words ""Final Chapter"" in the title this release is more than dishonest.A real letdown. So disjointed it feels like a bad reboot. It's shocking to me that it was made by the same director who helmed the first film",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
316,kelel49,Entertaining...but had SO MUCH MORE POTENTIAL!,4,29 January 2017,"If you have not watched the movie yet, stop reading now before anything gets revealed... SPOILERS AHEAD!Ever since the first Resident Evil was released, I was willing to keep an open mind about it. And this is coming from someone who is a HUGE fan of the games! I actually enjoyed the first five movies very much so. Different, yes. But still entertaining as can be. Plus, knowing that all of the original heroes were supposed to return for one last stand, was what I was most excited about. Alice fighting along side, Claire and Chris Redfield, Leon Kennedy, Jill Valentine, and Ada Wong, it would have been like a dream come true. But all of that changed when I found out none of the actors were asked to return. Instead, we got nothing more than characters who were very quickly disposed and continued to focus on Alice. Figures since, she's the director's wife. When Retribution concluded, we saw humanity giving a last stand against the undead and BOWs, leaving one of the biggest cliffhangers for this movie to pick up with. And when it starts, the fight is already over with. (a flat out waste in my opinion).The Story became more confusing once the history of the Red Queen was revealed, as well as Albert Wesker (the main video game villain) being nothing more than just an umbrella employee. Dr. Issacs had his shot in part 3, so why they decided to bring him back (with various clones and such) was beyond me. The Final fight should have concluded with Wesker vs Alice but that's just me. And in conclusion, though this movie was revealed as ""The Final Chapter"" the ending certainly did not make it seem that way. Wasn't the closure I was hoping for in any way. The only plus side was some of the action in this movie but all in all, I was rather disappointed between the overused jump scares, the rushed/confusing story, but above all, the exclusion of all of our past heroes and having made no mention of them whatsoever.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
317,simon_m87,Poor writing and awful camera work,3,24 December 2018,Really wanted to like this a sim a big fan of the games and loved Apocalypse which there in lies the problem.. this movie completely contradicts everything that happened in the second movie. How someone who's been involved in all 6 films and directed 4 out of the 6 can make a complete pigs ear of explaining the history and what happened in the beginning is beyond me. More surprising is how the studio saw the script and thought that it was good coupled by the fact only one of the countless survivors was asked to come back is crazy.,Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
318,nightanimal9,Better than I expected,8,25 March 2017,I thought this movie was awesome and different. It reminded me a little of Extinction. I don't understand a lot of the bad comments. The gas and tower scene is incredible. I thought the story was pretty cool and the little message near the end that crossed over into reality like global warming. Very good and very under rated movie. Anderson ROCKS!,Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

Yes, there was a few technical glitches, Did it really took away from the movie itself , not even close! Seriously? The final chapter open up with a bang and the bang just got louder to the very ending into the climatic explosion! Awesome work Milla, case and crew. Reading reviews about how unbelievable, and not realistic. (Okay where have you been from the first Resident Evil to the final chapter)? Light bulb, none of it is real or believable. apostolic zombie un-dead! Have you seen any walking around lately? (Then again...)Sorry, didn't mean to go there.It s great entertainment.

What a waste.,Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
321,jigzat,"Awful, also they manage to ruin the first movie.",1,4 June 2017,"I have enjoyed some handful of poorly rated movies but this one is horrible, I rather watch Showgirls 100 times. The series not only went into the same path as the second movie onward with excessive cheesy CGI and over the top camera movement but it also felt into the overly explained plot trend. They constantly try to explain every single aspect of the universe and it constantly recapitulates with previous films footage flashbacks. It tries to recycle certain things from the first movie in an very lazy attempt to find a success ""formula"" but of course it failed. Also the ending will ruin the plot of the first movie, so for your own sake pretend that the rest of the movies don't exist.If I had worked on that movie I would be ashamed of showing my name in the credits TBH. Milla Jovovich seriously lost part of her charm with this movie, I feel bad for her.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

It was a good run.,5,4 April 2017,"It takes in some good concepts from other movies and then butchers them with cliché lines, poor story line loose ends, and making the characters constantly look stupid by falling into obvious traps, just so they can bust out in ""cool"" over-the-top gratuitous action. Milla Jovovich and Iain Glen still have it, everyone else was at best ""ok"".",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
323,SynfulBlood,I thought that this couldn't possibly be worse than Retribution. I was wrong.,1,10 February 2017,"Literally everything is wrong with this movie. No, I'm not gonna complain about how it's nothing like the games because honestly, they threw that out the window at Apocalypse, which was ironically the only one that had anything from the games at all. Huh. Speaking of which, they threw a hell of a lot more out the window with this one, including plot points from the other movies.Remember Dr. Ashford and his daughter Angie from Apocalypse? If you don't, I don't blame you, but in any case, they are now irrelevant, because they pretty much never existed according to this movie. Now we have another character from the game (rather, just some jackass that shares a name with him), James Marcus, and his daughter, Alicia (not from the games), who replace them here. Now, according to this one, Marcus created the T-Virus to cure a disease his daughter was suffering from. Interesting; in Apocalypse, it was just paralysis, but whatever. Anyways, the side effect was that it kills people and turns them into zombies. Don't question it. I doubt even the writer knows what the hell he was thinking.So, with that needless plot revision out of the way, the movie starts out *after* the White House battle that was teased at the end of Retribution. Yeah, what could have made for a somewhat entertaining scene was completely skipped over. But whatever. At this point, the movie's loss is our gain. Alice was betrayed by Wesker; her powers were in fact not given back to her, which I actually kind of like about this movie, because that was one of the worst aspects of her character anyway. Kudos, writer. Anyways, she is contacted by the Red Queen, who is no longer the genocidal AI she was in Retribution and is once again played by a different actress. At least this time, she actually does look like the programmer's daughter, as they said in the first movie.You know, the complete lack of regard for the series' continuity is already enough to trash this movie, and the previous two, for that matter. Because even the fans (apparently, there actually *are* fans of this crap) don't have any real reason to keep watching it. The Red Queen has gone from killing people infected by the T-Virus to prevent an outbreak, to trying to kill all of humanity, and now she wants to save them. Can we make up our minds, please?The Red Queen tells Alice that Umbrella has developed an antivirus that can wipe out everything infected by the T-Virus across the world. Not that that really matters; the whole world has been destroyed and there are apparently only a little over four thousand people left on the planet. Humanity's screwed, guys, give it up already. In any case, Alice should already have known this, because the antivirus was a vital plot point in the first THREE movies, god damn it. The people who make these aren't even trying anymore, are they? Anyways, the Red Queen tells Alice to head back to The Hive facility in Raccoon City, where everything began, to get the antivirus and bring it back to the surface so it can be released.So that's the main plot of this movie, and in case you haven't already guessed, it's an absolutely terrible one, and that plot twist near the end... god damn. Seriously, a 12 year old fanfiction writer probably could have done a better job. But that isn't even the worst of this movie's problems.The action scenes are utterly incomprehensible. The camera jumps around so damn much that you can't even see what the characters are fighting most of the time, or even the characters themselves, really. Although, you'd have a lot of trouble seeing that anyway because the lighting is also terrible, and if you went to see this in 3D, the screen looks even darker on top of that because of the glasses. By the way, if you do go see this trainwreck, do so in 2D if you can. The 3D is utterly pointless, and so is this movie's existence.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
324,brandenmadary65,MINDBLOWING! Best of all 6,10,27 January 2017,Best addition to the resident evil movies. MINDBLOWING IMAX 3D. Even without the 3D the movie would still be great. Its sad that it was the final chapter but it was worth every penny of what i spent to see it at the IMAX ($40) highly recommend this movie to any true fan of resident evil. Saw this and Split and honestly Resident evil blew me away! Split was amazing but doesn't even go near how amazing this movie was. 10/10 5 stars 2 thumbs up. Would say 3 but that makes no sense. So Resident evil fans grab your friends or your love and go see this. I promise you wont regret it! The plot and the violence do not upset. I would say this is the most brutal of the series also!,Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
325,kyleweis20,I Am only person who likes Movie Franchise this is great final chapter,9,28 February 2017,"for game lovers who hates movie franchise, are so happy because the movie franchise has ended. for me i wanted to be more sequels, but anyway this ended pretty good i never played the games, i have but not as many of them first time i heard of Resident evil (2002)i have watched movie i never knew about games after i played games so i became fan of movie franchise it's still great, fun worth watching franchise to watch still i am only saying for my own opinion but i like franchise now in this final chapter it's fun as always story still continues brings back everything from previous films of Resident evil but you can't prove that Jill, Leon Wong, Bucky died because they weren't part of this movie, but they say they died but how ?? they aren't dead but they weren't part of this final chapter as always with action and Milla Jovovich is Always part of it kicking ass, and always surviving Impossible in every situation but everyone really expects to have a final showdown in white house from Resident Evil Retribution ending i wanted that to happen but showdown and final thing is in same place, where it takes to end showdown from First (2002) Resident evil laser defense system room where another Umbrella Corporation has been killed form fist film, that's where it takes place and going back to Raccoon City where it got destroyed and Nuked from Resident Evil: Apocalypse.Plot Dr. James Marcus, the original founder of the Umbrella Corporation, had a daughter the Red Queen (Ever Gabo Anderson) who was dying of premature aging. Desperate to save her, Marcus developed the T-virus as a way to cure all diseases on Earth. After having had his creation taken away from him, Marcus' business partner Dr. Alexander Isaacs (Iain Glen) who wants to end the world and tried to convince Marcus to use the T-virus for military purposes. When he refused, Isaacs ordered Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) to kill Marcus. because Issacs wants to take over Marcus business and toke his antivirus is the cure to kill all inflections. Alice (Milla Jovovich) who awakes from past 3 weeks from destroyed white house after events from Resident Evil Retribution after being betrayed once again by Wesker. the Red Queen appears and tells Alice that she must return to the Hive in Raccoon City within 48 hours, where the Umbrella Corporation has developed an airborne antivirus, which will kill every organism infected by the T-virus, before the remainder of humankind is wiped out. When asked why she's betraying her creators, the Red Queen simply says that she will tell Alice once she arrives at The Hive. Alice takes risk to go back to Raccoon City where it all ended from Resident Evil Apocalypse the thing It's Very Confusing when Resident evil Apocalypse ended and it's gonna be nuked ? how is it still their there is gonna be a lot of questions for that i thought it's Apocalypse end of world all that end of Raccoon city but anyway she goes back to city she had to trust Red Queen she request Alice to get T-virus because over Red Queen wanted Revenge.it's so good that they bought back Claire Redfield (Ali Larter)from Resident Evil Extinction, Resident Evil Afterlife and K-Mart who was in these Another 2 Previous movies is not even mention in movie again there is no proof that she is dead or not but anyway she is not part of movie franchise anymore and Chris Redfield is not Mention in movie too so the character is only thing is back is Claire Redfield that's all you have another characters (Ruby Rose) Abigail she was a chop shop worker, Eoin Macken, William Levy, Rola are new characters but there weren't noting special characters you have a lot of great action scenes a lot of fun action when Alice escape's from Motorbike BMW Motorrad a lot of fight scenes and she kills a lot of Zombies a lot of Creatures and action was so fun, Claire is still kicking ass in movie as always with Alice teams up as usually when group went underground where Raccoon city is been destroyed they go underground in tunnels where Alice has to find the real Isaacs cool staff some cool traps, cool fight scenes Wesker doesn't do much in movie. expect he fights with Alice that's all he doesn't do much but he is in it, a lot of great stunts witch i can tell there is a lot of stunt work in film. I Never Wanted to Spoil the movie I liked the movie there is some plot holes aside, it was a thrilling and intense wrap up great worth seeing movie in a final chapter the game haters must be happy but for another people is different their never played games before, another people that includes me can't compare with all another games of Resident evil game franchise. it's a An Awesome end to the series with lots of exciting action but they were gonna make 2 more after Paul W.S Anderson ended to 6th movie but i expect 2 more movies to be made i am saying it in my opinion. CGI were just as talented expect, don't let anyone let you hate the movie franchise just because the games were a lot better then movie franchise the movie is complete different to games they can compare it. i don't and never will understand why everyone hated this movie franchise this is still worth seeing it very fun and fast Pacing 8.10 still worth watching",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
326,jagodaray,Entertaining and moving in parts (spoilers),7,20 May 2019,"This is a fun movie to watch, if you come with no expectations. It isn't as well paced or intriguing as the first Resident Evil, but then again it's rare for sequels to match the first film in terms of quality. I don't remember this film being advertised as widely as the first film when it was released, and this is surprising as it is one of the more intriguing and poignant movies in the series, though it has its share of two dimensional characters and simplistic sequences. The film is sufficiently similar to its predecessors to firmly ground the viewer in the world of Resident Evil, while also offering several new developments which add a layer of humanity to the story.
The film opens with a short sequence revealing the origins behind the T-Virus. These scenes are an interesting insight into the backstory, and provide a very moving undercurrent to the narrative, by showing that it's love, not only greed, that created the Virus in the first place. The sequence moves on to show a post apocalyptic world, with impressive CGI effects creating the monsters haunting the deserted landscape. Those watching for the zombies will enjoy an impressive shot of an army of the undead, as they move in on an outpost under siege. The way one of the villain's manipulates the zombies is intelligent and nightmarish to watch.
It's important to note that this film wouldn't function as a standalone film, neither is it meant to. If you haven't seen the previous movies in the series you won't really understand what is going on. The twist at the end is particularly affecting, and Alice's resolution is emotional and fitting- a true full circle. Milla Jovovich is consistently convincing as Alice, as is her daughter who plays the younger version of her character.
In conclusion the action sequences are gripping and well executed, and this is a satisfying close to the Resident Evil movie series.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
327,dafaq84,Absolute Mess - Hard to Watch,3,4 February 2017,This franchise is one of my guilty pleasures and I am usually a big fan of the zombie genre. The franchise has always been B grade at best and some of the movies in the series have better than others. Unfortunately this last installment is an absolute flop. The plot is incoherent - doesn't even carry on from the cliffhanger of the previous movie and the editing is some of the worse I have ever seen. One of the action scenes is so poorly shot and edited that I could not make out which character died until the next scene when suddenly they are not around anymore.Watch it if you like the franchise as there is a kinda cool twist at the end with who Alice actually is.

338,belaskam,If you thought resident evil movie adaption could not get ever worst..,1,18 March 2019,"The review would be simple...it is pile of crap if i could be honest and gentle.Trailers for those movie always give me hype but then i get dissapointed and yet when similiar trailer drops i get hyped again even tho i know i will get sad or mad from the movie.The movie basically has nothing to do with the game ,it only took few things and that's all that you get.Put those few things into a blender and boom...you get ""RESIDENT EVIL THE FINAL CHAPTER"".
My reviews are simple so here it is for youPositives+
-Trailer was even better than the movie
-Concept and the athmosphere felt good
-Soundrack is good..maybe only good thingNegatives-
-Ending is bulls**t
-Entire script makes no sense,neither the ending does,neither the plot of this franchise or neither the death of characters which i explain below
-Wesker's death:Worst of them all,this pissed me most.But why? Here's why..
Basically,Albert Wesker was one of the biggest villains in RESIDENT EVIL franchise ,including games and even those bad movies(not so big in movies i guess) and how did he die in the movie ? Horrible death it indeed was...but who decided to do it that way ? Now hold you breath and read:""He died when elevator cut his leg off""....and i was like that's it for my boy Wesker in the movie ? and it indeed was...
-You cannot watch ,it gives you headache,i don't know who is responsible for this messy camera,but it is so awful that it is punchable..right on the nose and not only once
-Even tho the budget was bigger than what we will get in our entire life ,the movie did not offer anything special,not even extra bows like tyrant or hunters or anything similiar (in this movie)Conclusion
-Like i said ,it's bulls**t i wasted 10 good dollars on movie ticket for this crap ,even if it was less i would be pissed ,movie makes no sense and constantly shaking camera that is pointed each frame somewhere else is really bad.
Not only this movie is unwatchable ,it is out of this universe too.
Wish this was never made.

Her mission this time is to get back to Raccoon City and into The Hive and find the Airborne anti virus.That's where things stop making sense. The film is a series of fast cuts between different settings and people. The characters are simply put in place just to be killed off. At this point you might as well Put Alice in a movie on her own because the supporting cast is so unmemorable you couldn't pick them out of a line up, did they even have names. seriously put the supporting cast in red shirts and dump them onto an original Star Trek episode.For the most part everything is so dark that you cant tell what monster is attacking or who just died, the scenes are cut so quickly that your mind cant process whats happening, and the amount of jump scares feels like a slap in the face.By the end you just don't care. Alice is given 48 hrs to release the anti virus or whats left of humanity will be destroyed, but at that point its why. My biggest hate in this movie was what they turned Wesker in to. In the games he was the biggest baddie. Responsible for everything in the first half of the series, always present with an overlooking ominous feel, but here they put him as a third rate lacky to Iain Glens Dr. Issacs. Nothing about the film screams Resident Evil. It's more of a punch in the face to the fans.Lets not forget about the total lack and explanation of absence of the heros from the last film, Leon, Ada, Jill and Alice's ""daughter"". Explanation in these films have never been the strong suit and this one continues the tradition.It may not be the worst of the series but its nowhere close to the best of the franchise.They had promised this to be the final chapter, and if its the case they left so many unanswered questions and nowhere near did the characters, that were so integral to the games you love, the service they deserved.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
346,Kolpax-469,The final movie goes out as a dud instead of with a bang.,3,31 January 2017,"The movie is just a mess from start to finish. It pretty much writes off what happened in the Resident Evil 4 & 5 movies and acts like it is picking up a few years after RE3: Extinction while changing entire plot points of RE1 & RE2: Apocalypse. Here are some of my major gripes with the movie:The movie is pretty much shot entirely with shaky cam, so it's hard to focus on any given scene.The CGI here is just bad and the CGI looks more realistic in the Resident Evil 7 game. Full of just completely random jump scares for no reason at all.The plot makes zero sense and what plot is there is just full of holes. Wesker was barely in this movie and was pretty much a joke after being such a bad ass character in 4 & 5. They don't address what happened to Chris, Ada, Leon, or Jill acting like they never existed at all.It was pretty easy to see this movie didn't have anywhere near the budget of the previous entries in the series and honestly shouldn't have been made or at the very least it should have been a direct to DVD movie. It will not only upset fans of the game series again, but I feel it will also upset fans of the movie series as well.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

348,blackcupcake999,Best of the Resident evil franchise.,10,26 January 2017,"Pure thrilling actions-packed yet full of surprises and meanings. Best of the Resident evil franchise. It's a genius and satisfying ending for this series. The only real thumb down for this is the gap in time-line between it and the previous movie. This gap remained unexplained even after the movie ends so it leaves out the possibility for another one being made. However, this ending is too satisfying for me that I personally think it should be kept like this hence no more sequel needs to be added. Another small point is the rapid deaths of supporting characters. Some of those deaths happened a little too forcefully so you kind of feel like they are forced to die by the writers to save screen time.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
349,tritanz,shitty movie such a waste of time,3,28 March 2017,"Resident evil was a good game, now the movie and the game sucks so bad. this movie doesn't even worth your time, piece of garbage literally. So boring, so predictable, the story is so straight, shitty twistI don't even watch from beginning to the end, i just keep fast forwarding the movie because since beginning its so predictable and boring and the story going downhill since the first movie.im not that often to write a review, this is like my revenge for wasting my time for this garbage. u can trust me on this onenot even worth 5 stars",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
350,trevorh63,"Why the hate against this film, I loved it.",10,3 January 2019,"I don,t understand people giving the film a 1 star it's not perfect, but I loved it.
The two great big transport machines were great. Loved the long road with the zombies following. I,ve always allowed poetic licence for the resident evil and I love the whole franchise, so I am biased.
The changes in camera angles were too much I will admit, but I could still figure out what was going on. There seems to be an opening for a return even though it said it was the final chapter, so hoping for that to happen soon.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
351,markjmata2009-295-960888,What the ****!?,3,29 January 2017,"Wow... I went into this hoping for the best and expecting the worst. Got the worst. First off there was no continuity from the last one....what, everyone but her dies? Then at the end of the last one weaker gives her her powers back. But wait... Sike, he was just foolin. Next we have the ingenious plot to race to get to the the airborne antivirus(which of course there is only one of) in 48 hours or all of humanity will be wiped out. Now, I know you need to have a suspenseful plot, but when she releases the antivirus with milliseconds to go she saves the day, right? Wrong. Apparently the humanity saving airborne antivirus needs to spread across the world on the winds of bullsh**. Does that mean while the airborne antivirus is taking its sweet time globetrotting that the last remnants of humanity and undead are just chilling, waiting? The only reason this movie got 3 stars is some of the scenes were cool. Other than that... Wait for video. You have been warned.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
352,mhess87,"If you like good movies, do yourself a favor and watch a different movie",1,1 February 2017,"I have never written a review of a movie before I saw Resident Evil: The Final Chapter. After watching this piece of zombie dung, I jumped onto IMDb to see who is responsible for this catastrophe of a movie. First thing I notice is the movie has a 6.3 rating. Really people? 6.3 to me is ABOVE AVERAGE and if you think this movie is a 6.3, you are either: high, wasted, age 12, or have an IQ of a zombie with brain damage. This movie is the literal definition of the word, ""garbage."" I felt compelled to tell the world how terrible this movie is... and calling it terrible is actually being lenient.I could pick out a million different things as regards to why this movie is awful. Stupid plot, terrible acting, all the characters with zero character. I will spare you your time and talk about two.First: EDITING. I would LOVE to listen in the editing room talk during the making of this movie. Good lord it would be hilarious. The average time taken between camera cuts has got to be a movie record. During several scenes the camera had to have changed 5 times in the span of like 2 seconds. I felt like I was being interrogated by the CIA watching this poop. Halfway through the movie I felt like I would spill any government secrets if I had any just to make it stop. And when Alice gets to the last room in the hive, the movie finally gives you a moment of relief for two minutes but at that point you're already dead.Second: JUMP SCARES. There is probably an average of 2-3 jump scares per setting. It gets hilarious as the movie goes on. Every time the movie gets quiet, get ready to have your ears blown out by the loudest noises they could legally include in the movie. If I took a shot for every jump scare in this movie, I'd be dead in 10 minutes.Best part about this movie: it's over and I'm still alive. Enjoy life kids, you never know when you may stumble upon a movie such as this.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
353,robveerman,Thank god it's the final chapter,1,29 January 2017,"It's (I think) commonly known that the Resident Evil series aren't very good movies, but I must say that this one is laughably bad. The plot is terrible and some events just occur without any meaning. That being said, the plot is also very predictable. You know what's going to happen minutes before the actual moment. The acting is mediocre, no real outstanding performances, but the movie doesn't make that possible either. The movie could be acceptable for fans, but I can't understand that you can be a fan of this.I thought that it was my duty to mankind to write this review about this absolute piece of garbage. The movie producers should never ever make a movie about this topic again. Please for the sake of the people who like to watch movies DON'T.To finalize, I'm a frequent moviegoer, so I have some material to compare it with. This was my second 1 I've given (other was Snowpiercer). Hopefully this review will withhold people to watch this movie and they won't spend 15 for this like me.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
354,lagunaleonhart1982-318-64960,A big disappointment,2,15 March 2017,"I rarely make a review of movies i have watched but i think i must do with this film. The story is a big screw up from the last movie. It doesn't even make any sense, in the last movie Wesker returned Alice's superhuman power to stop Red Queen's plan to wipe out humanity & in the final chapter Wesker ""betrayed"" Alice. Another confusing part of the story is that Weskeris the chairman of Umbrella in Resident Evil Extinction & Dr. Isaac is the head of the North American Umbrella facility under Wesker's command but in the movie Dr. Isaac owns 50% of umbrella corporation(Half is with Alicia) & Wesker is one of his pawn. AND another confusing part is why Wesker is such a weakling in this movie... in the previous films Wesker has superhuman powers comparable or even better than Alice but in the film he easily gets killed by Red Queen's ""automatic door"". I think the only worth watching RE film is only the first & second film, the rest is just...",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
355,emazanoni,Unwatchable,2,26 January 2017,"Aside the nonsense plot, the total lack of logic and the poor script that I could expect from a full action-based movie, there is this filming style where the camera flies, rebound, shakes, zoom in and out (so close that I can see the skin cells of alice and suddenly from 50 feets in the air) that makes the action scenes impossible to follow, and the actions scenes are like the 99% of the movie so the movie is unwatchable. The special effects seems good but it's hard to appreciate them because it's a dark movie and again, the constant movement of the cameras. The acting is not bad.If a movie director is reading this please consider stop making that thing with the cameras, the action can be exciting even with a fixed plane, if you don't believe me play the first 3 resident evil games ;)",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

359,robnijhof,The worst chapter in the installment with over-the-top editing and sound effects,3,31 March 2017,"This review will be short. I've seen all of the Resident Evil chapters and I liked them all. This final chapter raised quite some expectations for me after seeing the trailer. But after seeing it, I was nothing but disappointed. Not because of the story, not because of the acting, not because of the special EFX or the costumes but because of the editing and the over-the-top sound EFX and mixing. It is so poorly done, that in the end it completely ruined the movie experience for me. The sound effects are too loud, too much and too overly produced to a point where they don't feel natural anymore. Same with the editing; too much and too fast. A fight sequence is tiring to watch because of this. A final installment should be nothing like this. But unfortunately it is.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

However this movie gives you a nonstop action from the beginning of this movie.That's what I wanted from these movies though. Ending was great .Paul end it very well.But the camera editing and some CGI were not that great because you can't see a thing when Alice fights with someone or someone get killed by a zombie.The thing is people die very quickly.That's not good .If Paul made a longer script about 2 hours and 30 mins then it could be slower and we could many more actions. Violence was great and the characters were great with their dialogues and action too.Music is also nice .But I like Tommandandy because his music was awesome .So that's all.This was the end of her story and I appreciate it.Thank you for bringing this up.

363,RadioBat,Best ending any series could have. Must watch for Milla and the end.,9,6 February 2017,"Unlike other REs I felt that this one was very fast paced. We didn't get to see many locations and feels like the principal photography could have wrapped up within a month. We just get to see a little part of raccoon city and this time the Hive didn't feel enormous. Don't pay attention to bad reviews and don't change your plan of watching movie as this is the only chance you got to see it in theater. Watching in theater gives a different thrill. I did not like the action part much because at places Alice gets her butt kicked by normal humans too which I don't get because she has superpower's right? Milla's performance is very good. I felt that she should have been chosen for Wonder Woman's role. She got this blue eyes and that body and that look. The ending is good and the plot twist did justice to the series. I did not get one thing however, it says that Marcus developed the virus whereas in 2nd installment it says Ashford did.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

I've been a fan since I've been hooked since the beginning, but if we are talking cinematically speaking it was a tad bit uneasy. they really just wanted to say goodbye one last time. they gave it a high dose of CGI and quick cuts so fast you will drop your popcorn. I do have to say that the ending was quite spectacle, makes me want to play the video game series again. now i'm curious if they will go the VR route with the next film.. that is if they do decide to make another one. It's always awesome to see Alice kick some zombie butt, she always has this unique way of making it look so easy. If it does come down to the franchise ending then so be it, i'm happy with what I have gotten through the years.I would hope that they wait a few years to make another rendition of the Resident Evil film series.

366,frednotbob,"A slow, dreary and ultimately pointless film.",2,25 October 2019,"This film is a sad, predictable clunky and ultimately unsatisfying end to a series that (for the most part) I quite enjoyed.I've stuck with Alice since the beginning, when she woke up in the Umbrella mansion in the original 'Resident Evil'. I followed her through the streets of Raccoon City in the odd-but-enjoyable 'Apocalypse'. The third film, 'Extinction', was arguably the zenith of the series, with its enjoyable combination of 'Mad Max' action-adventure and Romero-like zombie chaos.And then the franchise slowly-but-surely lost the proverbial plot.After two more increasingly-nonsensical chapters of zombie action, filled with completely pointless set-pieces against increasingly outlandish undead monsters, and an inexplicable clones-and-brainwashing B-story that ultimately goes nowhere, Alice and company finally wheeze into the station for the 'Final Chapter' of their saga.Sadly, but not surprisingly, our zombie-smashing heroine's final adventure is a predictable,torpid, badly-scripted mess of a film.To start with, let's go for a summary:When we last left Alice, she was at the crumbled shell of the White House, apparently preparing to make a heroic last stand alongside the ragged remains of humanity. Outside, there are zombies charging the walls, zombies pulling helicopters from the sky, and zombies...well, milling about ineffectually as zombies are wont to do.'Extinction' flashes forward: predictably, the cease-fire Alice brokered with her nemesis, Albert Wesker, was nothing but a ruse, and he's left Alice for dead in the remains of Washington.And that is the last we will ever hear about Alice's famous 'last stand'. That's right, no flashbacks, no back-story, and her companions from the previous films have inexplicably vanished as if they never existed at all, without tying up any of their loose plot-threads -- in short, there's absolutely no explanation of anything that happened in D.C.Oh, and on her way out of DC, Alice fights a giant zombie-dragon-wasp thing, but that's just filler, because in all of five minutes time, she's blown the hell out of it without smudging her makeup.What happens next just hits all of the action-adventure cliche buttons: the Red Queen, Alice's anti-villain tormentor, pops up and tells Alice that she has 48 hours to reach the Hive, 400 miles west in Raccoon City, and stop the release of an airborne anti-virus that will kill anything infected with the T-virus.The first third of the film involves Alice (who is apparently a nearly-indestructible superwoman now, because 'plot') storming her way through a convoy of Umbrella Corporation trucks on the way to Raccoon City.The middle third is yet another round of Alice navigating the Hive's traps and miraculously escaping unharmed.The final third of the film is the predictable 'your party member is secretly a spy and will betray you at the first opportunity' cliche, complete with the tacked-on 'I knew it all along, so I gave you an empty gun' post-script.In the last act, we discover that Alice is a clone of Umbrella's majority shareholder, and has never had a real childhood. This comes totally out of left field, because Alice's childhood had never even been mentioned in the franchise prior to this point, but as Alice escapes and blows up the Hive, the Red Queen uploads Alicia Marcus' memories into Alice's brain in the perhaps the most deus-ex-machina-driven dénouement ever seen on film.And then Alice heads for Manhattan, because the cure will take years to circle the globe, and her job isn't done yet. I'm not kidding, that's actually the last line of the franchise.Oh, and the entire zombie-virus incident that started the apocalypse? Alicia 'shockingly' reveals that it was just the stock 'humanity sucks, so we're cleansing the Earth' trope that we've seen a thousand times before. Yawn.Between the cliche-driven character beats, completely pointless action sequences, and a plot that goes absolutely nowhere for three-quarters of the movie, Resident Evil: the Final Chapter is a painful, nonsensical disappointment.Take my advice, and stop with 'Extinction'. It's a much more satisfying ending for the series, and quite frankly, a much better film.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

368,Sanguine137,My review.,7,26 January 2017,"Right from the beginning the plot is explained to a certain degree and for once somewhat of an idea of whats happening is up for display. Wish they showed the battle in DC but didn't bother me much and obviously Alice on the road to Raccoon city brings up many crazy cool action scenes. Here the 'choppy' editing will start off, takes a while to grasp but soon comes together. The acting was on point and had no bland actors from Retribution, the ""young and popular"" actors and actresses did feel gimmicky at times but Ruby Rose and the doc guy do become quick favorites. The action never ends, never a dull moment, and it all feels very fast-paced and the action editing works in that favor. Time is passing and soon once in the hive, we get a couple cool scenes and a traitor arc is opened and surprisingly fooled me. The explanation of the umbrella corporation felt as if Paul just came up with but was good... The whole biblical theme was pretty well done, especially a line towards the end. Finally, Alice. Oh boy a plot twist awaits. I've spent many times over the years debating whether the Alice we've seen in afterlife and retribution were clones. All our answers are given here and to be honest, it was unexpected. I had anticipated a gag of a twist but it turned out alright. It was satisfying and the emotion brought in added a more humane feeling in the atmosphere (wish this was touched upon more often throughout the franchise.) Final Verdict: 8/10 : Taking a step away from my fan feelings, this movie is certainly not for everyone. Although it touched me and was entertaining, had witty dialogue and some pretty cool character arcs considering the EXTREMELY short time available. Pros: Satisfying twist, explanation and ending. Focus was on Alice. Action was out of this world! Finally a cohesive story. (somewhat) Cons: Gimmicky actors should have NOT replaced the original cast. (Jill, Michelle, etc) Felt as if a lot of character development was missing.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
369,lavalemons,An epic conclusion to an epic franchise,10,26 January 2017,"As a fan of both the Resident Evil games and the movie franchise I look at them both as completely different properties with only the name in similarity.These movies are fun and ridiculous and silly but so beyond enjoyable. They are a genre mix of horror, action, thriller and a whole lot more and that's what so good about them. The Final Chapter ties up all the loose ends and satisfies you with the answers you wanted. It has lots of twists, great action, plenty of jump scares and everything that made the movie franchise it is today. Alice returns as the bad ass she was when we left off with her in Retribution 5 years ago (2012) and Claire returns as Alice's undying friend and sidekick. Its a fun movie for a fun franchise and that's would you expect from it. Its not a cinematic masterpiece but it is a movie you can re watch on a Friday night and get a lot of enjoyment out of.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

Every minute, every dialogue is complete non-sense, none - not even one - half-good trail of thought of the previous films has been picked up and continued. Everything gets thrown over board and twisted, every scene with undeads is a f**** JOKE, they disappear in an instant at random, and reappear without any ounce of sense back in the next after yet another pointless exchange of words.

The story which has always been an afterthought in this franchise is full of so many plot holes and inconsistencies that it leaves you wondering if the director/writer Paul WS Anderson paid attention to any of the previous movies. The action scenes are virtually unwatchable thanks to the worst editing job that I have ever witnessed.Hopefully Resident Evil: The Final Chapter is the last chapter in this series, despite the sequel-bait and we can all move on to bigger and better things.

Events of the original movies are referenced but they are altered to match the new concepts. This is supposed to end the series but instead it's basically a standalone. And not a good one. The premise is idiotic. We're supposed to believe that a scientist is basing all his actions on the biblical tale of the great flood. An event that's been proven conclusively to have never happened. A scientist would know that. Alice isn't Alice anymore, in a plot twist so dumb, IQs are lowered just watching it. The final sequences take place in The Hive, which we all saw annihilated in the first movie. The action is overblown and tedious. The only good thing I can say about it is that the actors did a great job given what they had to work with. But that's not enough to save a terrible film.

It is so obvious that it was made up, just to add one more chapter, like people could actually remember the previous two (yes, this is the 5th). It's OK to make up some extension to a story, but it doesn't have to be that silly. What kind of cure can spread from a single vial to the entire world, just carried by air?? Hell, what kind of cure works in a fraction of a second killing the host?? I don't usually like to be picking on every scientific detail, but this is the main plot. Going back to Rakoon city just reminded me how much I liked the 1st two chapters, and how awful does this one compare to them. Christianity seems to have been dragged and forced into a couple of scenes somehow for no apparent reason, 'punish the infidels by outcasting', and hilariously taking a vote for whether to kill Alice or not, wow. I'm not Christian, but it felt like someone's forcing their personal beliefs on me in a disgusting way. There're a lot of other holes and contradictions in the story if you consider the previous chapters, but I don't have to go through them all.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
380,legends-25833,Horrible.,3,31 January 2017,"The final Resident Evil Movie. Let's be honest, the only reason we are still watching this is our stubbornness to see it through to the end, but nonetheless I expecting something a tiny bit worth watching.What am I given?Pure garbage. The CGI was really good along with the special effects, stunt co-ordination and close nit fight scenes. But it was hard to see with camera-work that was just damn terrible. It's like they gave up. Especially at the start, which was so rushed and pointless they had to throw in jump scares. The plot itself was horrible, expanding on the clone saga to try and screw with your mind, but if the character whose got the clone isn't developed enough, you can't really get into it. Then come the inconsistencies, such as why were Umbrella looking for a cure, and trying to rehabilitate these zombies, for no reason? What the hell is the point of being able to predict movements, if it only happens AFTER. And in one scene it seems they completely forgot where the placement of the zombies were compared to the main character in the next scene. That's only going on the small parts for a shorter review. All up, don't pay for this. I've seen porn with more consistency and a better plot. It's not even worth it for the action.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

Okay there are a couple of plot holes, but the film is set 5 years after the previous film in the franchise. So these can be forgiven. The action is intense. The gore is glorious and the storyline is gripping and shocking. This film is truly amazing. Don't pay attention to all the negative reviews people seem to have left in the movie's wake. The acting is great. The cast delivers a truly electrifying performance, especially Milla Jovovich and her Daughter, Ever Anderson. Ali Larter and Ruby Rose also deliver what are possibly their best performances I have ever seen.

This movie suffers from many horrible errors and has no redeeming qualities. The acting was so bad from all members of the cast ,old ones and new. Mila Jovovich is the only one who is not completely awful.The writing in this was dreadful. All diaologue was there for exposistion, because you couldn't understand what was happening with everything going so fast. That and some terrible one-liners. It did no justice to the other films, which were already below average and it also had a ton of plot holes.The action and the editing on this movie though, is the icing on the cake. The choreographies were bad , the CG was like a high school kid created it and it had the worst camera work I've seen in years. It was too shaky, it had more jumpcuts than a youtube video and the transistioning from one scene to another was so fast, you didn't know where you are.It was painful to watch. I don't understand why there are people who have rated this with more than one star. I hope WS Anderson doesn't work in a film...ever...again.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

I've played most of the games, and the HD-remake of the first is my absolute favorite. Now this movie comes along, and I just laugh. EVERYTHING happens so fast, every scene is a few seconds and the editing is like a tornado that just throws everything around the room. I have NEVER seen crappy, all over the place editing like this. You'll almost NEVER see what's actually going on in the scenes, because of the shaking, zooming, blurring and CONSTANT angle-changes. Also, the story is minuscule and barely holds up, there are NO connections to the previous movie's story and ending, and there are retcons taking place now. It's like Anderson and his ""crew"" got hella drunk one night, and wrote the script while chugging beers and filmed it all the next day. Worst movie of the franchise BY FAR, and the rest of'em aren't far behind.

So this final movie had good parts, and bad parts. The good part is that you get all the answers and the story finally ends, as the title says - the final chapter. The bad part is when the action happens, they filmed like 4-5 different camera angles per gesture, i don't get it , why they did this? Overall a nice movie, i give it an 8 because i'm a fan , but the movie doesn't deserve more than 7, it was badly directed.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

She can ruin a movie pretty fast and pretty furiously. I was excited when I learned about Alice's final chapter. For over a decade I've watched this movie franchise decline with each film but this movie was going to end the Umbrella Corp saga once and for all. It took me three attempts to get through the movie. Each time I was watching the progress bar thinking how is it possible this movie isn't done yet? It was like the director just figured out shaky cam film style a-la Jason Bourne, so any action scenes are overly shaky. And the CGI, my God CGI everywhere. There are zero practical effects. My guess is there wasn't even a traditional ""set"". Every single scene was probably done in front of a green screen and everything added in during post. I hope that someone doesn't regret how terrible this is and try to reboot the franchise in a few years. I don't want this to be like Michael Jordan's retirement. I hope this is truly the last chapter of this once decent franchise.﻿",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
387,asmellysmew,The movie sucked. Worst 8 bucks i ever spent.,1,28 February 2017,"I saw it in the theater the night it came out and it sucked really really hard, and this has to be the one film I've ever regretted paying money to see. The fight scenes are filled with nothing but jump cuts, so you can't tell what's going on until said fight is over. The story makes no sense from what they were going with from the fifth movie (In the last movie, RE: Retribution, the red queen's trying to kill Alice along with the rest of humanity. In this one, it turns out she's trying to SAVE humanity, which directly conflicts with retribution's story.) Seriously, Watch the other five movies first, preferably in one sitting, and then watch this one. You'll see exactly what I mean when I say it sucked.The new people didn't even matter. They had time to bring in like a few random new people, who die one by one as soon as they get into the hive. They had Chris Redfield, Leon, Ada, Claire, and Becky, they could have had these people survive (Oh yeah, it turns out they're all dead, except for Claire, apparently and to make matters worse, they don't even mention them except for a passing mention of Chris by Claire and Alice then it's not talked about ever again.) and help Alice in her mission, but instead we settle for a bunch of nobodies who got introduced in the middle of the movie and then died like 30 minutes later. These people didn't matter. Not even the one who turns out to be an umbrella informant. And this is AFTER they built up that the people from the last movie were going to play a significant role in the final chapter.They set up all this cool stuff in the 5th movie, that we could have seen at the beginning of TFC and instead they chose to hand wave it.Wesker barely did anything then he gets killed off in terrible way, which they stress that the red queen can't kill umbrella employees, despite the fact that she did in the first movie.Also they pretty much retconned the first two movies. Originally the red queen was modeled after Angela Ashford, and in this abomination, it turns out the red queen was modeled after James Marcus' (From the games) daughter, who turns out to be Alice's DNA template (shocker, Alice was a clone the whole time!). Which brings me to my next point. Also, they made it a huge plot point that the red queen can't kill umbrella employees, and yet in the first movie she slaughtered everyone in the hive except Matt and Alice.The ""Everyone is a damn clone"" nonsense. They went hard with this after extinction. Turns out the Dr. Isaacs we watched die in extinction, was just a clone and it seems that he's leading three tank things that are drawing zombies behind them, seems simple, right? Nope, turns out that guy is a clone too. The real Dr Isaac was underneath raccoon city the whole time.OH AND THE ENDING! God the ending sucked too! They made a big deal about how Alice would die if she released the antivirus, which is apparently airborne now, into the air and that this was the final chapter, but what happens? She tosses it to the ground and goes unconscious for a bit but survives. They wussed out on a perfect end to Alice's tale and cemented her as a true Mary sue character.Just...If you're reading this Paul Anderson, You should have worked way harder on this movie, because this movie is garbage. And I say that as a fan of the other 5 movies. There was no reason for this to be this terrible, I mean they even stopped showing it a week after it released in my town, that's how bad it was.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
388,rcschram,Glad that is finally over,2,25 September 2017,"Since the first film which held the popular video games name sake ""Resident Evil"" has unfortunately took turn for the worse. The RE franchise spanned over 5 films and the only consistency the films had managed to keep was keeping Mila Jovovich as the main character, that's about it. The films jumped around so much that they were not consistent and the story line suffered because of that. You would think that with the budget for the special effects and the popularity of the video game franchise you would have a win. But poor writing and directions left the film anti-climatic and slow. This film feels that it was rushed to be produced which gave it a choppy feel and poor transitions.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
389,DarkestFather-21342,Sucked beyond sucking,1,30 November 2017,"Aside from the siezure I got from watching every 10 seconds of this movie the story lines up with none of the previous five movies. First off what's the deal with the Red Queen not being able to kill Umbrella employees yet she can slaughter an entire facility in the first movie. Then there is Wesker, the guy who could get his brains blown out, two full clips of pistol ammo pumped into his chest and let's not forget he can dodge bullets but yet he dies by getting his foot cut off by a f***ing door! What kind of bs is that! Then there is Dr. Issacs, the head of the Umbrella Corp. yet no one throughout all 5 movies especially the third say anything about it. Not to mention the fact that the other 50% owner of the crop is Alice yet no one says anything about it in any movie. Last time I checked it's not necessarily a secret as to who runs a company especially if you constantly raid their facilities and hack into the computers. TBH at this rate I was done watching the movie it was that bad but to kill off every character except Claire and Alice and not even show how they died or even mention them was ridiculous. Then there's the bs story of how it was never planned for the clone of Alice to live that long yet in the fifth movie they could have either killed her or left her in that cell. Why the f**k did they help her escape then?!? This movie could have been from a different series with how poor of a job they did connecting this movie to all the rest. It's honestly like taking the last Harry Potter movie and making it about aliens with no hint of magic to it at all. DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!

The effects were incredible, you really felt you were in the movie. The plot was great, the actors too, and the movement of the chairs, the water falling on you, the wind, everything was perfectly coordinated and really effective. The entire room was so quiet; everybody was literally living the movie. When it finished, nobody was ready to get off those chairs. We were all amazed by what just happened. I don't want to tell you anything about the plot because I don't want to ruin it for you. All I can to say is that Mila plays great in this movie; the fight scenes (which are many) are very well done and pretty creative in the sense that it is not usual like just punching but not superhuman either. In one word they are astonishing. I've seen tonnes of action movies and several in 4DX, but this one was the best so far. Combining the two is a great idea. I enjoyed every single second of it.

The opening sequence of this movie recaps what happened thus far... And literally everything that happened in movie 2 is erased it changed like it never happened. All of it.

392,kevinharkness-54878,Paul W.S Anderson achieves a new low for the series somehow,1,11 June 2017,"I have avoided direct spoilers in this reviewWhere to begin with this review. I have seen every movie in this series and whilst every movie has been at best poor there have been certain hilarity aspects and some minor pros to the movies. ProsNow on to The Final Chapter, there is very little positives to take from this movie other than this franchise has thankfully come to an end. The film has no plot and just bundles from action scene to action scene, the last 20 minutes attempts to introduce some plot and twists but then negates and ignores any plot threads from previous movies. Milla Jovovich and Iain Glen give passable performances but everyone else is beyond poor with terrible writing given to the characters.ConsHow there is so many contradictions to previous movies considering Paul W.S Anderson has been involved throughout the whole series is beyond me. If you watched the end scene of the last movie this movie ignores everything that happened and changes everything, actually this movie changes aspects and plot threads from every movie in the series. The biggest con is the editing, WOW this film cannot do an action scene without cuts every second, it is so jarring to watch. It is also a terrible example of shaky cam ruining every scene it's in. They also clearly couldn't afford to bring back cast from previous movies except for Ali Larter so introduced loads of new characters in such a quick lazily written way. Combine all these elements together I had to wait till the next scene when a character died to find out who it was and didn't even care in the end which is a massive failure on the films part.An awful movie and worst in the series",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
393,takizakura-04810,Not so good.,1,23 December 2016,"The worst thing was the frame rate during action scenes (which was most of the movie) when the film becomes jerky as though the camera-work had been done by a few drunks with hand held cameras and then spliced together by software - it was impossible to make out what was happening - yes it's that bad. None of the characters were developed, except for the computer simulated girl, who gets best actor award. The story could have been written on the back of a stamp; she has forty hours to get the anti-virus and save the world, and the script is instantly forgettable. That's about it.

394,elijns,The best of the series,10,30 December 2016,"with the soft installment of the resident evil live action series, this one seems to take the cake, besides the last film being a little bit of a mess, this sixth instalment definitely compensates for its mistakes. Even though action sequences may have seemed a little obscure due to camera angles, it was still pretty impressive, seeing millia returnafter 5 years of delay is very pleasing to those internationally and some bit in the u.s the protagonists story was straight to the point and presented a compelling story to Alice's final battle with the cgi involved, it was great the new type of zombies being bought in the film definitely helps this film. It's exciting to see Paul w. Anderson pitch in on these monsters. I would be very glad to see a next inside of this film. I would never want to see a remake, maybe some side story movies can be made like the animated movies such as resident evil degeneration,damnation, and 2017's vendetta coming out.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

But the ending of Albert Wesker is something that i despise really bad.....the strongest person in R.E series end like that....what a joke..... The ending still makes us think is there will be another continuity of this series since she said "" the effect will still take many years to reach the far away country"" will Alice last word is a hint for our other survivor to come in next movie??since the hardcore fans of R.E series will do anything to see a stand off movie that only includes character like Chris, Ada, Leon and maybe some real Wesker to jump in...since i think Wesker in this movie were such a clone",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
398,powerspell,The Final Chapter ALMOST Satisfies (Rant),7,29 January 2017,"Let me start by saying that I am one of the biggest Resident Evil movie fans. I grew up watching them and I waited so eagerly to see The Final Chapter.Resident Evil: The Final Chapter is a nice conclusion for longtime RE movie fans. It ties the main story's loose ends, and it really gives you that feeling of nostalgia as they return to laser hallway... however, this was the only feeling of nostalgia you get through the entire movie, unfortunately.As you probably have heard by now, the editing is absolutely AWFUL. I wanted to like the movie so bad. I waited around 5 years to watch it, and although it satisfied me as the end, it didn't deliver what it had the potential to. The shots were all there, the story was mostly all there, and the acting was all there as well. Almost everything they needed to end the series with a proper sendoff was all there. BUT, the shaky cameras and poor editing completely demolished it all. I understand that people complained about Afterlife and Retribution having too much slow motion, but this... this is NOT the fix they needed. The action scenes were written and directed well, but the shaky cameras and the editing that cut the camera to a million different angles within 10 seconds was extremely aggravating and it made the scenes almost impossible to watch, and pretty much impossible to understand what was happening on the first watch. Everything you shouldn't do in editing was practiced in this film. I never thought I would be writing this review about my favorite movie series, but it was just so ""wrong"" that I had to speak up about it.My next point is how disappointed I am that they didn't bring back Jill, Chris, Ada, or Leon (he wasn't a great actor in Retribution anyway though). They could have AT LEAST made the intro of the movie into an explanation, flashback, glimpse, or summary of what happened at the white house battle since the end of Retribution. What happened to the other characters? Was Alice living underground the whole time? - Who knows? ... Wesker says in this film that he didn't really give Alice's powers back, yet at the end of Retribution it showed the T- Virus invading her body and her pupils dilating. There are plot holes in the story BIG TIME in this film.My last complaint is about the poor character development and overwhelming events timeline. The Final Chapter jumps from one event to the next, with little to no explanation or transition. It's a bit overwhelming. They didn't use their screen time wisely, and instead of developing the characters, they gave them a handful of lines (if even), and killed them off 5 minutes later. They hired all of these well-known actors to play in and promote the movie, only to give them ZERO character development, story purpose, relationship to the viewer or the other characters, and then they just gave them the dumbest deaths ever that go unnoticed. The only death that was actually semi- touching was Ruby Rose's character. Alice's relationship with Claire was almost non-existent. They didn't have the chemistry from Afterlife, and they didn't even talk about any of their lost time. I understand they're on a time constraint, but I mean... really!? Oh, let's not forget that Wesker died from a DOOR... a d-o-o-r. Like... oh my GOD. His purpose in the movie was almost unnecessary. Then he died from a door.Alice feels too ""reserved"" in this movie. The stunts weren't as dramatic or extensive as they always have been, and she doesn't even feel like she has a real purpose in this movie. I do like the more human approach they took with her this time though. I just wish the movie didn't feel like it's a nonstop, cluttered anxiety attack with no character developments and awful editing. It just feels like they didn't try as hard with this film. Even Retribution made more sense than this film did. At least it had dialog and you could SEE what was happening.I am so upset. Alice was my favorite character of any film series, and they barely did her justice. The whole movie just feels shallow and I really wish they would release a Director's Cut with new editing that gives the story a better vibe, similar to that of the previous films. It wouldn't fix the shaky cameras, but it would definitely allow the movie to make more sense, and especially easy to watch.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

P.S Resident Evil games Fan.,10,1 February 2017,"Note : Watched it twice in 2 days.I am a huge Resident Evil fan (games) and i went yesterday to the movies to watch Resident Evil : The Last Chapter. It did not just reach my high expectations, it went beyond them. First of all, to those who judge the plot that is not connected to the previous one, and that characters are missing with no explanation just PLAY the games and you will understand.   DO NOT FORGET that this movie franchise was made for the Resident Evil fans!!! Every Resident Evil game is connected with a main story but the game has its own independent story, and gives almost no explanation what happened to the previous ones. It has to be connected in a way to the games and what they did in the Last Chapter was the best effort to satisfy all the fans, and in my opinion he succeeded. Paul Anderson put EVERYTHING that the game franchise fans AND the movie fans would have wanted. Great story-line with twists, connected to the games as much possible, environments(sounds and visual) from the games, great fights to thrill you, a bid of horror (more than the previous ones), making it a movie that you CANNOT STOP WATCHING IT UNTIL ITS OVER AND MAKE YOU WATCH IT OVER AGAIN.

For what i hope for the final chapter are , they fulfill the best outcome in the future of the end of story. I really hope the old characters like Ada Wong , Leon , and other characters that I not listed that still alive from previous war series, come back in final chapter to join the act of the end zombies apocalypse at washington dc and go all out fight to death with dramatic action and of course include the cure of airborne antivirus moments. The producer of this film should add jet fight for the flying zombie mutant, and add more new characters for the zombies mutant and new guns like laser beam rockets handle by Alice or someone else. And for wesker he died in nonsense way just been said by the CEO original "" WESKER YOU FIRED "" wtf simple as that he lost his both legs by stomp with machine. I really want to type more of my ideas, what i had watched for this final movie of resident evil , there still have new movie in future because Alice still alive , and zombies still alive , at the ending part Alice said "" to cure the world to the edge it take years"" so there will have new chapter maybe this time we can guess the movie of the title for next series "" THE NEW BEGINNING "" or "" NEW CHAPTER "". Maybe this time Alice will meet that Ada Wong and Leon or what ever characters that still alive that not appear in final chapter. I hope for the next movie of resident evil IN THE FUTURE they add stuff like WITH FULL DANGEROUS ACTIONS AND NEW MUTANTS, DRAMATIC , HORROR, MORE BIG GUNS AND ROCKETS, Don't SHAKING THE CAMERA WHEN THEY FIGHT AND Don't TOO MUCH CUT ON FILM while they was fighting AND AWESOME EFFECTS. I want too see the BEST FIGHT FOR ZOMBIES AND HUMAN IN REAL WAY NOT IN NONSENSE WAY.. that's all. hope i can enjoy for the new chapter for next time.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

But, in the R.E : Final Chapter it is said that Dr. James Marcus, the original founder of the Umbrella Corporation and the creator also developer of the T-virus.2. R.E : Apocalypse --> the T-Virus was created in the beginning to cure the daughter of the T-Virus creator Angela Ashford from the sickness of unable to walk (like her dad). R.E : Final Chapter --> the T-Virus was created in the beginning to cure the daughter of the T-Virus creator Alicia Marcus from the sickness of premature aging (her dad is fine)3. R.E : Afterlife --> Albert Wesker has become a super monster human (Thanks to the T-Virus) and Alice couldn't kill her with any kind of method, even with a bomb (he is still alive and powerful in the end of R.E : Retribution. R.E : --> Albert Wesker is so weak. he is finished just by the steel door.4. Because of these ""weird story"", they decided to change the story. So they made Alice as the clone of Alicia Marcus, and that is why she called as Project Alice. But, in R.E : Apocalypse, Alice was called as Project Alice because she was put into an experiment project in the same time as Project Nemesis (Matt).The question is, Why do they have to change the story line in the end chapter ?

You may just create sound effect and voices and the movie will remain same. If in future you plan to create another movie then give us a chance to watch it rather than hear it. If a person ever played the game, then he will be too disappointed by watching this movie. Do not hide bad story-lines behind black screens. Let people watch a movie rather than hear it.A complete waste of money.To make things dramatic a few twists have been added and sound effect was not so bad. That is the only positive thing I can find in this movie.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
405,gregbouldin-65075,Thank God its the final chapter!,1,16 February 2017,"I cant begin to tell you how happy i am to finally see these train wreak of a film series to die out, i don't understand how any true resident evil fan could enjoy this it ruins the game series almost. Remember the scene in afterlife when chris and his sister see wesker and they get in that weird fight were wesker throws his shades at chris and catches them? that whole fight was stolen from resident evil 5 which i cant stand to play for that reason. i mean cant the Directors come up with their own fights besides copying scenes from the games? no cause thats how pathetic these movies are, that's also why everyone who plays in these movies are c rated actors or actresses. these movies in my eyes are up there with the saw movies simply put a dog that should have been put down a long time ago. they took the horror element out and turn them into special effects and action scenes. i mean what is this crap? seems like they took a chapter out of michael bays book on how to play it safe on filming. thank you for ruining resident evil.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
406,sapppppp,Whoever was responsible for the constant camera changes every 2 seconds in the action scenes ruined the movie,4,20 February 2017,not saying the Movie wasn't watchable but it gets to the point that you want to strangle the person responsible for changing the camera angle every 2 f**king seconds whenever a action scene takes place... it feels like I'm watching a f**king compilation of Trailers every time an action scene happens... like good lord 500 camera angle changes in a single action scene gets really f**king annoying....,Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

But it was an amazing movie left me in tears though that this was the last movie. I still have High hopes for another one. Because these movies are just to amazing to drop like that.

Highly RECOMMEND YOU to watch this movie.. i loved it,Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
409,zz_man,Resident Evil The Final Chapter Review (Spoilers Ahead),5,28 March 2017,"Spoilers Ahead! I have been a long time fan of both the Resident Evil games and movies. Both are enjoyable in separate ways and for different reasons. One thing I have always loved about the movies is Alice. She is a head strong female lead character who has taken charge of the film franchise for years. When The Final Chapter was announced I had hoped they would answer the long standing question who is Alice? Where are her memories? And while this movie did deliver on those questions, it did so in somewhat of a messy plot hole filled way.For one thing this movie completely ignores the already messy time line established by all the previous movies. There is no way 10 years have passed since the first outbreak, but apparently 10 years passed anyway. The previous film set up a climactic end to the franchise with Alice teaming up with Wesker and her remaining friends, getting her powers back and hopefully saving the day. Well if you came to this movie expecting all of that you will be sadly disappointed. While Alice (SPOILERS) does save the day in the end at the risk of losing her own life, she does so without the help of any of the characters from the previous movie. Leon, Ada, Jill Valentine and even Becky are killed off screen without even a mention from Alice or anyone else for that matter. It becomes clear at the start of the movie that Alice once again doesn't have her powers, even though she received them at the end of the previous movie (Although apparently it was a fake out.) Alice is the only survivor of what was meant to be the final stand for humanity, and she quickly teams up with the Red Queen (Who is now a good guy, though Alice does at first treat her like a villain so brownie points for not making the plot hole even bigger.) Alice heads off to Raccoon City and specifically the Hive to retrieve an air born anti-virus to stop the infection once and for all and kill everything infected by the T-Virus. She eventually gets captured and comes face to face with Dr Issacs (SPOILERS) (Though he still isn't the real one.) And she fights her way free and makes her way to Raccoon City, which unfortunately isn't as nostalgic as you would think it might be. She meets up with a new group of survivors, including Claire (Chris gets no mention either) and then eventually head off to the Hive (Again not as nostalgic as you would expect) They visit one place in the Hive that was from the original movie, a bunch of new locations, and really aren't in the Hive all that long. We meet (SPOILERS) The real Dr Issacs, who is basically a terminator. Wesker is reduced to a laughable character who gets killed in the stupidest of ways (After surviving a plane crash, his brains being blow out, and a massive explosion) And apparently he isn't and never was head of Umbrella, though Extinction and Afterlife would have you thinking otherwise. In the end Alice is revealed (SPOILERS) to be a clone of one of the heads of Umbrella, and she ""saves"" the world. Claire in my opinion was also reduced to a throw away character, not even helping Alice very much in the end, or being by her side to release the anti-virus, though she some how manages to escape before the Hive explodes even though it would seem otherwise.In the end if you are a fan of the movies, you will probably like this one if you can look past the many plot holes and the very shaky camera work ruining most of the action scenes.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
410,mtkearshot,15 minutes was enough for me,1,24 March 2017,"The worst edition that i've ever seen. Was the objective to make the people fall blind?. That screen flashing every second because of the camera's changing couldn't be worst.The film is practically impossible to watch, I know that the Resident Evil saga is not the best of all, but I expected something made with more professionalism.A child with basic knowledge in Windows can edit better using Windows Movie Maker.I'm incredibly disappointed.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
411,bradshields-05778,awesome,8,26 March 2017,"great film don't listen to anyone who slags it off, good story and it shows what has happened in previous movies so it is a follow on not a random flick. also I think there will be another film after this as the ending portrays that her work is not yet done :) I would recommend this film to all resident evil fans, it outgrew my expectations!",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
412,davidabarca-49291,Among the worst editing ever seen,1,24 August 2017,"Most of us don't really watch these movies for the story but because we've played the games and enjoyed most of them. It's well understood these don't fall into any Oscar categories. Yet it's damn painful so see the latest (and last?) movie so badly directed or edited.At first me and my partner though there was something wrong, maybe the movie was playing at 1.5-2 times faster the original speed but no! The movie was filmed from many angles, cut literally every 1 second into a new scene and it's so damn unwatchable. You cannot but get the feeling they had 6 hours of content and wanted to include all scenes and angles and gave them each 1 second.It's a shame because we do see that they have some good scenes and after all it's Resident Evil but the cutting between camera angles was so damn disturbing. I just wish we get a rerelease and with a DIFFERENT EDITOR or whoever did the cutting!",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
413,rustgame,Worthy completion(?) of a not very worthy franchise,5,28 April 2017,"It's worth starting with the fact that I treat the films ""Resident Evil"" extremely lightly. In my opinion, Paul Anderson is not able to make serious films. Thanks to him, we received the most mediocre films that bear the name of an excellent series of games. In his films, logic is regularly violated, and the number of plot holes can make's you crazy. In other words, these films can be called ""the patient fantasy of P. Anderson"".So, the last part of the movie series ""Resident Evil"" promised to be even more pathos and even more crazy. Was the film such? Obviously, yes. Well in order:1) Graphic - For the $ 40,000,000 is a deaf mediocrity. Pathetic and poor picture.2) Plot - The first 40 minutes of the plot was not. In general, everything is in Anderson's style, overloading with extremely stupid moments.3)Acting - forget It. Thats awfully. Yet the actors are already old4) Characters. Invincible Alice and some of unimportant characters. And what the hell, where have gone Leon and Jill?Eventually, despite all this the film finishes the franchise well. And the scenes of fights and shooting do not look so bad. Fans of the series will not go away distressed.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
414,aardogg,How can you not like this movie,9,30 April 2017,I thought this movie was good. Some of the scenes scared me to death. The action and this movie was intense. I like the character of Alice. She is a bada**. Milla Jovovich is a good actor and she is hot also. The only bad thing about the movie is the ending. Hopefully this is the end.,Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
415,uklaw_man,Disappointing Final Installment..,4,5 May 2017,"I felt cheated and let down by this mashup of a film... It promised so much and yet, delivered something masquerading as a sequel to Resident Evil: Retribution though I'm not sure what.Here is what I was expecting... The opening scene of Resident Evil: The Final Chapter begins with the final few minutes from the ending of RE: Retribution and then continues from there. Simple, logical and straight forward you would think.What I got was something completely different.Appalling editing made this film just a sequence of multi-angle, millisecond strobe images all tightly edited together one after another that made my eyes bleed while trying hard to enjoy the fast action scenes. Fun and excitement was hard to find in this film as it snaked and weaved furiously around while trying to cram in one action scene after another. I wasn't impressed or entertained.I'm trying very hard to find some redeeming features for this final sequel, right now there are two that comes to mind..1. The opening credits because I had so much great expectations for this film.2. The closing credits because I was thankful, nay, relieved the film had finished.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
416,amy-29746,Milla is amazing so don't be jealous,10,9 May 2017,"This is for all of you who write you're reviews about these movies. since it came out most fans have not been happy with the movie. i am sure it makes you feel better to make this movie look bad to people who are fans. Paul was Anderson a excellent director if you look up how he came up with the story he'll say that he references the video games too. Milla is a pretty good female actress i have seen all of her movies she knows how to play strong leading rolls, Resident Evil is one bad-ass movie plain and simple, if you can't handle the constant action it's not for you, there will be allot of motion and battles. this what makes these movie fun and just great story lines. i love it that's my opinion. this is for the guy who said the director has ADHD. Now don't you think that's a bit over the top? you just want to make this movie look bad. Grow up.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

421,www-86828,imo the best movie to come out of Hollywood since retribution,10,28 May 2017,"I feel like this movie is heavily under-appreciated. Its a non-stop action movie where a swarm of zombies seems small compared to what else is going on. Even when the characters stop to talk, the film shows their thoughts about how they're gonna kill the other person in the room. I'm curious about what people actually expected out of this, cause i feel like their expectations ruined for them what should have been a good experience. What you get is zombies, demonic looking monsters, corporate assassins, world wide conspiracy, futuristic sci-fi elements, and the people trying to put a stop to it. Everything is fast paced, if you look away for a second you will miss something, but this adds to the re-watch value and makes the movie more action packed, get a timer and see how many things happen just within the first twenty minutes of the movie. Its incredible.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter

424,jasminebianca,What was that!?!?!,2,17 October 2017,"I was foolish enough to get that digital purchase the very day it was made available in September 2016. What a silly, silly girl! I won't get into the camera work or the crazy editing. My main problem with the movie was that it was a great big F... You to the previous installments.What happened to the crew gathered up at the end of Retribution? Did Luther West really die for nothing? I really liked him... So, how did the T-virus get going? And what was Spence's role? So, was the first movie like a weird flashback? And that would make Apocalypse a flashback, too? And why go through all the previous movies just to throw it all out the window? And how come no one else involved with the movie bothered to mention that this final chapter had absolutely nothing to do with the story we have been watching for the last 15 years? Now, I admit that there was some disconnect with a linear plot after Apocalypse. But I was at least entertained. It took me 3 or 4 times to actually get through Final Chapter, and I guess it had to do with that camera stuff people keep talking about on here. I just could not sit through it.Plus, it has no intelligible plot. Alice has to go back to the Hive--which had an atomic weapon deployed on it in Apocalypse--and retrieve the one remaining anti-virus--which happens to be in the possession of Isaacs. And what has he been doing for the last decade? No one really explains. Also, how and when did all those people get underneath the hive in their little cryogenic tubes? And how did they escape the original Red Queen? She seems omniscient, yet failed to detect hundreds--thousands?--of frozen people right under her chamber? And why did I have to rewind several times to figure out when characters were dying off--such as when they were running from the Cerberus dogs,and once they entered the hive? People just disappeared. Ridiculous. It was as if all the indoor scenes were shot with as little light as humanly possible.By the time I finally got to the end of the movie, I realized a couple things about myself. First, I could not talk myself, or watch myself, into liking this movie. I did it with Extinction, but no dice with this mess. And finally, I learned that I will never ever pay to see another movie before I read lots and lots of reviews. I could have saved myself $14.99 and 98 minutes of my life.Final recommendation: Just wait for it to go on stream for free or check it out at the library. Not worth the rental.",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
425,Tiffany-Dimmick,Resident Evil: The Final Chapter is the last movie in the Resident Evil series. It's about Alice determined to end the Umbrella Inc headquarters once and for all.,4,31 October 2017,"The first three movies in the Resident Evil series were done pretty well in my opinion. There was a story line and realistic people in claustrophobic survival situations. Then the next few came out - and it reverted to a ton of action, terrible plots, and boring characters (too weak or too strong - never quite believable). I was hopeful for this last movie in the Resident Evil series because it had good ratings, and I wanted to see how it all ended. Alice back in the hive sounded like potential.Of course the graphics were great, but it was way way way way too fast paced. I felt like I was watching a strobe light of scenes. Each cut literally flashed before my eyes in little sequences of intense action. I felt sick and dizzy.There were incredible action moments - but too much. Even if it's the final movie and it's really about Alice vs. Head Villain, I think less action and more character development would have been successful. I could care less about the characters here - some died - oh well - there wasn't enough build up to feel emotion.Some things I liked were the suspense of thinking someone was a ""rat"" in the group and trying to figure out who (if anyone). Then of course I'm a plot twist kind of gal - so the ending was pretty awesome - which is the only reason I bumped it to a 4 star.I'm very glad the series is over with now. I loved the original Resident Evil video games and the first three movies in the series had great potential, but then it started to get too much action-packed just like the subsequent video games after 3. That's when I stop caring about the plot and characters.Overall, I think you should see it - because every movie deserves a chance - and we are all so different in our opinions, interests, and enjoyment levels. :)",Resident Evil - The Final Chapter
